He was married to Beatrix FitzWalter, who was the daughter of Theobald FitzWalter. He is known for being the first Lord of Loughmoe. == Ancestry == === Patriarchal === Sir Hugh Purcell of Loughmoe's ancestors, most probably patriarchal, derive from another Sir Hugh Purcell. Hugh Purcell was a knight, who, as John O'hart notes, and as the family believed, participated in William the Conqueror's Norman invasion of England in 1066. He was credited with being the first Norman to sail the English channel and reach Pevensy bay, supposedly the first Norman to prove himself worthy by storming the ruins of an old Roman castle, of which a group of Harold Godwinson's soldiers was holding, and the first to be formally recognized by William, after his success, and be allotted land by the new king. The elder Hugh Purcell had two sons, by the name of Dyno and Oyno or Oyn. Dyno was the keeper of the bedchamber to the king, which perhaps signals strong friendship or alliances between the Purcell and the Royal family. Oyno, although his brother had a considerably important position, inherited his father's legacy, and was awarded a Manor in Cattleshell, Surry, by King Henry I. These events unfolded at around 1120, with no specific date found. Oyno married the daughter of Nigel de Broc, of who was fairly known at the time. His son's name varies from the following (because although he refereed to be known by his mother's prestigious name, it was still more common for people to have their father's): Ralph de Broc, Ralph Purcell, Randulf de Broc and Randulf Purcell. He was unfortunately drawn in to the famous assassination of the Bishop Thomas Becket, who, after the king said, \\"Will nobody rid me of this turbulent priest?\\" was murdered on Holy ground by knights. Randulf had one of his estates, Saltwood by name, confiscated by the king because the knights received hospitality in his castle before the murder. Randulf's nephew had the name of Robert Purcell, who was a administrator of justice, often mentioned in the public records. One of Robert's sons, also Hugh Purcell, participated in the Norman invasion of Ireland, in 1171, where he may have been killed. O'hart claims that this Hugh Purcell was the unnamed knight mentioned by Giraldus Cambrensis, who states, \\"on the morrow, seeking to cross the river in one of the native boats to hold parley with the King, the boatmen rose upon him in the middle of the stream, stabbed him with their long skeans and the threw the body into the river.\\" This Hugh Purcell's sons were Walter Purcell and Hugh Purcell of Loughmoe. === Matriarchal === Sir Hugh Purcell's matriarchal ancestors have noble blood, however illegitimate. To support this claim, Hugh Purcell's (of Loughmoe) tomb had a statue of a man in armour, or so our 17th century sources tell us, with a shield on his left arm. Painted across this are three lions - of course, the symbol of Richard the Lionheart or Richard I.The tomb of Hugh Purcell This gives the claim that his mother was an illegitimate daughter of Richard the Lionheart more support. Since, in this section of the article, we are tracing back the matriarchal ancestors of Hugh, we will stay on Richard's line of matriarchal ancestry. It goes as the following. Dangereuse de L' Isle Bouchard was the earliest known matriarchal ancestor of Richard, who spanned from 1079 - 1151. Her daughter was A√©nor de Ch√¢tellerault, who lives a relatively short life: 1103 - 1130. Her daughter was Eleanor of Aquitaine, who was arguably one of the most prominent women of her time, for she was the queen consort of France. Eleanor's son was Richard the Lionheart, and the rest of the ancestry to Hugh has already been covered. Richard participated in the third crusade, scoring considerable victories (following the departure of Phillip Augustus) against the famous Muslin commander Saladin. He is one of the only kings of England remembered by his epithet, not his number, and remains a prominent and influential icon in medieval history. He was mortally wounded and killed by a stray arrow while besieging Ch√¢lus in France.Loughmoe castle, as seen from the South-West. The closest tower is the one of which was constructed by Hugh. == Marriage to Beatrix FitzWalter == Hugh Purcell married the daughter of Theobald FitzWalter, Beatrix FitzWalter. As part of the marriage, Hugh received a dowry from Theobald, consisting of a town by the name of Loughmoe in Tipperary. Here, Hugh constructed a castle, Loughmoe castle. Beatrix had a previous husband; Thomas de Hereford or Thomas de Hungerford. According to O'hart, Beatrix was only a child when Thomas died, \\"thus the heiress to a splendid inheritance\\". Theobald was the cup bearer to King Henry II. == Loughmoe castle under Hugh Purcell == Further information: Loughmoe castle Hugh only built one of the towers. Hugh's contribution to the castle was well-constructed and built in a defensive style. As can be seen in the image, the two later additions have sharp corners and wide windows, while the prior tower has rounded corners, making it less vulnerable to cannon and artillery fire. The passage in \\"An history of the life of James, Duke of Ormonde\\" describing the Purcell/Botiller land dispute == Cause of the later Purcell/Botiller dispute of land == Beatrix had lands given to her by her previous husband Thomas de Hereford, but Hugh Purcell kept much of the lands as Thomas de Hereford died without issue. Therefore, there was a large dispute over it later by Hugh's grandson and Thomas le Botiller, the grandson of Theobald FitzWalter, who claimed it to be his. Purcell pleaded that Botiller's grandfather had been given to Hugh, and recited the totidem verbis: \\"In so many words; in these few words.\\" Of which was denied by Botiller, who claimed the land. == Mentions of Hugh Purcell in Church records == Hugh Purcell has multiple mentions in the Register of the Abbey of Saint Thomas, Dublin. In CLXXVII of Register of the Abbey of Saint Thomas, Dublin, Hugh Purcell gave a Grant to the Church. The original Medieval Latin version goes like this, \\"Universis Christi fidelibus presentes litteras inspecturis Hugo Purcel salutem: Noverit universitas vestra me, divine pietatis intuitu, pro salute anime mee, patris mei, et matris mee, et Beatricis, sponse me, et liberorum meorum, consisse et quietum clamasse, Deo et ecclessia de Kildroch. Et ut mea quitea clamacio firmitatem obtineat, sigillum Thome Purcel, commilitonis mei, presenti scripto, quia proprium sigillum meum in partibu Dublinie non habui curam apponere. Hiis testibus: Waltero Purcel, patre meo; Thoma Purcel; Milone de Rocheford; Ricardo de Midia, clerico.\\" The English translation of this is, \\"All trustworthy Christians salute and examine the present grant of Hugh Purcell: Know that I, divine piety, for the salvation of my soul, my father, my mother, and Beatrix my fiance, and my book, concise and tranquil, God and the Church of Kildroch. And in order to prevent a discharge of my stability, the present script is sealed by Thomas Purcell, my comrade, and my own seal and parts of Dublin did not have to take the trouble. The witness: Walter Purcell, my father; Thomas Purcell; Milon of Rocheford, Richard of Midia, clerk.\\" == Hugh's heir == Richard Purcell, Hugh's heir, was the first Baron of Loughmoe. He was either Hugh's son or grandson, as we do not know what \\"direct descendant\\" refers to. == Sources and further reading == * Giraldus Cambrensis, The history and topography of Ireland * John D'alton, King James' Irish army list * John Gillingham, Richard I * John O'hart, The Irish and Anglo-Irish landed gentry * John O'hart, Irish pedigrees == References == ","title":"Hugh Purcell of Loughmoe"},{"id":"63844891","text":"Lee Jae-gap (; also known as Lee Jae-kap; born 27 March 1958) is a South Korean politician currently serving as the Minister of Employment and Labor since his appointment by President Moon Jae-in in September 2019.

They speak the endangered Laiunghtor language. There are diaspora communities in the Indian states of Assam and Meghalaya. Most people living in Sylhet are even unaware of the existence of this minority community, although their presence dates back centuries, as they choose to stay hidden in the deep forests. ==Etymology== The endonym of the community is Laleng, which means \\"stone\\" in their native language and they also use the terms Lalong and Lalung. They are known by a number of exonyms in the Bengali language such as Patra (), Pathor (), Pator () and Fattor (). It is said that their ancestors were stone-collectors and coal merchants; hence the name. ==History== They are said to have descended from the Bodo-Kachari peoples. In ancient times, they migrated from Southwest China to Kamarupa. They claim to be descendants of Gour Govinda, the last Hindu king of the Gour Kingdom in Sylhet. After the Islamic Conquest of Sylhet in 1303, the royal family of Gour Govinda as well as the wealthier Lalengs were known to have fled the Sylhet region. It is said that the a section of the community abandoned the town, moving to the nearby deep forests of Sylhet where they remain today as Lalengs. In the mid-19th century, the British Raj founded the tea industry in the Sylhet region. Tea gardens were established, displacing Bengali-Sylhetis, and therefore led to the migration of Bengalis to the Laleng villages. The Laleng were poor and illiterate, and migrations of Laleng communities to Assam and Meghalaya are recorded to have taken place following Partition of India in 1947 and even more following the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. The Government of Bangladesh legally purchased land from the Lalengs to establish the Jalalabad Cantonment and Osmani International Airport. The Lalengs could have used the money they earned from selling that land to buy land elsewhere, however they wasted the money for their idleness. ==Population and location== The Laleng can be found in the forests of Sylhet Sadar, Jaintiapur, Gowainghat and Moulvibazar, in a total of 23 villages and 402 families. They can be found in the Kalagul forest of Sylhet Sadar in villages such as Alaibohor, Dadarani, Khushal, Makorkhula and Paikpara. Other villages include Fotehpur, Malgaon, Chiknagul, Goandaeer, Kushergual, Foring Ura, Doloipora, Lougul, Noeergul, Pathantola, Borogul, Kalishori, Poschimchuti, Kulauti, Khandar Dighi, Barar Hat, Ramnogor, Rajar Bagicha, Kohibohor, Bhobier Gul and Maqampunji. They also reside in the nearby Khadim Nagar National Park where they are being advised to switch from using charcoal to more sustainable sources. Their total population in the country is 3,365. The Indian diaspora community can be found in Cachar, Dawki and Patharkandi. ==Culture and language== They are divided into 17 clans (roi); Aloi Roi, Baroi Roi, Chamang Roi, Chondra Roi, Chundi Roi, Gab Roi, Golla Roi, Kalang Roi, Khakla Roi, Langthu Roi, Longkhi Roi, Pon Baboi Roi, Thakla Roi, Tipra Roi, Tongra Roi, Tonraba Roi and Tukri Roi. They don't marry within their own clans and have seven ways of marriage, including Sitkoi (forced marriage). The chief of a clan is known as Lar and the other elders were known as Montany. The chief of a village was known as Samuta. These titles and occupations were hereditary and only men could be elders and chiefs. The Lar, Montany and Samuta were all members of a Laleng council known as barguite, which met once or twice a year. This tradition has become inactive as more members of the population drifted to Hinduism. The new tradition abolishes the use of montany (elders) as a term, and samuta (village chief) as a post. The lar (clan chief) remains and is aided by elders now known as murobbi (a borrowed term from the Bengali language). All of these posts are now elected and no longer hereditary unlike the traditional system. They are predominantly followers of Hinduism, though there are many elements of tribal animistic beliefs and customs which differentiate them from the Hinduism practised by Bengali Hindus. Their denomination is known as Brahmadharma. They worship Kali, Lakshmi, Pailungiong and Saraswati, but do not keep idols in their home. Many of the Laleng living in Moulvibazar have been forcefully converted to Christianity by the missionaries, as with other tribal minorities. They celebrate Puin and Dol Purnima, as well as Akung Laram, Madhai Thakur, Poinunu, Taishi Takki, Thibum, Tilsongkranti and Baghai Seba (Tiger service) ceremony. They perform the latter hoping that tigers do not harm them (as they live in the forest). Their celebrations take place in a place known as a Shebakola. They are a poor community. The vast majority are illiterate, with only three or four literate people in their villages. The Government of Bangladesh as well as some NGOs are attempting to fix this situation. They are self-dependent, though a few have started working as private drivers and day labourers. They speak the endangered Laleng Thar or Laiunghtor which is facing extinction as it has no writing system. ==References== Category:Sino-Tibetan-speaking people Category:Ethnic groups in Bangladesh Category:People from Sylhet Division ","title":"Laleng"},{"id":"63844907","text":"Slavko Rodiƒá (; Sredice near Kljuƒç, 7 July 1914 - Belgrade, 29 April 1949), was a Yugoslav partisan, general of Yugoslav People's Army and People's Hero of Yugoslavia.

The book examined the work of eight Nigerian women writers, namely Zaynab Alkali, Simi Bedford, Buchi Emecheta, Funmilayo Fakunle, Flora Nwapa, Eno Obong, Ifeoma Okoye, and Adaora Lily Ulasi. Ogunyemi set out a new theory of Nigerian literature based on their works.

He was the 1st Minister for Labour and Social Affairs during the trusteeship period and also for the newly independent country of the Somali Republic. Ali Jimale's long political career started in 1946 when he became member of the Somali Youth Club, the precursor of the Somali Youth League (SYL), Beledweyne branch. From 1946 to 1955 he served, several times, as Secretary of the local branch of the party in Beledweyne ==Biography== Sheikh Ali Jimale, the only child of Jimale Barale and Ghedia Roble was born in 1905 in the village of Omaad, near Matabaan. He hails from the Hawadle, Cabdalle Madaxweyne. The son of a village herdsman, he moved to Mogadiscio where he attended Quran School before enrolling in the government run schools. In 1934 he joined the colonial troops, known as ‚ÄúDubat‚Äù. He took part in the Italo-Abyssinian war, and within two years he reached the rank of ‚ÄúCapo Banda‚Äù, the highest military rank a native soldier in the ‚ÄúDubat‚Äù contingent could reach. In 1938, at his request, he left the Italian military forces to serve in the Civil Affair Department of the Italian colonial administration. He was first based in Wardheer, and later transferred to Kebri Dahar as senior interpreter. Following the British Military Administration (Somali), he established his own commercial business in Beledweyne. From January 1953 to March 1956 he represented Hiiraan at the Territorial Council (Consiglio Teritoriale), a consultative Council advising the trusteeship Administration on domestic policy In March 1956, following the first political elections in Somalia, he was elected Member of Parliament for the electoral district of Beledweyne District From May 1956 to July 1959 he served as Minister of Social Affairs (Ministro per gli Affari Sociali); From July 1959 to August 13, 1960, he served as Minister of Health, Labour and Veterinary Service. From August 13, 1960 to November 30, 1961 he served again as Minister of Health, Labour and Veterinary Services. On November 30, 1961, Sheikh Ali Jimale was relieved of his duties following long standing feud with the Prime Minister, Abdirashid Shermarke. Jimale's removal sparked off a widespread protest in the Hiran Region, particularly in his political stronghold of Belet Uen, where people clamoured against their Minister's dismissal. Messages of solidarity came particularly from paramount chiefs, notables and religious leaders, as well as from SYL branches in Beledweyne and Bulo Burte ; these messages accused the Prime Minister of allegedly practicing tribalism. The dismissal of the Minister raised also security concerns to the point that the Minister of the Interior of the time, Abdirizak Haji Hussein, paid an unannounced visit to Beledweyne. The Minister took a tough line, warning the public in Bulo Burte and Beledweyne that the government would take grave measures against those who, in solidarity with Sheikh Ali Jimale, may stir up trouble in the region. Sheikh Ali Jimale was known for his active participation in the debates taken place in the Parliament, irrespective of whether he was member of the ruling party or in the opposition ranks. He never lost touch with his roots and electoral base. A shrewd politician with powerful oratory, well capable of captivating his audience, Jimale saw his popularity sky-rocket when campaigning against the referendum on the Constitution in 1961, the ‚Äòno‚Äô vote outnumbering the ‚Äòyes‚Äô in Hiiraan region. In 1962, Sheikh Ali Jimale, together with a number of other long time SYl associates, quit the party to establish a new opposition party they called Somali National Congress (SNC) The new party won 22 seats in the 1964 general elections.

It is loosely based on the Edgar Allan Poe short story The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether. The film is the directorial debut of Juan L√≥pez Moctezuma, who went on to make Mary, Mary, Bloody Mary (1975) and Alucarda (1977), among others. Surrealist artist Leonora Carrington supervised sets and costumes with one of her sons, Gabriel Weisz. The repeated appearance of a white horse, Carrington‚Äôs alter ego, and the elaborate surreal feasts and costumes has been credited as demonstrating the artist‚Äôs vision and several of her recurring motifs. The film was a Mexican production and was shot in Mexico, using a mostly Mexican cast and crew. It was filmed in English and then dubbed into Spanish for Mexican cinemas. ==Plot== The film is set in France in the 19th century. Gaston LeBlanc visits Dr. Maillard in his spacious sanatorium to witness his revolutionary treatments. He is introduced to the doctor‚Äôs lovely niece Eug√©nie, and is taken on a tour.

The dale is cut into the plateau of Gratton Moor and Smerrill Moor and lies to the north of the hamlet of Pikehall, which is the venue of the annual Y Not Festival. Midway down the valley it turns sharply left and is known as Gratton Dale. Most of the valley is dry but Rowlow Brook flows down the lower part of Gratton Dale towards Dale End and onwards to become the River Bradford at Youlgreave. Long Dale is part of the Derbyshire Dales National Nature Reserve. Natural England manages the reserve which covers five separate dales of the White Peak (Lathkill Dale, Cressbrook Dale, Hay Dale, Long Dale and Monk's Dale). The reserve contains ash and elm woodland and shrubs including hawthorn and elder. Abundant flowers include mountain pansy. On the spoil heaps of the old lead mines there are rare flowers such as spring sandwort (Minuartia verna) and alpine pennycress (Thlaspi alpestre). Native grasses include meadow oat and carnation sedge interspersed with heather, bilberry and dwarf gorse. Long Dale & Gratton Dale is also a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Overlooking Long Dale, the Smerrill Moor, Smerrill Barn and Long Dale bowl barrows are protected Scheduled Monuments. These Bronze Age burial mounds are about 10m across. They were excavated by Thomas Bateman in 1857 and he found numerous human skeletons, flint tools and a decorated Beaker pottery drinking vessel. On the east side of Gratton Dale are the remains of old lead mines (Rath Rake, Cowlica Rake, Dunnington, Hardbeat, Hardwork and Gatcliffe) which are a Scheduled Monument. Evidence of ancient surface lead mining comes from Roman brooches that were found in Victorian times at Cowlica Rake and Hardbeat mine. Records of intensive lead mining since the 1640s include disputed claims of mining rights. The remains include mine shafts, building ruins and earthworks. Just south of the head of Gratton Dale are the remains of Mouldridge Grange, which was a medieval farmstead run by monks from the Augustinian priory. The remaining earthworks of buildings and enclosures are a Scheduled Monument. There is a clear bridlepath along the length of the valley floor. The Pennine Bridleway runs parallel to Long Dale, about 1 km to the west. Long Dale is on the route of the long Limey Way, which links up 20 Debyshire dales. == References == Category:Valleys of the Peak District Category:Valleys of Derbyshire Category:Peak District Category:Derbyshire Dales Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Derbyshire ","title":"Long Dale"},{"id":"63845132","text":"Isaac William Marsh (1 February 1877 ‚Äì 1949) was an English footballer who played in the Football League for Doncaster Rovers, Gainsborough Trinity and Notts County.

His praenomen is not actually known, but has been assumed to be Lucius, since that was his fathers name, and first sons were generally given their fathers praenomen in Rome. He and Agrippa likely spent their childhood playing with each other until Lucius was old enough to go to school. Since Lucius became a soldier his education likely took him away from home rather young. He also had a sister named Vipsania Polla, it's not known if she was younger or older than him. ===Career=== During Caesar's Civil War Lucius sided with the Pompeians and fought for Cato the Younger in Africa where he was taken prisoner by Julius Caesar in Numidia after defeat in battle. It is likely that he had actually been captured before and pardoned already. Caesar had a habit of showing clemency to everyone the first time but made sure to punish repeat offenders and as such was likely to have him executed. Despite this he was treated with much respect. Agrippa was 17 years old at the time and was already studying with Caesar's nephew Octavian (later known as Augustus). Fearing for his brothers life, Agrippa asked his friend to speak to his uncle and beg him to show mercy for Lucius. This was the first time Octavian had asked his uncle for a favour and the wish was granted. This bound Agrippa forever to his benefactor and earned Octavian a reputation for loyalty. When returning home to Rome Lucius would have been expected to make a curtesy call to Cato's closest relatives there, his sister Servilia and wife Marcia. ===Later life=== Lucius appears to have been alive later on in his brothers career as he was involved in some type of affair which his brother refused to influence with his authority when a consul asked for his opinion on the matter. ==Cultural depictions== In I Loved Tiberius by Elisabeth Dored Lucius salvation at the hands of Octavian is mentioned as a reason for Agrippa's undying loyalty to the emperor. The same is done in Cleopatra's Daughter by Michelle Moran.

In the ensuing searches, sheriffs from the Aiken County Police Department reported that a girl matching Dingess' descriptions was seen on two occasions, accompanied by an older white male with dark hair. In the first instance, she entered a tan, older-model vehicle and in the second, a bright red four-door one. On October 13, 2000, her skeletal remains were found in the woods off the I-20 near Harlem, seven miles east of the Savannah River, after Rivera gave police directions to the burial site. On December 4th, 17-year-old Tiffaney Shereese Wilson, from Jackson, went missing while she and her two-month-old daughter Kaitlyn were visiting a Winn-Dixie restaurant in North Augusta. Her car was found at the parking lot, with witnesses seeing her enter a mid-1980s white four-door Ford, which had stopped briefly and sped off just as quickly. Three days later, Kaitlyn was found abandoned in her carrier in front of a Georgia welcome center across the state border. Suspecting an abduction, the authorities searched areas along the I-20 and Highway 25, finding clothing that was suspect to be Wilson's. On December 30th, two hunters discovered the body of a young female in a heavily wooded area near Graniteville. The decedent was later positively identified as Wilson via her fingerprints. According to the coroners, she had had her hands tied behind her back, raped and subsequently dealt a deadly stab in the back, all while her daughter was inside the car. On June 19, 2000, 18-year-old Tabitha Leigh Bosdell, of Augusta, Georgia disappeared in similar circumstances to the previous victims. According to her family members, they dropped her off at a Huddle House, where she was going to apply for a second part-time job, before going to her main job as a telemarketer. Rivera wasn't charged with her murder until October 16th, when skeletal remains were positively identified as hers. The final murder was that of 21-year-old Marnie Marie Glista, a soldier at Fort Gordon. She was attacked in her own home on September 5th, sustaining heavy injuries, but barely surviving. She was transported to a local hospital, where she died from said injuries five days later. ==Arrest, trial and imprisonment== On October 10, 2000, Rivera approached 18-year-old Chrisilee Barton at the parking lot of a Huddle House restaurant in North Augusta, presenting himself as the owner of an escort service and a modeling agent, expressing interest in taking photos of the young lady. Barton agreed, inviting him back to her home, whereupon Reinaldo raped and stabbed her three times in the throat with a plastic-handled steak knife he took from the kitchen. Barton survived the assault, and with her help, investigators were eventually led to Rivera, who was hiding in a South Carolina motel. Upon discovery, he attempted to commit suicide by slashing his wrists, but was prevented by the arresting officers and sent to the Medical College of Georgia, where he was kept under suicide watch in an isolated cell. Charged with the murders of Wilson, Bosdell and Glista and the attempted murder of Barton, Rivera was eventually convicted solely for Glista's murder and assaulting Barton. At the end of his trial, Reinaldo was quoted as saying to the jurors that he was mentally ill, and that doctors should study his ailment to possibly find a cure for it. In addition, he said that he still fantasized about his killing his victims, warning that he'd do it again if release, and asked for the death penalty. In the end, he was sentenced to death for killing Glista, and to this day remains on Georgia's death row at the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification State Prison in Jackson. ==References== Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:20th- century American criminals Category:20th-century Spanish criminals Category:Male serial killers Category:American serial killers Category:American people convicted of murder Category:American people convicted of rape Category:American people convicted of attempted murder Category:American prisoners sentenced to death Category:People convicted of murder by Georgia (U.S. state) Category:People convicted of murder by South Carolina Category:Prisoners sentenced to death by Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Prisoners and detainees of Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Spanish emigrants to the United States Category:People from Madrid ","title":"Reinaldo Rivera"},{"id":"63845230","text":"The Choito-Tamir inscriptions (also called Hoyt Tamir texts or Taihar Rock writings) are inscriptions erected during Uyghur Khaganate period.

Her and an infant Barbara starred on the cover of Country Life magazine in July 1907. In 1929 Stanley's husband was made governor of Madras in the British Raj. Stanley's body of watercolour work was created during her residency in India, in Ootacamund. She studied the plants and gardening practises in the local climate with local fauna, as well as British plants which had been imported. The family returned to the UK in 1934 after the end of British governance in India.

It was completed in 1785 and was replaced by Pontefract Town Hall which was completed in 1882. It was designated a Grade II* listed building in 1950. ==History== The first building on the site was a saxon moot hall which was destroyed during the English Civil War; this was replaced by a later building in 1656 which was demolished to make way for the current structure. The current structure, now known as the \\"old town hall\\", was designed by Bernard Hartley of Pontefract in the Classical style as a municipal building with market room and gaol on the ground floor and assembly room (now known as the \\"Nelson Room\\") on the first floor; it was completed in 1785. In 1855, Benjamin Oliveira MP, attended the town hall to donate the original plaster cast relief (i.e. the mold) from which the final bronze relief of \\"The Death of Nelson at Trafalgar\\" found on the pedestal of Nelson's Column had been made in 1849. The secret ballot was first used in the United Kingdom, and the result announced at the town hall, on 15 August 1872 to re- elect Hugh Childers as MP for Pontefract in a ministerial by-election following his appointment as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. The assembly rooms were built to the east of the old town hall in 1882. The old Town Hall remained the meeting place of the civic leaders and magistrates until they moved into the assembly rooms in the early 20th century. ==Architectural style== ===Exterior=== The building is constructed of sandstone ashlar, with a pitched Welsh-slate roof. There are three storeys with a lower two-storey gaol to the rear. The elevation facing onto the marketplace has three bays, the middle one having been altered in the twentieth century by the installation of a glass front. The first floor elevation is decorated with six large Tuscan order pilasters: the windows are twelve-pane sashes, with a wrought iron balcony in the centre, while the second floor windows have smaller six-pane windows. There is a flagpole on the front, and a small wooden central clocktower above with a lead cupola above with weathervane. ===Interior=== The Nelson Room, which is situated on the first floor has a large white-marble fireplace with a sleeping lion centrepiece. There is a magistrates' bench with coat of arms above. At the opposite end is the full-size plaster cast of John Edward Carew's bronze relief of The Death of Nelson.

She has served as an assistant bishop in the Anglican Diocese of Canberra and Goulburn since February 2020. ==Early life and parish ministry== Wagner was born in South Africa. She grew up in a non-religious family, but came to faith after what she describes as \\"an encounter with God\\" at age 15. Until her mid-40s, Wagner was a music teacher, who ran a business with her husband offering music lessons to children in Sydney from a mobile classroom. When she and her husband sold the business they employed 23 staff and taught up to 900 students a week. Wagner then studied theology. She obtained an Advanced Diploma in Ministry from Australian College of Ministries, Sydney, and a Bachelor of Theology from Sydney College of Divinity, through Australian College of Ministries and St Mark's National Theological Centre. After becoming a priest, Wagner served in a number of parishes in the Anglican Diocese of Canberra and Goulburn, including Berridale and the Snowy Mountains, Taralga and North Goulburn. She became rector of the Parish of Bodalla-Narooma in 2011, a role which she held until she was consecrated as bishop. On 27 February 2016, in addition to her parish role, Wagner was collated by Bishop Stuart Robinson as Archdeacon to the Coast, a role in which she assisted in the administration of the diocese and had oversight of Anglican churches stretching from the Victorian border to Batemans Bay. ==Episcopal ministry== On 28 October 2019, Wagner was appointed as the new assistant bishop of the Canberra and Goulburn Diocese, succeeding Trevor Edwards. She was consecrated bishop in St Saviour's Cathedral on 22 February 2020 by Bishop of Newcastle Peter Stuart. Wagner's role is based in Canberra and she holds particular responsibility for ministry support and the development of clergy and church workers. At the time of her appointment as assistant bishop, Wagner criticised the Government of the Australian Capital Territory and its Education Minister Yvette Berry for abolishing chaplains in schools, claiming it was a \\"drive to push any whisper of Christian teaching out of schools\\". She considered appointment to be a \\"big deal\\" because of the Anglican Church's conservative history and that the appointment of women priests \\"enriched\\" the church. ==Personal life== Wagner is married to Jay and has three adult sons.

She passes him a note on a slate stating \\"I love you Joe\\" while the grumpy and angry teacher is busy scolding one of the other children. Joe draws a heart on the slate to show his affection for the girl and shows her his drawing. He then later transforms the heart into a caricature of the teacher, to the amusement of the girl. When the teacher discovers the drawing, Joe gets into trouble and tells him off until another schoolboy, aiming for another boy in the class, hits the teacher with the wet sponge he had used to erase the blackboard with. Yet another schoolboy takes the opportunity while the teacher is dazed to dip his chewing gum in ink and fire it towards Joe with a slingshot. The gum hits Joe in the face and he chases after the boy, which gets the school's principle involved. More chaos ensues and things are complicated further when four inspectors arrive at the school, and accidentally sit down on sharpened objects (placed on the chairs by a schoolboy but meant for some of the girls).

Firsch later rewrote it following the success of his second play The Fire Raisers and it was produced successfully in theatres in Europe. It was translated into English from German only in 1962. Sterling read the script in the ABC's head office in Sydney and wanted to produce it on Australian television. It was the first non-Australian play to have its world TV premiere in Melbourne during the past five years (that had been The Soldier's Tale starring Robert Helpmann directed by Sterling). \\"Frisch uses the stage to tell a message as well as entertain,\\" said Sterling. \\"He is anti romantic. He hopes to achieve through the farce an awakening of the individual to his responsibilities.\\" According to one report, \\"The play's message is that mankind now has the means of destroying itself and must cope with this situation. Playwright Frisch chose the Chinese Wall as an allegorical basic for his play because it is one of the world's oldest constructions still standing in more or less its original state.\\" The play was experimental. ==Reception== The Age gave it a poor review saying the play was \\"ninety percent reiteration\\". The Age, reviewing the year in TV drama, said Chinese Wall and Barnstable were examples of \\"highbrow productions of limited appeal\\" which \\"frustrated more than they entertained, among local productions.\\" ==References== Category:1960s Australian television plays ","title":"The Chinese Wall (TV play)"},{"id":"63845913","text":"Harvey Wilson (born 9 December 1949) is a New Zealand equestrian.

His parents died before he was six years old, and most of his boyhood was passed in an unruly manner. When he was seventeen he heard George Whitefield preach, but the good impression received was not lasting. Three years later he was ‚Äòconvinced of sin‚Äô, joined the Methodists, and began to preach. He met John Wesley at Birstall in 1761, and by his advice attended the conference in London that year, when he was appointed the first travelling preacher of the connexion in Wales. A graphic account of his experiences in Glamorganshire and Pembrokeshire, and afterwards in various parts of England, Ireland, and Scotland, is given in his \\"Autobiography\\". Like many other early Methodists, he had a full share of hardships and persecutions. He continued an itinerant minister until 1816, a period of fifty-five years. He was president of the conference in 1796 and 1809. On the former occasion Alexander Kilham, the founder of the \\"methodist new connexion,\\" was expelled from the society. James Everett, in his Wesleyan Takings (p. 345), says of Taylor: \\"Large in stature, plain features; a useful preacher; natural temper short and peevish, but subdued by divine grace; with a few drawbacks, a fine specimen of the old school.\\" He was a close student, and mastered the original languages of the Bible. He died on 16 Oct. 1816 at Birch House, near Bolton, Lancashire, the residence of his friend Roger Hollond. Two days previously he had preached at Bolton, and his death inspired James Montgomery to write his poem The Christian Soldier. While at Chester in 1767 he married the descendant of a French Protestant family, by whom he had several children. A portrait of Taylor appeared in the Arminian Magazine for April 1780, and another in Wesley and his Successors, 1891. == Works == In addition to many separate sermons and tracts, he wrote: * ‚ÄòA New Concordance to the Holy Scriptures,‚Äô York, 1782. * ‚ÄòTen Sermons on the Millennium, and Five on what will Follow,‚Äô Hull, 1789. * ‚ÄòThe Hypocrite tried and cast out,‚Äô Liverpool, 1792. * ‚ÄòA Defence of the Methodists who do not attend the National Church,‚Äô Liverpool, 1792. * ‚ÄòHistory of the Waldenses and Albigenses,‚Äô Bolton, 1793. * ‚ÄòAn Answer to Paine's ‚ÄúAge of Reason,‚Äù‚Äô Manchester, 1796. * ‚ÄòSixteen Sermons on the Epistles to the Seven Churches,‚Äô Bristol, 1800. * ‚ÄòThe Reconciler, or an humble Attempt to sketch the Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of Christ,‚Äô &c.;, Liverpool, 1806. == Notes and references == === Citations === === Sources === * * == Further reading == * \\"Autobiography\\" in Jackson's Lives of Early Methodist Preachers, 1866, vol. v. * Osborn's Wesleyan Bibliography, 1869 * Batty's History of Rothwell, 1877, p. 231 * Tyerman's Life of John Wesley, 1871, vol. iii. * Green's Wesley Bibliography, 1896, p. 215\\\\. == External links == Category:1738 births Category:1816 deaths Category:18th-century Methodist ministers Category:Arminian ministers Category:Arminian writers Category:English Methodist ministers Category:Methodist writers Category:Presidents of the Methodist Conference Category:Wesleyan Methodists ","title":"Thomas Taylor (minister)"},{"id":"63846036","text":"Thomas Batliner (born 3 April 1959) is a Liechtenstein equestrian.

He is best known for his contributions in the understanding of radio pulsars, the galactic center and archaeoastronomy. Since the early 2000s he was heavily involved in the decoding of the Antikythera mechanism. He was a founding member of the Hellenic Astronomical Society, the European Astronomical Society and the International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics (IOAA). ==Personal life== John Seiradakis was born in Chania, Crete, Greece on March 5, 1948 to Mercy Burdett Money-Coutts Seiradaki and Michael Seiradakis. His mother was a British archaeologist. He had a younger sister, Sophia Hester Seiradaki. He completed his primary education, as well as two years of high school in Chania. In 1966 his family moved to Athens so he finished the last four grades of high school in Vyronas. He was admitted to the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, from which he received his Degree in Physics in 1971 (Class of 1970). He continued his post-graduate studies at the Victoria University of Manchester, from which he received his M.Sc. (1973) and his Ph.D. (1975) in Radio Astronomy. He had two children, Elena, currently an associate professor of Biochemistry at Oxford University, and Michael, currently a medical doctor working in Germany. He died on May 3, 2020 in his house in Thessaloniki, due to complications from cancer. An obituary appeared in Nature Astronomy. ==Career== John Seiradakis conducted his M.Sc. and Ph.D. projects under the supervision of Dr. John G. Davies. His M.Sc. thesis was entitled \\"High sensitivity pulsar search.\\" His MSc thesis examiners were Dr. Bryan Anderson and Prof. Antony Hewish. For his Ph.D project, entitled \\"Low latitude pulsar survey at 408 MHz\\", he designed and conducted a sensitive survey for pulsars in the galactic plane. This survey discovered 18 new radio pulsars, more than 20% of the then known population. His PhD viva examiners were Dr. Robin G. Conway and Prof. Bernard E.J. Pagel. After receiving his Ph.D., Seiradakis moved to Germany as a postdoctoral fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy (MPIfR), working under Prof. Richard Wielebinski. At the MPIfR, he made contributions to the understanding of pulsar emission and helped in the development of the first-generation pulsar instrumentation for the 100-m Effelsberg Radio telescope. He returned to the MPIfR several times during his career; in 1979 as a postdoctoral researcher, from 1982 to 1984 as an Alexander von Humboldt fellow and in 1991 as a visiting researcher on sabbatical leave from the University of Thessaloniki. In 1978 he became a researcher at the University of Hamburg. Together with Dr. W. Huchtmeier and others, he performed a comprehensive survey of the neutral hydrogen distribution in nearby galaxies using the 100-m radio telescope at Effelsberg. From 1982 to 1984 he worked as a researcher at the University of California, San Diego, where he continued his research on pulsar emission and interstellar scintillation. In 1984, together with collaborators A. N. Lasenby, F. Yusef-Zadeh, R. Wielebinski and U. Klein, Seiradakis performed some of the first polarimetric observations of Sag A* at 10 GHz. This study revealed an extended polarised radio source with jet-like lobes originating from the Galactic Center. In 1986 he joined the Department of Physics of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and in 1996 was promoted to Professor. As a faculty member, he contributed in numerous fields, including neutron stars (pulsars), neutral hydrogen modelling in nearby galaxies, the Galactic Center, Flare Stars, Lunar Transient Phenomena and Archaeoastronomy. He published more than 74 scientific papers in refereed journals, and more than 80 papers in conference proceedings and special volumes, as well as three University-level textbooks. He was a founding member of the Hellenic Astronomical Society (Hel.A.S.) where he served as Secretary (1994-1998) and as President (1998-2002). He served as Member (1986-1990) and as Chairman (2001-2005) of the Greek National Committee for Astronomy. ===Antikythera mechanism=== The Antikythera mechanism is a hand-powered analogue computer discovered in 1900. The mechanism had been studied extensively for over a century. However, in the early 2000s, a new effort to analyse it using more advanced imaging techniques commenced, the so called \\"The Antikythera Mechanism Research Project\\" (AMRP). Prof. Seiradakis led the Greek involvement in this effort, along with Prof. Xenophon Moussas and Yannis Bitsakis. In 2005 the AMRP was granted permission to study the mechanism using novel tomographic and imaging techniques. This new study resulted in breakthrough discoveries regarding the design, function and origin of the mechanism. The project's findings have been presented in a series of scientific papers and are summarised in a review article in Nature entitled, \\"Our current knowledge of the Antikythera Mechanism\\" by J.H. Seiradakis and M.G. Edmunds. They have also inspired a large number of popular science articles* and documentaries. Prof. Seiradakis gave numerous lectures and presentations presenting the new results all over the world, including Chicago (USA), Bonn (Germany), CERN(Switzerland), etc . ===Education and outreach=== 201x201pxThrough his teaching and outreach activities, Seiradakis played a central role in the development of astronomy in Greece during the entire period of the Third Hellenic Republic. Dozens of his students have continued their studies at the postgraduate level in astrophysics and went on to assume faculty research positions, both in Greece and abroad. With the initiative of Prof. Seiradakis, the 2006 General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union established the International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics, an international competition for high-school students, which is now one of the International Science Olympiads. Seiradakis represented Greece in the IOAA board until his death in 2020. Together with Prof. Loukas Zachilas, he also led the Greek team, from 2007 until 2017. == Selected publications == *\\"Pulsar Associated with the Supernova Remnant IC 443\\" by Davies J. G., Lyne A.

She received training from three notable painters of the period: Frederik Vermehren, J√∏rgen Roed and Vilhelm Kyhn. Kyhn submitted samples of her artwork, together with drawings by Augusta Paulli and , in an unsuccessful attempt to have them admitted to the Academy. While still young, following in Roed's footsteps, Bang made a drawing of a chapter in Ribe Cathedral (1865), attracting the interest of the art historian Niels Laurits H√∏yen. Inspired by H√∏yen, she went on to paint secluded landscapes, including scenes of Bornholm (1870). She first exhibited at the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition in 1873, becoming a frequent exhibitor thereafter. In 1876, she was a student of Paul Gauguin, living in his Paris home. She attended the Acad√©mie Julian where she studied under L√©on Bonnat and Tony Robert-Fleury. Thanks to a ministerial grant, she travelled to Italy in the late 1870s and again around 1886, painting subjects she exhibited at Charlottenborg in 1887. In 1888, together with 22 other women including Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen and Nathalie Krebs, she signed a petition to the parliament, calling for the Art Academy to be expanded to admit women.

The landslide, which hit late in the morning, was believed to have been caused by a burst of heavy rainfall and numerous village wells surrounding the landslide. The landslide collapsed the road of Lower Kelly, which was a vital and only road connection to the town of Calstock, trapping forty cars. == Cause == This landslide took place next to five old village drinking wells. This water for centuries had eroded the foundations of the road since its 18th-century construction, then in an heavy burst of rainfall caused by the 2013‚Äì14 United Kingdom winter floods led to the collapse of the road over a 30 foot drop, to the river bank with the River Tamar. Over Christmas morning the road continued to collapse, the local fire service and police were called to the scene. Local residents were evacuated immediately, as it was feared that the landslide could also collapse the nearby Georgian terrace. It was feared that the foundations of Calstock Viaduct might also collapse and Tamar Valley Line services were cancelled until 28 December 2013. == Management == On 30 December 2013, five days after the landslide, Calstock Parish Council held a local residents' meeting, chaired by Dorothy Kirk. At this meeting numerous proposals were made and rejected. As the meeting began to close a proposal was made by a local ten year old boy, Charlie Southcott. He proposed that the Royal Marines who were based nearby could rescue the trapped cars using landing crafts to ferry the trapped cars, between the Calstock Boatyard slipway and Cotehele Quay slipway. Charlie was also an acquaintance of the then commander of the HMNB Devonport, Commodore Graeme Little, whom he had met the previous week at the Babcock Christmas Carol Service, held on Christmas Eve. Young Southcott then also presented the parish council with Commodore Little's telephone number and contact details. == Royal Marine rescue == Calstock Parish Council contacted Cmdre Little and it was arranged that the Royal Marine's 1st Assault Group would leave HMNB Devonport, travel up the River Tamar to Calstock on 15 January 2014 to ferry the forty cars over two days. The day was chosen because of the favourable neap tides. Upon assessment and Charlie's recommendations the Royal Marines would land and cars could embark from Calstock Boat Yard and travel 1 mile down the River Tamar to Cotehele Quay, a National Trust property nearby, to disembark the cars. In total the Royal Marines provided four LCVP Mk5 and one Offshore Raiding Craft. The slipway used at Calstock was constructed by the American Army in the Second World War to embark US Army troops into Landing craft bound for Utah Beach, as part of the Normandy Landings. Calstock Primary School children, including Charlie Southcott, were given the day off to watch the unfolding military operation. The event was Calstock's largest peacetime military operation. == Aftermath == After the Royal Marine rescue Cornwall Council began rebuilding the collapsed wall. This was done by constructing a tall wall of large cement block and then an exterior of natural stone, imitating the original design and in keeping with the rest of the unclasped wall. The road was reopened on 19 May 2014 and a village street party was held to celebrate. The road since then has been in constant use and remains structurally intact. ==Damaged property== The road had also collapsed onto a riverside shed and the shed was also rebuilt by Cornwall Council once the road was completed. ==Gallery== File:Calstock Landslide (looking Westward).jpgCalstock Landslide, River Tamar behind.

Educated at home as a youth, he worked as a shepherd. Though self-taught, he was precocious and participated in the popular education of the time. ==Career== He was awarded the title Pleqnar i Kosov√´s (\\"Elder of Kosovo\\") at the Junik Assembly of 1877 and raised his profile by attending the inaugural meeting of the League of Prizren in 1878. He represented Drenica at the subsequent meeting, presided over by Binak Alia, where the Karanarme decree was signed. Alia later passed the chairmanship on to Abria. In addition, he participated in the 1899 Assembly of Peƒá (held near what is now De√ßan) and Deli Prekazi's Drenica revolt in 1903. ==The People's Genius== Xhemail Abria was known by three surnames: Abria (from his birthplace, known in Albanian as Abria e Ep√´rme), the honorific Aga, and Seferi (from his father). Rising from illiteracy to a connoisseur's understanding of the philosophy, history, and geography of the Albanian people, he was given the sobriquet of Gjeniu i Popullit (\\"The People‚Äôs Genius\\"). An apocryphal example was his response to a query from a village elder named Rexh√´ Hyseni from Belo Polje, near what is now Istok. The man asked Abria to solve a thorny dispute between two local clans over a family gravesite too old to otherwise identify. Abria suggested the following, akin to a crude version of modern DNA analysis: > Exhume one of the dead and get a bone from therein. Summon one man from each > family and obtain a drop of blood from each. Put each drop on the bone and > see which one is absorbed into the marrow, awarding the site to that drop‚Äôs > bloodline. ==Quotes== * Fjala n\`kam√´ nuk peshon rand!(‚ÄúWords have no weight standing (so sit)!‚Äù) * Ma pive kafen e ftoft√´!

He was baptised on 28 January 1781 in the Noorderkerk in Amsterdam. Temminck married Maria Jacoba Suerdfeger in Hasselt, Overijssel on 19 September 1802. The couple had at least eight children. By 1812, the family was living in Kampen, where Temminck was a police commissioner. For some reason he joined the Dutch colonial administration on the Gold Coast in the early 1820s. After arriving on the Gold Coast on 8 February 1822, he relieved interim commander Friedrich Last of his duties. He was installed on 14 February 1822. Temminck served until Willem Poolman arrived to succeed him. Temminck seems to have continued his career in the Dutch East Indies. In June 1830, he was made president of the orphans' court in Semarang, after having previously served as head commissioner of police in Batavia. In 1837, Temminck was indicted for \\"theft of the nation's wealth\\" (Dutch: landsdieverij) by the procurator fiscal at the Council of Justice in Semarang. He was sentenced to a high fine and banishment from the Dutch East Indies on 2 June 1837. On appeal, the Supreme Court of the Dutch East Indies left the fine in place, but instead of banishing Temminck from the Dutch East Indies, the court declared him \\"infamous\\" (Dutch: eerloos) and sentenced him to five years imprisonment. Temminck only had to serve part of his prison sentence and requested king William II of the Netherlands on 20 April 1841 to \\"remove the stain of infamy\\" from his record. The king granted this request by royal decree number 62 of 5 July 1842.

He is the CEO and founder of Satalia. Hulme founded Satalia in 2007, a company that provides AI products and consultancy for governments and companies such as Tesco, PwC and the BBC. He received a doctorate in AI from University College London (UCL), and is now their Computer Science Entrepreneur in residence, where he teaches how AI can be applied to solve business and social problems. Hulme is also a frequent public speaker and writer on the topics of AI, ethics, technology, innovation, decentralization and organisational design. ==Early life and education== Hulme was born in 1980. He grew up in the seaside town of Morecambe in north west England. After completing secondary school Hulme moved to London to study at University College London. On completing his under graduate degree, Hulme stayed at UCL to complete a masters and then a PhD. All three degrees were in subjects related to AI. In 2009 Hulme was awarded a Kauffman Global Entrepreneur Scholarship, which saw him visit institutes in the United States to better understand their culture of innovation, and what UK business people could learn from it. This included a tour of Stanford, MIT, Berkeley and Harvard, along with a placement at Cisco Systems HQ in Silicon Valley. == Career == ===Satalia=== Hulme founded NPComplete Limited in 2007, and incorporated it in 2008, a few months before completing his PhD. NPComplete Limited trades as Satalia. The London-based company provides full-stack AI consultancy and products, helping organisations harness data science, machine learning and AI to solve complex problems, including real-time optimisation. NPComplete refers to mathematical NP-completeness, which describes a class of exponential problems in the field of computational complexity theory. The trading name of NPComplete, Satalia, is intended as a portmanteau of SAT (Short for satisfiability, as in the Boolean satisfiability problem) and the Latin phrase Et alia. Satalia seeks to solve hard problems, in particular the class of exponentially hard problems found in academia and industry known as NP-hardness. While much of Satalia's focus in on helping firms cut costs and increase revenue, Hulme has stated the firm also has a higher vision. Which is to help anyone, from any part of the world, to contribute to innovations, and \\"to enable everyone to do the work they love\\". In 2016, Satalia was the only UK company to appear in the Gartner Cool Vendors list for Data science. In November 2019, City A.M. reported that Satalia was the 39th fastest growing tech firm in the UK, with three year growth at 886%. ===Academia=== Hulme's master's degree topic was on simulating artificial life with Artificial Neural Networks. His PhD spanned modelling bumblebee brains and mathematical optimization. Hulme maintained his connection with UCL after completing his doctorate, staying on in various teaching positions. From 2014 to Oct 2019 he was the Director of UCL's Business analytics MSc, which dealt with the application of AI to government, social, and business problems. As of 2020, Hulme is UCL's Entrepreneur In Residence. He is also a faculty member and lecturer at Singularity University, and a visiting lecturer at London School of Economics's Marshall Institute. ===Public engagement=== Hulme frequently speaks for TEDx, Google and at various other events. He specialises in Artificial Intelligence, Decentralization, Organisational Design, and Innovation. He has written numerous articles and contributed to several books, largely concerning AI, as well as applied technology and related ethical issues. In 2017, along with Elon Musk, Stuart J. Russell, Geoffrey Hinton and Demis Hassabis, Hulme was one of the 116 founders of robotics and AI companies to sign an open letter to the United Nations, warning against the use of AI in autonomous weapons.

He is spoken of by Pliny in terms of the highest praise, as not only an excellent man and profound scholar, but a lawyer thoroughly acquainted with private and public law, and perfectly skilled in the practice of his profession.Pliny the Younger, Epistulae 22 ==Works== Pliny does not say anything about Aristo's merits as an author, and though his works are occasionally mentioned in the compendium of juristic writings known as the Digest, there is no direct extract from any of them in that compilation. In philosophy, this model of a virtuous lawyer is described by Pliny as a genuine disciple of the Stoa Poikile. He has been usually supposed to belong to the legal sect of Proculeian school, which clashed with the rival sect of the Sabinian school, though there is at least one situation described in which his legal opinions sided with the Sabinian Javolenus instead of the Proculeian Pegasus.Digest 28. tit. 5. s. 19 Aristo wrote notes on the Libri Posteriorum of Marcus Antistius Labeo, on \\"Cassius\\" (unclear which one, but likely Gaius Cassius Longinus or a descendant), whose pupil he had been, and on Masurius Sabinus. \\"Aristo in decretis Frontianis\\", or \\"Frontinianis\\", is once cited in the Digest;Digest 29. tit. 2. s. ult. but what those decreta (\\"decisions\\") were has never been satisfactorily explained. He corresponded with his contemporary jurists, Publius Juventius Celsus and Lucius Neratius Priscus;Digest 19. tit. 2. s. 19.2, 20. tit. 3. s. 3, 40. tit. 7. s. 29.1 and it appears probable that many of the responsa and epistolae of the Roman jurisconsults were not opinions upon cases occurring in actual practice, but answers to the hypothetical questions of pupils and legal friends. ==Other Possible Works== Other works have been attributed to him without strong consensus among modern scholars. Some, for example, have inferred from a passage in Aulus Gellius, that he wrote de furtis;Aulus Gellius, Attic Nights 11.18 and, from passages in the Digest, that he published books titled Digesta and Responsa.Digest 24. tit. 3. s. 44. pr.; 8. tit. 5. s. 8.5 ; 23. tit. 2. s. 40 ==References== Category:Ancient Roman jurists Category:1st-century Romans Category:2nd- century Romans Category:2nd-century writers ","title":"Titius Aristo"},{"id":"63846640","text":"X1822‚Äì371, associated with the optically visible star V691 Coronae Australis (abbreviated V691 CrA), is a neutron-star X-ray binary system at a distance of approximately 2-2.5 kiloparsecs.

The church is Grade II* listed and has been since 30 March 1971. St Giles is the smaller of the Anglican churches in Wakefield City Centre, the larger being Wakefield Cathedral. ==History== Rendering of 1797 by Lindley & Watson architects The church with the corresponding Georgian architecture in the north end of Wakefield The church was constructed between 1791 and 1795 to a design by Charles Watson of Doncaster and York. It was altered in 1885 and then extended in 1905 to designs by J.T. Micklethwaite. The church was not built in isolation but as the centrepiece of a new development to the North of Wakefield City Centre and matches much of the other Georgian architecture in the vicinity and is the sole large development in Wakefield of this era. The tower was rebuilt in 1885 also to a design by J.T. Micklethwaite and other internal alterations were made at this time. ==Grounds== The church is situated in St John's Square in open grounds. The grounds are tree-lines and overlooked by the Georgian terraces built at the same time. There is no formal cemetery but a small number of graves and memorials in the grounds. The nave backs closely onto Wentworth Street. To the north-east corner there is a war memorial in the grounds to the workers at Wrenthorpe Colliery who lost their lives in the First World War. ==Listing and acthitectural notability== The church was grade II listed on 30 March 1971 for the reasons for its architectural notability. ==Architectural style== The building is of Ashlar sandstone with a hipped slate roof on the nave and aisles and a lead one to the chancel, chapel and vestry. The church is of a classical style. ===Tower=== Detail of upper stages of the tower The tower was is not the original one but was a replacement built in 1885 to a design by London architect, J.T. Micklethwaite. The tower is a west tower with five stages, a chancel with south chapel and over the north vestry an organ loft. There is a west doorway in the tower with Tuscan pilasters. The uppermost stage is octagonal with round belfry openings and a clock face. It is topped with a polygonal dome with a weathervane to its apex. Inside there is a round stairwell with two cantilevered stone staircases. ===Nave=== The nave has five bays. There are round-headed windows in the upper-tier and segmental headed windows in the lower tier. The south side has a central field with an oval panel, festoons and is surmounted by an urb. The back end of the main nave has porches with plain parapets and north and south doors. The nave has a platerred ceiling with three sunken round panels. The walls are plastered and there is a flagstone floor. ===Chancel=== There is a two bay chancel. The chancel has high-set Discletian north and south windows. There is statue of John the Baptist in a round-headed niche and a parapet showing the IHS monogram. There are Tuscan polasters and a painted and guilded barrelled ceiling. The chancel portch was added in 1905. There is a black and white marble dloor. ===Chapel and vestry=== There is a small single-bay chapel with an organ loft set above and a blind east window. the chapel is connected to the Chancel by colonaded entrances. There is a small vestry with a segmental headed window and door. ==Fixtures== There are still several of the original pews. Most other furnishings are late 19th century in origin and we installed during the restoration of this time. There is a polygonal pulpit with fielded panels which is dated 1822 though the fixture itself is likely later. The chancel has a fielded-panel dado which is dated 1912. There are choir stalls dated 1900s with ornate foliage crestings to the ends. There is a rederos depicting the crucifixion framed by Corinthian columns. Communion rails were added in 1905. There is a second rederos in the north chapel. There are wall tablets dating from the 18th and 19th centuries and 20th century square panels depicting the Stations of the Cross. ==Stained glass windows== There are several stained glass windows. The chancel windows date from 1905. The chapel window was of manufacture by E. Pickett & Co of Leeds. The South window is a design of H.

Aged 19 in 1952, Connell came to England, initially joining the Royal Air Force before going into acting training funded by the RAF. Zaran began his career in 1961, firstly using his birth name before adopting Nik Zaran as his stage name in 1968.

The Act, often shortened to ‚Ä≤CSDPA‚Ä≤, was given Royal Assent on 29 May 1970. The legislation was introduced as a Private Member's Bill by Alf Morris after he gained first place in a ballot held on 6 November 1969. From some 550 contenders, Alf Morris was afforded the opportunity to introduce his Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Bill. The provisions of the Act are wide-ranging and place a legal obligation on local authorities to make arrangements in relation to access for disabled people to public buildings, such as libraries. Section 2 of the Act makes specific provision for welfare services such as the provision of meals in the home or somewhere else; the provision (or assistance to obtain) a radio and television, a library and other recreational services; for assistance with obtaining travel to and from home; for assistance with adaptations to the home; for the installation of telephones or special equipment necessary to enable the use of a telephone; for the provision of vehicles. ==Effect of case law== There have been a number of legal cases which have brought about a body of caselaw which should be taken into account when considering the meaning and scope of this Act. R v Gloucestershire CC Ex p. Barry (1997) allowed an appeal by Gloucestershire CC of the Court of Appeal‚Ä≤s decision that the local authority could not take into account the available financial resources in establishing need and that this could not be assessed in the absence of some consideration as to the potential financial expenditure involved in addressing the need. However, a more recent ruling from the House of Lords in R v East Sussex County Council, ex p. Tandy [1998] has narrowed the reach of the ruling in Barry confining it to the CSDPA 1970 and not the duties under Section 21 of the National Assistance Act 1948. ==See also== Alf Morris, British Labour Co- operative politician and disability campaigner who introduced the Bill. ==References== ==External links== * Category:United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 1970 Category:Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom concerning healthcare ","title":"Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970"},{"id":"63846846","text":"Md.

The church is dedicated to Our Lady of Lapa and is part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of S√£o Salvador da Bahia. It is known as key site in the Brazilian independence movement in the early 19th century. Sister Joana Ang√©lica resisted the invasion of Portuguese troops into the convent and was killed by bayonet in 1822 at the south portal of the convent. The interior of the church is noted as \\"one of the finest rococo compositions in the city\\". Its original baroque construction of the 18th century remains largely unaltered, with a complex high altar, azulejos in the chancel, and a well-preserved nave ceiling painting. The Church and Convent of Our Lady of the Conception of Lapa was listed as a historic structure by the National Historic and Artistic Heritage Institute (IPHAN) in 1938. ==Location== Nave and chancel of the Church of Lapa Martyrdom of Joana Ang√©lica, 1822 The Church and Convent of Our Lady of the Conception of Lapa is located directly south of the Historic Center of Salvador. It was constructed on the second line of hills beyond the historic city center. While once surrounded by open agricultural land, it now stretches several city blocks along Avenida Joana Ang√©lica, a long commercial street in the Lapa neighborhood of the city. The church and convent have a broad, two- story white lime wall facing the avenue with two ornate portals. The north portal provides entrance to the east of the church nave, which sits parallel to the avenue. ==History== The first convent in Salvador was established in 1665, the Convent of Desterro, but proved to be too small by the early 18th century. Manuel Antunes Lima and Jo√£o de Miranda Ribeiro, wealthy merchants in Salvador, sought authorization from John V of Portugal to build a convent to cloister their daughters. Jo√£o de Miranda Ribeiro, originally from Porto, was admitted to the Santa Casa da Miseric√≥rdia of Salvador in 1717, a charitable fraternity, as a \\"minor\\" member due to his status as a carpenter. He became greatly wealthy over the next three decades; his son, Agostoinho de Miranda Ribeiro, was admitted to the Miseric√≥rdia fraternity as a \\"major\\" member due to their elevated family status. Similarly, Manuel Antunes Lima was also a member of the Miseric√≥rdia fraternity, and promoted from a minor member to a \\"major\\" member of the upper class in 1732. Lima and Ribeiro sent a letter dated October 13, 1733 to request permission to build the convent; it was granted via a royal decree dated October 13, 1733. John V stipulated that the Lima and Ribeiro cover the entire cost of the construction of the convent, and limit its community to twenty individuals. Construction on the convent of Lapa began in 1734 on landed ceded to Ribeiro by Captain Jo√£o Pinto Brand√£o de Magalh√£es. Jo√£o de Miranda Ribeiro, as a master carpenter, had previous experience building a chapel; he constructed a building of stone and lime at his residence in Toror√≥. It was dedicated to Our Lady of Conception of the Grotto. The convent was dedicated on December 7, 1744 under archbishop Dom Jos√© Botelho de Matos. 17 postulates entered the convent. Leadership of the new convent came from Convent of Desterro: Mother Maria Caetana da Assun√ß√£o was installed as Abbess of the Lapa Convent, and Mother Josefa Clara de Jesus became Vicar of the new community. Five novitiates were daughters of Jo√£o de Miranda Ribeiro: Sisters Francisca do Sacramento da Lapa, Joana do Nascimento da Lapa, Maria da Cruz da Lapa, Ursula das Virgens da Lapa. The Lapa convent, like the Convent of Desterro, was reserved for daughters of the wealthy merchant class, almost all with fortunes from sugarcane plantations. The Convent of Desterro had 400 enslaved Africans in the 18th century; the convent of Lapa was \\"renowned for their prominent families, their jewels and finery, their multitudinous personal servants, and their scandalous morality.\\" The Lapa community grew to 20 members as stipulated by the degree, then was allowed to grow to 33 members. The chapel of the convent became too small to accommodate the growing community. Jo√£o Miranda Ribeiro asked John V to build a church adjacent to the convent; a small military fortification, however, was located on the site. Construction was only authorized in 1750. The church was designed by Lieutenant-General Nicolau de Abreu Carvalho and his eldest son Jo√£o de Abreu e Carvalho in 1752. The plan of the church is located in the Arquivo Hist√≥rico Ultramarino, an archive of Portuguese colonial history in Lisbon. Construction of the church began on June 8, 1750. Sergeant-Major Manuel Cardoso de Saldanha declared the small military fortification ruined and useless in a letter dated June 10, 1752, which allowed construction to begin on the site. Progress on the project was slow and further delayed by the death of Jo√£o de Miranda Ribeiro in October 1755. Jo√£o Francisco Passarinho served as the master carpenter of the project. Jo√£o Francisco Passarinho, unlike Ribeiro, was paid daily, which greatly increased the cost of construction costs. Jos√© Moreira Leal arrived in Bahia from Lisbon in 1754 with a portal sculpted of lioz stone to donate to the convent, but it lacked two stones for its base; they arrived in a shipment in the following year. An image of Our Lady of the Conception and window panes also date to Leal's donation. The Conceptionists also petitioned for a choir accessible only to the convent community; as a result, the church has a two-tiered choir. Ant√¥nio Mendes da Silva, a woodcarver, designed and executed the high altar. His work began on June 8, 1755, but not completed until 1763; the Lapa convent, like other religious structures in Salvador, often lacked donations or wealthy patrons. The larger niche has the image of Our Lady of the Conception; an image of the Good Shepherd is located above. Both statues date to the 18th century. The stone wall dates to 1767. It was constructed by permission from the Chamber Senate of Salvador after the church and convent were straightened to conform to the street. ===Death of Joana Ang√©lica=== The Church and Convent of Our Lady of the Conception of Lapa is the site of a key event in the struggle for the independence of Brazil from the Portuguese in the early 19th century. Joana Ang√©lica, a Brazilian Conceptionist nun and abbess of the Lapa convent, resisted an invasion into the convent by Portuguese troops in 1822. The Portuguese stabbed Joana Ang√©lica a bayonet, and she promptly died and became the first heroine of the independence struggle of Brazil. The convent fell into financial crisis after the death of Joana Ang√©lica. Her successor, Mother Joana de Jesus Maria Rabelo, requested and received permission to sell gold and silver implements dating to the previous century; the included a silver crowns, a large gold vessel, large silver torches, and other valuable objects. ===20th century=== Only three Conceptcionist nuns and some servants remained in the convent at the beginning of the 20th century. Maria Jos√© da Concei√ß√£o Barata, abbess of the convent, received members of the Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd on July 16, 1901. The Congregation arrived in Bahia in 1892 and lived among various Catholic institutions in the city. With the death of the final Conceptionist sister in 1912, ownership of the Lapa Convent passed to the Good Shepherd religious community. ==Structure== The Church and Convent of Our Lady of the Conception of Lapa consists of a long complex with a church to the north and convent and school to the south. It is surrounded by a high wall constructed in 1767. Unlike other religious structures of Bahia, it lacks a monument pediment at its entrance. The convent and church have portals that open to street level. The stone portal of the church, brought by Jos√© Moreira Leal from Lisbon in 1754, is in an ornate baroque style with a large pediment, volutes, and a niche. The stone cartouche at center of the pediment retains a carving, \\"Virgem Sm.·µÉ da Lapa e Concei√ß√£o\\". The structure has a broad patio at center, which leads to a gallery of rooms for members of the convent community; the convent additionally had meeting rooms, halls, and corridors. The gallery leads to the upper choir, which is reserved for the exclusive use of the community. A house for the chaplain of the Lapa convent was constructed at the opposite side of the patio. ===Church interior=== Eug√©nio √Åvila Lins described the interior \\"one of the finest rococo compositions in the city\\". The origin and date of delivery of the two large panels of azulejos of the chancel are unknown. They depict Our Lady of the Conception in a detailed deep blue painting. The panels are framed with pilasters, garlands, and angels, all in the baroque style. The panel on the right wall is titled Adora√ß√£o dos Pastores, but is of unknown authorship. The panel has a legend reading Nesta Lapa se abrevia toda a gloria e sua luz; pois nella o sol de Jesus nasceo de aurora Maria. The panel at left has an image of the Virgin Mary in a procession to the new church, with a legend reading Bem intenta a devo√ß√£o dar-lhe lugar mais decente porem na Lapa somente quer ter a venera√ß√£o. The retable of the Church of Lapa is in the late baroque style and was designed by Ant√¥nio Mendes da Silva in 1755. It has \\"powerful\\" baroque-style Solomonic columns, four on each side of its central part, surmounted by a canopy in the form of a crown, supported by figures of caryatids. The retable has numerous rococo design features, including angels, cherubs, phytomorphic elements, and tassels. The ceiling of the chancel is painted and image of the Virgin Mary superimposed Holy Trinity, as well as religious figures receiving the habit of the Conceptionist order. The chancel and high altar of the Church of Lapa, unlike other churches of Bahia, was not renovated in the Neoclassical style; its elements are original to the structure. An exception is the altar table, which was originally of wood, then silver. It was replaced by one in marble in the Neoclassical style in the 19th century. Side altars sit to either side of the chancel at the front of the nave. ===Sacristy=== The sacristy of the Lapa Convent was built behind the wall of the high altar and was the width of the church. This original sacristy, although humbly decorated, once had rich ceiling paintings, a lavabo, and sacristy chest. The original sacristy had a retable designed in 1785 by Jos√© Nunes de Santana. It has been missing since the mid-20th century. The original sacristy is no longer used by the church or convent; the current sacristy is in a lateral corridor. ===Belvedere=== The Convent of Lapa has a three-story belvedere, a feature found in the nearby Church and Convent of Our Lady of the Exile (). The belvedere dates to approximately 1785, when a set of white azulejos arrived from Lisbon to cover the pyramid of the tower. ==Protected status== The Church and Convent of Our Lady of the Conception of Lapa was listed as a historic structure by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN) in 1938. Both the structure and its contents were included in the IPHAN directive under inscription number 79. The carvings and retable by Ant√¥nio Mendes da Silva are likely the sole remaining works of the artist. ==Access== The church of the is open to the public and may be visited. The convent and school to the south of the complex and the site of the martyrdom of Joana Ang√©lica are closed to the public. ==References== Category:Roman Catholic churches in Salvador, Bahia Category:18th-century Roman Catholic church buildings Category:National heritage sites of Bahia Category:Portuguese Colonial architecture in Brazil ","title":"Church and Convent of Our Lady of the Conception of Lapa"},{"id":"63847061","text":"Elisabetta Gafforini (1777 ‚Äì 10 November 1847) was an Italian opera singer who performed leading contralto and mezzo-soprano roles, primarily in the theatres of Venice and at La Scala in Milan but also in Spain, Portugal, and other Italian cities. During the course of her 25-year career she appeared in numerous world premieres. She possessed a limpid, flexible, and resonant voice with an exceptionally wide range, and according to Stendhal was a consummate and enchanting comic actress. Gafforini was born in Milan and lived there after her definitive retirement from the stage in 1818 until her death at the age of 70. ==Biography== ===Early years=== Gafforini was born in Milan in 1777, the daughter of Margherita n√©e Fenaroli and Giuseppe Gafforini. Despite her considerable celebrity, there is little biographical data available about her early life. Her first documented performances date from 1793 when she was active in the opera houses of Venice.. Her early appearances in Venice included the premieres of Francesco Bianchi's Il Cinese in Italia (Teatro San Mois√®, 1793) and La secchia rapita (Teatro San Samuele, 1794) and La principessa filosofa (Teatro San Benedetto, 1794). Over the next six years Gafforini continued to appear in Venice as well as in Verona, Trieste, Livorno, and Turin. During this period her younger sister, Marianna Gafforini, often appeared with her in secondary roles. Marianna later married the bass Luigi Zamboni. ===Stardom in Milan and Lisbon=== Gafforini made the first of her many appearances at La Scala in March 1801. That spring she sang in four comic operas there: revivals of Mayr's Che Originali!, Gazzaniga's Fedelt√† ed amore alla prova, and Portugal's Le Donne cambiate, and the premiere of Orlandi's Il Podest√† di Chioggia. In April she also sang in the premiere of cantata Il Trionfo della pace. It was given a gala performance at La Scala to celebrate the Treaty of Lun√©ville, which reconfirmed Napoleon's rule over Milan. The following November Gafforini sang the role of the Contessa in the premiere of Giuseppe Mosca's Il sedicente filosofo. By this time, her physical beauty and talent for comedy had made her the idol of La Scala's audiences. A four page leaflet was published to coincide with the premiere of Il sedicente filosofo, containing an adulatory sonnet and her portrait. Beneath her portrait was a couplet which was frequently repeated in later writings about her: Stendhal, who had attended many of her performances at La Scala, later recalled: > In her, the comic genius flowered in all its glory. Her performances in La > Dama soldato, in Ser Marcantonio and in Il Ciabattino were unforgettable. > Never again shall there be born into the world, solely for the purpose of > ministering to the frivolous pleasures of sophisticated people, another > living being that so shone and sparkled, whose wit was more irrepressible, > nor whose merriment was more irresistible. Gafforini in her artfully dishevelled hairstyle, depicted in Lisbon in 1804 Gafforini continued to sing at La Scala for the 1802 season, appearing in several operas including the world premieres of Mosca's La fortunata combinazione and Fioravanti's La capricciosa pentita. She then left for Lisbon, where she was the prima donna of an Italian opera buffa company led by Fioravanti. She performed in numerous operas at the Theatro de S√£o Carlos between 1803 and 1805, including the world premiere of Fioravanti's La donna soldato. The young women in the S√£o Carlos audiences were fascinated by her way of styling her thick blond hair to look artfully \\"dishevelled\\" and soon began imitating it. The Portuguese word \\"gaforina\\" was coined to describe both Gafforini's hairstyle and the type of woman who wore it. The word appears in later writings by both Aquilino Ribeiro and E√ßa de Queir√≥s. Gafforini returned to Milan and the stage of La Scala in 1806, appearing in the spring in a revival of La capricciosa pentita and in the summer in the premiere of La feudataria. However, there was trouble in the autumn season. Gafforini starred in the premiere of I saccenti alla moda (The Fashionable Prigs), a dramma giocoso satirizing the political regime of Milan. It proved very popular with the audience, but she was accused by the authorities of \\"shameless behavior\\" during the performance. This led to her being banned for a year from La Scala and other royal theatres under the patronage of Napoleon. At the same time, her future husband, Antonio Gasparinetti, had published a sonnet in her honour, and that too was seen as expressing anti-French sentiments, despite the fact that Gasparinetti was an ardent supporter of Napoleon and had served as a cavalry officer in Italy's Napoleonic troops. Gafforini was welcomed back to La Scala in the 1808 season and continued to sing there and at the Teatro Carignano in Turin until 1811. Towards the end of that period she ventured into opera seria, singing two en travesti roles previously assigned to castrati. She was Annibale (Hannibal) in Giuseppe Farinelli's Annibale in Capua and King Abradate in Nicolini's Abradate e Dircea. Although the repertoire throughout her main career had been overwhelmingly in the opera buffa genre where she excelled, she had sung similar roles in her early days in Venice: Giulio Cesare (Julius Caesar) in Francesco Bianchi's La morte di Cesare and Giovanni Talbot (John Talbot) in Gaetano Andreozzi's Giovanna d'Arco, both at La Fenice in 1797. ===Marriage and later years=== Gafforini's husband, Antonio Gasparinetti From late 1811 through early 1812, Gafforini was engaged by the Teatro San Carlo in Naples. She appeared there in Orlandi's La dama soldato, Portugal's Oro non compra amore, and Mosca's Il salto di Leucade. On her return to Milan, Gafforini and her lover, Antonio Gasparinetti, were married at the Chiesa di San Fedele on 1 April 1812. Their daughter and only child, Eugenia, was born later that year some time after Gafforini's summer appearance at the Teatro Eretenio in Vicenza in La dama soldato. From 1812 Gafforini had effectively retired from the stage although she made a few sporadic appearances between 1815 and 1818. Her brother-in-law, Luigi Zamboni, for whom Rossini wrote the role of Figaro in The Barber of Seville, had urged Rossini and the impresario Francesco Sforza-Cesarini to entice Gafforini out of retirement to sing Rosina at the opera's premiere.

She is an associate research scholar with the Obama Presidency Oral History project at Columbia University. She specializes in the history of conservative media in the United States from the 1940s to the present, and the role of right-wing media in American electoral politics. She is particularly involved in public communication that aims to provide historical context for contemporary events in American politics. Hemmer has been a regular columnist or an editor of historical series at print media outlets like The Washington Post, The US News & World Report, and The Age, and she hosts the American history podcasts Past Present and This Day in Esoteric Political History. ==Education and academic positions== Hemmer is from Indiana. She attended Marian University in Indianapolis, graduating with a BA in 2001 with a major in psychology and a minor in political science. She then earned an MA in 2005, an MPhil in 2006, and a PhD in 2010, all in U.S. history from the Department of History at Columbia University. Her dissertation was entitled Messengers of the Right: Media and the Modern Conservative Movement, and was supervised by Alan Brinkley. From 2009 to 2011, Hemmer was an Adjunct Lecturer at Manchester University in Indiana, and in 2011 she became a Postdoctoral Researcher at the United States Studies Centre of the University of Sydney. In 2012, she joined the faculty at The University of Miami, and in 2015 she joined The Miller Center of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia. She subsequently moved to the Interdisciplinary Center for Innovative Theory and Empirics at Columbia University, becoming a scholar with the Obama Presidency Oral History Project there. ==Research== In 2016, Hemmer published the book Messengers of the Right: Conservative media and the transformation of American politics, which arose from her PhD dissertation. The book traces the development of right-wing media in the United States from its origins in 1940s and 1950s periodicals like Human Events and National Review, and radio programs like Clarence Manion's Forum of Opinion, through to contemporary conservative media like The Rush Limbaugh Show and Fox News. Messengers of the Right is primarily structured around three figures: the mid- century right wing media broadcaster Clarence Manion, the publisher Henry Regnery, and the columnist William A. Rusher; Hemmer was credited with writing the first detailed treatment of Manion, and one of the first on Regnery. The development of this media landscape is situated in the context of conflicts within the Republican Party. In particular, conservative media and conservative politicians did not always have a close relationship in America, and Messengers of the right is concerned with the development of that relationship to the point that media figures like Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly, and Sean Hannity can often be understood as acting collaboratively with politicians like Ronald Reagan, Newt Gingrich, and Donald Trump. By studying the development of right-wing media from the promoters of the original America First movement and the supporters of Barry Goldwater through to conventional right-wing media outlets in contemporary America, Hemmer's work contextualized the ascent of far-right nationalist media figures like Steve Bannon and the outlet Breitbart News around the time of the 2016 United States presidential election. Hemmer also studies the relationship of these media outlets to the truth, demonstrating that some early right-wing outlets were openly motivated by a belief that objectivity is not possible in political news media, and that therefore ideologically driven media is justified in explicitly pursuing partisan electoral goals. Hemmer's research on conservative media and its role in electoral politics has been reviewed or cited in news outlets like NPR, Vox, Politico, and The Washington Times. ==Public communication== Hemmer has been a regular host of several podcast series. Since 2015, Hemmer has hosted the weekly podcast Past Present with the historians Natalia Mehlman Petrzela and Neil J. Young, which discusses recent American political events in the context of American political history. In 2020, she launched the Radiotopia podcast This Day in Esoteric Political History together with Jody Avirgan, who is the former host of the FiveThirtyEight elections podcast. Each episode of This Day in Esoteric Political History describes an event that happened on the same day of the year as that episode, focusing on events that might inform the current moment. Hemmer also created a 6-part podcast called A12, which focused on the Unite the Right rally and its historical context. Hemmer has also been a regular history contributor to print media outlets. She co-founded the Made By History series at The Washington Post, and served as one of two editors-in-chief of the series. From 2013 to 2018, she wrote a weekly column for the US News & World Report, Since 2014, she has been a syndicated columnist at The Age. ==Selected works== *Past Present podcast (2015‚Äì) *Messengers of the Right: Conservative media and the transformation of American politics (2016) *This Day in Esoteric Political History podcast (2020‚Äì) ==References== Category:American women social scientists Category:21st-century American women writers Category:Living people Category:21st-century American historians Category:Historians from Indiana Category:Historians of the United States Category:Columbia University alumni Category:Marian University (Indiana) alumni Category:University of Miami faculty Category:University of Virginia faculty Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Nicole Hemmer"},{"id":"63847133","text":"Ke Huibing (, 5 February 1979 ‚Äì 19 February 2020) was a Chinese management scientist, professor and doctoral advisor at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology. ==Career== Ke was educated at Law School of Hubei University, majoring in law, where he graduated in June 2002 and obtained a bachelor's degree.

The Culwick Choral Society is both named in honour of Culwick and traces its lineage to the Orpheus Choir. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Culwick was born in West Bromwich, Staffordshire. At the age of fourteen he became a chorister in Lichfield Cathedral where his father, also a musician, was a lay clerk. He took lessons from the then Cathedral organist, Thomas Bedsmore, and was later appointed assistant organist. He subsequently took the role of church organist at the Church of St Chad, Lichfield. ===Ireland=== Culwick relocated to Ireland in 1866, filling the position of organist at Parsonstown, King's County, before moving to Bray Parish Church in 1870 and then St Ann's Church, Dawson Street in 1871. In 1881 he was appointed as organist to the Chapel Royal at Dublin Castle. A 1907 Irish Times obituary states that he made a 'high reputation' as a teacher at an early stage in his career. Culwick founded a private society, known as 'Harmonie' which attracted amateur singers and musicians, and subsequently founded the Orpheus Choir. He was involved in the establishment of the Feis Ceoil, and from 1913 the Culwick Cup was awarded in his honour in the choral competitions. With Sir Robert Prescott Stewart, he helped establish a branch of the Incorporated Society of Musicians in Dublin. ===Marriage and children=== Culwick was married twice, first to Alice Mary Harrison of Lichfield (died 1875), then to Mary Richardson, 'a daughter of the late Dr Benjamin Richardson of Dublin'.

He can, for most purposes, be considered to have been a member of the Radical Party (\\"Partito Radicale storico\\"). During an unusually lengthy parliamentary career, he served as a member of the Chamber of Deputies (\\"Camera dei deputati\\"), between 1882 and 1913, and then - some thought in defiance of his own his anti-Monarchist principals - accepted nomination by the king as a senator in 1919, serving in the senate till his death in 1934. == Biography == === Provenance and early years === Ludovico Fulci was born in Santa Lucia del Mela, a small municipality located in the hills to the west of the provincial capital, Messina. He was the son of Antonio Fulci by his marriage to Nicolina Taccone, who was also of aristocratic provenance. The Fulci of Santa Lucia del Mela were a family from the minor nobility, originally from Tropea. They had moved from Calabria to Sicily during the sixteenth century. Ludovico's father, Antonio Fulci, was a lawyer who also held a teaching chair in Civil law at the University of Messina. Ludovico was a family name which he shared both with his uncle and with his grandfather. === Young lawyer === Ludovico graduated with a degree in law from the University of Messina and in 1873 launched himself as a criminal lawyer. He also sustained an academic interest in the law, evidenced by the publication in 1879 of his brief but challenging volume \\"Di alcuni problemi giuridici fondamentali\\" (loosely, \\"On some fundamental legal problems\\"). The book is concerned less with his professional speciality - criminal law - and more with the underlying philosophy of civil law. Themes tackled include the nature of the state, the very concept of law and the complex interaction between law and morality. He obtained a professorship in criminal law at the university in 1891. === Deputy === Meanwhile, on 29 October 1882 the electoral college for Messina elected him to membership of the Chamber of Deputies (\\"Camera dei deputati\\"), the elected lower house of the Italian parliament. He was re-elected at no fewer than nine subsequent general elections, the last of them being that of 18 July 1909. Political parties within the parliament during this period were still relatively loose groupings, but Ludovico Fulci is normally classified in sources as a Radical Party member. In 1908 he voted for the contentious Bissolati motion which sought to outlaw religious education in primary schools.Aldo A. Mola,Storia della Massoneria in Italia, Bompiani/Giunti, Firenze-Milano, 2018, p. 342. Fulci combined his university teaching and his national political duties with membership of the Provincial Council for Messina, of which he became vice- president. and, eventually, president. One project in which he was closely involved during this period involved a new aqueduct constructed for Messina. A college of arbitration was created to settle some of the disputes arising from the project, in which Fulci appeared as the lawyer representing the municipality. His success in winning a major dispute on behalf of the municipal authorities significantly accelerated the aqueduct's completion. Fulci's advocacy skills were also on display when he teamed up with fellow- lawyer Francesco Crispi to head up the defence team for the posthumous retrial as to facts held at the assize court in Rome, following the execution in Trieste of Guglielmo Oberdan. Trieste at this time was still an Austrian city subjugated, according to Italian nationalists, to a form of illegitimate military occupation. Oberdan's alleged crime was that he had plotted to assassinate the Austrian emperor. His last words were \\"viva Italia!\\" and he accordingly rapidly acquired martyr status among patriotic Italians. Fulci may not have shared Crispi's (late-flowering) monarchist sentiments, but he was just as much of an Italian patriot. Following the 1887 cholera epidemic, Fulci founded \\"The Golden Cross\\" (\\"La croce d'oro\\"), a large-scale public assistance organisation. Recognition followed in the form of a Silver Medal of Public Health and Welfare. He was part of the parliamentary sub-committee that produced the final draft of the new 1887 Criminal Procedure Code. This involved him in heated disagreements of principal over whether the opportunity should be taken to insert in the new code a right for judges to order the hospitalisation of accused parties following a \\"not guilty\\" verdict based on mental incapacity. The provision was retained in articvle 46 of the code, but triggered on-going disputes between those adhering rigidly to a belief that a judge's role in a criminal trial should cease at the point of determinable of guilt or innocence, and others who considered the new provision indispensable, basing their arguments on new positivist theories of a \\"social defence\\". Fulci's arguments reveal a delight in the legal and moral complexities involved, but he was not in favour of extedning the role of the judge in a criminal trial beyond point at which guilt or innocence are to be determined. === Legal scholarship === Fulci's monograph \\"L'evoluzione del diritto penale. La forza irresistibile\\" (loosely, \\"The evolution of criminal law. The irresistible force\\") appeared in 1891 and was still in print 90 years later. It was considered an important contribution to legal doctrine, notably by Cesare Lombroso and by Francesco Carrara who wrote a warmly appreciative critique of it shortly before his death. === Rosa Guerrera === By the time of the 1913 general election Fulci was 63, which may be one reason why he withdrew from politics, not standing for election. 1913 was also the year in which he married Rosa Guerrera. === Senator === He nevertheless accepted nomination as a senator on 6 October 1919. The nomination came automatically according to various sets of criteria. In Fulci's case it was because he had retired after serving as an elected member of the Chamber of Deputies during three parliaments, and been a deputy for more than six years. Either criterion would have secured an invitation to join the senate, but it would still have been open to Fulci to reject the offer which, formally, came from the king. His admission to the senate followed on 9 December 1919. He was formally sworn in on 27 December 1919. === Death and celebration === Ludovico Fulci died at Messina on 28 June 1934. When parliament reconvened towards the end of the year he was one of three recently deceased long-serving former deputies who had subsequently become senators to be honoured with a tribute delivered by Luigi Federzoni, the President of the Senate, in an address to the chamber following the opening of the session at 16.00 on 3 December 1934. Federzoni recalled in particular the energy and prescience (...\\"il fervore e chiaroveggenza\\") which Fulci had displayed in the aftermath of the earthquake which devastated Messina in 1908, along with his unstinting contributions to the arguments and disputes on the legal and financial aspects of the massive reconstruction necessary. There were nevertheless persistent rumours that Senator Fulci died because he was poisoned on account of his known hostility to Fascism. His advocacy of secularism did not sit well with the statism advocated by the Fascists. Ever since the murder in 1924 of Matteotti, it had been clear to everyone that for a politician to voice criticism of the Fascists was, in terms of personal safety, unwise. == Personal == Ludovico Fulci's marriage to Rosa Guerrera, which took place in 1913, was followed by the births of the couple's three sons, Nicola, Alfredo and Francesco. Ludovico Fulci's younger brother, Nicol√≤ Fulci (1857 - 1908), also achieved distinction as a lawyer and politician. He served as a deputy (elected member of parliament) between 1892 and 1908, and as a junior government minister between 1901 and 1903. Nicol√≤ Fulci died in the earthquake. Freemasonry provides important context for Ludovico Fulci's life, and for the anti-clerical secularism underpinning his Radical Party politics. In 1880 he joined the Adonhiram Lodge in Messina. He was also a member of Messina's \\"Mazzini & Garibaldi\\" Lodge, installed as Grand Master of it between 1884 and 1888. On 9 April 1919 the Messina \\"Liberty Lodge\\" accepted him for membership of the Grand Orient of Italy, appointing him an Honorary Grand Master, at a ceremony attended by more than 200.Vittorio Gnocchini, L'Italia dei Liberi Muratori, Erasmo ed., Roma, 2005, p. 132 == Awards and honours == ==Notes== ==References== Category:19th-century Italian politicians Category:20th-century Italian politicians Category:19th-century Italian lawyers Category:University of Messina faculty Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies (Kingdom of Italy) Category:Members of the Senate of the Kingdom of Italy Category:1849 births Category:1934 deaths Category:People from Messina Category:People from Sicily ","title":"Ludovico Fulci"},{"id":"63847440","text":"Al-Daylami or al-Dailami () is a nisba indicating a Dailamite or a person from Daylam.

Niketas was a disciple of Arethas of Caesarea. When Arethas, under pressure from Pope Nicholas I, moved to support the tetragamy of the Emperor Leo VI, Niketas distributed all his master's goods to the poor and fled to Thrace. He was arrested and imprisoned in Constantinople. The Patriarch Euthymios I secured his release, but forced him to live in seclusion for two years. Niketas was a prolific author on Christian topics. He wrote about fifty hagiographies, a treatise on calculating the end times, a commentary on the Psalms and many other works, including possibly pamphlets against Leo VI and Euthymios. In his commentary, he provides a moral exhortation for every psalm, which was an innovation at the time. He also evinces a strong dislike of musical instruments. His hagiography of Ignatios of Constantinople functions as a tract against Photios. His biography of Gregory of Agrigento was highly esteemed by Symeon the Metaphrast, who included it in his synaxarium. He was accused of heresy for proclaiming himself God, although this probably means only that he emphasised the divine nature in man. ==Notes== ==References== Category:9th-century Byzantine writers Category:10th-century Byzantine writers Category:Christian hagiographers Category:Bible commentators ","title":"Niketas David Paphlagon"},{"id":"63847534","text":"Don Ellersick (May 7, 1938 ‚Äì June 13, 1996) was an American football defensive back.

Researched and discussed across a wide variety of mediums; the identity usually interesects with, and is driven by, black African and Afro-Caribbean heritage, and association with African diaspora and culture. ==Background== A emergent black British identity has been acknowledged and researched in a diverse range of forms, in scholarly or journalistic publications, and works of media. Writing within the diasporic context of both African and Afro- Caribbean heritage, academic Eddie Chambers has suggested that the identity evolved across decades, after the mid-century arrival of British subjects from former colonies: > How did a distinct and powerful Black British identity emerge? In the 1950s, > when many Caribbean migrants came to Britain, there was no such recognised > entity as 'Black Britain'; Yet by the 1980s, the cultural landscape had > radically changed, and a remarkable array of creative practices such as > theatre, poetry, literature, music and the visual arts gave voice to > striking new articulations of Black-British identity. An analysis with ethnogenesistic similarities from historian Kobena Mercer, who has proposed that black Britons manifested their own identity in the 1980s through activism and self-realisation, has examined that conscious nature of the identity in the United Kingdom, and suggesting that the group's black identity \\"showed that identities are not found but made; that they are not just there, waiting to be discovered in a vocabulary of Nature, but that they have to be culturally and politically constructed through political antagonism and cultural struggle\\". Black British literature has been analyzed as one of the major contributions towards the emerging identity. In the 21st-century, novelists Diana Evans and Helen Oyeyemi's impact on black British identity has been explored in scholarly research. Dr Charlotte Beyer has studied the concept in Andrea Levy's and Joan Riley's works. The authors, both of Jamaican ancestry, have been described as two of the many authors that have been instrumental in the literary expression of identity for black Britons. ==History== Referring to the forging of a new ethnic group and its consciousness, sociologist Stuart Hall wrote in 1997 \\"that something as distinctive as a new ethnicity, a new Black British identity is emerging\\". In 2005, anthropologist Raymond Codrington wrote how, in certain contexts, black British identity suffered from comparison with a longer-established \\"black American-ness\\" in the United States. In 2011, the BBC published an article examing the impacts of the New Cross house fire, and whether the 1981 incident, which killed a number of black Britons, contributed to the advanced development of black British identity. In 2016, historian David Olusoga presented Black and British: A Forgotten History. The four-part BBC series explored how ongoing racialised events, such as the 1981 Toxteth riots, helped to shape the identity. In 2019, Huck magazine featured British drama film The Last Tree, discussing the plot - a Nigerian British foster child growing up in Britain - and its intersection the group identity. In October 2019, the UK Ministry of Justice published a blog-piece from an MoJ Civil Service employee, describing her black British identity. A first for a UK Government department, the article was timed for Black History Month. Jamaican-born photographer Armet Francis was listed, in a 2019 Museum of London curation, as making a significant contribution to the group's burgeoning identity in the mid-to-late 20th century. In 2020, writer Bernardine Evaristo spoke with CBC Radio regarding the emergence of the black British culture and identities, particularly in the 1990s. ==Academic research== A 2008 study, conducted at Florida International University, used a series of questions, which were asked of black British children in London-based secondary schools, in order to measure perceptions of the concept. The interviewees (eighteen individual students aged 11‚Äì17) and their responses, were used to indicate associations with, primarily, black British identity, as well as notions and beliefs regarding African diaspora. Diasporic factors have been examined as an important aspect of the development of the identity, such as in the works of historian Eddie Chambers, and in relation to both African and African Caribbean ancestry. ==References== Category:Black British people Category:African diaspora in the United Kingdom Category:Black British culture Category:Black British history ","title":"Black British identity"},{"id":"63847622","text":"Herbert Norman Houck (April 2, 1915 ‚Äì February 24, 2002) was a highly decorated United States Navy pilot with the rank of captain. During World War II, he became a flying ace with six aerial victories and was awarded three Navy Crosses. == Early life and service == Herbert N. Houck was born on April 2, 1915, in Corona, Minnesota. After graduating from high school, he attended the University of Minnesota for three years. Houck went into the Navy in 1936 and was designated as a Naval Aviator. == World War II == When the United States became involved in World War II, Houck was assigned to Fighting Squadron 9 (VF-9). On June 30, 1943, Lieutenant Houck was flying an F6F Hellcat over Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, when he was involved in a mid-air collision with another Hellcat pilot. Houck successfully bailed out while the other pilot was killed. In September 1943, VF-9 embarked on the USS Essex and left Pearl Harbor to partake in combat operations in the Pacific Theater. On November 11, 1943, Lieutenant Commander Houck, who was now the executive officer of the squadron, led other pilots in a preliminary attack at Rabaul Harbor, New Britain, strafing Japanese shore batteries and ships while under heavy anti-aircraft fire. Later that day, he shot down three Japanese aircraft and assisted in shooting down two others which were attacking friendly ships. For his actions that day, Houck was awarded his first Navy Cross. === Operation Hailstone === Lieutenant Commander Houck would be awarded his second Navy Cross for his actions on February 16, 1944. In the early morning hours of that date, he led his squadron in the first attack against Japanese-held Truk Atoll, Carolina Islands. VF-9 made repeated strafing attacks on parked enemy planes on the Param airfield and at the Moen seaplane base. Houck personally accounted for six of the 27 planes destroyed despite heavy anti-aircraft fire. Additionally, his squadron shot down 21 fighter planes which were attempting to intercept them, with Houck claiming two of these planes, attaining ace status. Later on that same day, Houck led a fighter group which escorted dive bombers and torpedo bombers to Truk Atoll. Houck's fighters attracted the majority of the anti-aircraft fire by strafing enemy ships and the airfield at Eten Island prior to the bombing attack. === Battle of Okinawa === On April 1, 1945, American troops invaded Okinawa. VF-9, now attached to the USS Yorktown, helped provide Naval air support during the operation. On April 6, the largest battleship ever built, the Yamato, left its home port at Kure, Japan, sailing towards Okinawa. The Yamato was travelling with nine other ships, however they had no air support and lacked sufficient fuel to return to mainland Japan once they reached Okinawa. The ships were essentially on a suicide mission. On April 7, the ships were spotted and attacked by several waves of American aircraft in the East China Sea off Kyushu. Lieutenant Commander Houck led over 40 torpedo bombers towards the enemy convoy through inclement weather, during which his plane experienced a partial engine failure and he was almost forced to turn back. Upon reaching the enemy ships, Houck's squadron attacked numerous ships under heavy anti-aircraft fire. He led several planes in an attack on the Yamato, striking the battleship with several torpedoes. The Yamato capsized shortly afterwards and exploded, killing more than 2,500 crew members. Houck took several photographs with his wing camera and his squadron also sunk the cruiser Yahagi, essentially marking the end of the Imperial Japanese Navy. Houck was awarded his third and final Navy Cross for his actions. == Later career and life == Houck stayed in the Navy after the war and served in the Korean War before he was promoted to captain in 1956. He served as the commanding officer of the USS Shangri-La from 1960 to 1961. Also serving during the Vietnam War, Captain Houck ultimately retired in 1968. Herbert N.

The original version, called simply Dutch Crossing, was choreographed in the English country dance style, by Ernst van Brakel of the Netherlands in 1990. In 2004, contra dance caller Joseph Pimentel modified the choreography in the American style, sometimes called Yankee Dutch crossing to distinguish it from the original. Any number of squares can perform the dance simultaneously. It is not normally found at monthly, bi-monthly, or weekly dances. The most likely venues are multi-day dance weekends, or weeks, where it is taught in sessions of one hour or longer. ==Description== Four large signs, each with a red and a black numeral are shown. During a teaching session of the dance Dutch Crossing, they are displayed on the four sides of a room, and referred to as \\"wall numbers\\" or \\"orientations\\". Half of the dancers will use the black numbers, and half will use the red numbers. So when the dance instructor announces \\"Face wall number 3\\" (for example), the dancers will be facing each other in opposite directions. The square of 16 dancers comprises 4 pairs of couples, facing each other, in the corners of the square. These pairs of \\"neighbors\\" will remain together throughout the dance, except for temporary departures and returns... always to the original corner of the square. The dance has four major parts, which are all identical, except for the orientation of the paired couples, which changes by 90¬∞ from one part to the next. Each major part has two minor parts. In the first minor part, the four neighbors interact with either of the two adjacent corner foursomes, which alternates from one orientation to the next. In the second minor part, the diagonally opposite members of each foursome interact only with the similarly-positioned members of the other foursomes. Effectively, the square can be described as two \\"teams\\" of eight, doing very different things in the same shared space. Each team also divides into 2 groups of four. Four members of the \\"X team\\" traverse one of the diagonals of the square (from which the name Dutch Crossing derives), across and back. The other four members traverse the other diagonal. The groups interact with each other in the middle and with members of the \\"O team\\" at the corners. Simultaneously, eight members of the \\"O team\\" perform a grand right and left around the circumference of the square. The role of each dancer alternates between \\"X team\\" and \\"O team\\" as the major parts cycle through the four orientations. Understandably, it is not uncommon for a square to disintegrate before all four major parts are completed. But that is part of the dance's appeal. == See also == * A step-by-step choreography can be found at 6+ Couple dances == Notes == ==References== # * # == External links == * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m8jPFEvteY * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiARGRpYnH8 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL1ulnHEuNY * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_ZljboRHbs Category:Country dance Category:Contra dance Category:Folk dance Category:Social dance ","title":"Yankee Dutch crossing"},{"id":"63847959","text":"Durosinmi is a surname.

The war came as a result of Croatian, Slavonian and Hungarian noble diets electing different candidates for their kings, following the death of Louis II of Hungary at Battle of Mohacs. == Background == Following the death of Louis II at the Battle of Mohacs, Croatian nobles gathered at Cetingrad in early 1527 in order to discuss the election of new king. Their choice was the powerful Ferdinand I of Habsburg, whom Croats wanted to get more thoroughly engaged in their defensive efforts against expanding Ottoman Empire. In another part of the Kingdom, Hungarian nobles elected their own candidate ‚Äì John Zapolya at their own noble diet in Szekesfehervar in late 1526. The same candidate was also elected on Slavonian noble diet, which happened in Dubrava, near ƒåazma, Croatia, under the influence of Simon Erdody, the bishop of Zagreb and count Cristoph Frankopan, the only Croatian noble who didn't attended the Cetingrad diet. This effectively brought a kingdom into state of civil war between supporters of who opposing kings. === Ferdinand's campaign in Hungary === Ferdinand launched his campaign from Vienna as his 20,000 strong army marched into Hungary. Habsburg commanders soon successfully captured the towns of Gyor, Kom√°rom, Esztergom, Visegr√°d and Buda, while Zapolya's forces retreated towards river Tisza. They were nevertheless intercepted by Habsburg forces near Tarcal in Hungary, where Habsburg general Nicholas, Count of Salm decisevly defeated them in Battle of Tarcal. John Zapolja therefore invited his supporter, ban Cristoph Frankapan, to come to his aid. == Siege of Vara≈ædin == Frankopan assembled his 13,000 strong army near Kri≈æevci, which according to Croatian historian Rudolf Horvat consisted of 10,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry. In the morning of September 24, Frankopan's army was approached by apparent emissaries from Vara≈ædin, who declared their allegiance to him and handed him the town keys, however, once he actually came to Vara≈ædin the town garrison turned out to he pro-Habsburg. Frankapan's commanders then ordered their troops to start digging trenches around town and prepare their siege engines. As he was scouting for weakpoints in town walls, some defending cannon opened fire and one of the missiles gravely wounded Frankapan. The wound was apparently so bad that his guts could be seen hence his doctors gave up all efforts of even trying to save him. Dying Frankapan issued orders to carry on with the siege, however majority army he assembled began dispersing irretrievably. A handful of soldiers that remained by him, started carrying him to Koprivnica, however he succumbed to his wounds upon reaching Martijanec. His death was a major blow for Zapolya's side, as they lost a powerful supporter in Croatia. == Sources == Category:Military history of Croatia Category:Battles involving Croatia Category:Sieges involving Croatia Category:1527 in Europe Category:Conflicts in 1527 ","title":"Siege of Vara≈ædin (1527)"},{"id":"63848034","text":"Slade Cecconi (born June 24, 1999) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Arizona Diamondbacks organization.

The employees that an employee trust benefits are usually defined by reference to employment by a particular company (or group of companies). In addition to employees, the beneficiaries may, under the terms of the trust, include some or all of former employees (of the relevant company or group) and individuals defined by reference to their marriage to, civil partnership with or dependence on such an employee (or former employee).See, for example, the UK definition of a trust for the benefit of employees in section 86 Inheritance Tax Act 1984 or the definition of an \\"employees' share scheme\\" in section 1166 Companies Act 2006. Charities may also be included in the class of beneficiaries. An employee trust is typically established by the relevant employing company (or a company in the employing group) entering into a trust deed (or other trust instrument) which sets out the terms of the trust, including who is to act as its trustee. An employee trust could also be established by an individual, for example a shareholder in the relevant company, including by their Will. The choice of who is the trustee of the trust and the type of property subject to the trust will vary depending on the purpose of the employee trust. Many employee trusts are discretionary trusts, where the trustee has discretion to select which beneficiaries benefit, when and how. It is possible that beneficiaries have fixed or absolute interests, for example, where shares awarded to employees under an employee share ownership plan remain held in an employee trust.For example, shares kept in a UK share incentive plan trust by a participant until sold have a special capital gains tax advantage. HM Revenue & Customs Employee Tax Advantaged Share Scheme User Manual ETASSUM29050 Government policy and tax rules in the United Kingdom, the United States and elsewhere encourage the use of employee trusts to support employee share ownership or employee ownership. Although, Government policy and tax rules may also counteract certain uses of employee trusts, for example, when they are used avoid the payment of tax on remuneration. == Purposes == Employee trusts exist for many purposes and have a wide range of titles. If the terms of the trust meet requirements prescribed by tax or other regulations, then the employee trust is likely to be known by the name given in the relevant regulations, for example, a share incentive plan or an employee stock ownership plan. If the purpose of an employee trust is to provide pensions or other retirement related benefits it is likely to be referred to as a pension plan or retirement benefits scheme, rather than an employee trust. The term employee trust (or, in the UK, employee benefit trust) is most likely to be used to describe a trust, where the trustee has wide-ranging powers, to be used at its discretion. Such a general employee trust may, nevertheless, in practice be intended to achieve a particular purpose and be named accordingly.HM Revenue & Customs Trusts, Settlements and Estates Manual TSEM5025 For example: * a discretionary bonus trust or remuneration trust, which provides cash payments to beneficiaries; * a staff benevolent fund, which provides sick pay or meets medical expenses; * an educational trust, which provides funding for the education of employees' children; * an employee share trust, which holds shares in order to facilitate employee share ownership in a company. Shares may be warehoused in an employee trust until allocated to participants under an employee share or share option plan. Depending on the type of plan, once allocated, shares may then be held by the trustee on behalf of individual employees. In a private company, the trustee may provide a marketplace for employees to buy and sell shares acquired under a share or share option plan; and * an employee ownership trust, which holds shares on behalf of employees on a long term basis in order to achieve and support employee ownership of a company. == Influence of tax rules == The extent to which particular types of employee trust are used in a country at any time can be significantly influenced by prevailing tax rules or other regulations, especially in relation to taxing the direct or indirect payment of remuneration, including policies on what is considered unacceptable tax avoidance. === Counteracting schemes to avoid tax on remuneration === In the UK the use of employee benefit trusts to provide loans to employees (or anything that is a reward or recognition, in connection with an employee's employment) was, in particular, curtailed by anti-avoidance legislation introduced with effect from 9 December 2010. This legislation imposed an immediate charge to income tax on the full value of such loans (or other benefits) provided from that date.HM Revenue & Customs Employment Income manual EIM4500 These new tax rules are referred to as the disguised remuneration rules. === Encouraging employee share ownership and employee ownership === The UK Government supports the use of employee benefit trusts as part of genuine arrangements to create employee share ownership or employee ownership. It has over the years provided tax advantages for specific types of employee trust, including: * the qualifying employee share ownership trust (or QUEST): From 1989 to accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2003 a company contributing funds to a QUEST could get a tax deduction as a statutory right for its contribution without having to rely on making a claim based on general case law principles. * the HM Revenue & Customs approved profit sharing scheme (or profit sharing trust): From 1978 until 2002 employees under this scheme received a special tax treatment for share awards, but this was phased out following the introduction of the share incentive plan. No new profit sharing schemes were approved after 5 April 2001. Awards under existing schemes ceased on 31 December 2002, although employees could continue to hold tax-advantaged shares from past appropriations. Current arrangements supported by the UK Government to promote employee share ownership and employee ownership using trusts with special tax advantages include: * the share incentive plan, and * the employee ownership trust == References == == External links == * Employee trust fund on Investopedia ","title":"Employee trust"},{"id":"63848166","text":"Eva Mottet (3 June 1994 ‚Äì 29 April 2020) was a French road racing cyclist. ==Personal== Mottet was born in the French department Haute Savoie.

He is credited with saving many student lives after the Kent State shootings of 1970. == Life== Frank was born in Mayfield Heights, Ohio to Harold and Gertrude Frank, both schoolteachers. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps, from 1946 to 1947. As an undergraduate on the G.I. Bill he studied geology at Kent State University, going on to postgraduate study at the University of Maine and Western Reserve University. From 1953 to his retirement in 1984 Frank was a geology professor at Kent State University. Frank married Betty Louise Dahlgren in 1949 and had three children. He died of cancer in 1993. A scholarship was established in his honor at Kent State. == Kent State shootings == On May 4, 1970, four unarmed students were shot dead at Kent State by the U.S. National Guard, during a peace rally against the expansion of the Vietnam War into neutral Cambodia by the United States. There had been repeated protests against police and military recruiting on campus, and the Reserve Officers' Training Corps building was burned down on May 2. The mayor of Kent called in the Ohio Army National Guard, which attempted to disperse students on May 4. Frank was a faculty marshal at the student protest on that day. He managed to persuade students to disperse after the National Guard had fired on the crowd. Immediately after the shootings, many angry students were ready to launch an all-out attack on the National Guard. Faculty members led by Frank pleaded with the students to leave the campus Commons and not to give in to violent escalation: > I don't care whether you've never listened to anyone before in your lives. I > am begging you right now. If you don't disperse right now, they're going to > move in, and it can only be a slaughter. Would you please listen to me? > Jesus Christ, I don't want to be a part of this ... ! After 20 minutes of speaking, the students left the Commons, as ambulance personnel tended to the wounded, and the Guard left the area. Professor Frank's son, also present that day, said, \\"He absolutely saved my life and hundreds of others\\". Frank later wrote an information brochure about the incident. He criticized both the shootings and the work of a grand jury that investigated the events on Kent State's campus, and was cited for contempt of court for defying an order not to talk about the investigation after testifying before the grand jury. == References == == External links == * Website about Frank and his role in the events of May 4, 1970 category:1928 births category:1993 deaths ","title":"Glenn W.

He is the head coach at Swarthmore. ==Playing career== Growing up, Kosmalski studied books on the Boston Celtics under coach Red Auerbach, and was impressed that the team only used seven plays. Kosmalski attended Trinity in Euless, Texas, where he was a Texas Sports Writers Association All-State First Team honoree as a senior. Kosmalski was also named Northeast Tarrant County Co-Player of the Year alongside teammate Dylan Osean. Kosmalski averaged 20 points and 13 rebounds per game during his senior season, and he had 34 points and 26 rebounds in two playoff games. He played in college at Davidson under Bob McKillop from 1996 to 2000. Kosmalski was named the Southern Conference Freshman of the Year in 1997. As a sophomore, he helped lead the team to the NCAA Tournament but was slowed by tendonitis. He was named to the All-Southern Conference First Team in 1999 and 2000. Kosmalski averaged 13.9 points and 8.6 rebounds per game during his junior season. As a senior, Kosmalski was ranked the 18th best small forward by one publication, and had 17 points and 11 rebounds against Wake Forest. Kosmalski finished his Davidson career 4th all-time in rebounding (877), 17th in scoring (1,438), and 12th in steals (121), and in 2014 he was inducted into the Davidson Athletic Hall of Fame. Between 2000 and 2004, he played professionally in Sweden and France. ==Coaching career== Kosmalski began his coaching career in 2004 as an assistant at Davidson under Bob McKillop. Kosmalski helped lead the Wildcats to the NCAA Tournament in 2006 as well as a Southern Conference championship. He said that he met Stephen Curry at a summer camp and watched him in high school but was not actively involved in his recruiting to Davidson. In the 2006‚Äì07 season, he left to become the head coach of the 08 Stockholm Human Rights developmental team and assistant coach of the senior team. Kosmalski accepted a job as head basketball coach and dean of students at The Webb School in Bell Buckle, Tennessee. He was responsible for maintaining discipline and improved the team's win record by nine games in his second season. In 2009, Kosmalski returned to Davidson as an assistant after Matt Matheny left to become the head coach at Elon. Responsible for developing big men, he helped De'Mon Brooks and Jake Cohen be named the 2012 Southern Conference player of the year by the coaches and media, respectively. Kosmalski helped Davidson win the Southern Conference and reach the NCAA Tournament in 2012, and he helped the Wildcats achieve an overall record of 102‚Äì58 in his two stints there. In May 2012, Kosmalski was named head basketball coach at Swarthmore College. When he arrived, Kosmalski envisioned Swarthmore, which had not won a conference title since 1951, becoming one of the best Division III programs and sent letters to this effect to recruits. He inherited a 3-22 team, and he briefly benched the program's leading scorer after he arrived. In Koswalski's first season, the Garnet won seven games, eight games in his second and 11 games in his third. Before the 2015‚Äì16 season, Koswalski recruited Swarthmore's first All-American, Cam Wiley, and the program showed immediate improvement, winning 22 games. The Garnet finished second in their conference and broke an 18-year streak of losing records. He earned his first Centennial Conference Coach of the Year honors. The following year, they had 23 wins and won the conference championship, reaching the second round of its first NCAA tournament. They won 25 games and reached a regional final in 2017‚Äì18, finishing as one of the top defensive teams. In the 2018‚Äì19 season the Garnet reached the title game, where they lost to Wisconsin‚ÄìOshkosh. After listening to a TED talk by Shawn Achor, author of ‚ÄúThe Happiness Advantage‚Äù, Kosmalski decided to apply his principles of positivity leading to a more productive work environment. In the 2019‚Äì20 season, the team was ranked preseason No. 1 by d3hoops.com. Swarthmore began the season 26-0 before losing to eighth-ranked Johns Hopkins in the Centennial Conference championship game. The team's leading scorer and rebounder was Zac O‚ÄôDell, who published an article in the journal Environmental Science & Technology entitled ‚ÄúIn Situ Quantification of Silver Nanoparticle Dissolution Kinetics in Simulated Sweat Using Linear Sweep Stripping Voltammetry.‚Äù The team finished the season 28-1 after the remainder of the NCAA Tournament was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. Kosmalski was named the NCAA Division III National Coach of the Year, which he called a \\"team honor\\". ==Personal life== Kosmalski is the son of Len Kosmalski, who played collegiately at Tennessee, then played professionally with the NBA's Chicago Bulls and Kansas City Kings as well as in Europe. Landry's younger brother Logan played collegiately at Baylor for two years before transferring to Davidson. Kosmalski's wife Lauren Santi was a former cheerleader at the University of Alabama and also worked in Davidson's office of sports information. They have three children, Lincoln, Bexley, and Larkin, and live in Swarthmore. ==Head coaching record== ==References== ==External links== *SportsReference stats Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:American expatriate basketball people in France Category:American expatriate basketball people in Sweden Category:American men's basketball coaches Category:American men's basketball players Category:Basketball coaches from Tennessee Category:Basketball players from Tennessee Category:Davidson Wildcats men's basketball coaches Category:Davidson Wildcats men's basketball players Category:High school basketball coaches in Tennessee Category:Sportspeople from Nashville, Tennessee Category:Swarthmore Garnet Tide men's basketball coaches ","title":"Landry Kosmalski"},{"id":"63848355","text":"Leiostracus demerarensis is a species of tropical air-breathing land snail, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusc in the family Simpulopsidae.MolluscaBase eds.

It was a single-member district throughout the ten legislatures of the Insular Government of the Philippine Islands from 1907 to 1935, the three legislatures of the Philippine Commonwealth from 1935 to 1946, and the seven congresses of the Third Philippine Republic from 1946 to 1972. On three occasions in its history, Isabela sent more than one member to the national legislatures who were also elected or appointed at-large. Three representatives were sent to the National Assembly (Malolos Congress) of the First Philippine Republic from 1898 to 1901, two representatives to the National Assembly of the Second Philippine Republic from 1943 to 1944, and three representatives to the national parliament of the Fourth Philippine Republic from 1984 to 1986.

It is a Grade II listed building. ==History== The Municipal Offices section of Stoke Newington Town Hall The building was commissioned to replace the council offices in Milton Grove which had been designed by E. Fry in the Italianate style and completed in 1881. After the area became a metropolitan borough in 1900, civic leaders decided that this arrangement was inadequate for their needs and that they would procure a more substantial town hall: the site chosen had previously been occupied by a 15th-century Manor House and, later, by a row of Georgian houses. The new building was designed by John Reginald Truelove and was completed in 1937. The design involved a symmetrical curved frontage of fifteen bays forming municipal offices built in the Renaissance style to the west; this section, which contained the council chamber, featured a central section which was recessed with a doorway on the ground floor and a balcony and window on the first floor flanked by two huge Doric order columns. This arrangement was complemented by a rectangular assembly hall with four huge Doric order columns flanked by pavilions built in the Classical style to the east. A sprung Canadian maple dance floor installed in the assembly hall allowing it to be used as a dance facility. In the Second World War, the building served as the local civil defence headquarters and was heavily camouflaged to protect it from enemy bombing during the London Blitz. The town hall continued to serve as the headquarters of the Metropolitan Borough of Stoke Newington for much of the 20th century but ceased to be the local seat of government after the formation of the London Borough of Hackney in 1965. The council chamber was subsequently used as a storeroom and the assembly hall was closed, due to its state of disrepair in 1999. The building was extensively refurbished and restored to a design by Hawkins\\\\Brown in 2010: the works, which cost ¬£6.4 million, included comprehensive repairs to the wooden panelling in the council chamber and the modernisation of the assembly hall. The quality of the work was recognised by the Worshipful Company of Carpenters in that year's Wood Awards.

It was released on CD, LP, and as a digital download on April 17, 2020. The CD also includes a DVD video of the band playing several of the songs on the album. For Big Road, musician, singer, and songwriter David Bromberg and his touring band went into the studio and recorded a dozen roots music songs in a variety of styles. Bromberg sings lead vocals and plays acoustic guitar, electric guitar, and mandolin, accompanied on most of the tracks by his band as well as several guest musicians. Like his two previous albums, Big Road was produced by Larry Campbell. == Critical reception == In PopMatters, Steve Horowitz wrote, \\"The album does a good job of mixing things up stylistically while maintaining a consistent vibe. The songs run together without ever sounding repetitive.... Big Road contains elements of old-time country, folk, bluegrass, gospel, blues and more.... Bromberg's singing is infectiously good, but it's his (and his bandmates) playing that makes the disc such a pleasure to hear.\\" In American Songwriter, Lee Zimmerman said, \\"With this latest offering, Big Road, credited, appropriately to the David Bromberg Band, he offers an excellent summation of his stance that spans the depth and breadth of his musical palette...Naturally, the arrangements are immaculate, given the oversight of producer Larry Campbell, although it‚Äôs Bromberg‚Äôs searing fretwork and warbling yet unassuming vocals that underscore the more poignant perspectives.\\" In Elmore Magazine, Iain Patience wrote, \\"Bromberg, a giant of US roots music with a back catalog of countless wonderful releases doesn‚Äôt disappoint with his latest offering... With Big Road, we find Bromberg working with his band, while keeping his guitar picking absolutely central to everything he does.... Overall, this is one of those rare, instant classic albums, faultless in conception and delivery from start to finish. This is Bromberg at his deservedly much-lauded best.\\" In No Depression, Doug Heselgrave said, \\"Since he released his first album in 1971, Bromberg has always embraced a \\"kitchen sink\\" philosophy toward music in which every conceivable style ‚Äì swing, folk, country, rock, bluegrass, and more ‚Äì and permutation of a tune is treated with equal reverence.... More than four decades into his career, he continues to breathe new life into very old songs by approaching them with the attitude that even though traditional music is sacred, it certainly isn't fragile... Big Road is a truly masterful work.\\" In Folk Alley, Henry Carrigan said, \\"Listening to David Bromberg and his band's Big Road is like driving on the open road with the windows down, letting the breezes of various musical styles wash over you.... Multi-instrumentalist Bromberg knows how to have fun playing music, and he gives each of [his] band members a chance to drive the music around. There's a joyous sense of camaraderie on the album that permeates the music... [E]very song on this album astonishes with its musicianship, its musical unity, its palpable spirit of joy and fun and sheer love of music. Big Road is, without a doubt, one of the best albums of the year.\\" In Glide Magazine, Jim Hynes wrote, \\"[Bromberg's] vocals have never sounded better, and this band is as first-rate as it gets. This is truly special; the apex of American music ‚Äì blues, gospel, bluegrass, folk, and country all in one package.... To appreciate the depth and breadth of this band's talent, it's best to listen to the whole recording to enjoy how they seamlessly cross genre boundaries....

Beginning in 1827 his work was regularly selected for exhibition in the annual Paris Salon. He achieved his greatest success as a painter of religious subjects, with his paintings of Christ and various saints installed in churches and public buildings across France. A successful portrait painter, his most prestigious commission was his 1847 portrait of Pope Pius IX. He was the son of self- taught artist Jean-Baptiste Goyet, and husband of the pastel portrait artist Zo√© Goyet. ==Career== Foulques de Villaret, grand ma√Ætre des hospitaliers de Saint-Jean de J√©rusalem de 1307 √† 1327, c. 1841, Salles des Croisades, Palace of Versailles.Having shown an aptitude for drawing, Goyet was sent at the age of eighteen to Paris to receive formal training. Eug√®ne ranked at the top of his class of sixty students at the atelier of Antoine-Jean Gros.Audiffred, Hyacinthe. \\"N√©crologie: Eug√®ne Goyet\\", Revue des Beaux-Arts, tome 8, 1857, pp. 237-8. At some point Goyet's parents also moved to Paris, with the family taking up residence at 3 Rue de l'Abbaye. Father and son were to have a close lifelong relationship, residing at the same address and working in the same studio. They made their debuts at the Paris Salon in the same year, 1827, when Jean-Baptiste was 48 and Eug√®ne was 29. From that point, both Goyets regularly had works selected for exhibition in the Salons, as did Eug√®ne's wife, Zo√©, a portrait artist who specialized in pastels. In 1837, after the Goyets moved to 25 Rue de la Chaus√©e-D'Antin, they set up their studios next door at number 27, where Eug√®ne and Zo√© also taught drawing and painting to female students.Le Charivari, 24 December 1837 p. 7.

A high point of Goyet's career was his trip to Rome in 1847, where he was commissioned to paint Pope Pius IX. The painting was purchased by the state under Napoleon III and installed at the Palais des Tuileries. Goyet's final, unfinished work was Le massacre des Innocents, which was posthumously exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1857 and reviewed by Jules Verne: > M.

In 1859, Zo√© Goyet completed her husband's final commission‚Äîof a painting of Christ at Calvary, for La chapelle Notre- Dame du Calvaire, Garbriac, Averyon, France‚Äîmarking the end of over three decades in which the three Goyets played a prominent role in the world of French art. Zo√© died in 1869. Goyet's imaginary portrait of Foulques de Villaret, displayed since the 1840s in the Salles des Croisades at the Palace of Versailles, is perhaps his best-known work today. Goyet exhibited a portrait of his father at the Salon of 1833, for which he received a medal, and exhibited a self-portrait in 1838.

The visitors Leeds went into the match as strong favourites given the gulf in divisions that separated the two teams; Leeds were leading the Premier League at the time while Cardiff were placed 10th in the Second Division, the third tier and two tiers below their opposition. Leeds entered the FA Cup in the third round, receiving byes in the opening rounds as they participated in the Premier League, while Cardiff had won their first two ties to reach this stage of the competition. The match was played in front of more than 22,000 spectators, the largest attendance for any fixture played at Ninian Park during the season, and was refereed by Andy D'Urso. Cardiff attacked their opponents early on but Leeds took the lead in the 12th minute via a goal from striker Mark Viduka. Cardiff equalised shortly after, when Graham Kavanagh scored direct from a free-kick. Shortly before half-time, Leeds midfielder Alan Smith was controversially sent off by referee D'Urso after clashing with Cardiff's Andy Legg. In the second half, Leeds played more defensively to compensate for Smith's dismissal. With three minutes remaining, Scott Young volleyed the ball into the net from a corner to give Cardiff the lead and the eventual win. The victory was described by Henry Winter as \\"one of the greatest upsets in FA Cup history\\". As the match ended, Cardiff fans launched a pitch invasion that led to confrontations between the two sets of supporters. Police were forced to intervene and pushed the home crowd away from the visiting supporters. Four arrests were made at the game while more were made in the ensuing weeks based on police footage and Cardiff and their fans faced widespread criticism. Club chairman Sam Hammam had altercations with a BBC reporter and Leeds manager David O'Leary in the immediate aftermath of the game. Cardiff were eventually fined ¬£20,000 over the pitch invasion. ==Background== As a Premier League side, Leeds United received byes through the first two rounds of the 2001‚Äì02 FA Cup and entered the competition in the third round. They were drawn against Second Division side Cardiff City. At the time of the match, Leeds were placed first in the Premier League, the top tier of English football, while Cardiff were in 10th position in their division, two tiers below Leeds. Prior to the match, Leeds had lost only twice in league competition during the season and five times in total from 29 matches in all competitions. Leeds had also reached the semi-final of the UEFA Champions League the previous season before being defeated by Spanish side Valencia 3‚Äì0 on aggregate. Leeds had further strengthened their squad with the signing of Robbie Fowler from Liverpool less than two months before the fixture for a fee of around ¬£11 million. The two sides had not met in competitive competition since the 1984‚Äì85 season, during which they recorded a 1‚Äì1 draw and a 2‚Äì1 victory for Cardiff. The gulf in positions between the two sides led Leeds manager David O'Leary to confidently predict that his side \\"will start and end our FA Cup run in Cardiff\\" in reference to the final being held at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. Ahead of the match, Leeds defender Michael Duberry returned to the first team after recovering from a leg injury. This was the first time Duberry had been involved with the side since testifying against teammate Jonathan Woodgate during a much-publicised legal case following an incident in 2000 in which Woodgate and teammate Lee Bowyer were accused of attacking a student outside a nightclub in Leeds. Woodgate had accused Duberry of lying in court and declared the two were \\"no longer friends\\". Woodgate was eventually found guilty of affray three weeks before the match, but was cleared of causing grevious bodily harm, and was ordered to complete 100 hours of community service. Bowyer was cleared of all charges, while Duberry subsequently received death threats over his decision. Cardiff meanwhile had been considerably more erratic in their division. The side had won promotion from the Third Division under manager Alan Cork the previous season and chairman Sam Hammam had invested heavily in the team. Cardiff had broken their transfer record twice in the opening months of the season, first signing midfielder Graham Kavanagh from Stoke City for ¬£1 million before signing striker Peter Thorne from the same side for a further ¬£1.75m. The club had also signed Spencer Prior from Manchester City for ¬£700,000, Neil Alexander from Livingston for ¬£130,000 and Des Hamilton from Newcastle United. This investment had raised expectations of the club's ability to immediately challenge for promotion again, but they entered the match on a four-game winless streak. Cardiff had entered the FA Cup in the first round in November 2001 where they were drawn against non-League opponents Tiverton Town. The match was switched to Cardiff's Ninian Park over safety concerns at Tiverton's Ladysmead ground. Cardiff advanced after securing a 3‚Äì1 victory with goals from Leo Fortune-West, Paul Brayson and Robert Earnshaw. One month later, Cardiff defeated Port Vale 3‚Äì0 in the second round of the competition to reach the third round for the third consecutive season. The draw against Leeds was regarded as a marquee tie for Cardiff and the idea of hosting the fixture at the nearby Millennium Stadium was put forward and the ground was made available if needed by Welsh Rugby Union chairman Glanmor Griffiths. Nevertheless, Hammam declared that promotion from the Second Division remained his priority and that the Leeds match was \\"the least important\\". The Football Association rejected the idea of moving the fixture, insisting \\"there was no compelling reason to move the tie.\\" Hammam had developed a reputation in English football for his eccentric style. He had previously served as chairman of Wimbledon during which time the club became known as the Crazy Gang. After purchasing Cardiff in August 2000, he attracted attention nationwide on several occasions. In his first year with Cardiff, he inserted a clause in the contract of Spencer Prior that required the defender to eat a dish containing sheep testicles. Cork also claimed that Hammam had bolts loosened on fences surrounding the home fan enclosures at Ninian Park so they would make more noise when rattled during a match. In response to O'Leary's comments before the match, Hammam responded by stating that Cardiff was a \\"bigger\\" club than Leeds. Cardiff captain Kavanagh was also confident ahead of the match, predicting weeks before that he knew he was going to score in the game. ===Pre-match=== Cardiff were forced into one change for the match. Dean Gordon had returned to his parent club Middlesbrough at the end of his loan spell. In his place, Cork selected 35-year old Andy Legg. Apart from Gordon, Cork made one further change from the club's previous fixture, a 3‚Äì1 defeat to Bristol City on 29 December 2001. Jason Bowen was dropped to the substitutes bench with Paul Brayson starting in his place. The more attacking Bowen was dropped in order for Brayson to provide more defensive support. Leeds made one change to their matchday squad from their previous fixture, a 3‚Äì0 victory over West Ham United on 1 January, Frazer Richardson replaced Harpal Singh on the bench. Prior to the game, John Charles, who played for both sides during his career, was presented to the crowd and received a standing ovation from fans of both sides. ==Match== ===Summary=== alt=A footballer wearing a grey and black tracksuit. The match kicked off at 16:00 GMT in front of 22,009 spectators, the largest crowd Cardiff had attracted for a home fixture during the season. Cardiff attacked their higher-ranked opponents quickly and Robert Earnshaw made several early attempts to pass his opposite fullback, Ian Harte. Crowd trouble flared early on when Harte walked to the sideline to take a throw-in and was narrowly missed by a bottle thrown from the stands. Ten minutes into the game, Leeds suffered an early injury blow when Rio Ferdinand was forced off with ankle ligament damage following a foul by Cardiff striker Gavin Gordon. Ferdinand was replaced by Michael Duberry who joined Jonathan Woodgate in the centre of Leeds' defence. This was the first time the pair had played together since Duberry had testified against Woodgate in court. One match report commented that the pair \\"barely acknowledged each other\\" during the rest of the game, although the BBC noted that the pair \\"played well together\\". Two minutes later, Cardiff's Spencer Prior hit a misplaced pass that was controlled by Leeds' captain Gary Kelly. He found teammate Mark Viduka who scored from 20 yards. Leeds' lead was short-lived as Cardiff equalised eight minutes later; Alan Smith fouled Andy Legg 22 yards from the Leeds goal. Cardiff's captain, Graham Kavanagh, converted the free-kick to draw his side level, fulfilling his prediction to score in the weeks leading up to the game. Minutes before half-time, Leeds' Smith was sent off after referee Andy D'Urso adjudged that he had elbowed Cardiff defender Legg in the face. Smith complained that he had simply been attempting to get away from Legg who was marking Smith tightly at the time. Legg suffered a cut mouth in the incident. Smith had been sent off six weeks earlier for a similar incident with Aston Villa defender Alpay √ñzalan. In the second half, Leeds switched to a more defensive style to compensate for Smith's dismissal, allowing Cardiff to apply pressure, primarily through the use of long passes and throw-ins into the Leeds area. Towards the end of the match, Hammam began walking around the edge of the pitch as the match continued, an action he often undertook to encourage the home supporters. He was pelted with missiles as he walked past the stand containing Leeds' supporters before remaining stood behind the goal his side were attacking for the remainder of the match. Ten minutes from the end of the match, D'Urso was hit on the head by a coin thrown from the stands and required treatment before continuing. One of D'Urso's assistants was also struck by a missile during the game. As the match wore on, Cork looked to pressure Leeds with substitutions, initially planning to send on Josh Low before instead opting to replace the tiring Gordon with Leo Fortune-West. Late in the game, Viduka broke through the Cardiff defence and advanced on Alexander's goal but was denied by a late sliding tackle by Cardiff's Scott Young. Cardiff won a corner in the 87th minute of the match, their seventh of the game. Kavanagh took the set piece and crossed the ball into the box where it was headed towards goal by the advancing Fortune-West. The ball bounced into the midriff of Leeds midfielder David Batty who attempted to clear but was beaten to the loose ball by the onrushing Young who volleyed into the Leeds net to give Cardiff the lead. The home side held onto the lead to see out the match and advance to the fourth round. ===Details=== { width=92% -   } { style=\\"width:100%\\" - style=\\"vertical-align:top; width:40%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 1  Neil Alexander - DF 18  Scott Young - DF 3  Andy Legg - DF 5  Spencer Prior - DF 6  Danny Gabbidon - MF 12  Willie Boland - MF 15  Mark Bonner - MF 8  Graham Kavanagh (c) - FW 10  Robert Earnshaw - FW 14 Paul Brayson - FW 20 Gavin Gordon - colspan=4Substitutes: - DF 2 Rhys Weston - MF 14 Jason Bowen - MF 23 Layton Maxwell - MF 7 Josh Low - FW 9 Leo Fortune-West - colspan=4Manager: - colspan=\\"4\\" Alan Cork } valign=\\"top\\" style=\\"vertical-align:top; width:50%\\" { cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" style=\\"font-size:90%; margin:auto\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 1  Nigel Martyn - DF 18  Danny Mills - DF 2  Gary Kelly (c) - DF 29  Rio Ferdinand - DF 6  Jonathan Woodgate - DF 3  Ian Harte - MF 11  Lee Bowyer - MF 23  David Batty   - MF 17  Alan Smith - FW 9 Mark Viduka - FW 27 Robbie Fowler - colspan=4Substitutes: - DF 22 Michael Duberry - DF 34 Frazer Richardson   - GK 13 Paul Robinson   - MF 14 Stephen McPhail   - MF 16 Jason Wilcox   - colspan=4Manager: - colspan=\\"4\\" David O'Leary } } { style=\\"width:100%; font-size:90%;\\"  style=\\"width:60%; vertical-align:top;\\" Match rules *90 minutes. *Replay if scores still level. *Five named substitutes. *Maximum of three substitutions. } ==Post-match== ===Immediate aftermath=== As D'Urso blew the final whistle, Cardiff fans immediately ran onto the pitch to celebrate their side's victory. Among the crowd on the pitch was Hammam, who waved a Welsh flag in celebration. Some of these fans quickly approached the section of the ground holding away supporters and missiles were thrown between the two sets of supporters as police intervened. As the situation escalated, the police line launched a baton charge to force the pitch invaders back and police dogs were also brought onto the pitch. Leeds' Lee Bowyer was targeted by a Cardiff fan as he left the field, narrowly avoiding a punch thrown by the supporter, while teammates Batty and Viduka also required assistance from security personnel to leave the pitch. One of the supporters seen to be causing trouble was later identified as Dai Thomas, a former Cardiff player who had previous convictions related to football hooliganism. He was charged with one count of threatening and violent behaviour after being filmed throwing an advertising hoarding at Leeds supporters and was jailed for 60 days as well as being banned from all football grounds in England and Wales for six years. There were minor disturbances outside the ground as Leeds fans returned to their coaches but these were quickly dispersed by police. Four fans were arrested on the night while a further eight were arrested in the following weeks after being identified from police footage. Leeds defender Rio Ferdinand was later quoted as describing Ninian Park as \\"the scariest ground he'd ever played in\\". Hammam left the field and was interviewed by BBC reporter Jonathan Overend. However, Hammam grew dissatisfied with the tone of the interview and subsequently instructed two of his security staff to remove Overend from the ground and confiscate his equipment. The items were later returned to Overend although the tapes had been removed. A second BBC employee attempted to retrieve the recording from Hammam but was also forcibly removed. Hammam later became involved in a further altercation, this time with Leeds manager O'Leary in the club car park. In response to O'Leary's comments before the match, Hammam quipped \\"you were right about one thing, your FA Cup started and finished in Cardiff.\\" A furious O'Leary advanced on Hammam, grabbing him by his jacket before Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale intervened and pulled O'Leary away. ===Later=== In the days following the match, Hammam described his side's triumph as \\"a special victory which would lift the profile of Welsh football\\", while also praising Cork, believing he would become \\"a great Cardiff City manager.\\" The Daily Telegraph's Henry Winter described the result as \\"one of the greatest upsets in FA Cup history\\" in his post-match coverage. Despite their victory, Cardiff suffered a drop in form following the match. They lost their next match, 2‚Äì1 to Peterborough United in the Second Division six days later, before being eliminated from the FA Cup in the fourth round at the end of January following a 3‚Äì1 defeat to Tranmere Rovers. Three defeats in their next five matches, culminating in a 4‚Äì0 defeat to struggling Wigan Athletic, led Cork to resign his position as manager. He was replaced by Lennie Lawrence who led the club to the play-offs where they suffered a defeat to Stoke City. Hammam was heavily criticised for his decision to walk around the pitch during the game but initially dismissed concerns by commenting \\"I like to watch the end of the game from behind the goal. I'm entitled to do that, I have a pass that allows me to do that which has been approved by security and proper safety authorities. I'm a lucky mascot for the team and why should I change that just because we're playing Leeds? I did not incite their fans at all.\\" Hammam had received warnings from the Football League on two occasions previously regarding pitchside walks and ultimately relented, announcing that he would cease the walks. Jeff Cooksley, the Chief Superintendent of South Wales Police, partly attributed the crowd trouble to the condition of Ninian Park, describing it as \\"a very old ground, 70 years old, and is very poorly designed compared with modern standards\\". The Football Association of Wales later fined Cardiff ¬£20,000 over the pitch invasion but did not uphold further charges over missile throwing or Hammam's pitchside walk. Leeds' form also slumped after the match. Having only lost two league matches during the season, they failed to win another game for two months and dropped from first place to finish the campaign fifth. The club launched an appeal over the red card shown to Smith but this was quickly dismissed by the Football Association, despite the recipient of the elbow, Andy Legg, testifying in support of Smith. He was given an initial four-match ban, which was extended to five after he received his fifth yellow card of the season in a 3‚Äì1 defeat to Newcastle United a week later. The team's failure to qualify for the Champions League, and subsequently missing out on the revenue it would generate, has been credited as a key factor in the club's financial implosion in the early 2000s. The Yorkshire Post stated that the defeat to Cardiff \\"symbolised the beginning of Leeds‚Äô dramatic fall from literally the top end of English football\\", with the club eventually being relegated to the third tier in the space of five years. Chairman Peter Ridsdale stepped down in 2003 and took up the same role with Cardiff three years later. ==References== Bibliography * Category:2001‚Äì02 FA Cup Category:FA Cup matches Leeds City Category:Leeds United F.C. matches Category:January 2002 sports events in the United Kingdom Category:2000s in Cardiff ","title":"Cardiff City F.C. 2‚Äì1 Leeds United F.C.

He was the youngest of six children. From around 1824 to 1834 the family lived in Canaan, Vermont. He was apprenticed to a builder in 1830 and by 1845 had become a contractor in Massachusetts. ==Career== He had established an architectural practise by the mid-1840s and he moved to Philadelphia in the mid-1850s, specialising in church designs. According to the records of the Court of common pleas Starkweather started work with Joseph C. Hoxie in November 1852 and became a full partner in 1854. The partnership with Hoxie broke down and was dissolved by July 1854. The Common Please case was to divide the assets of the office but this took until 1858. He appeared in Philadelphia city directories as an architect in 1854. The First Presbyterian Church, Baltimore was probably why he moved to Baltimore. He also designed Italianate villas in Maryland and Virginia. In 1860 he opened an office in Washington, D.C. After the Civil War became the partner of Thomas M. Plowman in the architectural and engineering firm of Starkweather & Plowman (1868‚Äì1871). Little is known of his career following the Panic of 1873 though he was listed in Washington directories until 1881. George A. Frederick commented that after an erratic career Startweather had moved to New York. In the middle of 1880 he moved to New York and became a partner of Robert Napier Anderson in the firm Startweather and Anderson at 106 Broadway. From 1881 to about 1884 he was the partner of Charles E. Gibbs, with whom he designed the Potter Building, the Second Avenue Methodist Episcopal Church (since demolished) and . In 1881 their offices were in the World Building owned by Orlando B. Potter. From 1882 until his death he was an associate of the American Institute of Architects. ==Death== He died in December 1885 before the Potter building was completed.

The events caused around 47 deaths, and 75 people were injured. ==Background== According to the BBC, Venezuelan prisons saw an increase in riots during the COVID-19 pandemic. Prisons in the country experience overcrowding and unsanitary conditions, and many inmates rely on food and water brought to the prison for them. During the pandemic, visits were cut down and much of the food for prisoners was confiscated, leading to widespread hunger. The Guardian reported that the prison was designed to hold 750 inmates, but had over 2,500 at the time of the riot. ==Riot== According to families of the prisoners, the motive for the riot was because of hunger, with the inmates trying to reclaim food that had been kept by guards. A group of prisoners went to the gates to ask for their food after visiting time on 1 May, but the director of the prison and a military officer were there and a confrontation ensued; the officials then claimed there was an escape attempt and so prisoners were subdued. The riot occurred in the administrative area of the prison and a section known as \\"Jumanji\\", where the prisoners catalogued as \\"los Manchados\\" ‚Äì those imprisoned as (a modern Venezuelan judicial term indicating a dangerous life-sentence criminal, from an acronym for \\"born killer\\") ‚Äì are held. Spokespersons for some of the prisoners gave testimonies to El Pitazo on 3 May, saying that there was no confrontation and that the National Guard initiated a massacre when a group of prisoners asked to be allowed through to get food. Families of prisoners added that they had also requested more flexibility with visiting times, which have been disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ===Official motive theory=== The Venezuelan NGO Una Ventana a la Libertad also reported on another theory, which suggests that the riot was started by \\"Olivo\\", an inmate prison gang leader, in response to the death of his second-in-command, who was killed by a group of various law enforcement and military officers in Biscucuy. According to the Minister for Prison Services, Iris Varela, the prisoners were forced by Olivo to start an escape attempt, and threatened by his gang at gunpoint. Varela said she would not confirm the number of deaths until more was known, and also claimed the prison director had been shot. == Casualties == During the riot, at least 47 people were killed, and 75 injured. All of the deaths were prisoners. The report from the Venezuelan Prison Observatory (OVP) indicated that at least 52 of the injured stayed in hospital overnight. The OVP also said that during the riot, the prison director Carlos Toro was injured by a stab wound to the back, and that a member of the Venezuelan National Guard (GNB) was injured by shrapnel from a grenade. A group with minor injuries were discharged and transferred back to prison before the morning. ==Aftermath== Information to the families of the prisoners was slow. One woman, identified as family of one of the prisoners in a video published by Una Ventana a la Libertad, said that the families were informed that they were going to be shown a list, but that they had been given no information or told if their relatives were alive. The director of the OVP, Beatriz Carolina Gir√≥n, said that \\"the families [were] at the doors of the morgue to move the bodies, but the Guanare forensic scientist asked them for bleach and soap to clean the bodies and hand them over\\", and that \\"until now [the doctors] have not let [the families] see [the deceased], a relative told [Carolina Gir√≥n] that they identified them from photos shown on a computer\\". The BBC said that, according to National Assembly deputy Mar√≠a Beatriz Mart√≠nez, families of the deceased have been informed that they will not receive their relatives' bodies, which will be buried in a mass grave instead. ===Reactions=== The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, called for the government to investigate the deaths and to further guarantee basic rights for prisoners. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights also spoke of their worries about the events, and asked for the Venezuelan authorities to investigate impartially to ultimately find those responsible. Luis Almagro, Secretary General of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to the massacre as \\"another unacceptable form of torture by the dictatorship [of Venezuela]\\". Amnesty International directly blamed Nicol√°s Maduro for the deaths, and for trying to \\"justify the violence used, stating that it was an attempted escape by persons deprived of liberty.\\" == See also == * 2018 Valencia fire * Acarigua prison riot == References == == External links == * EN VIVO - Situaci√≥n del mot√≠n en c√°rcel de Guanare ‚Äì Live reporting from VPItv's YouTube channel (in Spanish) Category:2020 crimes in South America Category:2020 in Venezuela Category:Crisis in Venezuela Riot Category:Massacres in 2020 Category:Massacres in Venezuela Category:May 2020 crimes Category:May 2020 events in South America Category:Portuguesa (state) Category:Prison uprisings ","title":"Guanare prison riot"},{"id":"63848584","text":"Patrick Walsh (born 14 June 1963) is an Irish retired hurler who played for Kilkenny Championship club Windgap.

Byrne was one of 15 people who witnessed an unusual sight at the gable end of the church on 21 August 1879, later the site of the Knock Shrine. She was brought there at 8:15pm by the housekeeper of the parish priest, Mary McCloughlin. Upon her arrival, Byrne saw three figures hovering 2 feet in the air, and was told by McCloughlin that two of the figures were the Blessed Virgin Mary and Saint Joseph. Byrne identified the third figure of Saint John the Evangelist, as he bore a resemblance to a statues at a church in Lecanvey, near Westport, County Mayo. The witnesses claimed that it was raining heavily, but that no rain hit the area in which the apparitions stood. Byrne went to nearby houses, and brought the rest of the group of 15 to witness the apparition, including her siblings, Dominick and Margaret, and her mother. The parish priest, Archdeacon Bartholomew Cavanagh, refused to attend the site as he did not believe his housekeeper's claims. The story of the apparition at Knock spread, with Byrne being considered the chief witness to it. In 1880, on the first anniversary of the vision, Byrne took part in a commemorative procession carrying a banner of the Virgin Mary. After the apparition, all the witnesses gave testimony to a commission of inquiry into the event, which took place just 6 weeks after the apparition. Described as \\"intelligent, forthcoming, earnest, and truthful\\", Byrne, along with her fellow witnesses, was deemed credible. Byrne married James O'Connell on 1 July 1882. He was from a local village, Becan. The couple had five sons and a daughter. Two of their sons, Dominick and Patrick, became policemen, Patrick in Chicago and Dominick in Belfast with the Royal Irish Constabulary. After she was widowed in 1926, Byrne lived near Knock with James, her eldest son. Many of the pilgrims to Knock would visit the house to touch her. Byrne insisted that when she closed her eyes and opened them again, she could see the vision. In 1932, she gave a deposition and did not waver from her previous testimony. She signed a sworn statement on 27 January 1936 affirming what she witnessed at Knock. She was examined as part of the second commission of inquiry into Knock in August 1936, and is reported to have impressed them with her clear recollection, stating \\"I am clear about everything I have said and I make this statement knowing I am going before my God.\\" Byrne died on 19 October 1936, and is buried beside her husband in Knock cemetery. ==References== Category:1850 births Category:1936 deaths Category:Marian visionaries Category:Angelic visionaries ","title":"Mary Byrne (witness)"},{"id":"63848599","text":"Bowesville is an under construction station on the Trillium Line in Ottawa, Ontario.

His commitment to social justice pervades his music and led him to found the human rights charity Amos Trust in 1985. He continues to raise awareness of social justice issues by recording and releasing albums, and also through writing books and articles. == Background == The son of Anglican Reverend Thomas Hewitt and brother of broadcaster, Gavin Hewitt, Garth Hewitt attended St John's School in Leatherhead, Surrey. He graduated from St John's College, Durham in 1968 and from London College of Divinity in 1970. He began his ministry as curate at St Luke's Church in the Diocese of Canterbury and was ordained by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Michael Ramsey, in 1971. Performing and writing songs from an early age, in 1973 Hewitt's musical talent was noted by well- known hymn writer Tim Dudley-Smith of the Anglican Church Pastoral Aid Society, which then employed him for the next six years to develop his music for the benefit of young people within the church. As his songs became known to Anglican audiences, he played in schools, churches, and larger venues.By age 40 he achieved recognition as \\"the elder statesman of the gospel music scene\\" in the UK. == Musical career == === Working with Cliff Richard === An early partnership with Sir Cliff Richard was formed in 1977 when Hewitt wrote the music for a film about third world poverty, in which Richard performed, called A World of Difference. Backed by the Christian relief agency, Tearfund, the film featured Hewitt singing the title song \\"A World of Difference.\\" The following year Richard provided backing vocals on Hewitt's album I‚Äôm Grateful. A year later, he produced Hewitt's album Did He Jump... or Was He Pushed? Richard subsequently covered two tracks from that record. First was the single issued from it, \\"Did He Jump,\\" which did not chart. Hewitt was ambivalent about its release in any event since the long playing album was his preferred medium as he later recalled. However, Richard recorded the song live at the Hammersmith Odeon in 1979, when he spoke of Hewitt as \\"a fine singer- songwriter.\\" The second track was \\"A World of Difference,\\" which Richard knew from the Tearfund film. He sang it at the Live Aid after‚Äëparty at a nightclub in London in 1985. With backing vocals by DJ Kenny Everett, Richard recorded Hewitt's 1981 track \\"Under the Influence\\" for the B side of his single \\"The Only Way Out\\" in 1982. Richard later added the track to his album Now You See Me, Now You Don't on the album's re‚Äërelease in 2002. === Other collaborations and tours === Hewitt has also worked with an eclectic array of singers, arrangers, and instrumentalists on his records. They include fellow Christian musicians Bryn Haworth and Paul Field, pedal steel guitarist B. J. Cole, gospel singer Jessy Dixon, protest singer-songwriter Martyn Joseph, vocalist Denise Ogbeide, contemporary Christian artist Randy Stonehill, producer and world musician Ben Okafor, Palestinian singer Reem Kelani, folk-rock singer Mark Heard, experimental composer Paul Pilot, pianist and singer Duke Special, and renowned harpsichordist Penelope Cave. Hewitt has regularly toured in Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Poland, US, Belgium, Netherlands, France, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia (once), and Canada (once). He has performed in venues ranging from high security prisons in Singapore and Bolivia to the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, after being invited by country singer George Hamilton IV. === International recognition === Hewitt sang at several events organised by American evangelist Billy Graham: in 1973 at the UK Spree ‚Äô73 festival; in 1975 at Eurofest ‚Äô75, held in Heysel Stadium, Brussels; and in 1980 in evangelistic campaigns at Oxford and Cambridge universities. In 1983 Hewitt won wide acclaim in the developing world upon the release of his Indian and African influenced album, Road to Freedom. It featured the track \\"Namirembe\\" about a hill in Kampala, Uganda. The track became so popular in that country that the people of Uganda nicknamed him \\"Namirembe.\\" In 1988 he was named International Artist of the Year at the Gospel Music Association's Dove Awards in Nashville. The award was for what the judges said was his many years of commitment to the disadvantaged. One song specifically mentioned was Hewitt's \\"A Child is the Future\\" with its concern for children born into poverty. == Social activism, ministry, music == Having been influenced in his early thinking and theology by Martin Luther King Jr, Archbishop Trevor Huddleston, Canon John Collins, Monsignor Bruce Kent among others, Hewitt's invitation by Tearfund to travel with the organisation to Haiti in 1978 confirmed the direction of his music and ministry. From that point he began to focus his understanding of the role of a priest in the context of activism and protest. Hewitt traces his awareness of social issues to a sermon he heard as a teenager by Martin Luther King Jr when King was guest preacher at London's St Paul's Cathedral. King, who was on his way to Oslo, Norway, to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, attracted a congregation of more than 4,000 that afternoon. He had been invited by another of Hewitt's exemplars, the canon of St Paul's, John Collins, and he spoke on \\"The Three Dimensions of a Complete Life\\"‚Äîthe love you should have for yourself, the love you should show to your neighbour, and love for God. An example of Hewitt using his lyrics for protest and awareness-raising was his song, \\"You Are Loved Stephen Lawrence,\\" written on the murder of 18-year-old Stephen Lawrence, killed in a racist attack in Eltham, London, in 1993. Stephen's mother Doreen Lawrence selected the song as a choice when she appeared on BBC Radio 4‚Äôs Desert Island Discs. Another instance was his song for American peace activist Rachel Corrie on her death in Gaza in 2003, \\"Light a Candle in the Darkness.\\" In 1989 Hewitt controversially gave open support to Viraj Mendis, a Sri Lankan refugee who claimed sanctuary in a Manchester church in an attempt to avoid deportation from the UK. While Mendis was there, Hewitt gave a concert in the church to highlight what he considered to be the moral issues. In 1989‚Äì90 Hewitt toured with poet Stewart Henderson and mime artist Geoffrey Stevenson in an interdisciplinary and multimedia show called Broken Image. Sponsored by Tearfund, the production focussed on the plight of the poor in the Philippines. All three performers addressed the issue of poverty, with the Church Times reporting in its review that Hewitt's songs were \\"full of peace and justice slogans, which had the audience singing along.\\" === Greenbelt === In 1974 Hewitt played at the first Greenbelt Festival and was subsequently deeply involved in its development from a Christian music festival to a broad annual Christian celebration of the arts, faith, and justice. === TV === In 1979 Granada TV‚Äôs weekly programme Pop Gospel selected Hewitt's song \\"That's Why We‚Äôre Here\\" as its theme tune. The following year, Hewitt presented the programme, a light religious musical show aimed at young people, with singer Bernie Flint. In June 1981 Hewitt joined Southern TV‚Äôs short-lived religious affairs show, Royle Progress, presented by Reverend Roger Royle. Hewitt's role was to place \\"the emphasis on youth and music,\\" which he did each week until the programme ceased a month later. === Amos Trust === In 1985 Hewitt founded the human rights charity Amos Trust to support his visits to projects in parts of the world where funding would not be available to finance his trips. It had a particular mission to encourage musicians in developing nations to raise their voices in ways that were true to their respective cultures. Hewitt named his charity after the Old Testament prophet Amos, who in Amos 5:24 relates God's command to let justice roll on like a river. The trust took this as its credo, the text particularly resonating with Hewitt as it comes immediately after God's rejection of music‚Äîthe only place in the Bible where this occurs apparently‚Äîwhen it is produced by musicians who ignore the poor. In the 1990s Amos Trust began organizing trips to the international projects it supports, to introduce people to the problems in different countries, with a view both to enlarging a global understanding of poverty and encouraging activism when visitors returned to the UK. Hewitt served as director from the trust's inception until 2011 when the Reverend Chris Rose was appointed to the role of director, while Hewitt retained the position of founder. In his period as director he was Guildford Diocesan World Affairs and World Mission Advisor from 1994 to 1996. Toward the end of this advisory role he wrote a book for Lent called Pilgrims & Peacemakers, which by way of featuring Palestinian and Jewish mediators, espoused his progressive approach to Christian mission. === Christian Aid === In 1996 Hewitt started a new job with Christian Aid as Head of the London and South East Team and Area Coordinator for the Westminster area. During his time with the charity he released a musical, The Feast of Life, for churches to perform during Christian Aid Week to bring attention to the causes supported by the agency. It didn't consist entirely of new material. Some songs were recycled from previous albums. Nevertheless the musical was widely successful. It was soon performed not only during Christian Aid Week but throughout the year. With churches still reviving the show, it proved a lasting legacy of Hewitt's tenure at Christian Aid. He left the London and South East Team after six years. === All Hallows-on-the-Wall === Between 1997 and 2012, at All Hallows-on-the-Wall Anglican church in central London, Hewitt was Guild Vicar, so-called because the church retained links with the ancient guilds, or livery companies as they are also known, found in the City of London. On 4 May 2010, Hewitt was made a freeman of one of these guilds, the Worshipful Company of Carpenters, for leading their annual election day service at All Hallows-on- the-Wall.\\"The Carpenter's Company, a list of the Master, Wardens Court of Assistants, Liverymen and Freemen\\", 4 May 2010, published by the Worshipful Company of Carpenters, 4 May 2010. Catering to the traditions of the carpenters was part of a very wide ministry Hewitt conducted at All Hallows that also embraced peace, justice, and art. At one point he brought five charities under the church's roof: Amos Trust, Greenbelt Festivals, Stamp Out Poverty, Art and Christianity Enquiry (ACE), and the Wall Gallery, also known as Wallspace, which they described as \\"a spiritual home for the visual arts.\\" == Interests == === Palestine === Hewitt's interest in the work of peacemakers in Israel/Palestine began when he read the best-selling book, Blood Brothers, by the Palestinian-Israeli Abuna, Elias Chacour, and after inviting him to speak to the Greenbelt Festival in 1988. In respect of his support for Palestinians working for peace, on 11 June 2006, the Bishop of Jerusalem, Riah Abu El Assal, made Hewitt a canon of St George's Cathedral in Jerusalem. In 2006, the House of Poetry in Ramallah awarded Hewitt a certificate of appreciation for his songs on Palestine, and in 2007, British relief and development agency, Interpal, honoured him during a two-day conference, \\"Partners for Peace and Development for Palestine,\\" for his commitment to the Palestinian people. Hewitt is a patron of Palestine Solidarity Campaign. And of ABCD Bethlehem (Action around Bethlehem Children with Disability). His writings on the Palestinians include the book Occupied Territories, which one critic describes as \\"passionate but level-headed.\\" === Nicaragua === Hewitt cites as one of his influences Gustavo Parajon, Nicaraguan Baptist pastor and founder of the Council of Protestant Churches of Nicaragua (CEPAD). Through CEPAD, Amos Trust supports various projects in Nicaragua involved with sustainable community development. === Street children === Hewitt's earliest encounters with street children were in Brazil, which inspired his protest song \\"Little Outlaws, Dirty Angels\\" on his Lonesome Troubadour album in 1991. This led to Amos Trust supporting projects in South Africa: initially Isaiah 58 in East London, then Umthombo in Durban, and eventually Amos Trust‚Äôs involvement with Umthombo in setting up the Street Child World Cup in 2010. === Dalits === While at Christian Aid, Hewitt travelled to India to research an album about Dalits, the most marginalised caste in the country. Accompanied by Paul Field, the resulting 11 songs became their album Dalit Drum. Later, Amos Trust became involved in supporting various educational programmes with Dalits in Tamil Nadu in Southern India. === Chartists === Acknowledging the legacy of previous Christian protesters, Hewitt recorded songs from an 1845 hymnal compiled by the Chartists, who campaigned for social justice in Victorian Britain. Containing lyrics but no tunes, the hymn book was discovered by a lecturer in nineteenth-century writing at Manchester University, Mike Sanders, who discussed its egalitarian content in 2012. Following contact with Sanders, Hewitt put music to the lyrics in a unique album, Liberty is Near!, the first ever recording of Chartist hymns. == Writings == Among his writings are two works of autobiography. The first of these was Nero's Watching Video, a summary of his first few years of world travel, issued in 1987. This was followed by a more substantial reflection on his life and career, Against the Grain, published in 2018. == Collected works == === Albums === * The Lion and the Lamb (1973, Myrrh) * I Never Knew Life Was in Full Technicolor (1974 Myrrh) * Love Song For the Earth (1976 Myrrh) * I‚Äôm Grateful (1978 Myrrh) * Did He Jump‚Ä¶ or Was He Pushed?

Like the Iskander-M, it flies in a quasi-ballistic trajectory, flattening out below an altitude of about where the atmosphere is dense enough so the missile's fins can change course along its flight path. It is believed to have a range of some 450 km with a 500 kg warhead, putting all of South Korea within range, though it is possible to extend range out to 690 km with a reduced payload; warhead is likely to be unitary, submunition, or possibly nuclear. The KN-23's active steering capability could make it accurate to within 100 meters CEP with satellite guidance, or within 200 meters using INS alone. It is launched from a wheeled transporter-erector-launcher (TEL).KN-23. Missile Threat, Center for Strategic and International Studies.KN-23. Missile Defense Advocacy.North Korea‚Äôs New Short-Range Missiles: A Technical Evaluation. 38 North. 9 October 2019. The KN-23 is likely to replace older liquid-fueled North Korean SRBMs like the Hwasong-5 and Hwasong-6. Being road-mobile and solid-fueled, it can be moved and fired more rapidly, making it more difficult for an opposing force to locate and target before firing. Once launched, the missile's low apogee, short overall flight time, and ability to conduct a terminal \\"pull-up\\" maneuver makes it harder to detect and be intercepted by traditional missile defense systems. Its increased accuracy also reduces the number of missiles that would be needed to destroy a single target. ==History== North Korea first displayed the KN-23 publicly in a military parade on 8 February 2018. The first flight test was on 4 May 2019 near Wonsan, reaching an apogee of 60 km and a range of . Five days later, two more missiles were fired from Kusong, one having a range of and the other of , both with a 50 km apogee. By 17 May, United States Forces Korea had formally designated the weapon as the KN-23. A third flight test was conducted on 25 July 2019, with two missiles again reaching 50 km in altitude but demonstrating greater ranges of and 690 km before landing in the Sea of Japan. A fourth flight test on 6 August 2019 launched two missiles from the country's west coast, overflying the North Korean capital region at an apogee of 37 km out to 450 km. ==See also== *9K720 Iskander *Hyunmoo-2 *KN-24 ==References== ==External links== *KN-23.

Rodriguez is a Puerto Rican psychiatrist, neuroscientist, and clinical researcher developing treatments for obsessive compulsive disorder as well as mapping circuit dysfunction in the human brain. Rodriguez holds appointments in both clinical and academic departments at Stanford University. Rodriguez is a Clinical Lab Director at the Stanford Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging, an Associate Professor and Associate Chair of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, and a Director of several specialized translational research programs. == Early life and education == Rodriguez was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico. She moved to Boston for her undergraduate degree in Computer Science at Harvard University. After graduating in 1996, Rodriguez stayed in Boston to pursue her MD-PhD training within the Harvard- MIT Health Sciences and Technology program where she conducted research in Neuroscience and completed her MD training at Harvard Medical School. During her PhD, Rodriguez was mentored by Susan Dymecki where she developed an innovative genetic technology to map the development of the Precerebellar System in rodents. Her technology has been cited hundreds of times and is now widely used many researchers in neuroscience. Rodriguez moved to New York City to complete her internship, residency, and postdoctoral training at Columbia University Medical Center-NYSPI. In 2005, Rodriguez completed her Internship in Pediatrics and in 2008, she completed her Residency in both Pediatrics and Psychiatry. Rodriguez narrowed her clinical and research focus towards understand and treating patients with Obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder. When she first treated a patient with OCD, she was taken aback by how disabling the disease was and she became frustrated by both the lack of treatments and the long time course before existing treatments begin to relieve patients symptoms. She became motivated to help patients suffering from OCD by exploring avenues to innovate treatments that have rapid effects on patients. Rodriguez continued on to Fellowship training at Columbia under the mentorship of Helen Blair Simpson. Rodriguez explored the rapid therapeutic effects of Ketamine as a treatment for OCD. Rodriguez was recruited to Stanford University in 2015. === Tool Development for Precerebellar Afferent System Ontogeny === During her graduate studies, Rodriguez wanted to test the hypothesis that precerebellar neurons originate from the dorsal neuroepithelium, but she needed a tool to do so. To determine the origins of the precerebellar neurons, Rodriguez developed a genetic tool, using flip- recombinase, that allowed for irreversible fluorescent tagging of descendent cells from a specific progenitor. Applying this tool. Rodriguez localized the origins of the precerebellar neurons to Wnt1 expressing dorsal neural progenitors. She later improved the efficacy of her tool by creating an enhanced version, called FLPe, that had 10 fold improved activity compared to the previous iteration. Using FLPe, Rodriguez was able to determine molecular differences in the primordial cell population that gave rise to unique subsystems of cerebellar cells, suggesting that differentiation may occur even earlier than originally appreciated. Rodriguez's genetic tool development and novel findings were published in Neuron in 2000 and have been cited numerous times due to their utility in neuronal fate mapping. === Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and Hoarding Disorder === Rodriguez published a case study exploring the difficulty in diagnosing and treating an individual with signs of both OCD and schizophrenia, and she displayed the efficacy of treating OCD with glutamate modulators posing future questions about their longitudinal use in treating OCD. Rodriguez and her colleagues tested a novel glutamate modulator, minocycline, to assess its potential for relief of OCD symptoms as an alternative to SSRIs. They found that minocycline might ameliorate early onset OCD and improve symptoms of primary hoarding, and their results overall suggest that further studies are warranted to explore minocycline as a therapeutic agent for early-onset OCD. In 2015, Rodriguez published a groundbreaking paper in Neurospychopharmacology highlighting the therapeutic potential of a different glutamate modulating compound, Ketamine, in treating OCD. They found significant decreases in obsessions that lasted for more than one week. Rodriuguez's study was the first randomized controlled trial to show that modulating glutamate signalling could have rapid and long-lasting therapeutic effects for patients suffering from OCD. Rodriguez also discovered abnormally high rates of Hoarding Disorder (HD) in the population of individuals in New York seeking help from Eviction Intervention Services. Her findings highlighted the potential of treating HD in reducing homelessness in New York and Rodriguez began to explore new and improved treatments for HD. In a case report, she assessed the use of methylphenidate, an amphetamine, in treating HD and it showed improvements in some individuals suggesting further research into applying amphetamine compounds in a clinical setting for HD. == Career and research == In 2015, Rodriguez joined the faculty at Stanford University as an Assistant Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences and a member of the Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute. Rodriguez was also appointed the Director of the Stanford Hoarding Disorders Research Program, the Director of the Translational OCD Research Program, and the Director of the Translational Therapeutics Lab, which is also the Rodriguez Lab. Rodriguez's lab focuses on understanding the neurobiological mechanisms of emotion and behavior in order to develop rapid acting therapeutics for mental illnesses. They focus on drug discovery and participate in clinical trials to test mechanisms and efficacy of their compounds and treatments in the human brain. The main illness that the lab focuses on currently is OCD, they also work on Hoarding Disorder and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. Rodriguez also provides clinical mental health care for veterans as a consultation liaison psychiatrist. In 2018, Rodriguez was promoted to Associate Chair of Inclusion and Diversity at Stanford Medical School in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, and she took on the role of Clinical Lab Director at the Stanford Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging. === Glutamate Modulation as a Treatment for OCD === Following Rodriguez's successful postdoctoral work at Columbia elucidating the therapeutic potential of Ketamine in treating OCD, Rodriguez continued to pursue a further understanding of this therapeutic avenue and ways to improve its efficacy in patients. To assess the neurochemical effects of Ketamine, Rodriguez and her colleagues used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. They found that subjects treated with Ketamine had higher GABA levels than controls, and these findings support data showing that patients with OCD have decreased GABAergic activity. Their finding pointed to a novel mechanism of ketamine action and underlying GABA abnormality in patients suffering from OCD. While Ketamine was effective in ameliorating symptoms, its side effects include nausea and dissociation, so Rodriguez and her colleagues sought to find another glutamate modulatory compound to treat OCD with fewer side effects. They found that Rapastinel, a NMDAR glycine-site partial agonist, showed similar improvements in obsessions associated with OCD while accompanied by fewer side effects compared to ketamine treatment. Though the short term effects were positive, it did not have long lasting effects like ketamine thus calling for further developments in therapeutics. To explore underlying mechanisms of Ketamine's actions and find ways to reduce the dissociative effects of Ketamine, Rodriguez and her team tested opioid receptor antagonism as a means to reduce dissociations in patients. They surprisingly found that opioid signalling plays an important role in mediating ketamines acute anti-depressant effects but does not seem to play as dominant a role in mediating the dissociative effects. == Advocacy == Rodriguez is a past Chair of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology Underrepresented Minority Task Force and mentors trainees to encourage their entry into academic careers and boost their leadership and grant writing skills through National Institutes of Health- funded programs. Rodriguez also advocates for equity, inclusion, and diversity in science and medicine. She recently co-authored an article in the Harvard Business Review discussing the barriers that women face in medicine and that broader diversity can improve innovative potential. She also helps to outline critical yet simple steps that can be achieved quickly to begin to make changes to improve the numbers of women in leadership positions in medicine and academia. As a writer for the Huffington Post, Rodriguez has written articles educating the public about the importance of research and how they can get involved in advancing research towards treating and curing mental illnesses like OCD. Her writing has also created an avenue for public awareness of the stages of ketamine research for use in mental illness. == Awards and honors == * 2019 Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) * 2018 Chairman's Annual Award for Excellence Across Multiple Missions ‚Äì Stanford Medical School * 2017 Eva King Killam Research Award for Outstanding Translational Research Contributions ‚Äì ACNP * 2017 A.E.

Dick at the University of Columbia in December 1972.Title: The Android and the Human  Speculative Fiction Database In it the author examines the psychology of humanity as seen through the lens of technology, and vice versa. Dick compares the way that modern technology is animated by mechanism or computation with the way that, according to sociology, primitive man imagines reality itself to be \\"alive\\": Rocks, clouds, and the rest of his environment seeming full of hidden motivation, often replete with malice or benevolence. As man advances, intellectually, he comes to the point where he questions that magical world of superstition, coming to only see life where it actually is, scientifically. In fact he can become solipsist about whether there is any life outside of his own thoughts: Cogito, ergo sum. But with modern automation, people can be drawn back into the intellectually primitive world of animism, where life appears to be in places sound reason says it is not. This was apparent even in 1972, years before Alexa or Siri.THE ANDROID AND THE HUMAN... What's more, that technological illusion of life is being created by human beings, who therefore project their own biases and views onto it, so that this impression of animism is a mirror held up to humanity itself: Dick analogizes this to androids, describing such a device as \\"a thing somehow generated to deceive us in a cruel way, to cause us to think it to be one of ourselves\\".PHILIP K. DICK‚ÄôS ANDROIDS: VICTIMIZED VICTIMIZERS In fact, Dick even claims that a person who lacks the ethics, empathy, and sincerity that are seen as defining humanity can be considered an android: \\"a metaphor for people who are physiologically human but psychologically behaving in a non- human way.\\"PHILIP K. DICK ON SEX BETWEEN HUMANS AND ANDROIDS Among the androids of modern society, Dick addresses the unethical behavior of the police state, giving examples of what would someday be called the surveillance society. One such being the way checkpoints justified to prevent mass shootings in libraries had almost immediately come to be used as a means of generating false probable cause to search people for drugs. Contrasted with this is the hope that Philip holds for the youth who are used to the police state, and yet resisting it via civil disobedience. ==References== Category:Philip K.

Dublin Association was the first football club to be formed in Dublin and the first club outside of Ulster to be affiliated with the Irish Football Association. They existed between 1883 and 1890 and played in the Irish Cup. Dublin Association was formed at Tyrone Place (now Cathedral Street) in November 1883. Initially, the team had little in the way of competition, with only 12 men turning up for their first game, however a month later, students from Trinity College would form a rival club called Dublin University A.F.C.. The first-ever \\"Dublin Derby\\" was played at College Park on 7 November 1883 when Association met and defeated the University, 4-0. Association's goals were scored by W. Butler (2), H.J. Hamilton and C. Clegg. The club first entered the Irish Cup in the 1883-84 season. By 1884, there were five teams in the city, including a Scottish infantry battalion side. Both Dublin Association and Dublin University would enter the Irish Cup that year, but were eliminated early against better organised sides from Ulster. The club would only last for seven years. They folded in 1890 due to controversy surrounding their Irish Cup semi-final tie with Cliftonville. After suffering a 3-2 defeat, Association claimed that a match official was connected with Cliftonville and complained to the IFA. A replayed match resulted in the same controversy and the same claims. After the IFA to replay or terminate the tie, Association pulled out of the competition and folded as a club. Following this, a number of Dublin Association members would go on to form a new club called the Leinster Nomads.Neal Garnham, Association Football and Society in Pre-partition Ireland (Ulster Historical Foundation, 2004), page 6. ==Notable former players== Brothers Willoughby and William Hamilton were the first and only two Dublin Association players to represent Ireland when they played against Wales on 11 April, 1885. The match, the last to be played as part of the 1884‚Äì85 British Home Championship ended with a 2-8 loss to the Welsh in Belfast. ==References== Category:Association football clubs in Dublin (city) Category:Association football clubs established in 1883 Category:1883 establishments in Ireland Category:Association football clubs in Ireland Category:Former Leinster Senior League clubs ","title":"Dublin Association F.C."},{"id":"63848720","text":"Bachelor Mountain is a mountain located in Linn County, Oregon.

However the purchase is of no legal effect and many commentators of the sales practice consider it to be a scam. == Right of Ownership == See generally, Scots Property Law The souvenir plot will advertise the purchase of 'ownership' of small plot of land part of an estate. However, Scots property law only recognises a defined number of real rights, or rights in rem, which follows the legal principle shared with other jurisdictions,For a comparative discussion, see B. Akkermans, The Principle of Numerus Clausus in European Property Law (Intersentia, 2008) vol 75, 75. that only real rights within the numerus clausus (closed number) are competent. Without the valid creation of a recognised real right, an individual only holds a personal (contractual) right against another. This means that where an individual contracts to purchase property from another, they only hold a contractual right not a right in rem in the property itself. Ownership is also a real right, or right in rem that falls within the numerus clausus. === An Absolute Singular (Unititular) Right of Ownership === Scots law follows the Roman law principle that the right of ownership in _property_ (for definition of term see above) is absolute. Other legal systems such as United States jurisdictions consider ownership as a 'bundle of rights' which can be separated into different components and separated amongst different individuals.Steven, A. and Gretton, G. (2017) Property, Trusts and Succession 3rd edn., page 24. Instead in Scots law, ownership is a singular unitary right, that cannot be broken down into different components, it can only be transferred to another in whole or be encumbered through the creation of inferior real rights.Steven, A. and Gretton, G. (2017) Property, Trusts and Succession 3rd edn., page 24. The owner of a 'thing' has the right to usus, fructus, abusus - the right to use, to the fruits (enjoyment) and the right to abuse or destroy the property.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, para 5. In contrast to historically feudal systems such as England & Wales or Scotland (Davidian Revolution ‚Äì 28 November 2004), ownership is not split among individuals, such as interests held by a feudal superior. Because ownership is a single right, when it is transferred, it transfers instantaneously, with the previous Owner being deprived of all ownership in the property, at the moment of registration in the Land Register.  Transferring a right of Ownership in Scots Law  There are three stages to creating a right of ownership in land: 1) The Contract (the Missives of Sale): for the contract to be formally valid it must meet the Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995. 2) The Conveyance (the Disposition): for the conveyance to be formally valid, the deed, known as the disposition, must meet the Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995. 3) Registration in the Land Register of Scotland: this must be registered validly in accordance with the Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012.  Registration of souvenir plots  Even if a Seller of souvenir plots does validly create a contract of sale for the plot of land sold and provides the Buyer with a valid disposition, the registration of the disposition deed is not possible under the Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012. This replaced the longstanding rule found in the Land Registration (Scotland) Act 1979. > \\"Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012 Section 22 (2)In subsection (1)(b), > ‚Äúsouvenir plot‚Äù means a plot of land which‚Äî (a)is of inconsiderable size and > of no practical utility, and (b)is neither‚Äî (i)a registered plot, nor (ii) a > plot the ownership of which has, at any time, separately been constituted or > transferred by a document recorded in the Register of Sasines.\\"[bold added] Since the Seller will unlikely 'sell' a souvenir plot of a considerable size or practical utility, the disposition will be unable to be registered in the Land Register. This means that the Buyer cannot acquire a real right of ownership in Scots law.Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012 s.50 Therefore, it is impossible for Buyers of the sale to become 'owners' of a souvenir plot. No other form of ownership is recognised bar the real right of ownership, as discussed above, owing to Scots property law's Roman law influences. == Sale of Right to Title, Heraldry, Coat of Arms, etc == === Titles === It is not possible for a Buyer to legally purchase a \\"right\\" to use Scottish nobility titles such as lord or lady. These are only capable of creation at the pleasure of the Sovereign (ie: Her Majesty the Queen) by the issuance of letters patent. In an interview with the Journal of the Law Society of Scotland, The Court of the Lord Lyon, the court in Scotland which regulates the award of heraldry (ie: titles and coats of arms), made the following statement concerning the legal implications of the purchase of souvenir plots: > ‚ÄúOwnership of a souvenir plot of land does not bring with it the right to > any description such as ‚Äòlaird‚Äô, ‚Äòlord‚Äô or ‚Äòlady‚Äô. ‚ÄòLaird‚Äô is not a title > but a description applied by those living on and around the estate, many of > whom will derive their living from it, to the principal landowner of a long- > named area of land. It will, therefore, be seen that it is not a description > which is appropriate for the owner of a normal residential property. ‚ÄúIt > cannot properly be used to describe a person who owns a small part of a > larger piece of land. The term ‚Äòlaird‚Äô is not one recognisable by attachment > to a personal name and thus there is no official recognition of ‚ÄòXY, Laird > of Z‚Äô. ‚ÄúThe words ‚Äòlord‚Äô and ‚Äòlady‚Äô apply to those on whom a peerage has > been confirmed and do not relate to the ownership of land. ‚ÄúOwnership of a > souvenir plot of land is not sufficient to bring a person otherwise > ineligible within the jurisdiction of the Lord Lyon for seeking a coat of > arms.‚Äù [bold added] === Law of Heraldry === The Public Register of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland which was established in 1672, pursuant to the Lyon King of Arms Act 1672 (c 47), and lists all heraldry awarded in Scotland. Heraldry is considered to be incorporeal property in Scots law, so is capable of having a right of ownership over the use and control of the heraldic coat of arms.M'Donnell v M'Donald (1826) 4 S 371 at 372 (NE 374 at 376). The award of coat of arms in Scots law confers a status and a precedence on the holder of the arms, and their successors, whether a person or a corporate body.Law Society of Scotland 1955 SLT (Lyon Ct) 2. Any device other than letters or numerals, displayed on a shield, lozenge, cartouche or rectangular banner or set upon a wreath, crest, coronet or chapeau amounts to an armorial bearing the display of which is subject to the provisions of the Lyon King of Arms Act 1672.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 11, Heraldry, para 1613.  Lyon King of Arms Act 1672  The 1672 Act of the Parliament of the Kingdom of Scotland (still in force today) provides that no person is allowed to use a coat of arms unless those arms are recorded in their right in the Public Register of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland. The penalty for a breach of the 1672 Act is a fine of ¬£100. All the goods on which those arms are illegally displayed may become forfeit to the Crown, or alternatively the offending arms to be erased or defaced from any building or monument.  Creation of Heraldry  Under the 1672 Act, heraldry is awarded by grant by the Lord Lyon, who can grant heraldic coats of arms to human individuals of Scottish domicile or Scottish heritage, irrespective of nationality (excluding Canada as Canadian coats of arms are regulated by the Canadian Heraldic Authority). This arises where no grant has previously been made. Therefore, it is not possible to purchase a right to use heraldry online. ==References== Category:Scotland Category:Scots law Category:Scots property law ","title":"Souvenir Plots (Scotland)"},{"id":"63848858","text":"Middle Pyramid is a mountain in Linn County, Oregon.

The company also invests in mineral exploration companies in the form of purchases of shares. Like its predecessor company, Osisko Mining, it is headquartered in Montreal, Quebec, with shares listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange. ==Business model== Like Franco- Nevada, Wheaton Precious Metals and Sandstorm Gold, Osisko Gold Royalties makes investments in the mining industry and transfers profits to shareholders through regular dividend payments. Its profits principally come from royalties, net smelter returns and precious metals streaming contracts with producing mines. These contracts are made with companies involved in mineral exploration or mine development; as an alternative to debt financing or issuing additional shares, the mining company seeking capital funding may agree to a contract with the royalty company to pay a percentage of its future income or products from the mine. Osisko Gold Royalties also buys, holds and sells ownership shares in mining companies and may otherwise purchase 100% ownership of mining companies. ==Corporate history== Osisko Gold Royalties is a spin-off company that was incorporated on April 29, 2014. Its creation was part of a deal between Osisko Mining, Yamana Gold and Agnico Eagle Mines in which white knights Yamana and Agnico purchased Osisko Mining, thwarting Goldcorp's hostile takeover bid. While Yamana and Agnico each retained 50% ownership of Osisko Mining's Malartic mine, Osisko Gold Royalties was spun-off with a 5% net smelter return on the mine, a 2% net smelter return on several Agnico and Yamana mines in the Kirkland Lake area of Ontario, plus CAN$157 million cash for building the company up by making acquisitions, and with Osisko Mining CEO Sean Roosen continuing as Osisko Gold Royalties' CEO. The company made its first moves later in 2014 by purchasing a 20% stake in mineral exploration company NioGold Mining and by merging with Virginia Mines Inc. The merger gave Virginia Mines shareholders a 39% stake in the combined company in exchange for its net smelter return contract on the Goldcorp √âl√©onore mine. Virginia Mines would become a subsidiary and renamed Osisko Exploration James Bay Inc. In 2015 and 2017, they acquired equity interests in several companies and royalty contracts in their producing mines or development projects, including Taseko Mines' Gibraltar copper mine, Nottaway Resources' Vezza gold mine, Arizona Mining's lead-zinc Hermosa project, the Highland Copper Company's White Pine-Copperwood silver-copper project, IDM Mining's Red Mountain gold project, and several third party contracts that were held by Teck Resources. Most significantly, in June 2017 in exchange for 20% stake in the company plus $675 million, Osisko Gold Royalties doubled the number of royalties and streams they owned from 57 to 131 from the American private equity company Orion Mine Finance Group. The deal included royalties or streams in several active mines such as the Renard diamond mine in Quebec, Mantos Blancos mine in Chile, and th Brucejack gold and silver mine in British Columbia. They also provided $20 million financing for a merger of five small mining companies that would re-unite the executive management of the old Osisko Mining, including Roosen, with the new company renaming itself \\"Osisko Mining\\". In 2019, Osisko Gold Royalties acquired the bankrupt Stornoway Diamond Corp for the remainder of the Renard diamond mine and then acquired Barkerville Gold Mines Ltd for its developing Cariboo gold project in British Columbia. ==References== Category:Companies based in Montreal Category:Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange Category:Companies listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange Category:Gold mining companies of Canada ","title":"Osisko Gold Royalties"},{"id":"63848939","text":"Daisy E. Fancourt is a British researcher who is an Associate Professor of Psychobiology and Epidemiology at University College London. During the COVID-19 pandemic Fancourt established the network COVID Minds, which looked to better understand the impact of coronavirus disease on mental health and well-being. == Early life and education == Fancourt earned her bachelor's degree at the University of Oxford and her master's at King's College London. Fancourt joined the National Health Service, where she worked at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital on arts and clinical innovations. She eventually returned to academia, and earned her doctoral degree at University College London (UCL) where she worked in psychoneuroimmunology. == Research and career == After her PhD, Fancourt moved to Imperial College London as a postdoctoral researcher, where she was based in the Centre for Performance Science. The Centre for Performance Science is a partnership between Imperial College School of Medicine and the Royal College of Music. At the annual Imperial College London festival Fancourt analysed the capacity of men and women to play board games whilst listening to music, and showed that men perform worse when there is rock music in the background. During her time at Imperial she acted as Director of Research for Breathe Health Research, an organisation that looked to support children with hemiplegia through magic training. Fancourt studies the impact of the arts on immune response, with a particular focus on the use of music in clinical settings. She analyses how engaging with music and other cultural activities impact physical and mental health at all stages of a person's life. Engaging with music can mean joining a local choir, listening to music or attending a concert. For her contributions to science and the arts, Fancourt was made the British Science Association Jacob Bronowski Award Lecturer in 2016. In 2017 Fancourt was selected as one of the BBC Radio 3 Next Generation Thinkers. As part of the award, Fancourt had the opportunity to create content for BBC Radio 3 and BBC Radio 4. She joined University College London as a Wellcome Trust research fellow later that year. Fancourt worked with the World Health Organization to develop an agenda that connected the arts, health and well-being. In one of her WHO reports, Fancourt concluded that arts interventions, including singing in a choir to improve the outcomes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, present low-cost treatment options for healthcare workers. During the COVID-19 pandemic Fancourt established the network COVID Minds that looked to better understand the impact of coronavirus disease on mental health. The network collates longitudinal international mental health studies during the pandemic, offering opportunities for researchers to join projects and sharing regular updates with members of the public. Fancourt is leading the COVID‚Äì19 Social Study, an investigation looking at the social experiences of adults in the United Kingdom during the outbreak. She created a survey that could collect information on the psychological and social challenges that people in the UK faced during the pandemic. The outcomes of the survey are regularly reported, allowing policymakers and the media to better understand and report on the impact of lockdown. In particular, the Social Study looked to better understand how the virus and enforced social isolation impacted mental health and loneliness. At the end of April 2020 the social study had over 75,000 participants. As part of the social study Fancourt will conduct in-depth surveys of over 150 adults, exploring the impact of social isolation. Her results showed that prior to the lockdown officially beginning there was a decline in happiness. However, over the course of April Fancourt showed that levels of well-being had increased and levels of anxiety had decreased. === Awards and honours === * 2016 British Science Association Jacob Bronowski Award Lecture for Science and the Arts * 2017 British Academy Rising Star Engagement Award * 2017 World Economic Forum Global Shaper * 2017 BBC New Generation Thinker == Selected publications == === Journal articles === * * * === Books === * * == References == Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:British psychologists Category:British women academics Category:British women psychologists Category:Alumni of Christ Church, Oxford Category:Alumni of University College London Category:Alumni of King's College London Category:Academics of University College London ","title":"Daisy Fancourt"},{"id":"63848940","text":"Harry Van der Weyden (1868 ‚Äì 1952) was an American Impressionist painter. ==Life== Van der Weyden was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on 8 September 1868, the son of Henry Van Der Weyde, the Dutch-born American painter and photographer. Henry Van Der Weyde married Mona Wetherbee at the Swedenborgian Church in Boston in 1867, and migrated to London in 1870. In 1871 the family was living at The Birches, Jasper Road, Upper Norwood, and possibly at Van Der Weyde's studio at 182 Regent Street, Westminster, in 1882. In 1887 Van der Weyden won a scholarship to the Slade School of Fine Art, where he studied under Alphonse Legros. In 1890 he moved to Paris, where he studied at the Acad√©mie Julian under Benjamin Constant, Jean-Paul Laurens and Jules Joseph Lefebvre. Exhibiting at the Paris Salon from 1891, he won a third class gold medal in that year. Until the First World War he lived at Montreuil-sur-Mer, near √âtaples in northern France. In 1914 he and his family left France and settled in Rye, East Sussex, living at 15 Market Street. Aged 46 he joined the British Army and between 1916 and 1918 he worked as a Camouflage officer with the British Royal Engineers, when √âtaples was a major transit point and storage depot. Both of his sons joined up with him, one being awarded the Military Cross in 1918. His 1919 painting Desolation: Trenches North of Lens 1919 depicted the aftermath of the Battle of Hill 70, in which 10,000 Canadians were killed. There are two watercolour studies in the Imperial War Museum, one inscribed Chicory Trench, N. of Lens 1918, the other dated 1919. Both are close to the finished painting, suggesting it was completed early in 1919. Van der Weyden exhibited the work that year in the Camouflage Exhibition at the Royal Academy. Van der Weyden developed a reputation for his scenes of the war. He maintained his house in Rye until at least 1922, but in 1919 he and his four children were living at 22 Temple Fortune Hill, Hendon. They then began the process of naturalisation to become British subjects. In 1924 his father died at that address. From the end of the decade, he lived at 26a West End Lane, West Hampstead. By the 1920s van der Weyden was working in the \\"tonal\\" style of painting, with soft twilight effects, owing much to the Japanese print revival of the 1920s, particularly the style known as shin- hanga, that was known in the West from articles in The Studio magazine. He died in London on 23 September 1952. A number of his works are held by the Rye Art Gallery in Rye, East Sussex. ==References== ==External links== * Harry van der Weyden at artnet.com Category:1868 births Category:1952 deaths Category:American Impressionist painters Category:Artists from Boston Category:Alumni of the Slade School of Fine Art ","title":"Harry van der Weyden"},{"id":"63848959","text":"380px Annunciation is a 1517 tempera on panel painting by Master Jerzy, who signed it with the letter G (Georgius, the Latin form of his name).

The province elected its representatives province- wide at-large from its reorganization under Article 6 of the Decreto de 18 junio de 1898 y las instrucciones sobre el r√©gimen de las provincias y pueblos for the Malolos Congress in 1898 until the creation of a first and second district on February 2, 1987. It was a single-member district throughout the ten legislatures of the Insular Government of the Philippine Islands from 1907 to 1935, the three legislatures of the Philippine Commonwealth from 1935 to 1946, the seven congresses of the Third Philippine Republic from 1946 to 1972, and the national parliament of the Fourth Philippine Republic from 1984 to 1986. Bataan has had two instances in its history where more than one member represented it in the national legislatures. Three members were elected or appointed at-large for the National Assembly (Malolos Congress) of the First Philippine Republic from 1898 to 1901 and two members for the National Assembly of the Second Philippine Republic from 1943 to 1944.

Stenner has studied the political activation of authoritarian personality types, and how that activation explains the contemporary success of some authoritarian political figures as well as enduring conflicts between some individuals and the broad tolerance that characterizes liberal democracy. ==Education and early career== Stenner attended The University of Queensland, earning a BA in 1987. In 1995 she earned an MA from Stony Brook University, followed by a PhD there in 1997. In 1996 she became an assistant professor at Duke University, and then in 1998 she joined the faculty at Princeton University. She later returned to Australia, where she worked on behavioral economics and public policy at institutions including Griffith University. ==Research== In 2005, Stenner published The Authoritarian Dynamic, which is an investigation into authoritarian personality types and how they become politically activated. She posits that prior research on authoritarianism has suffered primarily from tautological assertions and has otherwise failed to produce a coherent theory which is consistent cross-nationally, and which can successfully account for how authoritarian expressions fluctuate with diverse sociopolitical conditions. In particular, she asserts that Bob Altemeyer's right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) scale is best understood as a measure of expressed authoritarianism, and that other measures are needed to assess authoritarian predispositions. To this end, she rejects Altemeyer's \\"social learning\\" interpretation and instead argues that authoritarianism is a dynamic response to perceived external threats; not a static personality type based only on the traits of submission, aggression and conventionalism.Stenner, K. (2005). The Authoritarian Dynamic. Cambridge University Press. 13-27. Stenner asserts that authoritarianism is distinct from conservatism: people who are inclined towards authoritarianism are resistant to interpersonal difference (i.e. diversity of people and beliefs at a given moment), whereas people who are inclined towards conservatism are resistant to change. Authoritarianism can thus be thought of as aversion to difference across space, whereas conservatism is aversion to difference across time. For example, one may be a conservative libertarian, but libertarianism is the opposite end of a spectrum from authoritarianism, since the former is defined by encouragement of individual difference and resistance to centralized authority. She thus argues that much of what is conventionally referred to as \\"racism\\" is perhaps better understood as \\"difference-ism,\\" with moral and political diversity (as opposed merely to ethnic diversity) being especially provocative of intolerant attitudes from authoritarian individuals.Stenner, K. (2005). The Authoritarian Dynamic. Cambridge University Press. 328-330. In particular, she highlights how authoritarians' expressions of racial, moral, and political intolerance depreciated by approximately 50% when survey respondents were misled to believe that NASA had discovered alien life forms which were \\"very different from us in ways we are not yet even able to imagine.\\"Stenner, K. (2005). The Authoritarian Dynamic. Cambridge University Press. 279. Stenner argues that conservatives value stability and certainty over increased uniformity, and therefore, will embrace racial diversity, civil liberties and moral freedom to the extent they are already institutionalized and authoritatively-supported traditions within a given society. However, she argues that conservatives may be drawn towards authoritarianism only when public opinion is fractious and there is a general loss of confidence in major institutions; i.e. when the prospect of revolution appears less daunting to them than the current state of affairs. Authoritarians meanwhile, want difference restricted regardless of circumstances; even when so doing would necessitate vast social reforms and instability. By this account, she asserts that authoritarians are never more tolerant than when reassured and pacified by an autocratic culture, and never more intolerant than when forced to endure a vibrant democracy.Stenner, K. (2005). The Authoritarian Dynamic. Cambridge University Press. 334. Stenner, K. (2005). The Authoritarian Dynamic. Cambridge University Press. 250. Through survey techniques identifying authoritarianism in respondents, Stenner identifies personality attributes and values shared by those with pro- authoritarian inclinations, and argues that these traits inform an opposition to difference and an attachment to uniformity which are then activated in the presence of normative societal threats. Such threats to uniformity thus transform a personality attribute into a politically salient reaction which ultimately serves to defend one's beliefs and identification with the collective. Most notably, she cites perceptions of poor leadership and belief diversity (i.e. lack of consensus in group values) as being the two most significant factors contributing to the authoritarian response,Stenner, K. (2005). The Authoritarian Dynamic. Cambridge University Press. 292-324. though she also notes that authoritarians are generally susceptible to the false consensus effect and thus are not likely to perceive normative threats until they have become highly apparent: \\"Authoritarians are not especially inclined to perceive normative (indeed, any) threat, they are just especially intolerant once they do.\\"Stenner, K. (2005). The Authoritarian Dynamic. Cambridge University Press. 81-82. When otherwise abated by belief consensus and leadership which they regard as sufficiently strong however, authoritarians express very low levels of moral, racial, and political intolerance.Stenner, K. (2005). The Authoritarian Dynamic. Cambridge University Press. 52-76. Authoritarians living in Japan in 1990, for example, were found to be nearly indistinguishable from their libertarian counterparts, on account of numerous cultural and societal factors contributing to a climate of near-equanimity and conformity, thereby mitigating the manifest expression of intolerance of difference.Stenner, K. (2005). The Authoritarian Dynamic. Cambridge University Press. 319. According to Stenner, authoritarianism is primarily the result of cognitive inhibitions and personality factors which significantly limit one's ability to tolerate ambiguity, complexity, and‚Äîby extension‚Äîsociocultural diversity. Authoritarians rank slightly above-average on conscientiousness and very low on openness to experience‚Äîtwo of the Big Five personality traits‚Äîand are demonstrably more likely to commit spelling errors and less likely to pursue post-secondary education, the lattermost having generally been shown to otherwise mitigate individual expressions of authoritarianism.Stenner, K. (2005). The Authoritarian Dynamic. Cambridge University Press. 143-173. Ultimately, she argues that authoritarians are best understood as \\"simple-minded avoiders of complexity rather than closed-minded avoiders of change.\\"Stenner, K. and Haidt, J. (2018). Authoritarianism is not a momentary madness, but an eternal dynamic within liberal democracies. In C.R. Sunstein. (Ed.), Can It Happen Here? (pp. 183). New York City, NY: Dey Street Books. She similarly refutes the hypothesis that religiosity is a contributing factor to authoritarian beliefs and expressions, citing research indicating a lack of correlation before concluding: \\"There is no necessary relation between belief in and personal commitment to a religious code, and demand for state coercion of others' adherence to same. The latter rests primarily on something beyond personal faith and individual codes of conduct, having to do with a compulsion to control the diversity and complexity of one's environment, that is, a need to regulate other people's behaviour.\\"Stenner, K. (2005). The Authoritarian Dynamic. Cambridge University Press. 271-272. Though focusing primarily on authoritarian predispositions as they are expressed by individuals on the American political right, Stenner nonetheless notes that the dynamic can appear elsewhere on the political spectrum. In particular, she cites the Nation of Islam as a potential sub- cultural manifestation of the authoritarian dynamic, comparing its \\"self- glorification,\\" insistence on conformity, and militant rejection of state legitimacy to similar attitudes expressed by civilian militia and patriot movements among white authoritarians on the American right.Stenner, K. (2005). The Authoritarian Dynamic. Cambridge University Press. 141-142. She also notes that approximately one-third of authoritarians tend towards socialism,Stenner, K. (2005). The Authoritarian Dynamic. Cambridge University Press. 132. with even non-socialist authoritarians indicating a willingness to support affirmative action, provided that such measures are enacted with the aim of reducing social stratification, as well as operated by institutions which those same authoritarians perceive as sharing their own beliefs and ideals. Likewise, she asserts that any perceived relation between authoritarianism and laissez-faire economic policies is inconsistent, due to it being highly contingent on authoritarians' varying levels of trust in government.Stenner, K. (2005). The Authoritarian Dynamic. Cambridge University Press. 178-186. Stenner identifies the same psychological phenomenon recurring cross- nationally, citing data obtained from Altemeyer's RWA scale as conducted in fifty-nine different countries by the World Values Survey.Stenner, K. (2005). The Authoritarian Dynamic. Cambridge University Press. 316-319. According to Stenner, authoritarians living within Eastern European nations expressed relatively low levels of racial, moral, and political intolerance prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, as socialist autocracies provided citizens with normative reassurance (the former-Yugoslavia under rule of Josip Broz Tito being one of the most notable examples). Following the collapse of communism and subsequent institution of liberal democratic norms however, authoritarians within these countries began to express more overtly intolerant attitudes, becoming nearly indistinguishable from authoritarians living within Western-European nations despite differing significantly in their political and economic beliefs and backgrounds.Stenner, K. (2005). The Authoritarian Dynamic. Cambridge University Press. 96-116. Likewise, she cites studies conducted on identical twins reared in separate environments which have found that authoritarian predispositions have a significant genetic component, on account of them being rooted in personality variables which in turn are substantially heritable.Stenner, K. (2005). The Authoritarian Dynamic. Cambridge University Press. 145-146. Stenner thus extrapolates that authoritarianism is not a \\"learned\\" phenomenon, but rather, an innate psychological tendency which can be found within all civilizations worldwide, and that individuals so predisposed to it \\"will never live comfortably in a liberal democracy.\\"Stenner, K. (2005). The Authoritarian Dynamic. Cambridge University Press. 1. She thus concludes her analysis by suggesting that authoritarian predilections can only be deterred through responsible leadership and fortuitous societal conditions, and that such an impediment is perhaps a contributing factor to previously-failed attempts at instituting liberal-democratic norms in formerly-autocratic cultures such as those found in Iraq and Afghanistan:Stenner, K. (2005). The Authoritarian Dynamic. Cambridge University Press. 331-332. Stenner, K. (2005). The Authoritarian Dynamic. Cambridge University Press. 335. She consequently upholds parliamentary systems of government as examples of \\"stealth democracy\\" which are less susceptible to authoritarian influences, on account of them providing individuals who bear such predispositions with normative reassurance. Conversely, she argues against the multilevel structure of the U.S. political order, stressing that it serves ultimately to amplify public disagreement, propagate adversaries, and polarize the electorate‚Äîconditions which are all guaranteed to exacerbate the authoritarian dynamic.Stenner, K. (2005). The Authoritarian Dynamic. Cambridge University Press. 333-335. Stenner also stresses that expressions of moral, political, and racial intolerance can only be ameliorated by emphasizing unity through common social/cultural identities, and that democracy cannot be sustained in the absence of substantial commonality:Stenner, K. (2005). The Authoritarian Dynamic. Cambridge University Press. 330-331. The Authoritarian Dynamic has been frequently cited by news outlets such as The New York Times, The Atlantic, Slate, and Salon as a work that predicted the resurgence of authoritarianism in contemporary politics, and particularly as an example of research that helps to explain the rise of the Alt-right and other culturally-nationalist sentiments in the lead- up to the 2016 United States Presidential election. Stenner's work suggests that these events appeared surprising or mystifying to many contemporary commentators mainly because they were not provoked by any specific event, but rather because they were a predictable backlash against the gradual increase in diversity and tolerance of difference that has characterized the last several decades of liberal democracy. Jonathan Haidt identified it in 2016 as a text that offers a particularly strong explanation of authoritarianism's contemporary successes. In 2018, Haidt and Stenner collaborated to write a chapter for Can it Happen Here? Authoritarianism in America, wherein they state that \\"Western liberal democracies have now exceeded many people's capacity to tolerate them,\\" and that authoritarianism is not a momentary madness, but a phenomenon which will continue to endure throughout all human societies‚Äîand liberal democracies‚Äîfor the foreseeable future.Stenner, K. and Haidt, J. (2018). Authoritarianism is not a momentary madness, but an eternal dynamic within liberal democracies. In C.R. Sunstein. (Ed.), Can It Happen Here? (pp. 209-217).

All designs included an incline to the surface, plus a surface or underground terminal with a loop, crossovers, or even a turntable to reverse streetcars. The Boston Transit Commission constructed a four-track incline; the inner tracks would lead to the surface, and the outer tracks would serve an underground loop station. This would allow streetcars from Charlestown and Cambridge to use the inner tracks to terminate at the Scollay Square and Adams Square loops, while streetcars that entered the subway from the south would loop at North Station. However, the Boston Elevated Railway intended to attach the subway to its under-construction Charlestown Elevated line. The underground station plan was abandoned, and all four tracks used the Canal Street incline, with a surface terminal at Causeway Street. The Main Line Elevated opened in 1901 with an elevated station at North Union Station. Elevated trains ran south through the Tremont Street subway, north on the Charlestown Elevated, and east along the waterfront on the Atlantic Avenue Elevated. The elevated moved into its own tunnel in 1908. Just south of North Station was the Canal Street incline through which the Tremont Street subway (now part of the Green Line) went from surface to subway, and later the Washington Street Tunnel connected to the Charlestown Elevated (both later part of the Orange Line). The Causeway Street Elevated opened in 1912, with an elevated streetcar station over Causeway Street. The project included a single-track platform for Atlantic Avenue Elevated shuttle trains. The Atlantic Avenue elevated was reduced to a North Station-South Station shuttle by 1928 after an accident at Beach Street, and closed entirely in 1938. It was demolished in 1942, but the shuttle platform remained intact. On June 11, 1959, a bomb exploded in a locker in the Main Line Elevated station, killing one M.T.A. worker. Operations were suspended the rest of the day, and the track was up and running the next day, contrary to public expectations. Further bomb threats were phoned in, but no other bombs were found. Just a month before, a leaking gas line had caused an explosion outside North Station that injured 50 people. ===Subway station=== In 1975, the Orange Line was moved underground as part of the Haymarket North Extension project. The Canal Street loop was closed on June 18, 1977; it reopened on December 15 as a three-track stub-end terminal for the new LRVs. The west entrance to the elevated Green Line station was closed on January 3, 1981, during budget cuts. (second page) A Green Line train at North Station in 2006 In February 1993, the state reached a deal with a developer for the replacement of the aging Boston Garden. As part of the agreement, the MBTA was granted easements for a Green Line tunnel under the arena to replace the Causeway Street Elevated and for a combined underground \\"superstation\\" for the Green and Orange lines. On March 28, 1997, the Green Line surface terminal at Canal Street was permanently closed for construction of the new tunnel under North Station. The Orange Line station was made accessible with the addition of elevators in 2001. The elevated Green Line station (which had an elevator only to the Lechmere-bound platform) was outfitted with portable lifts and mini-high platforms around that time for temporary accessibility while the new underground station was constructed. On June 25, 2004, Green Line service was removed from the Causeway Street Elevated. Green Line trains began using the underground \\"superstation\\" shared with the Orange Line on June 28. Southbound Green Line and Orange Line trains share an island platform, while northbound Green Line trains stop at the mezzanine level. North Station was the terminal of the Green Line until November 12, 2005, when the new tunnel opened and service to resumed. The station cost $262 million to construct. An artwork titled Currents, by Gary Duehr, was placed on the wall behind the southbound Green Line track. The aluminum mural is a strip of 120 sepia-toned photos which appear as an animation from passing trains. The MBTA subway headhouse on the north side of Causeway Street was permanently closed on January 2, 2016; the underground connection which replaced it opened on January 6, 2019. On June 24, 2019, the MBTA Board awarded a $29.7 million, 16-month contract for full cleaning, wayfinding signage replacement, and other improvements at North Station, Haymarket, State, and Downtown Crossing stations. , that work is expected to be complete by the end of 2020. The MBTA plans to add elevators connecting both Orange Line platforms to the south end of the fare mezzanine, providing redundant access to the platforms. A design contract was awarded in April 2020. On May 24, 2020, service to and was temporarily replaced by buses to North Station for construction of the Green Line Extension project, leaving North Station as the northern terminus of Green Line service. Service north of North Station to new terminals at and is planned to resume in 2021. ==References== ==External links== *MBTA ‚Äì North Station *Google Maps Street View: Causeway Street entrances, Elevator north of Causeway Street, Valenti Way entrance Category:Green Line (MBTA) stations Category:Orange Line (MBTA) stations Category:Transport infrastructure completed in 2005 Category:Railway stations located underground in Boston Category:West End, Boston Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1975 ","title":"North Station (subway)"},{"id":"63849043","text":"Ronald A Roy (born 10 December 1956) is an American engineer, physicist, and academic, who is a leading expert in physical acoustics and its applications to ultrasonics, biomedical acoustics, acousto-optics, cavitation and bubble swarm acoustics.

She uses interlacing entropy as an indicator of confinement and phase transitions. It is considered the natural order parameter for systems with topological order. Relative entropy's properties give rise to the Bekenstein dimension, energy levels in field theories and the generalized second law. She has provided a new interpretation of the Bekenstein bound using relative entropy and distinguishability of states. Interlacing entropy is essential in holography, which relates quantum gravity theories to non-gravitational field theories with one less dimension. Interlacing is necessary to explain the connectivity of space and to describe physics beyond the event horizon. == Selected publications == *On the RG running of the entanglement entropy of a circle.

She presented the results in 1887 at a convention in Buffalo, New York. Allen published the results in an article, \\"The Danger and Harmfulness of Patent Medicines\\" in the Christian Advocate which revealed the presence of alcohol in patent medicines. She campaigned against the use of whisky in the treatment of tuberculosis. Allen attempted to persuade the Massachusetts Medical Association to denounce the use of alcohol and narcotics. As Superintendent of the Department of Medical Temperance she was involved in a national program that exposed dangerous patent medicines and liquid foods. The department aimed to convince medical authorities to discontinue prescribing alcohol. The national department sent 25,000 leaflets to local and state unions outlining their objectives. Allen reported that non-alcoholic medicine was \\"growing in favor\\" and new members were specializing in activism. The department was responsible for generating a large amount of pure drink and temperance literature.

From 2003 to 2015, Meoni was intendente (mayor) of Jun√≠n, a partido in the Buenos Aires Province. ==Early and personal life== Mario Andr√©s Meoni was born in 1965 in a road camp in Ascensi√≥n, a small town in General Arenales Partido in northern Buenos Aires Province. His father was a roadway maintenance worker, and he is of Italian descent through his grandfather, who worked as a smith. His family moved to Jun√≠n when he was 6 years old, and stayed there ever since. He became interested in political activism after the return of democracy to Argentina in 1983, being drawn to the Radical Civic Union (UCR) inspired by President Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n. Meoni's political career began as private secretary to then-UCR senator Leopoldo Moreau. Since 1991 Meoni has been married to Laura Oliva, with whom he has twin sons. ==Political career== In 1987, Meoni was hired to work in the Plan Alimentario Nacional (PAN) of the Ministry of Social Action, during the presidency of Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n. From 1991 to 1995 he was a local councillor in Jun√≠n, then going on to work as secretary of the UCR parliamentary bloc in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies from 1995 to 1999. In 1999 Meoni was elected to the Buenos Aires Province Chamber of Deputies in the UCR list, representing the fourth electoral district; he was the parliamentary bloc's vice president. Meoni (left) as Minister of Transport and Chief of Cabinet Santiago Cafiero during a joint press conference in February 2020. ===Intendencia of Jun√≠n=== In 2003, after several unsuccessful runs, Meoni won the UCR primary to the intendencia (mayoralty) of Jun√≠n. He was elected mayor on 14 September 2003 with 38.34% of the vote. Ahead of the 2007 general election, Meoni left the ranks of the UCR and joined the dissident \\"Radicales K\\" who supported the Kirchnerist government and the presidential candidacy of Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner; thus he ran for re-election in the provincial list of the Plural Consensus coalition. During his second term as intendente, Meoni became a major collaborator of the OAS-based MuNET local development and transparency programme. Following the 2008 conflict between the government and farmers, in 2010 Meoni joined other radicales K who followed Vice President Julio Cobos in abandoning the Plural Consensus front and petitioning the UCR to allow them back into the party. Meoni went on to call for a public referendum to validate Cobos's permanency in his post following his controversial vote against Resolution 125, an idea that never materialized. Meoni ran for a third term in 2011, this time forming part of Uni√≥n Social para el Desarrollo (UDESO), the electoral alliance that backed the presidential candidacy of Ricardo Alfons√≠n. On that occasion, Meoni won with 41,27% against the candidate from the Front for Victory. During his third term and starting in 2013, Meoni became close to Sergio Massa's Renewal Front. In 2015, Meoni ran for a fourth term, this time under the United for a New Alternative coalition of which the Renewal Front was part of. Meoni lost against the PRO candidate, Pablo Petracca, by over 7 thousand votes. ===Banco Provincia and Ministry of Transport=== On 14 January 2016 Meoni was appointed as one of the members of the directive board of the Bank of the Province of Buenos Aires (Banco Provincia) by the Provincial Senate of Buenos Aires, representing the Renewal Front and in replacement of Daniel Arroyo. At the 2019 general election, Meoni ran again for the mayoralty of Jun√≠n against incumbent Petracca, but failed to regain the district and lost by a wide margin. On 6 December 2019, President-elect Alberto Fern√°ndez announced the composition of his incoming cabinet, in which Meoni was touted to be the next Minister of Transport, succeeding Guillermo Dietrich. He took office alongside the rest of the cabinet on 10 December 2019. ==References== ==External links== *Official website of the Ministry of Transport (in Spanish) Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Argentine people of Italian descent Category:Radical Civic Union politicians Category:Mayors of places in Argentina Category:Government ministers of Argentina ","title":"Mario Meoni"},{"id":"63849498","text":"\\"\\"√çndios\\"\\" is a song composed by Renato Russo, released in 1986 on the Dois album by Legi√£o Urbana and also released as the third single from the album in December the same year. A live version was also released in 2001 as a single from the live album Como √© Que Se Diz Eu te Amo. The song's title includes quotation marks. According to Russo, they are used to indicate that the title does not refer to Brazil's first inhabitants, but to the innocence instilled in the country's people since its beginnings, with them always being fooled by their leaders. The song begs for a different world, with less selfish people. == History and structure == Russo struggled to match the lyrics to the music. Over ten different recordings were attempted. When he was about to give up, producer Mayrton Bahia and sound technician Amaro Mo√ßo started editing the recordings, a technique they had already used a lot with the band's previous record, Legi√£o Urbana. The song is based on a keyboard mantra. Guitarist Dado Villa-Lobos only adds an acoustic guitar. == Reception == Reception to the song has been in general positive. Ant√¥nio Carlos Miguel, in a review of Dois for Jornal da Tarde, considered the song the album's \\"most fascinating\\" one. He said: \\"In a hypnotic take, repeating the same musical theme, he [Russo] attempts to translate the first and real owners of Brazil's despair (...) Works such as this one, uniting pleasure and awareness, could even contribute to the thriving of the last indigenous people. Or show the so-called civilized people that we can still learn a lot with the innocence of these peoples\\". Gilmar Eitelwein, in a review for Zero Hora, said that \\"√çndios' lyrics are very good\\" and, when describing another track, \\"Andrea Doria\\", said it too \\"attacks human falsehood found around every corner\\". During the album's tour, amidst a performance at Cai√ßara Music Hall, the audience asked the band to play the song, but they refused, in spite of the public's protests. == Personnel == * Renato Russo ‚Äì vocals, acoustic guitar and keyboard * Dado Villa-Lobos ‚Äì guitar * Renato Rocha ‚Äì bass * Marcelo Bonf√° ‚Äì drums == Track listing == 12\\" PROMO (EMI 9951 023) == References == === Bibliography === * Category:Legi√£o Urbana songs Category:Portuguese-language songs Category:Synth-pop songs Category:New wave songs Category:1986 singles Category:1986 songs Category:Songs written by Renato Russo ","title":"&quot;√çndios&quot;"},{"id":"63849515","text":"Justina Lavrenovaitƒó-Perez (n√©e Lavrenovaitƒó; born 7 October 1984) is a Lithuanian football referee and a former player who played as a midfielder.

Isabella Howard, Countess of Carlisle (n√©e Byron; 10 November 1721 ‚Äì 22 January 1795), was a British aristocrat, writer, and traveller. On marrying in 1743 she became the Countess of Carlisle, and following her husband's death was styled the Dowager Countess of Carlisle. == Early life == Isabella was the eldest child of William, 4th Baron Byron and his much-younger third wife Frances Berkeley. Five younger brothers quickly followed, including William, 5th Baron Byron and navy officer John Byron (the grandfather of the poet Lord Byron). Her childhood was divided between the Byrons' ancestral seat at Newstead Abbey in Nottinghamshire, and their London townhouse on Great Marlborough Street. == Marriages and issue == At the age of 21, Isabella married 49-year-old widower Henry Howard, 4th Earl of Carlisle and became mistress of Castle Howard in Yorkshire. The couple had five children: * Anne Howard (1744‚Äì99), a Lady of the Bedchamber to Princess Amelia * Frances Howard (1745‚Äì1808), who married John Radcliffe * Elizabeth Howard (1747‚Äì1813), who firstly married Peter Delme and, secondly, Charles Garnier * Frederick Howard, 5th Earl of Carlisle (1748‚Äì1825), who married Caroline Leveson-Gower * Juliana Howard (1750‚Äì1849) Following the death of her husband in 1758, Isabella rushed into a whirlwind engagement with a lawyer and art historian 14 years her junior, Sir William Musgrave, 6th Baronet. The marriage began happily, but the two slowly discovered they were mismatched and separated in 1769. == Years abroad and reputation == Following her separation, Isabella spent 13 years travelling Europe, taking in France, Switzerland and Italy. Unable to resist the prospect of romance, she incurred the wrath of her frustrated son first by encouraging an unsuitable match for her youngest daughter Juliana, and then becoming increasingly reliant on the company of a German soldier. Though repeatedly urged to return to England, she instead continued on her travels, racking up debts and eventually attempting to pass off her companion as a German aristocrat in order to allow him access to royal courts. While travelling she entertained herself by writing a compilation of 'maxims' intended as general matrimonial and etiquette advice for younger female relatives and friends. When living in Paris shortly before the French Revolution, she was visited by her notorious nephew Jack Byron (father of the poet Lord Byron) and was persuaded to give him money and attempt to heal the growing rift between him and his long-suffering parents. == Writing and later life == Isabella immersed herself in the arts, being admired as a talented singer, musical hostess, sketcher and poet. Her poetry was circulated amongst fashionable friends, and one particularly admired defense of the passions, written in the 1750s, was published in 1771. When eventually compelled to return to England, Isabella settled at Bath and sought a publisher for her compilation of etiquette advice ‚Äì it was published as Thoughts in the Form of Maxims in the winter of 1789, and immediately stirred up interest amongst those who thought her entirely unqualified to be giving advice on proper conduct. Cut off from society by lack of funds and social disapproval of her escapades abroad, Isabella died at home in Bath on 22 January 1795 and was buried in the nearby village of Weston the following week. == Bibliography == * Emily Brand, The Fall of the House of Byron (John Murray, 2020). * Christopher Ridgeway, 'Isabella, Fourth Countess of Carlisle: No Life by Halves', in Maids and Mistresses: Celebrating 300 Years of Women and the Yorkshire Country House, ed.

The park was created in , just a year after Sydney's founding, making it the oldest of Sydney's parks. Wentworth Park incorporates the Kiwanis Bandshell, a playground, fountains, and a splash pad, as well as a network of paved paths surrounding the park's ponds and flower beds. The park centres around Wentworth Creek, which forms a series of interconnected ponds. The park encompass within the former city's boundaries. It is centrally located on the edge of the city's downtown core. Wentworth Park is divided into two distinct sections by Bentinck Street, which creates a connection from the Sydney Waterfront District to either end of Wentworth Park. A playground for young children is located in the east section of the park. ==Park features== Wentworth Park Kiwannis Bandshell, July 2017 ===Bandshell=== Since before the construction of the concrete bandshell, musical performances were drawing audiences to the park. In 1915, the Sydney Woman's council raised money for a circular bandshell and flower beds. By 1917, a Coronation Band was playing in the park, entertaining people paddling canoes in the Creek. This old bandshell was removed and a new wooden one located over the run of the former Morrison's Mill in 1960. The Kiwanis Club replaced this with the present brick and concrete bandshell in 1962. In 1967, Sydney celebrated Canada's Centennial with the lighting of the Centennial flame at the bandshell, and a concert in the bandshell, attended by HRH Queen Mother Elizabeth, Lieutenant Governor and Mrs. H.P. McKeen, Member of the Canadian Parliament for Inverness‚ÄîRichmond Allan MacEachen, Mayor of Sydney Mayor Carlin Neville, and other dignitaries and members of the public. Wentworth Park Playground 3 left Orangemen War Memorial in Wentworth Park ===The Orangemen War Memorial=== The Grand Orange Lodge of British America, more commonly known as the Grand Orange Lodge of Canada or simply Orange Order in Canada, is the Canadian branch of the Orange Order, a Protestant fraternal organization that began in County Armagh, Ireland, in 1795. It has played a large part in the history of Canada, with many prominent members including four Prime Ministers. The Orangemen War Memorial in Wentworth Park commemorates members of the Orange Order from Cape Breton County who died while serving in the armed forces in World War I. It was installed in the park first in 1921, at a site next to George Street, near the intersection of Argyle Street. A new frontispiece was set on the monument to include Orangemen from Cape Breton County who were lost in the Second World War, with an unveiling on 7 July 1946. In 1999, working with a local disabled community activist (who raised 50% of the cost), the Cape Breton Regional Municipality (CBRM) relocated the Orangemen War Memorial from its non- accessible location to a now full accessible location in the Park next to the Anne Terry Pavilion. ==Park access== * Transit Cape Breton Route 13 drops at Wentworth Park throughout the day. * CBRM Handi-Trans is able to drop passengers off right at the entrance to the park, especially for special events. * Asphalt paths are free of obstacles for those utilizing mobility aids. * Accessible washrooms are available on site during the summer months. * Service animals are permitted in the park, as are dogs on leash, except in the Playground. * Parking is available to the west of King's Road, connecting to the rest of the park by crosswalk and by a pedestrian tunnel.

The markers, with anchors carved into the stone, indicating that the land belonged to the Admiralty, were placed at four locations. One was located on George Street, one off Argyle Street, not far from the present bandshell, another, now lost, at King's Road and Byng Avenue, and this one at the corner of present Crescent Street and King's Road. ===Admiralty reserve=== Wentworth Creek rises in the hills east of Sydney bringing fresh water to the harbour; it probably served Spanish and Basque fishermen in the 16TH and 17TH centuries as a place to replenish their water supplies and was a factor in Joseph F.W. DesBarres' decision in choosing the location of Sydney as his colonial capital. Hence its earlier name: Freshwater Creek. In 1786, John Wentworth, the Surveyour-General visited Sydney to set aside valuable white pine stands on its shores for the use of the Royal Navy. Wentworth reserved a strip on both sides of the Creek between present King's Road, Great George Street and Argyle Street as Admiralty Lands, to be used as either a government shipyard or a timber reserve. DesBarres named the stream \\"Wentworth Creek\\" in his honour. In 1790, the shipbuilding industry began in Sydney when Philip Ingouville, a native of the Channel Islands, built the first ship here, the NANCY, at the mouth of Wentworth Creek. His workers settled in the area below the Creek which is still known as the Shipyard. A street in the area still bears his name. Wentworth Creek, Tannery Bridge, ca. 1882 A bridge was built over the mouth of the Creek on King's Road by the 1870s but in 1900 there was still no bridge on Bentinck Street. The path along the north shore of the Creek was still secluded enough to afford privacy to young courting couples; hence the name \\"Lovers Lane\\" which it kept util 1926 when it was changed to Byng Avenue to honour Governor General Byng who visited Sydney at that time. The British Government never made use of the reserve, but instead leased land along the north shore of the creek. Richard and Joseph Dobson of Westmount built a dam on the Creek and the present Argyle Street and erected a gristmill for the grinding of grain. Photos of the Park from around 1895 show the old mill building near the site of the existing Bandshell. The Dobsons sold the mill to Murdock Morrison, who with his son ran the mill both as a grist mill and wool carding mill until 1913. The road that led to the mill from the countryside, now Argyle Street, was know ans the \\"Old Mill Road\\". In 1946, the city of Sydney bought the land. In 1899, a railway bridge for the Intercolonial Railway was built at the site of the present crossing. There is anecdotal evidence that ships anchored as far up Wentworth Creek as the site of the existing rail bridge. Construction of the bridge would have limited passage up Wentworth Creek and reduced the use of the creek for transportation. This was probably the single most significant alteration to the Creek. ===Wentworth Park=== Wentworth Park Poastcard, cir. 1910-1920 Wentworth Park has been integral to life in Sydney and area for more than two hundred years. While the park existed, and was in use in 1786, the form and use were significantly different from the Park of the 1900s. While the area in the early 1800s was certainly different from today, photographs from the early 1900s show a Park that current residents of Sydney would recognize. During the sudden boom in Sydney in the first decade of the 20TH Century, houses were built along the Creek. Despite this, people continued to use the Admiralty lands as a park, with many boats and canoes on the ponds, and families picnicking on the lawns. In 1903, town official decided to turn the area into a park and began moves to purchase the land. By 1913, the federal government recommended to the Admiralty the city annex all lots not held under lease for park purposes. In 1923, landfill was brought in which narrowed the lower end of the Creek by two-thirds. In 1928, two swans were given to the park from the royal Swannery and a swan house was constructed. Finally, in 1934, the Canadian Department of the Interior took over the land form the Admiralty and turned it over to the city. The property leases were closed out one by one, the last house, owned by the Rudderham family, was removed in 1956. The city then extended the park from George Street to King's Road and by 1961, the park assumed its present boundaries. The modern history of the Park shows fewer changes than occurred during the first one hundred years of use. During the 1960s, the Kiwanis Club built the Bandshell, the first major change to the Park since the turn of the last century. More recently, gabion baskets were installed to limit erosion of the banks along the waters edge. ===Donald Marshall, Jr.=== Donald Marshall, Jr., at the time 17, was convicted of murdering acquaintance Sandy Seale in 1971 and sentenced to life in prison. The two had confronted Roy Ebsary, an older man they encountered in Wentworth Park, during the late evening with the intent to \\"roll a drunk\\". A short scuffle occurred and Seale fell mortally wounded by a knife blow. Ebsary admitted that he had stabbed Seale but then lied about his role to the police who immediately focused on Marshall, who was 'known to them' from previous incidents. After this first trial, which took place in the Cape Breton County Courthouse overlooking this park, Marshall spent 11 years in jail before being acquitted by the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in 1983. A witness came forward to say he had seen another man stab Seale, and several prior witness statements pinpointing Marshall were recanted. Ebsary was subsequently tried and convicted of manslaughter. The Crown Attorney's failure to provide full disclosure (contradictory and coerced statements by witnesses, because they believed the evidence not provided had no bearing in the case) brought about changes in the Canadian rules of evidence regarding disclosure. The prosecution must provide full disclosure without determination on what may be useful to the defence (that is the defence's duty to decide). Donald Marshall Jr. rose to prominence again as the primary petitioner in the landmark Supreme Court of Canada case of R v Marshall [1999] 3 SCR 45 regarding native fishing rights. The Court held that Donald Marshall's catching and selling of eels was valid under 1760 and 1761 treaties between the Mi'kmaq and Britain, and that federal fishery regulations governing a closed fishing season and the regulating and the requirement of licenses to fish and sell the catch would infringe the treaty right. ===1985 Kiwanis Club Bicentennial Redevelopment=== In 1985, the Kiwanis Club sponsored a bicentennial redevelopment of Wentworth Park to celebrate 200 years of use. The redevelopment included the addition of the Ann Terry Memorial Plaza, which included a large gazebo, fountain, and archway. This addition was constructed on the north side of the largest pond off Byng Avenue. It was replaced during the 2007 redevelopment by the Ann Terry Interactive Fountain and Plaza. ==Wentworth Park Revitalization 2003-2010== === Background === In the summer of 2003, Ekistics Planning & Design (Ekistics), in association with ADI Ltd., were selected by the Cape Breton Regional Municipality as the design consultants to prepare a revitalization plan for Wentworth Park in downtown Sydney. Several public interviews and workshops were conducted to gauge community interest and support and these findings formed the basis for revitalization recommendations for Wentworth Park. In the spring of 2005, another series of public meetings were held to discuss the future of Wentworth Park and unveil the revitalization plan developed by Ekistics. The consensus at this public meeting was that there should be a local volunteer group formed to oversee the use and maintenance of the Park along with ensuring recommendations from the Ekistics Plan were considered. At that public meeting, where nearly sixty people were in attendance, a steering committee consisting of fifteen volunteers was formed under the name Friends of Wentworth Park. left ===Friends of Wentworth Park Society=== The Friends of Wentworth Park Society (FWPS) was a non-profit stewardship organization run by an eleven-member Board of Directors consisting of volunteer citizens of the Cape Breton Regional Municipality. The steering committee met weekly for more than two months to come up with the parameters for the \\"Friends of Wentworth Park Society\\". The steering committee developed a mission statement, a set of objectives and committees to take back to the public for comment and approval. The steering committee held a public meeting at the end of May to present its vision for the future of Wentworth Park. At that meeting there was an election of a Board of Directors and the Friends of Wentworth Park Society (FWPS) was formed. Seven members were elected at large and four seats were designated, one for the Kiwanis Club, one for CBRM Council, one for the business community and one for youth. This ensured a wide and diverse representation on the board. The board held its first meeting in June 2005 and elected an executive. They were as follows: * Wayne Weatherbee ‚Äì chair * Alan Peddle ‚Äì vice chair * Doug Arsenault ‚Äì treasurer * Nicole MacLennan ‚Äì secretary ===Revitalization Phase I=== A $2.3 million renovation to the western section of the park and its facilities began in 2005. At this time all of King's Road (Hwy 4) within the city's limits was undergoing a complete reconstruction, part of which included a realignment of the roadbed where it formed the western border of the park. This work would result in a newly elevated section King's Road across the end of the park, which would take from the lower pond and change access to existing sidewalks and crosswalks. The planned elevation of the reconstructed roadway allowed for the construction of a lighted pedestrian underpass under King's Road as part of a larger plan to connect the park to the Sydney Waterfront Boardwalk on one side and Rotary Park on the other. The renovations also included a new network of connected paved asphalt pathways and path lighting, more natural looking stone riprap borders on the pond's shores for erosion control and shoreline protection, a new elevated concrete temple within brick paver terraces overlooking the pond, and three new floating fountains that lit up at night to improve aeration and water quality. As part of the work, the existing Ann Terry Memorial Plaza and fountain were replaced with The Ann Terry Interactive Fountain, with surrounding paver areas, seating, new trees, and other landscaping. ===Revitalization Phase II=== The $750,000 Phase II project, which was underway by August 2008, involved modifications to Wentworth Creek where it flowed through the park. The largest alteration involved the construction of a box culvert to extend the run of the creek beyond the front of the bandshell to allow the area immediately before the performing space to be infilled, creating a lawn for audience seating. A second large concrete culvert was installed in parallel to the creek's run below the bandshell to allow for additional water flow to help prevent flooding of the bandshell area during heavy rain events. Other watercourse changes included improved and more natural looking stone riprap shorelines along the pond, a sloped access area to the pond for skaters in winter, an upgrade to the small dam at Bentinck Street which saw a fish ladder added. Wentworth Park Construction - Revitalization Phase III - November 2009 ===Revitalization Phase III=== Phase III ran almost concurrently with Phase II, starting in 2008 but carrying on into 2009, at a cost of $850,000. This part of the overall project included a new 'tot' playground, improved accessible pathways with lighting, landscaping, inducing tree planting, and restoration of the park's bandshell itself which has been an important landmark in the area for generations. A floating fountain, lit up at night, was placed in the bandshell pond. A new entry arch was created by Cape Breton artist Gordon Kennedy and installed at the intersection of Byng and Bentinck Streets. Kennedy also created artistic stands for interpretive story boards to explain the park's history. ===Grand Opening=== A Grand Opening was held on Sunday 1 August 2010 to celebrate the completion of the park's revitalization project. ===Park expansion=== In 2005 CBRM developed an additional section of land along King's Road, bordering on Sydney Harbour, adding it to Wentworth Park. The area was landscaped with trees and shrubs, a gravel path was laid out through the lawn area, and a paved parking area for the public was created. ==Gallery== File:Wentworth Park Playground 4.jpgWentworth Park Playground File:Wentworth Park, Nova Scotia-July in Cape Breton-002.jpgWentworth Bandshell & East Pond File:Wentworth park, Sydney (26493078967).jpgWentworth Park Gazebo File:Wentworth park, Sydney (40469228475).jpgWentworth Park, Gazebo & West Pond File:Wentworth park, Sydney (26493080737).jpgWentworth Park Fountains & West Pond File:Wentworth Park, Sydney (6579267015).jpgWentworth Park Fountains & West Pond File:01-20151111 Orangemen War Memorial in Wentworth Park, Sydney.jpgThe Orangemen War Memorial in Wentworth Park ==References== ==External links== * Google Map of Wentworth Park * Video - Wentworth Park Grand Opening 2010 - Sydney, Nova Scotia Category:Tourist attractions in Cape Breton County Category:Parks in the Cape Breton Regional Municipality ","title":"Wentworth Park, Nova Scotia"},{"id":"63849685","text":"How to Fix a Drug Scandal is an American true crime documentary miniseries that was released on Netflix on April 1, 2020. The premise revolves around documentary filmmaker Erin Lee Carr following the effects of crime drug lab chemist Sonja Farak and Annie Dookhan and their tampering with evidence and its aftereffects. Dookhan was accused of forging reports and tampering with samples to produce desired results. Farak was accused of tampering with the evidence she was tasked with analyzing by using it to get high herself. The actions of both women, who acted independently, resulted in tens of thousands of drug counts being dismissed, the largest single mass dismissal of criminal cases in U.S. history. How to Fix a Drug Scandal depicts the role of former Attorney General of Massachusetts Martha Coakley, who was accused of political cover up. == Cast == * Scott Allen * Karl Kenzler * Daniel Marx * Shawn Musgrave * Shannon O'Neill * Jared Olanoff * Luke Ryan * Paul Solotaroff * David Sullivan * Daniel Conley * Amy Farak * Linda Farak * Maura Healey * Matt Segal * Madelyn Vazquez * Robin Whitney * Deborah Becker == Release == How to Fix a Drug Scandal was released on April 1, 2020, on Netflix. == References Category:2020 American television series debuts Category:2020 American television series endings Category:2020s American documentary television series Category:English-language television shows Category:Netflix original documentary television series Category:Documentary television series about crime in the United States Category:English-language Netflix original programming Category:Television shows set in Massachusetts ","title":"How to Fix a Drug Scandal"},{"id":"63849695","text":"Gonsalvo Monroy was a nobleman that served as Count of Malta between 1421 and 1427. Monroy served as a feudal lord of Malta, and was unpopular due to various heavy taxes being introduced, and this may have been one of the causes why the population was living in poverty. The population of Gozo revolted in 1425, with the peak being reached in 1426, when Maltese ransacked Monroy's residence in Mdina, and blocking the Castrum Maris in Birgu (where Monroy's wife, Donna Costanza, was). The Maltese people were ready to buy out the land from Monroy, and a deal was struck between Gonsalvo Monroy's administration and a Maltese nobleman, Antonio Inguanez, who offered his two sons in exchange of Lady Constance of Monroy. The sum to be paid was 30,000 florins, which however was still a hefty sum, and the local population never managed to settle, and Monroy relieved the debt in his will. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing Category:1428 deaths Category:Feudalism in Europe Category:15th century in Malta Category:Heads of state of Malta Category:Kingdom of Sicily people ","title":"Gonsalvo Monroy"},{"id":"63849700","text":"James Moir (1900 ‚Äì 11 February 1961) was a Canadian soccer player who played as a defender for Toronto Ulster United and for Canada. == Career == Moir was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, and moved to Toronto, Canada in 1913.

Barrios was a home care worker for 18 years and notably worked 24-hour shifts for over 14 years, five days a week. She developed severe asthma and heart problems as a result. On May 2, 2020, the Aint I A Woman? campaign reported that Barrios had died of COVID-19. Barrios was working to distribute Personal Protective Equipment to home care workers throughout New York City shortly before she contracted COVID-19. Barrios worked with the Ain't I A Woman? campaign to change the state of New York's labor regulations which permitted agencies to pay workers only 13 hours for a 24-hour workday. Some workers had been required to work shifts of five to six days straight, which Barrios and others recognized as an inhumane policy. Barrios recognized that she did this work \\"at a huge cost to my health.\\" She was told by her doctor that she could no longer work these hours because of her depleting health. However, Allcare Homecare Agency, the home care agency she worked for, refused to give her work other than 24-hour shifts, which left Barrios unemployed. When Barrios and other workers complained about unpaid wages to the agency, they were reportedly threatened with deportation by Allcare, who would report them to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. An objective of the Ain't I A Woman? campaign was achieved in September 2018 when a court decision ruled that the practice of paying workers for half of a 24-hour shift was \\"null and void.\\" Barrios expressed her approval of the ruling, stating \\"I feel happy! We face so much abuse working these 24-hour shifts ‚Äî and they only pay us for half! We do this work because patients need this care around the clock. But working all this 24-hour shifts has hurt my health, my family.\\" The Allcare Homecare Agency was forced by New York Attorney General Letitia James in 2019 to pay a settlement of over $450,000 for regularly only paying workers \\"for 13 hours when they had worked more than that during 24-hour shifts ‚Äî all while taking home minimum wage and looking after disabled and elderly New Yorkers.\\" In response to the attorney general's ruling, Barrios was supportive and stated \\"we‚Äôre human beings. We have families and we have people we care for with serious health issues.\\" On March 2, 2020, Barrios was one of over 200 workers protesting Governor Andrew Cuomo calling for vetoing the Securing Wages Earned Against Theft (SWEAT) bill, which would have given workers and the New York Department of Labor the tools to hold employers accountable to the state's labor laws. The bill had been in the works for many years and had passed both houses of New York's state legislature in 2019 before being vetoed by Cuomo. Barrios supported the bill for addressing wage theft, which amounts to an estimated $1 billion in New York every year, stating ‚Äúall of us workers need SWEAT because we need to collect our stolen wage. But Cuomo doesn‚Äôt care about us. Instead of defending us, he‚Äôs defending the bosses who are criminals. He‚Äôs helping the criminals.‚Äù At the protests, Barrios could reportedly be heard from miles away. ==Death== Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, Barrios continued calling other home care workers about the conditions they were enduring as health workers who were not given protective equipment and how this could be addressed. Barrios positioned the responsibility for these failures on Governor Cuomo. On May 2, 2020, the Aint I A Woman? campaign reported that Barrios had died of COVID-19. Barrios is remembered by members of the National Mobilization Against Sweatshops (NMASS) as a fearless organizer and fighter of injustice. In a statement on her death, the organization affirmed \\"while we are grieving, we are also angry. And we will use this anger to keep fighting to change our system that robs people of their time, their health, and their livelihoods, in Justa‚Äôs spirit. We love her, and we‚Äôll take her with us.\\" == References == Category:American women trade unionists Category:Deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City Category:2020 deaths ","title":"Justa Barrios"},{"id":"63849812","text":"Jos√© El√≠as Rauda Guti√©rrez O.F.M.

In 1810, John Knight started making candles and soaps, in his spare time, using scraps of material from his job working for a grocer in London. The son of a farmer, Knight was about 18 years old when he established a company in London that would last for 200 years. ==Early life== John Knight was born on Christmas Day in 1792 to a large Quaker family of farmers in Hertfordshire, England. He left home at the age of 15, with only the money in his pocket, and set off to try and make his fortune in London. First, he served as an indentured apprentice in a grocer's shop in the Mile End, East London. There, Knight learned the art of tallow candle dipping. ==Career== Jigsaw for John Knight's \\"Family Health Soap\\" Knight saw an untapped demand for soap while working in the working-class neighborhood of Wapping in East London. His goal was to make affordable products that would work well and that everyone would enjoy using. In 1817, John Knight Soap Works was officially established in the industrial area of Wapping, East London. The company was renamed John Knight & Sons when five sons joined the business in the 1840s. For decades, Knight provided candles and washing soaps to the royal family in London. In recognition, John Knight & Sons were awarded a Royal Warrant that officially branded the company as Soap Makers to King Edward VII, in 1903. It was also during this year that the name of Primrose Soap was changed to The Royal Primrose Soap. In 1906, the soap and candle company went public as John Knight, Ltd. The first of John Knight's factories was based next to the London Docks by the River Thames. This was a busy industrial area of town. The company hired and trained hundreds of local workers for the factory in East London. The business became known for producing high-quality Primrose Soap, Castile soap, and \\"John Knight's Family Health Soap\\" to promote public health. John Knight's soaps, oils and candles were used in hospitals and by families throughout England. ===Primrose Soap=== The soap of those early days was dark in color, and the consumption small; Knight revolutionized the trade by manufacturing a high-quality pale yellow soap, which he named \\"Primrose Soap\\". ===Family business=== John Knight Ltd, Soap Makers to King George V Knight was one of the first companies in London to hire women to work in factories during World War I. They supported reducing factory shifts from 12 hours down to a reasonable 8 hours. This strategy increased the number of workers hired and improved productivity. The company was one of the first in London to provide an annual bonus and a pension for retired workers. They supported local schools and provided recreational opportunities for employees who worked in the factory for decades. ==John Knight & Sons== Over the years, John Knight ramped up his manufacturing business since the products were in high demand throughout England, Australia and America. As the business grew, his five sons joined him to run the company. In 1871, William Knight (John's first son) was head of the company with 300 employees. Soap manufacturer Charles Upfold served his apprenticeship as a soap maker with John Knight & Co. at their Wapping factory in London. John Knight's company was officially sanctioned as \\"Soap Makers to the King\\". The factory became known as The Royal Primrose Soap Works in Silvertown. ==Business in England== John Knight & Sons Silvertown Soap Works The candle, oils and soap business was established in 1817 in Radcliff Way, and when the business expanded they moved to larger premises at Old Gravel Lane, Wapping, in 1836. The large factory was located near the London Docks in Wapping, East London. The location near the River Thames allowed for the supply of raw materials and easy distribution of products by river or road. The company expanded the product line to include oils, glue, shaving soap, perfume and other items. In 1891, the company was listed in the London Directory. Knight's Carbolic Soap was produced around 1890 before Lifebuoy soap was developed in 1895. Later, the company reformulated the carbolic soap, previously made from coal tar, and branded it as Family Health Soap. The affordable soaps produced by John Knight & Sons helped to prevent disease and keep citizens healthy. The soap company promoted hand washing via print publications and postcards. Their public messaging of cleanliness was especially important during wars and disease epidemics. The anti-bacterial soap was distributed to soldiers and POWs during the wars. ==Notes== ==References== Category:1792 births Category:1864 deaths Category:19th-century British people Category:English industrialists Category:People from Hertfordshire Category:Soaps ","title":"John Knight (soap maker)"},{"id":"63850043","text":" W-101 or No. 101 (Japanese: Á¨¨Áôæ‰∏ÄËôüÊéÉÊµ∑Ëâá) was a that was seized by the Imperial Japanese Navy before completion during World War II and converted into a convoy escort. ==History== She was laid down on 12 July 1941, at the Hong Kong shipyard of Taikoo Dockyard and Engineering Company as HMS Portland. In September 1941, while still under construction, she was renamed HMS Taitam. On 26 December 1941, still unfinished, she was seized by the Japanese after the Fall of Hong Kong. The Japanese continued construction and she was launched on 20 February 1943 and renamed W-101. On 10 April 1944, she was completed, commissioned, and attached to the Yokosuka Naval District under Lieutenant Commandeer Ginji Yamashita. She spent most of 1944 on escort duty and conducting minesweeping activities between Japanese controlled ports in the Philippines (Manila, Zamboanga, Basilan Island), Borneo (Tarakan, Laut Island, Balikpapan), Flores Island (Maumere), Java (Surabaya), and Sulawesi (Macassar). ===Convoy MI-27=== On 15 November 1944, she departed Moji, Kitaky≈´sh≈´ destined for Miri, Borneo with Type C escort ship CD-61, Type D escort ship CD-134, and s and Cha-157 escorting convoy MI-27 consisting of four tankers (Awagawa Maru, Kyokuun Maru, Osakasan Maru, and Enkei Maru) and six transport/cargo ships (, Shoho Maru, Matsuura Maru, , Koshu Maru, and Chinkai Maru). Enkei Maru and Kyokuun Maru developed mechanical problems and were forced to return to Moji. The convoy was running parallel to Convoy Hi-81 which had left Imari on 14 November 1944 destined for Formosa to benefit from air cover provided by HI-81's escort carrier which was carrying fourteen Nakajima B5N \\"Kate\\" torpedo bombers of the 931st Air Squadron, Saeki Naval Air Station. The two convoys converged together at times. On 17 November 1944, in the Yellow Sea off Cheju Island, MI-27 was spotted by US submarines and which were operating in a wolfpack with . Sunfish torpedoed and damaged both Edogawa Maru and Seisho Maru while Peto torpedoed and sank Osakasan Maru (killing 142). Nearby, Spadefish spotted Shin'y≈ç of HI-81 and fired six torpedoes four of which hit causing the carrier to burst into flames and sink (killing 1,130). W-101 and CD-61 were unattached from MI-27 to pick up survivors. On 18 November 1944, Sunfish torpedoed and sank the damaged Seisho Maru (killing 448) and the damaged Edogawa Maru (killing 2,083); while Peto torpedoed and sank Chinkai Maru (killing 39). After losing four of the eight ships being escorted, the remainder of convoy MI-27 arrived at Sijiao Island on 19 November 1944. ===Convoy Tama-33=== On 30 November 1944, W-101 departed Takao for Manila escorting landing craft depot ships and Kibitsu Maru along with escorts , the Daito, and four Type D escort ships (CD-14, CD-16, CD-46, and CD-134). The convoy diverted and disembarked its troops at San Fernando, Luzon due to enemy air attacks at Manila. ===Convoy HI-85=== On 29 December 1944, she joined convoy HI-85 in the South China Sea consisting of the light cruiser , two Ukuru-class escort ships (Ukuru and Daito), and three Type C escort ships (CD-23, CD-27, CD-51) in escorting nine tankers (Enkei Maru, Yamazawa Maru, Engen Maru, Encho Maru, Daigyo Maru, Otususan Maru, Fuei Maru, Oei Maru, Seria Maru) and one cargo ship (Shinyu Maru). After several unsuccessful attacks by B-24 Liberator bombers, the convoy arrived at Cap Saint-Jacques on 4 January 1945. ===Demise=== On 11 January 1945, W-101 along with CD-35, CD-43, patrol boat No. 103, and subchaser CH-31 left Cap Saint Jacques escorting convoy SATA-05 consisting of two transports (Kensei Maru, Toyo Maru), a (T-149), and three tankers (Ayayuki Maru, Koshin Maru, Eihi Maru) (T-149 was unable to handle the heavy seas and returned to Cap St Jacques).

She is a Professor of Political Science at the University of Bristol. Guerrina studies the gendered effects of public policies and the way that policies are shaped by gendered hierarchies, with a particular focus on European Union policies pertaining to defense and security. She has also written extensively about the effects that Brexit will have on women, about the politics of motherhood, and about European identity. ==Career== Since 2019 Guerrina has been a professor of political science at The University of Bristol, where she has also been Director of the Gender Research Centre. Before that, she held the Jean Monnet Chair in EU Gender Politics at the University of Surrey, and was the Director for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion there. Guerrina co-founded the \\"Gendering EU Studies\\" research network. In 2002, Guerrina published the book Europe: History, Ideas and Ideologies. This introductory textbook takes an interdisciplinary approach to European studies. Guerrina describes the historical construction of European identity in terms of how it defines otherness and positions the notion of Europe as a whole in contrast to the rest of the world. The text also treats the question of whether or not a more inclusive pan-European identity could be constructed. In 2005, Guerrina published Mothering the Union: Gender politics in the EU. Mothering the Union applies a feminist understanding of equality and the relationship between the public and the private to study policies of the European Union throughout the 1990s which relate to motherhood, including Directive 92/85/EEC. This book followed previous studies that Guerrina published on the topic of maternity in the European Union, such as her 2002 article \\"Mothering in Europe: Feminist Critique of European Policies on Motherhood and Employment\\" in The European Journal of Women's Studies. Since Brexit, Guerrina has studied the question of how Brexit will affect women. She has found evidence that the original Brexit referendum had low levels of political participation by women, partly because of a systematic exclusion of women from media narratives in advance of the referendum and also because the framing of Brexit largely excluded major implications of the referendum in areas like social policy that are systematically important to women. As further evidence of this pattern, she also noted that a large number of women Members of Parliament had left politics in response to Brexit. In order to correct this bias and ensure that issues which are systematically important to women were included in the deals that followed Brexit, Guerrina argued that gender would need to be a major part of the Brexit negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union. Guerrina's work on the gendered effects of policies, particularly the consequences of Brexit for women, have been cited in media outlets like The New York Times, Cosmopolitan, and France 24. ==Selected works== *Europe: History, ideas and ideologies (2002) *\\"Mothering in Europe: Feminist Critique of European Policies on Motherhood and Employment\\", European Journal of Women's Studies (2002) *Mothering the Union: Gender politics in the EU (2010) ==References== Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:British women academics Category:British political scientists Category:20th-century British women writers Category:21st-century British women writers Category:Women political scientists ","title":"Roberta Guerrina"},{"id":"63850052","text":" Bolton was launched at Liverpool in 1792.

Basel had suffered relegation the previous season and their clear aim was to obtain immediate promotion. The Nationalliga B was contested by 14 teams. The two teams that finished at the top of the division were to be promoted and the two teams that finished in last and second last position in the league table would be relegated. Basel played a good season, winning 19 league matches, drawing five, losing only two matches. Thus they ended the season with 43 points in 1st position four points ahead of Urania Gen√®ve Sport in 2nd position and these two clubs won promotion.

The peak is situated north-northeast of Skagway, and south of Mount Cleveland, on land managed by Tongass National Forest. As the highpoint on the divide between the Taiya River and the Skagway River, precipitation runoff from the mountain drains east into the Skagway River and west into Taiya River, both of which empty into Taiya Inlet. Although modest in elevation, relief is significant since Mount Carmack rises 6,800 feet above the Taiya valley in less than , and 5,800 feet above Skagway valley in about 2 miles. Mount Carmack has a lower subsidiary summit, elevation , about to the northeast of the true summit. The USGS map has this lower northeast peak labelled as Mount Carmack. This mountain was named in 1898 by John A. Flemer of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, undoubtedly for George Carmack (1860‚Äì1922), whose discovery of large gold nuggets at Bonanza Creek in 1896 resulted in the Klondike Gold Rush.Donald J. Orth, Dictionary of Alaska Place Names, 1967, page 187. The Chilkoot Trail, a route which was used by thousands heading to the goldfields, skirts along the western base of this mountain, whereas the Klondike Highway traverses the eastern base of the mountain. Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park is located on both sides of the mountain, but the peak is not within the park boundary. ==Climate== Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Carmack has a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and cool summers. Weather systems coming off the Gulf of Alaska are forced upwards by the Coast Mountains (orographic lift), causing heavy precipitation in the form of rainfall and snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. This climate supports glaciers on all slopes surrounding the summit. The months May through July offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing Mount Carmack. ==See also== *List of mountain peaks of Alaska *Geography of Alaska 120px ==References== ==External links== * Mount Carmack: weather forecast Carmack Carmack ","title":"Mount Carmack"},{"id":"63850122","text":"Ieva Melanija Kibirk≈°tis (born 2 April 1991) is a Canadian-raised Lithuanian football manager and a former player who played as a forward.

Under this policy, for every franc spent on a project in Wallonia, a franc was also spent on a similar project in Flanders (and vice versa.) The social and linguistic divisions between Flanders and Wallonia meant that the coalition and compromise of waffle-iron politics helped to maintain peace. However, matching spending in one region with equal allocations to the other was costly and inefficient. Waffle-iron politics was a key cause of the Belgian national debt. In 1981, public debt amounted to 13% of GNP, among the highest in the European Union at the time. Waffle-iron politics also led to the creation of several (large useless works): misplaced or unnecessary public structures. One example is the bridges in Varsenare, two bridges built in 1976 that were never connected to a highway. The Dutch word literally translates to \\"waffle-iron politics\\" or \\"waffle-iron policy\\". The name is based on the idea that the waffle-iron leaves an identical impression on each side of the waffle. Both sides of the iron are necessary in order for the machine to function. Waffle- iron politics effectively came to an end in 1988 with the third state reform in Belgium. Belgium went from a unitary state to a federal one, giving each region more decision-making power. Flanders and Wallonia became responsible for their own spending, except in matters affecting the entire state. ==See also== * Politics of Belgium * Logrolling ==References== Category:Politics of Belgium Category:Political terminology Category:Public choice theory ","title":"Waffle-iron politics"},{"id":"63850419","text":"Valentyna Petrivna Kotyk (; born 8 January 1978) is a Ukrainian football manager and a former player who played as a defender.

He can be considered a martyr of free thinking. Only one source about Gesualdo exists, and its truthfulness has been questioned in later years. ==Lutheran monk== According to the narrative, Gesuald was a French monk who lived in Malta. Around 1535, he founded the Confraternity of Good Christians (La Confraternit√† dei Buoni Cristiani), where members discussed ideas of Martin Luther, such as marriage among priests. His teachings became popular, especially with Maltese nobility, such as Matteo Falson and his son (who carried the same name), and Pietro Cumbo. ==Condemnation== In 1545, he was denounced to Grand Master of the Order of the Knights of Saint John by the notary public Jacopo Baldacchino. Domenico Cubelles, then Bishop of Malta, investigated the matter. However, before 1564, Inquisition was not present in Malta, with such matters falling under the Inquisitor of Palermo. Therefore, the Bishop and the Grand Master Juan de Homedes, since they were concerned with the Reformation ideals starting to arise in the Maltese territory, led the investigation together. Gesualdo was found guilty of heresy and was incarcerated in the gaols of Fort Saint Angelo. He was released not too long after due to good conduct. In the beginning of the 1550s, he reprised illegally preaching Protestantism with the help of another priest by the name of Andrea Axac (or Axiak). Once again, he was denounced in 1554, together with a group of 28 others. On 5 November 1554, a tribunal of the Order defrocked him due to preaching heresy, before he was put in front of Bishop Cubelles. Most of the accused, including the priest Axac, agreed to abjure their sins, but Gesualdo, who maintained his faith, was condemned to the burnt alive. On the stake Gesualdo continued to preach marriage among priests. He was burnt alive in the main square of Birgu. == Re- examination == Later re-examination of the original documents by scholars has indicated that Gesualdo is not French, but from Calabria, Italy. ==References== Category:French monks Category:Monks ","title":"Francesco Gesualdo"},{"id":"63850466","text":"Emily Bonser (born 27 October 1995) is a retired Australian rules footballer who played for West Coast in the AFL Women's (AFLW). ==AFLW career== Bonser joined West Coast for their inaugural season.

Multiple transcription factors binding sites are associated with the promoter such as ERE, C2H2, and TFIIBGenomatix, Promoter: FAM155B. === RNA-level regulation === There are no known miRNA target sites in FAM155B. Many stem-loop structures are predicted from the 3' UTR of human FAM155B and close orthologsQuickfold: FAM155B. This indicates some conservation of secondary mRNA structures among different species. === Protein-level regulation ===  Localization  Human FAM155B along with closely related orthologs are most likely to be localized in the endoplasmic reticulum with a prediction of 34.8%. Following this, the protein is likely to be found in the plasma membrane with a prediction of 21.7%PSORTII Server: FAM155B .  Post-translational modification  FAM155B has two proposed N-Glycosylation sites at Asparagine 120 and 193SIB Motif Scan: FAM155B . There do not appear to be any significant O-Glycosylation sitesYinOYang Analysis: FAM155B . There are two CKII phosphorylation sites at Threonine 302 and 469 along with two PKC phosphorylation sites at 283 and 349NetPhos: FAM155B . A sumoylation analysis identified two motifs with low probability scores of 0.5 and 0.13SUMOplot Analysis: FAM155B . Since the probability scores are low, this indicates that FAM155B is unlikely to have any true sumoylation motifs. == Expression == Highest expression is observed in the heart, thyroid, and brain tissues from RNA sequencing of human tissues. Specifically, fetal brain tissue and the cerebellum are observed to have higher expression than the brain as a whole. In regards to fetal tissue, high expression of the heart was observed at 11 weeks while the stomach and intestine are expressed highly at 20 weeks. The kidney is also expressed relatively highly at 10 weeks. This implies that expression in tissues like the stomach, intestine, and kidneys decreases as fetal development continues. == Homology == === Orthologs === FAM155B has many orthologs found exclusively within the phylum Metazoa. This indicates that FAM155B isn't conserved in life forms such as plants, protists, fungi, bacteria, and archaea. Within Metazoa, very few orthologs are found outside of the subphylum Vertebrata-- implying that the majority of FAM155B orthologs are vertebrates. The most distant ortholog detected is Actinia tenebrosa (Australian Red Waratah Sea Anemone). Closely related orthologs include primates, rodents, and African mammals while moderately related orthologs include birds, reptiles, and amphibians. The distantly related orthologs include bony fish and the sea anemone. === Paralog === There is one human paralog for this gene, FAM155A. The amino acid identity between the two paralogs is 46.29%. Like its paralog, FAM155A is also conserved in animals within the phylum Metazoa. However, FAM155A is conserved in more invertebrates than FAM155B which implies that the original gene may have split in an invertebrate ancestor about 824 MYA. Cytochrome C and Fibrinogen alpha chain. === Evolutionary history === This gene seems to have first appeared in Cnidaria about 824 MYA. It then appeared in bony fish about 435 MYA. It is first noted in vertebrates (specifically amphibians) around 351.8 MYA and about 159 MYA in mammals. == Function == The function of FAM155B is poorly understood by the scientific community. However, it may be involved in immune function as it has been found to interact with elements of the immune system. == Interacting proteins == Predicted functional partners of FAM155B include C3, SH2B3, and C1R-- all of which are associated with immune functions. C3 and C1R are involved in the complement system while SH2B3 is a protein which links the T-cell receptor signal to the phospholipase GRB2 and PI3K. FAM155B may also interact with AGBL4 and AGBL5 which are metallocarboxypeptidases that mediate protein deglutamylationSTRING: FAM155B . == Clinical significance == FAM155B is differentially expressed under many circumstances which indicates that it may be associated with various diseases. Significantly decreased expression of FAM155B has been noted in MCF7 human breast cancer cell lines when the estrogen receptor is silenced. Another study observed that this gene was overexpressed in breast cancer cell lines under normal circumstances which reinforced the association with breast cancerApostolou, P., Toloudi, M., & Papasotiriou, I.

He is a Cockrell Family Regents Chair in engineering, Director of the Texas Materials Institute, and the Director of the Materials Science and Engineering Program at the University of Texas at Austin. Manthiram delivered the 2019 Nobel Lecture in Chemistry on behalf of Chemistry Laureate John B. Goodenough. == Early life and education == Manthiram was born in Amarapuram, Tamil Nadu, a small village in southern India. He completed his B.S. and M.S. degrees in Chemistry at Madurai University. He then received his Ph.D. in Chemistry from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. == Career == After working as a lecturer at Madurai Kamaraj University for four years, he joined John B. Goodenough's lab as a Research Associate, first at Oxford University and then at the University of Texas at Austin. Manthiram joined the faculty of the University of Texas at Austin in 1991. ===Research=== Manthiram identified the polyanion class of cathode materials for lithium ion batteries, which are widely used in commercial applications. This is a class which includes lithium iron phosphate. He demonstrated that positive electrodes containing polyanions, e.g., sulfates, produce higher voltages than oxides due to the inductive effect of the polyanion. These polyanion cathodes are also used in sodium ion batteries. Manthiram discovered that the capacity limitations of layered oxide cathodes is a result of chemical instability that can be understood based on the relative positions of the metal 3d band relative to the top of the oxygen 2p band. This discovery has had significant implications for the practically accessible compositional space of lithium ion batteries, as well as their stability from a safety perspective. He has identified the critical parameters needed for transitioning lithium sulfur batteries towards commercial use. Specifically, lithium sulfur batteries need to achieve a sulfur loading of >5 mg cm‚àí2, a carbon content of <5%, electrolyte-to-sulfur ratio of <5 ŒºL mg‚àí1, electrolyte-to-capacity ratio of <5 ŒºL (mA h)‚àí1, and negative-to-positive capacity ratio of <5 in pouch-type cells. Key technological advances for lithium sulfur batteries developed by Manthiram include the use of microporous carbon interlayers and the use of doped graphene sponge electrodes. == References == ==External links== Arumugam Manthiram at Google Scholar Category:University of Texas at Austin faculty Category:American materials scientists Category:21st-century American engineers Category:1951 births Category:Living people ","title":"Arumugam Manthiram"},{"id":"63850595","text":"Kevin Berl√≠n Reyes is a Mexican diver.

When the King changed sides, he fled to Scotland, where he married James' mother, Mary Farquharson Black.Eduard Maria Oettinger: Moniteur des dates. Biographisch-genealogisch-historisches Welt-Register. Ludwig Denicke, Leipzig 1869, pg. 70 (Google Books) In 1832, after his father's early death, his mother decided to emigrate to the United States. They settled in New York City. In 1842, having shown some aptitude for drawing, he began attending evening classes at the National Academy of Design. Upon the recommendation of the portrait painter, Frederick Styles Agate, he became a full-time student. Following his graduation, he found employment as an apprentice at Harper & Brothers publishing, in Manhattan. In 1851, he paid a visit to London to see the Great Exhibition. He later described what he saw there as his \\"revelation\\". Over the next ten years, he became increasingly involved in the Abolitionist movement and discovered that he had a talent for public speaking; attending a course on the subject taught by Edward Delafield Smith. In 1858, when a dispute arose over removing Bible study from the New York public schools, he opposed the change, ran for a seat on the school board committee, and was elected. An unsuccessful campaign for Congress soon followed. ===Civil War service=== In 1861, a few months after the Civil War began, he enlisted as a Captain with Company B of the 10th New York Infantry. He was, however, released after four weeks for trying to recruit his own regiment. He then became a recruiter for the 4th Excelsior Regiment, on behalf of Congressman Daniel Sickles. Having little success there, he applied to the 96th New York Volunteer Infantry and was accepted as a Colonel. After only three weeks of training, his unit took part in the Peninsula Campaign. During this time, four complaints were brought against him as the result of disputes with subordinate officers. He was also reprimanded for insulting a superior officer, General William High Keim; calling him a \\"Pennsylvania Dutchman\\" who obtained his position through political influence. When similar complaints followed, he was asked to resign and he did, in September 1862.Thomas P. Lowry: Curmudgeons, Drunkards and Outright Fools. Courts-Martials of Civil War Union Colonels. University of Nebraska Press, 1997 pgs.141‚Äì143 (Google Books) ===Later career=== He then returned to New York and opened his own studio. He also gave lectures on behalf of the Cooper Union. Until 1871, he participated in exhibits at the National Academy and the American Watercolor Society. However, his disputatious character reasserted itself, and he came to be viewed as an outsider. As a result, he left the United States, travelling through Europe and spending several months in Palestine. In 1872, attracted by the paintings of the D√ºsseldorfer Malerschule, he went there to open a studio and stayed for three years.Bettina Baumg√§rtel, Sabine Schroyen, Lydia Immerheiser, Sabine Teichgr√∂b: \\"Verzeichnis der ausl√§ndischen K√ºnstler und K√ºnstlerinnen.

Michael Imhof Verlag, Petersberg 2011, , Vol.1, pg. 430 In 1875, he moved to Paris, where he also stayed for three years. This was followed by some time in London. Every so often, he visited the United States to sell his paintings. This would involve planned events, to which he invited journalists, and populist-themed lectures; attacking the established, academic art scene.

The party demanded increased education about the effects and dangers of alcohol in the educational system, confiscation of all profits on alcohol production and sales, and their ultimate goal was the total prohibition of alcohol in Norway. Hans Seip, mayor of Bergen between 1923 and 1924, was a member of the party.

However the tradition on which the school was based comes from the jurist Marcus Antistius Labeo. Labeo spent half the year convening sessions at actual schools with regular students who then carried forth his views and perspectives on the law. They were often contrasted with the Sabinian school, a rival school operating in roughly the same time and place, and were (very generally) considered the more progressive of the two, while the Sabinians were seen as more advocates of legal conservatism. Proculeians were thought to \\"push a legal principle to all its logical consequences,\\" and the legal tradition they inherited from Labeo was one of liberalism influenced by a keen understanding of the science of the day. The Proculeians tried to enlarge the scope of Roman law, and tried to push legal innovations into practice such as were suggested by their liberal philosophy and the principles of reason. The progressive and conservative natures of the schools increased over time, and there came to be wider chasms between the two, which is perhaps why the schools were named after later prominent disciples and students, and not after their originators (the Proculeian school being named after Proculus but originated by Labeo, and the Sabinian school being named after Masurius Sabinus but originated by Gaius Ateius Capito). ==Positions== The Roman legal compendium known as Digest records many decisions in which the Proculeians advocated. Among these were: * Fixing the legal age of puberty (decided in favor of the Proculeians)Digest i, ¬ß 196 * Deciding the validity of an appointment of an heir in a will in which the son had been omitted (decided in favor of the Sabinians)Digest i, ¬ß 123 * Deciding the validity of a will in which the will writer made inheritance conditional upon an impossible condition (decided in favor of the Sabinians)Digest iii, ¬ß 98 * Deciding the legal effect on slaves that are jointly owned when one of the owners grants the slave their freedom (decided in favor of the Sabinians)Digest iii, ¬ß 167a ==End of the school== The rivalry with the Sabinians ended in the 2nd century AD when the two schools either merged or disappeared, or were united under the 3rd century's leading legal mind, Papinian. ==Notable Proculeians== * Marcus Antistius Labeo * Marcus Cocceius Nerva (jurist) * Marcus Cocceius Nerva (father of the emperor) * Publius Juventius Celsus * Lucius Neratius Priscus * Proculus (jurist) * Plotius Pegasus * Titus Aristo ==References== Category:Roman law ","title":"Proculeian school"},{"id":"63850865","text":"Arnold Suppan (born 18 August 1945 in St. Veit an der Glan) is an Austrian historian who studies Eastern Europe in the twentieth century.

It is often described as a kwetiau version of the popular mie ayam (chicken noodles), and especially common in Indonesia, and can trace its origin to Chinese cuisine. In Indonesia, the dish is recognized as a popular Chinese Indonesian dish together with bakso meatballs and mie ayam, served from simple humble street- side warung to restaurants. Since the recipe is almost identical to the popular mie ayam, food stalls and restaurants that serving mie ayam usually also offering kwetiau ayam and bihun ayam. ==Preparation and serving== The kwetiau flat rice noodles is boiled in water until it achieves an al dente texture and mixed in a bowl with cooking oil, soy sauce and garlic. The oil coats the noodle in order to separate the threads. The oil can be chicken fat, lard, or vegetable oil. The chicken meat is diced and cooked in soy sauce and other seasonings including garlic. The chicken meat might also be cooked with jamur (mushrooms). The soy sauce seasoned chicken and mushroom mixture is placed on the flat rice noodles, and topped with chopped spring onions (green shallots). Kwetiau ayam is usually served with a separate chicken broth, boiled chinese cabbage, and often wonton () either dry crispy fried or moist soft in soup, and also bakso (meatballs). While Chinese variants might use pork fat or lard, the more common Indonesian kwetiau ayam uses halal chicken fat or vegetable oil to cater to Muslim customers. Additional condiments might include tong cay (salted preserved vegetables), bawang goreng (fried shallots), daun bawang (leek), pangsit goreng (fried wonton), acar timun cabe rawit (pickled cucumber and birds eye chilli), sambal chili sauce and tomato ketchup. ==Variants== The dish recipe is actually almost identical to the popular mie ayam that uses yellow wheat noodles instead. Thus variants might use almost exact recipe and ingredients while replacing the type of noodles; either common mi wheat noodles or bihun (rice vermicelli). Although kwetiau ayam sometimes also called as kwetiau ayam kuah or kwetiau kuah (soupy kway teow), the recipe is actually rather different. Kwetiau ayam chicken broth soup is usually served in a separate bowl, while kwetiau kuah noodle is cooked and served in rich soup together in a single bowl, more akin to mie kuah.

Neal Brennan (co-creator of Chappelle Show) started as a doorman at the club and counted the experience as one of \\"10 Defining Moments\\" in his comedy career as per the list he put together for New York magazine's pop culture website Vulture. It was at the Boston Comedy Club that Brennan first performed stand up and where he first met Dave Chappelle. Sarah Silverman, Pete Holmes and Bert Kreischer all worked as \\"barkers\\" for the club in their early careers‚Äîbarkers are responsible for announcing line ups and distributing fliers to people passing by the club's entrance. Adam Sandler started his comedy career at the club, performing there at age 17. Jeff Ross's first stand up performance was in 1994 at one of the club's open mic nights. The club closed its doors in 2005. In 2016 a re- creation of the club was built for Pete Holmes's semi-autobiographical television series Crashing. During Katz's 2016 appearance on the Be Here For A While podcast hosted by comedian Rachael O'Brien, Katz was asked: \\"Why did you call the club 'The Boston Comedy Club' in New York?\\" Katz responded: \\"Because clearly I'm an idiot.\\" ==References== Category:Comedy clubs in Manhattan Category:Defunct comedy clubs in the United States Category:Greenwich Village ","title":"Boston Comedy Club"},{"id":"63851000","text":"Southern Hemisphere Proving Grounds (SHPG) is an international vehicle testing facility in New Zealand's Cardrona Valley. It is the only one of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere, alongside its second operation undergoing development in southern Patagonia, Argentina. It covers 400ha of private land and usually operates during southern winter months. Global car manufacturers seek to test new models during the Northern Hemisphere summer. SHPG was established in the early 1990s, after Japanese car companies like Toyota and Sumitomo began inquiring for a suitable site for testing new engines and tyres in the southern snow. The facility operates under strict discretion for other clients and employ efforts to keep out of the public eye. Alongside car testing, SHPG owns and borders the Snow Farm, a cross-country ski course. In 2013, SHPG bought neighbouring snowsports terrain park Snow Park NZ, which had been struggling after several years of earning under profit. == References == == External links== *https://www.shpg.co.nz/ ","title":"Southern Hemisphere Proving Grounds (SHPG)"},{"id":"63851003","text":"Mory Konat√© (born 15 November 1993) is a Guinean professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for the club Sint-Truidense. ==Professional career== Konat√© began playing football late, and moved to Germany as student after his lack of footballing opportunities in Guinea.

The brick church, built from 1909 to 1915, is atypically designed in Beaux-Arts style by Buechner & Orth to harmonize with the nearby Minnesota State Capitol. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The oldest part of the building, the north side, was built in 1909. The main church building, facing University Avenue, was constructed in 1915 of yellow brick. The building's principal facade is symmetrical and features a Classical pediment supported by Ionic columns and pilasters, flaked by bell towers. An office wing, which currently houses the Saint Paul Area Synod of the ELCA, was constructed in 1962‚Äì63. The congregation was formally organized in 1868 as the Scandinavian Lutheran Church Society. Later that year, it was changed from \\"Society\\" to \\"Congregation\\". In 1869, it was renamed the Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Church. Services were initially held in members' homes, in the Ramsey County Courthouse, and in the Zion Evangelical Lutheran Church, a German congregation at East 9th and Rosabel Street. In 1870, the congregation erected its own building at the southwest corner of L'Orient and Mt. Airy Streets. The sandy soil at that site required regular maintenance to keep the building from sliding down the hill, and in 1875, the structure was moved to 13th and Canada Streets. In 1904, Rev. S.T. Reque began a 37-year tenure as pastor, and in 1909, the current site at Park Street and University Avenue was purchased. The architect, Buechner & Orth, chose an architectural style compatible with the neighboring Minnesota State Capitol. The basement of the new structure was finished for use as a worship space on Christmas Eve 1911. The upper church was dedicated on December 5, 1915. A few years later, the congregation's name was changed to \\"Christ Lutheran Church\\". In 1962, the congregation added the words \\"on Capitol Hill\\" to the name to highlight its proximity to the state's seat of civil government. Baptized membership peaked in 1944 at 1198 persons. The Pastor from 1939‚Äì1952, Rev. Joseph Simonson, served as chaplain of the Minnesota Senate for 10 years before being appointed by President Eisenhower as Ambassador to Ethiopia. This led by a visit from Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie to Christ Lutheran Church in June 1954. The emperor presented the congregation with a processional cross identical to one presented to the National Cathedral. In the 1980s, the church's neighborhood experienced an influx of immigrants and refugees from Southeast Asia and Africa. The congregation responded to these demographic changes by establishing a Southeast Asian Ministry to address the needs of this new population. ==References== ==External links== * Christ on Capitol Hill Category:1909 establishments in Minnesota Category:Beaux-Arts architecture in Minnesota Category:Churches completed in 1915 Category:Churches in Saint Paul, Minnesota Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Minnesota Category:Lutheran churches in Minnesota Category:National Register of Historic Places in Saint Paul, Minnesota ","title":"Christ Lutheran Church on Capitol Hill"},{"id":"63851209","text":"Juling () is a town in Linying County, Henan province, China. , it had 26 villages under its administration: *Juling Village *Liuzhuang Village () *Zhangzhuang Village () *Mengzhuang Village () *Louzhuang Village () *Youfangchen Village () *Lizhuang Village () *Fangcheliu Village () *Hanzhuang Village () *Shiyuanwang Village () *Taizhuang Village () *Liangli Village () *Yanglin Village () *Daduan Village () *Wulukou Village () *Wujiqiao Village () *Wangzhuang Village () *Huanlong Village () *Panzhuang Village () *Guaizili Village () *Mamiao Village () *Guanjie Village () *Yingwang Village () *Qizhuang Village () *Laimaizhang Village () *Luoshanxin Village () == See also == * List of township-level divisions of Henan == References == Category:Township-level divisions of Henan Category:Linying County ","title":"Juling"},{"id":"63851213","text":"Leucopogon oliganthus is a shrub in the family Ericaceae found in Western Australia.

It was represented as a single-member district when it was re-established as a regular province separate from Sorsogon in 1920 and took part in five legislatures of the Insular Government of the Philippine Islands from 1922 to 1935, the three legislatures of the Philippine Commonwealth from 1935 to 1946, and the seven congresses of the Third Philippine Republic from 1946 to 1972. Masbate was allocated an additional seat on three separate occasions in its history. From 1898 to 1901, the province, then known as Masbate y Ticao, was represented by two members in the National Assembly (Malolos Congress) of the First Philippine Republic, with a separate representation for the then island province of Burias. It also sent two representatives to the National Assembly of the Second Philippine Republic from 1943 to 1944 and the national parliament of the Fourth Philippine Republic from 1984 to 1986.

Lahey (1902-1969) AKA Ed Lahey was a 20th-Century American journalist, known for his coverage of Al Capone and John Dillinger, the labor beat, and personal knowledge of Philip Murray, Lee Pressman, James Carey, John L. Lewis, Robert A. Taft, and Thomas E. Dewey. US Representative William H. Ayres called him \\"a crusader for all of us in these United States of America,\\" while Knight Newspapers's John S. Knight, called him \\"the best newspaper reporter in my profession.\\" ==Background== Edwin Aloysius Lahey was born on January 11, 1902, in Chicago. His parents were Alice Burns and machinist James F. Lahey. He dropped out of school at an early age, possibly by fourth grade. ==Career== Lahey as an office boy, shipping clerk, railroad yard clerk, and dishwasher. In 1927, he joined The Glen Ellyn, Illiniois, Beacon, followed by The East St. Louis Journal and Associated Press. ===Chicago=== Lahey first met CIO leader Philip Murray during labor strikes in the late 1930s In 1929, he joined Chicago Daily News, which he later said was \\"the only paper I ever wanted to work.\\" In 1936, the Chicago Daily News assigned Lahey to the labor beat. In 1937, he covered sit-down strikes in the Automobile and Steel industries. These included the Little Steel Strike. In 1959, Lahey recalled for oral history: > In my association with the C.I.O., which was very, very close and intimate, > more so than ‚Äî I'm not immodest when I say so, but I was closer to the > operation of the C.I.O. than most of the people in the C.I.O., not to > mention the newspapermen, because my best friends after I moved to > Washington, were Philip Murray, the president of the C.I.O., and Lee > Pressman, the general counsel of the C.I.O. Shortly after a Nieman Fellowship at Harvard 1939, Lahey investigated an Illinois state auditor, which resulted in the official's imprisonment. ===Washington=== Lahey's reportage helped reconcile Robert A. Taft (here) with Dwight D. Eisenhower during the 1952 Republican Party presidential primaries. In 1941, the Chicago Daily News assigned Lahey to Washington, DC. There, he met with Murray and Pressman twice a week. During World War II, he covered first the China-Burma-India front and later Europe, Africa, and Latin America. In 1956, the Chicago Daily News made Lahey bureau chief there. In 1959, when Chicago Daily News sold to Marshall Field III, Lahey remained with Knight Newspapers as chief correspondent. He spent 28 years covering news in the nation's capital. Famous stories include the resignation of Martin Durkin (former labor leader and President Dwight D. Eisenhower's first Secretary of Labor and an interview with US Senator Robert A. Taft (which led to reconciliation between Taft and Eisenhower following Taft's defeat for the 1952 Republican Party presidential primaries. In 1951, during tense negotiations between Walter Reuther of the United Auto Workers and George Meany of the AFL-CIO, Lahey wrote, \\"the final act of complete labor unity awaits only the retirement or passing of three onetime cronies, Green, Murray, and John L. Lewis...\\" and \\"competitive civil war\\" in labor organizing. ==Personal life and death== Lahey married Grace Seidcheck and had two children and several grandchildren. He was a heavy drinker early but gave it up early and in 1940 joined Alcoholics Anonymous. He was a member of the National Press Club, Harvard Club, and Gridiron Club. He befriended Felix Frankfurter while a Nieman Fellow at Harvard. Edwin A. Lahey died age 67 on July 17, 1969 of complications of emphysema at the Washington Hospital Center. ==Awards== * 1939: Nieman Fellowship for Journalism at Harvard University * 1967: Elijah Parish Lovejoy Award, Colby College ==Legacy== John S. Knight of Knight Newspapers called Lahey \\"the best newspaper reporter in my profession\\" On July 22, 1969, US Representative William H. Ayres extolled Lahey before the United States House of Representatives. His last employer, John S. Knight, founder of Knight Newspapers said of him, \\"During my time as editor and publisher of the Chicago Daily News, the only man of whom I stood in awe was Ed Lahey, the best newspaper reporter in my profession.\\" In 1978, when the Chicago Daily News closed, the New York Times listed Lahey among the newspaper's top \\"reporting talent.\\" In 1996, the New York Times noted Lahey's reluctance to use news leaks: \\"The background interview is a vicious device because it lets officials escape responsibility.\\" In 2008, M. A. Lyons published a collection of writings by parent Louis M. Lyons, which included a chapter entitled, \\"Edwin A. Lahey: Chicago Daily News.\\" Lahey remains known for his sardonic summaries and statements: * \\"Write for people who move their lips when they read.\\" * \\"Richard Loeb, who graduated with honors from college at the age of fifteen and who was a master of the English language, today ended his sentence with a preposition.\\" ==Works== Articles: * \\"Anything Can Happen in Chicago,\\" The Nation (January 1, 1936) * \\"What's Ahead for American Labor,\\" The New Republic (July 26, 1943) * \\"Is Pegler Right?\\" The New Republic (September 20, 1943) * \\"The AFL and Lewis,\\" The New Republic (February 7, 1944) * \\"Bedaux and His Friends,\\" The New Republic (March 6, 1944) * \\"Fascism's Day in Court,\\" The New Republic (June 5, 1944) * \\"A Reporter at Bretton Woods,\\" The New Republic (July 17, 1944) * \\"Mayor Lausche of Cleveland,\\" The New Republic (July 31, 1944) * \\"The CIO Comes of Age,\\" The New Republic (December 4, 1944) * \\"Detroit's Got 'Em Again,\\" The New Republic (October 1, 1945) * \\"Reuther Takes Over,\\" The New Republic (April 8, 1946) * \\"Kefauver: Underworld Nemesis,\\" The New Republic (February 19, 1951) * \\"The Gangs Go Legitimate,\\" The New Republic (May 14, 1951) * \\"Fattening on Futures,\\" The New Republic (May 21, 1951) * \\"The AFL Will Absorb the CIO,\\" Collier‚Äôs Magazine (September 1, 1951) * \\"The Steelworkers State Their Case,\\" The New Republic (May 26, 1952) * \\"Ike: An Innocent at Home,\\" The New Republic (June 30, 1952) * \\"Labor, Adlai and Ike,\\" The New Republic (August 25, 1952) * \\"Perspective on Guatemala,\\" The New Republic (July 19, 1954) * \\"UAW Ties Stand For Annual Wage To Principle,\\" Detroit Free Press (March 8, 1955) * \\"Reuther Is Sure That He'll Win Wage Crusade,\\" Detroit Free Press (March 9, 1955) * \\"Industry's View On GAW Pact: It's Too Costly,\\" Detroit Free Press (March 10, 1955) * \\"Powerful Teamwork: Dulles Brothers Cope With Reds From Sunny, Dark Sides of Street,\\" Chicago Daily News (October 6, 1955) * \\"Right-to-Work Forces Outspent 3-1 by Labor,\\" Washington Post/Times Herald (October 28, 1958) * \\"‚ÄìAt the Cost of Only One U.S. Fighter,\\" The Challenge of Ideas: An Essay Reader (1958) * \\"Richard Nixon: An Obituary of a Career,\\" Boston Globe (November 8, 1962) Television, Film: * Meet the Press: ** September 17, 1949 ** August 27, 1950 ** September 1, 1957 ** June 28, 1958 ** August 31, 1958 ** February 4, 1962 * The Press and the People on WGBH-TV (1958-1959) * The Today Show (October 4, 1962) Books, Pamphlets: * Memo to Congress : if you really want to cut the budget... with David J.

They had dug a tunnel in a thin fossil-containing layer on the edge of a quarry and illegal finds were offered for sale there. In 2020, the new genus and species Apatorhamphus gyrostega was named and described by James McPhee, Nizar Ibrahim, Alex Kao, David M. Unwin, Roy Smith, and David M. Martill. The genus name is derived from Ancient Greek apatos, \\"deceptive\\", and ramphos, \\"snout\\", a reference to the difficulties one had in determining the taxonomic nature of the jaws and indeed whether it was an upper jaw or lower jaw. The species designation is a combination of the Greek gyros, \\"rounded\\", and steg√®, \\"roof\\", a reference to the round cross section of the top of the muzzle. The holotype, FSAC-KK 5010, was found in the Kem Kem Formation in Morocco, which dates to the Albian to Cenomanian of the Cretaceous. It consists of a large snout fragment. McPhee and Martill referred various earlier finds to the species. This concerns the specimens FSAC-KK 5011, FSAC- KK 5012 and FSAC-KK 5013, found at Begaa in Morocco; the FSAC-KK 5014 specimen, also in a Moroccan collection but of unknown origin; BSP 1993 IX 338, a snout found in 1993, reported as a possible pteranodontian in 1999 and assigned to Alanqa in 2010; and CMN 50859, a lower jaw identified in 2011 as a possible member of the Dsungaripteroidea. == References == Category:Neoazhdarchians Category:Fossil taxa described in 2020 ","title":"Apatorhamphus"},{"id":"63851508","text":"Mauricio Eduardo Cataldo Mancilla (born 28 February 1979) was a Chilean footballer. ==Club career== He is well remembered for his rabona golden goal to then Universidad de Chile's goalkeeper Johnny Herrera during the Chilean 2003 Torneo Apertura.

Foglia (November 27, 1950 ‚Äì April 21, 2020)Farenga Brothers Funeral Home: Phil Foglia was an American lawyer, prosecutor, civic activist, politician, and advocate for Italian-American rights issues. Most recently, Foglia led a campaign to construct a statue honoring Frances Xavier Cabrini, an Italian-American Catholic nun more commonly known as Mother Cabrini, after the proposal was initially rejected by a New York City commission. ==Biography== Foglia, the son of a police detective, was raised in Belmont, a neighborhood of The Bronx with a large Italian American and Italian immigrant community. His childhood friends included actor Chazz Palminteri. He graduated from Mount Saint Michael Academy in the Bronx. Foglia received his bachelor's degree from Lehman College before completing his juris doctorate from Pace University School of Law. ===Prosecution career=== Foglia was hired out of law school as a prosecutor for the office of the Bronx County District Attorney, where he prosecuted public corruption cases. In addition to his work in the Bronx, Foglia was cross-designated as an Assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York during the 1980s when the office was headed by Rudy Giuliani. The Southern District office assigned Foglia to its organized crime and public corruption strike force. In 1988, Phil Foglia was appointed as an Executive Assistant District Attorney for Investigations in Queens County, New York. He also served as a special counsel to the city of Yonkers, New York, for ten years. In the private sector, he was a partner at the Culleton, Marinaccio and Foglia law firm in White Plains, for seventeen years. In recent years, Foglia became a leading member of the New York State Inspector General's Office until the summer of 2019. During his tenure, Foglia uncovered a bidding scandal at the first company to run the Aqueduct Racetrack's casino, which opened in 2011. The casino's initial bids were redone following Foglia's report. Foglia attempted to move from the prosecutor's office into elected politics. In 2005, Foglia ran as a member of the Republican, Conservative and Independence parties for the New York City Council's open 13th Council District seat, which was being vacated by outgoing councilwoman Madeline Provenzano, who was term-limited. Foglia was defeated by James Vacca, a Democrat, in the general election. ===Italian American activism=== Philip Foglia became a major Italian American civic and community leader in the Bronx and New York City. He established the Italian-American Legal Defense and Higher Education Fund and served as its chief legal counsel. He was also a founding member of the board of the Italian American Museum in Manhattan. Foglia campaigned against negative Italian American stereotypes and discrimination. He also sought to elevate and protect the image of major Italian historical figures, ranging from Mother Cabrini to Christopher Columbus. During the 1990s, Foglia filed a federal lawsuit against City University of New York (CUNY), alleging that the university routinely discriminated against Italian Americans in its hiring practices. Foglia reached a legal settlement with CUNY, which required the university to officially recognize Italian Americans as an under represented demographic group in its staff hiring decisions. In 2017, in the aftermath of a violent march by white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio created a public design commission, called the Mayoral Advisory Commission on City Art, Monuments, and Markers, to review \\"all symbols of hate on city property.\\". Following Charlottesville, activist groups began calling for the removal of monuments to Christopher Columbus in New York City, including the Columbus statue at the center of Columbus Circle. Foglia and other Italian American activists defended the statues and lobbied the mayor to preserve the monuments, calling them a symbol of Italian American heritage. The commission and Mayor de Blasio ultimately decided to keep the Columbus statues. Two years later, Foglia emerged as a leading critic over the exclusion of a proposed statue of Mother Cabrini, born Frances Xavier Cabrini, by the \\"She Built NYC\\" program, which was created to honor famous New York City women with new statues and monuments. Mother Cabrini, an Italian-born nun known for opening schools and hospitals in New York, is the patron saint of immigrants. Cabrini received the most votes for a monument in a 2018 public survey conducted by the \\"She Built NYC\\" program, out of 320 historical women who were nominated for a proposed statue. However, despite the support, the mayor's office and the \\"She Built NYC\\" commission, led by New York City First Lady Chirlane McCray, rejected the statue's inclusion in 2020 in favor of monuments to seven other women. Italian American and Catholic leaders swiftly denounced the exclusion of Cabrini's statue and criticized both McCray and Mayor de Blasio. Foglia, as head of the Italian-American Legal Defense and Higher Education Fund, called the decision an \\"insult\\" to Italian Americans and sent a letter of protest to First Lady McCray in September 2020. Foglia wrote, \\"Our organization is dismayed by the decision by 'She Built NYC' to preempt their own selection process and ignore Mother Cabrini, the clear choice of the public and most deserving person for such an honor.\\" A march in support of the Mother Cabrini statue, held in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, on October 6, 2019, attracted more than 1,000 participants. After months of controversy, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo stepped to override McCrae's and de Blasio's decision. On October 24, 2019, Governor Cuomo announce that a public statue honoring Mother Cabrini would indeed be constructed in New York City, writing in release, \\"Mother Cabrini was a great New Yorker and a great Italian American immigrant who did untold good for the people of this state, and there is no doubt she is deserving of a statue in her honor.\\" Cuomo pledged $750 thousand to build the statue. He also appointed Philip Foglia to an 19-member commission created to oversee the Cabrini memorial. In addition to Foglia, the commission members included Brooklyn Bishop Nicholas DiMarzio and television journalist Maria Bartiromo. In December 2019, Governor Andrew Cuomo and the 19-member commission, including Foglia, announced that the statue honoring Mother Cabrini would be constructed in Battery Park in lower Manhattan. When completed, Cabrini's monument will be located adjacent to the Museum of Jewish Heritage alongside Battery Park's South Cove, overlooking the Statue of Liberty. The panel also considered an alternative site in Brooklyn Bridge Park, but ultimately chose the location in Battery Park. Foglia, a resident of the Pelham Gardens neighborhood of the Bronx, became ill with COVID-19 on March 22, 2020. He spent 28 days on a ventilator at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. After five weeks, his condition eventually improved enough that he was able to be taken off the ventilator, but his health rapidly declined soon afterward and he never recovered. Foglia died from COVID-19 on April 21, 2020, at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in Washington Heights, Manhattan, at the age of 69. He was survived by his wife of more than thirty years, Jacqueline, and their two sons, Philip, Jr. and Louis. ==References== Category:1950 births Category:2020 deaths Category:American prosecutors Category:New York (state) lawyers Category:Lawyers from New York City Category:American civil rights activists Category:Pace University School of Law alumni Category:Lehman College alumni Category:American people of Italian descent Category:People from the Bronx Category:Deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City ","title":"Philip Foglia"},{"id":"63851616","text":"Irina Birvagen (; born 24 July 1988) is a Kazakhstani former footballer who played as a forward.

It aims to improve the visibility of women researchers, in response to the poor representation of discoveries by women in media outlets that quote or cover academic research. Women Are Boring is primarily a platform for women to post summaries or synopses of research that they have published in a different venue, on any topic. ==History and motivation== Grace McDermott and Catherine Connolly founded the publication while they were PhD students at Dublin City University in May of 2016. McDermott and Connolly attributed their decision to found Women Are Boring to the under-representation of women in media, and particularly the underrepresentation of women scholars in news about research. They were specifically motivated by a study by The Global Media Monitoring Project which concluded that \\"only 24% of the persons heard, read about or seen in news media are women\\", and that only 28% of the sources cited in Irish news media were women, with only a very small proportion of those in expert roles like scientific or academic sources. McDermott and Connolly have noted the contrast between the dearth of women researchers in popular media and the plethora of research by women that they consistently encountered as PhD students. McDermott and Connolly chose the name \\"Women Are Boring\\" for their platform partly to alter the Google Search results for that phrase, which they noted had previously consisted of results that were overwhelmingly demeaning to women. It is also intended to ironically contrast the attitude that women are boring with the interesting information that is shared by women on the platform, to demonstrate the absurdity of the claim that women are boring. Women Are Boring was founded at a similar time to other efforts to increase the visibility of women academics online and specifically in news media, such as Women Also Know Stuff and 500 Women Scientists. It has also been compared to The Bearded Lady Project, the Athena SWAN Program, and the Dangerous Women Project of International Women's Day 2016. ==Contributions== Women Are Boring features research summaries and research contributions from women. Most contributors are academics, but contributions also come from women researchers who do not work in academia. The contributions are specifically meant for a general audience, and are intended to be accessible to any interested reader, rather than appealing exclusively to other researchers. Although founders McDermott and Connolly both studied foreign policy and international affairs, with McDermott studying in the School of Communications and Connolly studying in the School of Law and Government at Dublin City University, there are no restrictions on the topics accepted by Women Are Boring. Shortly after its founding, in July 2016, a Dublin City University news release noted that it had already covered topics including \\"women in ISIS, gender equality in Northern Ireland and Scotland's health inequalities\\", and had then received \\"12,000 views from more than 94 countries\\". By 2017, about one year after the website's founding, Stellar Magazine reported that Women Are Boring had featured contributions in areas \\"from US foreign policy to William Shakespeare\\". Women Are Boring specifically aims to promote interdisciplinary research, and facilitate networking of scholars across traditional disciplinary boundaries. Women Are Boring does not publish full research papers, but rather features summaries or synopses which link readers to full research projects, a process which has been compared with the research summaries available on Wikipedia. Although the website does not publish full research papers, some original early-stage research contributions to Women Are Boring that were not already published in full elsewhere have subsequently been expanded by their authors and published in peer-reviewed academic journals. ==ReferencesWomen Are Boring Twitter account * Women Are Boring Facebook page Category:Internet properties established in 2016 Category:Online magazines Category:Women's magazines ","title":"Women Are Boring"},{"id":"63852042","text":"An artist's illustration showing WASP-76b during its night hours.

In March 2020, it was speculated what as the temperature on the planet reaches 2,400C on hot side, this appears to be hot enough to vaporize neutral iron. If the night side of WASP-76b have temperatures down to at least 1,400C, the iron may condense then rain down as hot liquid iron on its surface. The planet equilibrium temperature is 2190 K, yet measured dayside temperature is still hotter at 2500 K. Study shows that WASP-76b seems to be the only planet in its solar system. In May 2020, it was discovered what the previously HST-taken spectra of WASP-76b were distorted by the light from the suspected stellar companion. Therefore, updated atmospheric model is cloudy hydrogen-helium envelope, **non-detection of alternatively reported neutral iron** (including \\"iron rain\\"), and only upper limits on oxides of titanium and vanadium.

An initial conflict broke out in 1217 when the founder of Eastern Xia, Puxian Wannu, rebelled against the Mongol Empire. However, Wannu shortly afterward submitted to Mongol overlordship. Wannu later broke from the Mongols again, and in 1233 √ñgedei Khan sent his son G√ºy√ºk to conquer the kingdom. Eastern Xia was destroyed and Wannu executed. == Background == Eastern Xia, also known as Dongxia or Dongzhen, was a kingdom founded by the warlord Puxian Wannu in 1215. Wannu served under the Jin dynasty during its war with the Mongol Empire. In late 1214, his army was defeated by the Eastern Liao, a vassal of the Mongols. The Jin capital, Zhongdu, fell to Muqali, and Wannu used the opportunity to establish a breakaway state, originally based in Liaoyang. After the Mongols defeated him in 1216, he sent his son Tege to the Mongols as a hostage in order to pledge his loyalty to the empire.Henthorn, 1963, p. 6 In 1217, due to the futility of him establishing a kingdom in the area of Liaoning, he relocated to northeast Manchuria along the border with Korea. == Conquest == In 1217, Wannu attempted a rebellion against his Mongol allies.McLynn, 2015, p. 385 n. 60 This was swiftly subdued, and Wannu accepted the Mongols as his lords.

Blumberg is an American professor, neuroscientist, researcher, and author who specializes in the fields of developmental psychobiology and behavioral neuroscience. He is currently an F. Wendell Miller Professor and department chair in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at the University of Iowa. In addition to writing academic research articles, Blumberg has served as the editor-in-chief of Behavioral Neuroscience and authored several books, including Freaks of Nature: What Anomalies Tell Us About Development and Evolution. His research also appeared on a 2020 episode of the Netflix series, Babies. ==Education== During his undergraduate years, Blumberg studied physics and philosophy at Brandeis University, where he graduated in 1983. While at Brandeis, he studied under Frank E. Manuel. He earned his master's degree and his PhD at the University of Chicago, finishing his doctoral studies in biopsychology in 1988. He had a focus on developmental psychobiology at Indiana University for his postdoctoral training, which concluded in 1992. ==Career== After completing his postdoctoral training at Indiana University, Blumberg joined the faculty in the Department of Psychology at the University of Iowa. His research there has focused on behavioral, psychological, and neural development. In 1997, Blumberg was honored with an APA Distinguished Scientific Early Career Award for his research on behavioral and physiological development. In 2002, his first book, Body Heat: Temperature and Life on Earth, was published by Harvard University Press. The book discusses thermoregulation in humans and other animals and how it affects behavior and development. Three years later in 2005, he published his second book, Basic Instinct: The Genesis of Behavior, through Thunder‚Äôs Mouth Press. The book delves into the origins of so-called innate behaviors, reframing them as emerging from complex biological and environmental cascades rather than as products of hardwiring or genetic instruction. This theme is a central tenet of Developmental Systems Theory, of which Blumberg is a proponent. In 2008, Blumberg was named the editor-in-chief of Behavioral Neuroscience, a peer-reviewed scientific journal covering its eponymous topic and published by the American Psychological Association. The following year, he published his third book, Freaks of Nature: What Anomalies Tell Us About Development and Evolution, through Oxford University Press. The book discusses elements of behavioral plasticity and the developing animal's ability to adapt to the body it has, rather than the body it was \\"supposed\\" to have. This theme again contrasts with the idea that certain behaviors are \\"preprogrammed.\\" In the book, Blumberg uses examples from conjoined twins who coordinate their behavior and goats and dogs born without forelimbs who learn to walk on their hind legs. Also in 2009, Blumberg was a co-editor of the Oxford Handbook of Developmental Behavioral Neuroscience. During this time, he also served as the president of the International Society for Developmental Psychobiology and was named the F. Wendell Miller Professor of Psychology at the University of Iowa. In 2014, he received a National Institutes of Health MERIT Award for his research on sleep and its role in neural development. Blumberg had been researching muscle twitches during sleep and their role in the development of connections between muscles, brain, and spinal cord since the 1990s. The studies show that muscle twitches during sleep provide information to the brains of newborn animals about the structure of muscles and limbs, effectively teaching the brain how to move the body. Blumberg's research on the subject was highlighted in an episode of the 2020 Netflix series, Babies. In 2017, Blumberg was named the department chair of the University of Iowa's Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, a position he continues to hold as of 2020. ==Selected publications== { class=\\" plainrowheaders sortable\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" Year ! scope=\\"col\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" Original publisher ! scope=\\"col\\" ISBN ! scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  Notes - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2002  Body Heat: Temperature and Life on Earth  Harvard University Press   - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2005 Basic Instinct: The Genesis of Behavior  Thunder's Mouth Press   - ! scope=\\"row\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  2009  Freaks of Nature: What Anomalies Tell Us About Development and Evolution  rowspan=\\"2\\"  Oxford University Press   -  Oxford Handbook of Developmental Behavioral Neuroscience   Co-editor with John Freeman and Scott Robinson - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2016  How We Develop‚ÄîDevelopmental Systems and the Emergence of Complex Behaviors  WIREs Cognitive Science   Co-editor with John Spencer and David Shenk } ==References== ==External links== *Faculty page *Lab website * Category:Living people Category:1961 births Category:American psychologists Category:Brandeis University alumni Category:University of Chicago alumni Category:University of Iowa faculty Category:American neuroscientists ","title":"Mark Blumberg"},{"id":"63852536","text":"The flag of Austin is the official municipal flag of Austin, Texas. The flag simply consists of a white field with the seal of Austin without the surrounding circle of text. Below the seal of Austin is the text, \\"CITY OF AUSTIN\\", written in blue and arched upwards. ==Design and symbolism== Coat of arms of Stephen F. Austin's family, where the crest on the flag is derived from The flag has a proportion of 2 units tall by 3 units wide. The shield in the center is about 1 unit high and two-thirds of a unit tall and is divided into three even vertical strips of red, white, and red. The top of the shield is a blue isosceles triangle with an orange oil lamp in the middle. The red, white, and blue color scheme symbolizes that it is situated in Texas and the United States, as they both have red, white, and blue as their official colors. The oil lamp symbolizes knowledge and represents the various educational options within Austin, most notably the University of Texas at Austin located in the city (hence the choice of the orange color). Fimbriating the shield is a narrow gold border. The shield's crest rests on a white wreath. The crest consists of a gold cross bottony with white wings outlined in blue protruding on either side. This crest is derived from the coat of arms of the city's namesake, Stephen F. Austin. Austin was known as the \\"Father of Texas\\" due in large part to his effort in the colonization and growth of the territory. The cross symbolized that an ancestor of Austin participated in a crusade, while the wings were designed to symbolize Saint Austin, Archbishop of Canterbury, who converted Wales to Christianity. This symbolism would prove important in the 1992 lawsuit. Behind the crest is a silhouette of the Texas State Capitol in red, with a blue outline. This represents its status as the capital city of Texas. Written in blue is the text \\"CITY OF AUSTIN\\", which is arched counterclockwise in the bottom third of the flag. ==History== The idea for a city flag was first suggested in 1915 by Ellen Wyse, an editor of Gossip. She brought the idea to the attention of mayor A. P. Wooldridge, who organized a committee of 38 people to explore the idea, and soon created a flag design competition, declaring: The contest offered $50 to the first place design and $25 to the runner-up. By October 2, 1916, the deadline, the contest had received 130 entrants. Out of these 130, the 10-person committee selected the design of Ray Frederick Coyle, an artist from San Francisco, as the first- place winner. Second place went to G.A. Geist, a Texas A&M; University faculty member. Coyle's entry became the official flag and seal of the city after a few slight modifications to the design. The original had a shield of red, white, and blue, with the outline of the Capitol building at the top of the shield. The blue triangle came from the Austin family coat of arms and the cross and wings came from Stephen F. Austin's coat of arms. The committee added the oil lamp to represent the aspect of education in Austin, which replace a white star and crown that represented the City of the Violet Crown. The committee also added the wording \\"CITY OF AUSTIN\\" in block letters below the shield and the color blue to the lineage of the wings. Flag of NAVA 42, which took place from October 10 to 12, 2008 The city first began using the design as a flag and seal in 1917, following a shipment of several large and small flags to Scarbrough's Department Store, with one copy being presented to the city. The design was used on city documents, police cars, and other city property. The city copy from Scarbrough's was actually lost, according to a July 20, 1917, Statesman story, although it was later discovered. It was officially adopted by the Austin City Council on April 12, 1919. The resolution said that the flag would be flown on proper occasions. Jane Y. McCallum wrote about the flag in 1944, for her weekly column in the Statesman. In the column, she discussed the flag's lack of use and also questioned people on their knowledge of the existence of an Austin city flag. At some point, the original flag was placed in a desk drawer in the city clerk's office and was eventually discovered by an employee in 1975. The flag was framed and hung at the Old Bakery and Emporium, which served as the headquarters of the bicentennial for the city. The flag was then placed in an archive with all other materials involved with the bicentennial. It currently resides at the Austin History Center and is often displayed in the mayor's office. The flag placed 62nd out of 150 United States city flags in a 2004 North American Vexillological Association survey, ranking 7th out of 12 Texas cities. The flag was also featured in Roman Mars' viral TED Talk, in which he described it as a \\"seal on a bedsheet\\", or a flag with nothing but a seal, an example of bad flag design. Austin (specifically the State Capitol) was home to the 42nd annual NAVA meeting in 2008. Every annual NAVA meeting has an official flag that represents the host city. The flag chosen for Austin was a historic design drawn in 1839. It is a rectangular variant of a square auxiliary naval flag, consisting of a blue bar with a white star in the middle. Surrounding this bar is a thick white bar. Surrounding the white bar is another thick bar, this time in red. This flag represents the state of Texas. As the conference took place in the capitol building, it conveys the importance of Austin as the state's capital city. KXAN, in a 2015 report, found that the city flag is nearly impossible to find and that not even Austin City Hall flies it. === 1992 lawsuit === The flag once again reached headlines when Jon G. Murray, of the Society of Separationists, sued the city in 1992. Murray claimed that the flag violated the First Amendment, specifically the separation of church and state, due to the depiction of the cross on the shield. Prior to this lawsuit, Zion, Illinois was brought to court by the same group for the same reason and was forced to change its seal, as it was found that it had religious intent. A federal judge decided that as the cross was used in Austin's coat of arms it did not endorse or advance Christianity, but instead showcased historical validity, meaning it followed the first amendment. The plaintiffs appealed the decision and took it all the way to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and even the Supreme Court, but the higher courts endorsed the previous decisions and did not find the flag unconstitutional. ===Alternative designs=== One of the more prominent designs in the flag redesign effort- made by Michael Kriegshauser and published in 2015 Like many other flags with seals on them, various efforts have been made to redesign Austin's flag. One redesign was posted by Michael Kriegshauser to the design website Medium in 2015, which featured a diagonal strip that separated the flag into two colors, with blue on the left and red on the right, with a white five-pointed star in the canton. Kriegshauser's redesign was featured by the Austin American- Statesman newspaper and KUT radio station. KXAN-TV published a YouTube video featuring the design, along with another proposal from University of Texas student Alec Rios, who took the blue triangle and stripes from the seal and flipped it horizontally, covering the whole height and width of the flag. The oil lamp was then replaced with a white five-pointed star. Inspired by Kriegshauser's post, local event website Do512 orchestrated a flag contest. Despite the coverage, the City of Austin has not made a change to the flag. ==References== Category:Flags of cities in the United States Category:Flags of cities in Texas Category:Flags of Texas Category:Austin, Texas Category:1919 establishments in Texas Category:Christianity and politics in the United States Category:Flags introduced in 1919 Category:Flag controversies in the United States Category:Flags adopted through competition ","title":"Flag of Austin, Texas"},{"id":"63852613","text":"The political positions of Kamala Harris are reflected by her United States Senate voting record, public speeches, and interviews.

The ban was made due to St. Joseph's \\"sensitivity\\" about abortion. As the attorney general, Harris had legal authority to decide on any such change, as a condition of her approving a major transaction involving any non-profit medical institution in the state. The ban would not be able to go into effect without her knowledge or approval. Harris did set conditions on the ban, requiring the hospital to \\"take steps to ensure that alternative providers are available and accessible to all women, especially low-income women for direct abortions\\" in the hospital's serviceable area. Critics voiced concern that by imposing Catholic doctrine on its operations, St. Joseph was reducing the availability of reproductive services while receiving millions of dollars from taxpayers through Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements and a legal status that allowed it to be tax- exempt while taking tax deductions. In July 2015, an organization called \\"The Center for Medical Progress\\" (dba \\"Biomax\\"), a registered California non- profit corporation, posted five videos, shot in Texas, as evidence of proof that Planned Parenthood was \\"illegally trafficking aborted fetal parts.\\" The videos were found to be manipulatedpropaganda produced by anti-abortion activists who used fake California identification to establish a ghost California non-profit corporation. Within two months of the videos' posting, a Texas grand jury indicted the two activists responsible for producing them. However, as of March 2016, Harris had yet to make any determination on the matter: \\"In July, our politically ambitious attorney general, Kamala Harris, vowed to 'carefully review' the 'Center for Medical Progress‚Ä¶ what is [she] waiting for?' While a spokesperson for Harris said that \\"the office does not comment on investigations, or even confirm whether an investigation exists\\", abortion rights advocates began to speculate that Harris's senatorial campaign to replace Barbara Boxer might have contributed to Harris's \\"lack of urgency\\" on the case. Governor Jerry Brown and Kamala Harris in 2017 However, in September 2016, Governor Jerry Brown signed into law \\"Assembly Bill 1671\\", which was reportedly drafted by Harris, with input from Planned Parenthood‚Äîwhich sponsored the bill‚Äîmaking it a criminal offense to intentionally distribute, or to help with the dissemination of, unlawfully obtained confidential communications. Libertarians, filmmakers and news organizations vehemently opposed the bill, which was signed into law after late amendments were added to it. Since her election to the Senate, Harris has maintained a 100% rating by the abortion rights advocacy group Planned Parenthood Action Fund, and a 0% rating by the anti-abortion group National Right to Life Committee. She was also endorsed by Emily's List in 2015 during her senatorial campaign. ===Affirmative action=== Harris opposed California's ban on affirmative action. She asked the Supreme Court to \\"reaffirm its decision that public colleges and universities may consider race as one factor in admissions decisions.\\" Harris filed legal papers in the Supreme Court case supporting race as an admissions factor at the University of Texas. She also filed papers supporting affirmative action in a different Supreme Court case involving the University of Michigan. ===Capital punishment=== Harris is opposed to the death penalty, but has said that she would review each case individually. As the district attorney of San Francisco, Harris was opposed to the death penalty, refusing to demand it against a man charged with the murder of a police officer. This decision was controversial and criticized by senator Dianne Feinstein. She reversed her position as the California attorney general, when she defended the death penalty in that state against a Federal ruling which might have resulted in its abolition and declined to support two ballot initiatives that would have banned the death penalty in the state, raising accusations of political opportunism and inconsistency on the issue. However, in July 2019, as Attorney General William Barr announced the federal government's resumption of capital punishment after nearly 20 years without an execution of a federal inmate. Harris criticized the move as \\"misguided,\\" \\"immoral,\\" and \\"a gross misuse of taxpayer dollars.\\" As a Senator, she also co-sponsored a bill banning the death penalty, === Criminal justice === LAPD Chief Charlie Beck with Kamala Harris in 2014 In December 2018, Harris voted for the First Step Act, legislation aimed at reducing recidivism rates among federal prisoners through expanding job training and other programs in addition to forming an expansion of early-release programs and modifications on sentencing laws such as mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, \\"to more equitably punish drug offenders.\\" In March 2020, Harris was one of fifteen senators to sign a letter to Federal Bureau of Prisons, GEO Group, CoreCivic, and Management and Training Corporation requesting information on their strategy to address the COVID-19 pandemic, asserting that it was \\"critical that [you] have a plan to help prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus to incarcerated individuals and correctional staff, along with their families and loved ones, and provide treatment to incarcerated individuals and staff who become infected.\\" In June 2020, following a campaign by a coalition of community groups including Black Lives Matter, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced Los Angeles Police Department budget cuts of $150 million. Kamala Harris supported Garcetti's decision to cut the LAPD's budget by $150 million. === Drugs === U.S.‚ÄìMexico border to discuss border violence and strategies to combat drug cartels, 2011 Harris did not initially support the legalization of recreational marijuana, but later moved to support legalization. In 2010, while campaigning for Attorney General of California, she opposed Proposition 19, the first failed attempt to legalize recreational marijuana in California, on the grounds that selling drugs harms communities. In 2015, she called for an end on the federal prohibition of medical marijuana. In April 2018, following reports that the Justice Department was blocking the Drug Enforcement Administration from taking action on over two dozen requests to grow marijuana for use in research, Harris and Republican Orrin Hatch sent a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions on the necessity of marijuana research \\"for evidence-based decision making\\" and \\"to resolve critical questions of public health and safety, such as learning the impacts of marijuana on developing brains and formulating methods to test marijuana impairment in drivers.\\" In May 2018, Harris announced she would co- sponsor the Marijuana Justice Act (originally introduced by Senator Cory Booker in August 2017) which would legalize cannabis at the federal level by removing it from the Controlled Substance Act. The bill would also require federal courts to automatically expunge earlier federal marijuana convictions related to use or possession and would penalize states that enforce cannabis laws in a disproportionate manner against minority or low-income individuals. In February 2019, as she reintroduced the Marijuana Justice Act, Harris asserted that the United States had not equally applied marijuana laws and \\"criminalized marijuana use in a way that has led to the disproportionate incarceration of young men of color.\\" In December 2018, Harris was one of twenty-one senators to sign a letter to Commissioner of Food and Drugs Scott Gottlieb stating their approval of the actions of the Food and Drugs Administration to hinder youth access to e-cigarettes and urging the FDA \\"to take additional, stronger steps to prevent and reduce e-cigarette use among youth.\\" In July 2019, Harris and Representative Jerry Nadler introduced the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act of 2019, legislation that would legalize marijuana on the federal level in addition to expunging low-level marijuana possession convictions and authorizing grants to members of communities of color as part of an effort to reverse decades of damage cannabis criminalization had inflicted to those respective communities. In a statement, Harris cited the need to regulate marijuana and ensuring \\"everyone‚Äîespecially communities of color that have been disproportionately impacted by the War on Drugs‚Äîhas a real opportunity to participate in this growing industry.\\" ===Education=== Harris and Malala Yousafzai, Pakistani activist for female education and Nobel Prize laureate. Harris has argued for treating \\"habitual and chronic truancy\\" among children in elementary school as a crime committed by the parents of truant children. She argues that there is a direct connection between habitual truancy in elementary school and crime later in life. She has received the endorsement of the California Federation of Teachers. Harris supports busing for desegregation of public schools, saying that \\"the schools of America are as segregated, if not more segregated, today than when I was in elementary school.\\" Harris views busing as an option to be considered by school districts, rather than the responsibility of the federal government. Harris supports the creation of a government funding program to pay tuition and fees for students attending public colleges and universities for dependent students whose parents have income of $125,000 or less and independent students with incomes of $125,000 or less. The program would be funded by a fee on Wall Street firms of 0.5 percent per stock trade. Regarding student loans, Kamala Harris proposed having up to $20,000 in student debt forgiven for Pell Grant recipients who start a business and operate it for at least three years in a disadvantaged community. Eligible students would also have loans deferred interest free for a business formation period of up to three years. === Election security === On December 21, 2017, Harris was one of six senators to introduce the \\"Secure Elections Act\\", legislation authorizing block grants for states that would update outdated voting technology. The act would also create a program for an independent panel of experts to develop cybersecurity guidelines for election systems that states could adopt if they choose, along with offering states resources to implement the recommendations. In March 2019, Harris told Jimmy Kimmel that she was open to discussing abolishing the Electoral College given that there was \\"no question that the popular vote has been diminished in terms of making the final decision about who's the president of the United States and we need to deal with that\\". In May 2019, Harris was a cosponsor of the Protecting American Votes and Elections (PAVE) Act, legislation granting the United States Department of Homeland Security the authority \\"to set minimum cybersecurity standards for U.S. voting machines, authorize a one-time $500 million grant program for states to buy ballot-scanning machines to count paper ballots and require states to conduct risk-limiting audits of all federal elections in order to detect any cyber hacks.\\" ===Guns=== Gabby Giffords and Kamala Harris Harris earned an \\"F\\" rating from the National Rifle Association for her consistent efforts supporting gun control. While serving as district attorney in San Francisco Harris, along with other district attorneys, filed an amicus brief in District of Columbia v. Heller arguing that the Washington, D.C. gun law at issue did not violate the Second Amendment. During her run for Senate, Harris was endorsed by former U.S. Representative Gabby Giffords, who had been shot in Tucson in 2011. She was also endorsed by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. In response to the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, Harris supported the call for more gun control. Saying that she believed that thoughts and prayers are inadequate answers to the shooting, she stated that \\"...we must also commit ourselves to action. Another moment of silence won't suffice.\\" In November 2017, Harris was a cosponsor of the Military Domestic Violence Reporting Enhancement Act, a bill that would form a charge of Domestic Violence under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and stipulate that convictions would have to be reported to federal databases with the authority to keep abusers from purchasing firearms within three days in an attempt to close a loophole in the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) through which convicted abusers retained the ability to purchase firearms. In January 2019, Harris joined Bernie Sanders and 38 other Senate Democrats in introducing the Background Check Expansion Act, a bill that would require background checks for either the sale or transfer of all firearms including all unlicensed sellers. Exceptions to the bill's background check requirement included transfers between members of law enforcement, loaning firearms for either hunting or sporting events on a temporary basis, providing firearms as gifts to members of one's immediate family, firearms being transferred as part of an inheritance, or giving a firearm to another person temporarily for immediate self-defense. In May 2019, Harris was one of ten Democratic senators to sign a letter to Facebook Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg on social media users being \\"able to facilitate firearm transactions by directing potential buyers to other methods of communication\\" despite Instagram banning gun sales on its platforms and demanded answers on how Facebook governs its own ban on gun sales and holds violators of the site's policy accountable. Speaking to Wolf Blitzer in August 2019, Harris stated that congressional action on gun control rested in the hands of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and that she \\"would hope and pray that he understands that he actually has the power to do the right thing here and that he will do the right thing.\\" During a 2019 appearance on ‚ÄúThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,‚Äù Ms. Harris explained her support for a mandatory buyback on ‚Äúassault weapons.‚Äù ‚ÄúI do believe that we need to do buybacks, and I‚Äôll tell you why,‚Äù the California senator responded. ‚ÄúFirst of all, let‚Äôs be clear about what assault weapons are. They have been designed to kill a lot of human beings quickly. They are weapons of war with no place on the streets of a civil society.‚Äù She has not provided a definition of \\"assault weapons\\". However, CNN reported in May of 2019 that \\"Harris' new proposal \\"would ban AR-15-style assault weapon imports\\". On August 14, 2019, Harris unveiled a plan that would address domestic terrorism while prioritizing increasing the difficulty for suspected individuals to either obtain or keep firearms through the formation of domestic terrorism prevention orders meant to empower law enforcement officers and family members with the ability to petition federal court for a temporary restriction on a person's access to firearms in the event that they \\"exhibit clear evidence of dangerousness.\\" Harris stated that in the US \\"loaded guns should not be a few clicks away for any domestic terrorist with a laptop or smartphone‚Äù and cited the \\"need to take action to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people and stop violent, hate-fueled attacks before they happen.\\" === Immigration === Meeting with DREAMers in December 2017 Harris has expressed support for San Francisco's sanctuary city policy of not inquiring about immigration status in the process of a criminal investigation. She argued that it is important that immigrants be able to talk with law enforcement without fear. On October 25, 2017, Harris stated she would not support a spending bill until Congress addressed the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in a way that clarified \\"what we are going to do to protect and take care of our DACA young people in this country.\\" She did not support a February 2018 proposal by some Democrats to provide Trump with $25 billion in funding for a border wall in exchange for giving DREAMers a pathway to citizenship. In a January 2018 interview, when asked about her ideal version of a bipartisan deal on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, Harris stated the need to focus on comprehensive immigration reform and \\"pass a clean DREAM Act.\\" In January 2018, Harris and three other Democratic senators were cosponsors of the Border and Port Security Act, legislation that would mandate U.S. Customs and Border Protection \\"hire, train and assign at least 500 officers per year until the number of needed positions the model identifies is filled\\" in addition to requiring the commissioner of the Customs and Border Protection to determine potential equipment and infrastructure improvements that could be used for ports of entry. In April 2018, Harris was one of five senators to send a letter to Thomas Homan, acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), on standards used by the agency when determining how to detain a pregnant woman, requesting that pregnant women not be held in custody unless under extraordinary standards after reports \\"that ICE has failed to provide critical medical care to pregnant women in immigration detentionresulting in miscarriages and other negative health outcomes\\". In July 2018, the Trump administration falsely accused Harris of \\"supporting the animals of MS-13.\\" She responded, \\"As a career prosecutor, I actually went after gangs and transnational criminal organizations. That's being a leader on public safety. What is not, is ripping babies from their mothers.\\" In July 2018, Harris was one of 22 senators to sponsor the Stop Shackling and Detaining Pregnant Women Act, which if enacted would prohibit immigration officers from detaining pregnant women in a majority of circumstances and improve conditions of care for individuals in custody. In August 2018, Harris led 15 Democrats and Bernie Sanders in a letter to United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen demanding that the Trump administration take immediate action in attempting to reunite 539 migrant children with their families, citing each passing day of inaction as intensifying \\"trauma that this administration has needlessly caused for children and their families seeking humanitarian protection.\\" In November 2018, Harris was one of 11 senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of Defense James Mattis concerning \\"the overt politicization of the military\\" with the Trump administration's deployment of 5,800 troops to the U.S.‚ÄìMexico border, and requesting a briefing and written justification from the U.S. Northern Command for troop deployment, while urging Mattis to \\"curb the unprecedented escalation of DOD involvement in immigration enforcement.\\" Harris speaking in support of DACA in September 2017 In January 2019, Harris was one of 20 senators to sponsor the Dreamer Confidentiality Act, a bill imposing a ban on the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from passing information collected on DACA recipients to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Department of Justice, or any other law enforcement agency with exceptions in the case of fraudulent claims, national security issues, or non-immigration related felonies being investigated. In April 2019, Harris signed a letter led by Catherine Cortez Masto to Immigrations and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Enforcement asserting that \\"the civil detention of an expectant mother for potential immigration offenses is never justified\\" due to the \\"absence of compelling evidence that the detention of a pregnant woman is necessary because she is a threat to herself or others, or is a threat to public safety or national security\\". The senators requested the CBP enact measures that would ensure \\"timely and appropriate treatment\\" for pregnant women in custody along with both agencies providing information on how available facilities and doctors are for pregnant immigrants and complete data on the number of those currently in custody. In June 2019, during a forum at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Harris stated that as president she would push for comprehensive immigration reform in response to a stagnant Congress and outlined her immigration plan which included renewal and expansion of DACA, allowing undocumented parents, siblings, and spouses of U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents to seek deportation relief, and using executive actions to undo technical barriers that prevent many Dreamers from receiving legal status by applying for a green card. In June 2019, following the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development‚Äôs confirmation that DACA recipients did not meet eligibility for federal backed loans, Harris and 11 other senators introduced The Home Ownership Dreamers Act, legislation that mandated that the federal government was not authorized to deny mortgage loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or the Agriculture Department solely due to the immigration status of an applicant. In July 2019, along with Kirsten Gillibrand and Amy Klobuchar, Harris sent a letter to the Office of Refugee Resettlement asserting that the agency \\"should be prioritizing reunification of every child as soon as possible, but instead it has been responsible for policies that are forcing longer stays in government custody for children\\" and that it was mandatory that the office \\"ensure that the custody and processing of [unaccompanied migrant children] is meeting the minimum standards required by domestic and international law.\\" In July 2019, Harris and 15 other Senate Democrats introduced the Protecting Sensitive Locations Act which mandated that ICE agents get approval from a supervisor ahead of engaging in enforcement actions at sensitive locations with the exception of special circumstances and that agents receive annual training in addition to being required to report annually regarding enforcement actions in those locations. In August 2019, after the Trump administration released a new regulation imposing the possibility that any green card and visa applicants could be turned down in the event that they have low incomes or little education and have used benefits such as food stamps and housing vouchers, Harris referred to the regulation as part of Trump's ongoing campaign \\"to vilify a whole group of people\\" and cited Trump's sending of service members to the southern border and building a border wall as part of his goal to distract \\"from the fact that he has betrayed so many people and has actually done very little that has been productive in the best interest of American families.\\" In November 2019, in response to reports from NBC News that ICE had put thousands of immigrants in solitary confinement between 2012 and 2017 despite some not violating the rules, Harris, Cory Booker, and Dick Durbin introduced legislation to prevent ICE from overusing solitary confinement in its facilities. Harris said the bill required \\"ICE to comply with specific safeguards to ensure individuals are treated more humanely and ICE is not adding to the trauma many of these people have already been subjected to.\\" Harris speaking at L.A.'s Families Belong Together protest in June 2018 In April 2020, Harris was a cosponsor of the Coronavirus Immigrant Families Protection Act, legislation which would provide dedicated funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in its efforts for public outreach in multiple languages to hard-to-reach populations in order to ensure vulnerable communities are granted access to COVID-19 relief measures as well as critical public health information. The bill would also modify immigration policies deterring immigrants from receiving medical care relating to COVID-19. In April 2020, Harris, along with fellow California Senator Dianne Feinstein and Representative Juan Vargas, sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General requesting an investigation into the way detainees were treated at the Otay Mesa Detention Center following reports that they were required to sign contracts in order to receive masks, citing that they were \\"in a public health crisis, and it is our duty to protect the health and safety of every individual, especially those who are in custody and unable to take precautions on their own.\\" ===Internet privacy and net neutrality=== In September 2017, Harris was one of nine senators to sign a letter to Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai that charged the FCC with failing \\"to provide stakeholders with an opportunity to comment on the tens of thousands of filed complaints that directly shed light on proposed changes to existing net neutrality protections.\\" In March 2018, Harris was one of ten senators to sign a letter spearheaded by Jeff Merkley lambasting a proposal from FCC Chairman Ajit Pai that would curb the scope of benefits from the Lifeline program during a period where roughly 6.5 million people in poor communities relied on Lifeline to receive access to high-speed internet, citing that it was Pai's \\"obligation to the American public, as the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, to improve the Lifeline program and ensure that more Americans can afford access, and have means of access, to broadband and phone service.\\" The senators also advocated for insuring \\"Lifeline reaches more Americans in need of access to communication services.\\" === LGBT rights === San Francisco Pride, 2019 As a member of the U.S. Senate, she co-sponsored the Equality Act. In July 2018, Harris led her colleagues in introducing the Gay and Trans Panic Defense Prohibition Act of 2018, a nationwide bill that would curtail the effectiveness of the so-called gay and trans panic defenses, an issue she pioneered during her tenure as District Attorney of San Francisco. In October 2019, Harris participated in a CNN/Human Rights Campaign town hall on the topic of LGBTQ rights, where she pledged her support for \\"all of the folks who are fighting for equality\\" in cases that would determine whether gay and transgender people were protected under laws banning federal workplace discrimination. Kamala Harris drew attention to the epidemic of hate violence against Black trans women (at the time 20 killed that year), noting that LGBTQ people of color are doubly exposed to discrimination.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0BiwOZvvkc&t;=956shttps://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/08/12/kamala- harris-trans-rights-trangender-pose-angelica-ross-lgbt/ ===Sex workers=== As district attorney in 2008, Harris opposed Prop K, a San Francisco ballot measure to decriminalize sex work, calling it \\"completely ridiculous.\\" As attorney general, she led the charge against Backpage, an online classifieds service that had a subsection for escorts. In 2016, Harris filed charges against the site, leading to the arrest of the CEO and the removal of its adult section. Sex workers, who used the site to vet potential clients, were faced with a loss of income from the closure. Some were also forced into street prostitution, endangering their lives. Sex Workers Outreach Project executive director Kristen DiAngelo said that taking down Backpage would result in increased violence and risk to people engaged in survival sex. Harris also co-sponsored the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA), an anti-sex trafficking law, which holds websites responsible for third-party ads. Surveys have indicated that SESTA resulted in an overall rise in violence against sex workers. In a 2019 interview with The Root, Harris indicated that her position on sex work had relaxed. Asked if she supported the decriminalization of sex work, Harris said \\"I think so. I do.\\" She then described how she had prioritized arresting pimps and johns over sex workers. According to Rolling Stone, her comments were viewed as support for partial decriminalization, akin to the Nordic approach to sex work. ===Women's rights=== In September 2016, Governor Jerry Brown signed Assembly Bill 1671 into law, which was reportedly drafted by Harris, with input from Planned Parenthoodwhich sponsored the billmaking it a criminal offense to intentionally distribute, or to help with the dissemination of, unlawfully obtained confidential communications. Since her election to the Senate, Harris has maintained a 100% rating by the abortion rights advocacy group, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, and a 0% rating by the anti-abortion group, National Right to Life Committee. She was also endorsed by Emily's List in 2015 during her Senatorial Campaign. ===Voting rights=== Harris attributed the 2018 gubernatorial losses of Stacey Abrams and Andrew Gillum, in Georgia and Florida respectively, to voter suppression. In 2020, along with House Whip Jim Clyburn and Marcia Fudge Harris introduced the VoteSafe Act, which sets forth uniform national standards for all registered voters to use mail-in absentee voting, a minimum early in-person voting period of 20 days, and $5 billion in funding and grants for states to increase the safety and availability of voting amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The bill was endorsed by the ACLU.. == Economic issues == ===Campaign finance=== Harris's 2020 campaign has disavowed most corporate donations, and has committed to rejecting money from corporate political action committees for her presidential campaign, in favor of relying on small and large individual donors. Harris, along with candidates Cory Booker, Julian Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Kirsten Gillibrand, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Marianne Williamson, has explicitly discouraged single-candidate super PACs from operating on her behalf, though she cannot prevent them from doing so. === COVID-19 === In April 2020, Harris, along with Adam Schiff and Dianne Feinstein, unveiled legislation that would establish a bi-partisan commission to review the U.S. response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, similar to the 9/11 Commission and the Pearl Harbor Commission. Harris and her colleagues also sent a letter to the Trump administration's health officials demanding a consistent protocol for counting the number of casualties caused by the virus to prevent deflation and underreporting of the number of deaths. Harris announced that she would be introducing legislation to create a task force that would address racial disparities, the COVID-19 Racial and Ethnic Disparities Task Force Act. Under the law, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services would be empowered to make recommendations about effective distribution of resources to communities suffering from racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and death rates. House Rep. Robin Kelly introduced a companion bill in the lower chamber. Alongside Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Harris introduced a bill that would expand access by 30 percent to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps. Harris also introduced a bipartisan bill with Republican Senator Tim Scott, with the support of chef Jos√© Andr√©s to expand eligibility for assistance from FEMA, allowing state and local governments to partner with restaurants and non-profit groups to feed those in need during the pandemic. Harris also introduced a bill with and Senators Bernie Sanders and Ed Markey to give Americans a monthly payment of $2000 during the coronavirus crisis, with payments to every U.S. resident making up to $120,000 as the unemployment rate spiked to 14.7%. === Disaster relief === Touring Puerto Rico In October 2017, following Hurricane Maria and Hurricane Irma, Harris signed a letter to Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke urging her \\"to provide all necessary resources to confirm that storm-related deaths are being counted correctly\\" given that President Trump seemed \\"to be using the number of fatalities to determine the quality of the disaster response\\". In August 2018, Harris was one of eight senators to sign a letter to the Federal Emergency Management Agency charging the agency with not assisting displaced homeowners in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria under the Individuals and Households program (IHP) at \\"alarming rates.\\" In February 2019, Harris introduced the Protecting Disaster Relief Funds Act, a bill that would disable the president from taking funds allocated to the Departments of Homeland Security and Housing and Urban Development or the Army Corps of Engineers for disaster relief and using the funds in construction of physical barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border. Harris said the bill would \\"ensure that funds intended for victims of natural disasters do not go towards a wall that Congress won't fund and people on the border don't even want\\" and \\"stand up for Congress's power of the purse and help California families affected by recent natural disasters begin the process of recovery.\\" In March 2019, Harris was one of eleven senators to sign a letter to congressional leaders urging them to \\"bring legislation providing disaster supplemental appropriations to your respective floors for consideration immediately\\" after noting that the previous year had seen 124 federal disaster declarations approved for states, territories, and tribal nations across the US. In April 2019, Harris announced her opposition to a Republican disaster aid package, charging the Trump administration with playing \\"politics with disaster funding by failing to fully assist California wildfire victims and the millions of American citizens still struggling in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Survivors of these disasters are hurting, and they deserve immediate and meaningful support‚Äîthis bill does not do that.\\" In November 2019, wildfire conditions forced California power companies to begin presumptive public safety power shutoff events, nearly 800,000 electric customers were left without electricity for days. People in areas particularly vulnerable to the fires were left vulnerable, without any way of getting information and supplies. Harris introduced the Wildfire Defense Act, a bill which would invest $1 billion to establish guidelines to create community wildfire defense plans, provide grants of up to $10 million to implement such a plan, and create reporting on best practices to protect communities from wildfires. Her bill was co-sponsored by House Representative Jared Huffman. ===Consumer protection=== On April 10, 2020, Harris and Senator Elizabeth Warren introduced the Price Gouging Prevention Act, a bill that would empower the Federal Trade Commission to enforce a ban on excessive price increases of consumer goods amid national emergencies and specifically consider any price increase above 10% to be price gouging during such a declaration. In April 2020, Harris, along with Senator Sherrod Brown and Representatives Ayanna Pressley and Gregory Meeks, sent a letter to the Small Business Administration and Treasury Department requesting that the aforementioned agencies move to ensure minority-owned businesses remain under the Paycheck Protection Program and called for the Trump administration revise guidance on the program in order to reaffirm lending institutions comply with fair lending laws and mandate that they report the demographics of program lending. ===Energy and environment=== Touring neighborhood in Santa Rosa, CA During her time as San Francisco District Attorney, Harris created the Environmental Justice Unit in the San Francisco District Attorney's Office and prosecuted several industries and individuals for pollution, most notably U-Haul, Alameda Publishing Corporation, and the Cosco Busan oil spill. She also advocated for strong enforcement of environmental protection laws. In October 2017, Harris was one of nineteen senators to sign a letter to Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency Scott Pruitt questioning Pruitt's decision to repeal the Clean Power Plan, asserting that the repeal's proposal used \\"mathematical sleights of hand to over-state the costs of industry compliance with the 2015 Rule and understate the benefits that will be lost if the 2017 repeal is finalized\\" and science denying and math fabricating would fail to \\"satisfy the requirements of the law, nor will it slow the increase in frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, the inexorable rise in sea levels, or the other dire effects of global warming that our planet is already experiencing.\\" In September 2018, Harris was one of eight senators to sponsor the Climate Risk Disclosure Act, a bill described by cosponsor Elizabeth Warren as using \\"market forces to speed up the transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy‚Äîreducing the odds of an environmental and financial disaster without spending a dime of taxpayer money.\\" She stated that her goal would be achieving 100% of U.S. electricity from renewable energy sources, and that she supports a Green New Deal, an idea made popular by first-term Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, because \\"climate change is an existential threat to all of us.\\" In November 2018, Harris was one of 25 Democratic senators to co- sponsor a resolution specifying key findings of the Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change report and National Climate Assessment. The resolution affirmed the senators' acceptance of the findings and their support for bold action toward addressing climate change. On July 29, 2019, Harris and Ocasio-Cortez introduced the Climate Equity Act, a bill that would lay out steps for Congress and the White House on how to go about guaranteeing policies that composed \\"a future Green New Deal protect the health and economic wellbeing of all Americans for generations to come.\\" Referring to climate change as \\"an existential threat\\", Harris noted cutting emissions and ending American reliance on fossil fuels were not enough and cited the need \\"that communities already contending with unsafe drinking water, toxic air, and lack of economic opportunity are not left behind.\\" In August 2019, Harris was one of fifteen senators to sign a letter to EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler urging the EPA to ban chlorpyrifos given that the agency had found \\"that chlorpyrifos harms children's brains at exposures far lower than what the EPA allows\\" and warned that \\"more children, farmworkers and American families will be exposed to this pesticide and they will suffer as a result\\" of the EPA not reversing its decision. On September 4, 2019, Harris unveiled a $10 trillion climate change plan intended to move the United States to a 100 percent renewable energy- based power grid by 2030 in addition to transitioning all vehicles in America to the same energy sources by 2035. She pledged to rejoin the Paris Agreement and end U.S. support for international oil and natural gas extraction projects, furthering that as president she would \\"hold polluters accountable for the damage they inflict upon our environment and set us on a path to a 100 percent clean economy that creates millions of good-paying jobs.\\" In February 2020 Harris was one of seven senators to sign a letter to Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt that called it \\"reckless and unwise\\" to remove protections to the Arctic after the U.S. Geological Survey found the Arctic to be warming faster than any other place on Earth and stating their support for \\"the strongest possible protections‚Äù for Special Areas within the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. In April 2020, in response to the proposed decision of the EPA to retain air quality standards from the Obama administration, Harris was one of eighteen senators to sign a letter led by fellow Democratic senator Maggie Hassan asserting that the EPA \\"should be taking actions that will further protect health during this crisis, not put more Americans at risk.\\" === Free trade === In May 2019, Harris stated she would not have voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) due to her belief that \\"we can do a better job to protect American workers\\" and called for the United States to do \\"a better job in terms of thinking about the priorities that should be more apparent now than perhaps they were then, which are issues like the climate crisis and what we need to build into these trade agreements.\\" In September 2019, Harris declared she was not a \\"protectionist Democrat.\\" In January 2020, she was one of ten senators to vote against the USMCA, stating that \\"by not confronting climate change, the USMCA fails to meet the crises of the moment\\". === Healthcare === Save Our Care Rally, 2017 On August 30, 2017, Harris announced at a town hall in Oakland that she would co-sponsor fellow Senator Bernie Sanders' \\"Medicare for All\\" bill, supporting single-payer healthcare. In April 2018, Harris was one of ten senators to sponsor the Choose Medicare Act, an expanded public option for health insurance that also increased ObamaCare subsidies and rendered individuals with higher income levels eligible for its assistance. In August 2018, Harris introduced the Maternal Care Access and Reducing Emergencies (CARE) Act, a bill designed to reduce racial disparities in maternal mortality and morbidity. In the United States, the risk of death from pregnancy-related causes for black women is three to four times higher than for white women, and black women are twice as likely to suffer from life-threatening pregnancy complications. She was joined by 13 of her Democratic colleagues. In December 2018, Harris was one of 42 senators to sign a letter to Trump administration officials Alex Azar, Seema Verma, and Steve Mnuchin arguing that the administration was improperly using Section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act to authorize states to \\"increase health care costs for millions of consumers while weakening protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions.\\" The senators requested the administration withdraw the policy and \\"re-engage with stakeholders, states, and Congress.\\" In February 2019, Harris and twenty-two other Democratic senators introduced the State Public Option Act, a bill that would authorize states to form a Medicaid buy-in program for all residents and thereby grant all denizens of the state the ability to buy into a state-driven Medicaid health insurance plan if they wished. Brian Schatz, a bill cosponsor, said the legislation would \\"unlock each state's Medicaid program to anyone who wants it, giving people a high-quality, low-cost public health insurance option\\" and that its goal was \\"to make sure that every single American has comprehensive health care coverage.\\" In June 2019, Harris was one of eight senators to co- sponsor the Territories Health Equity Act of 2019, legislation that would remove the cap on annual federal Medicaid funding and increase federal matching rate for Medicaid expenditures of territories along with more funds being provided for prescription drug coverage to low-income seniors in an attempt to equalize funding for American territories Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands with that of U.S. states. On July 29, 2019, Harris unveiled a health plan that would expand coverage while preserving a role for private insurance companies, the plan calling for transitioning to a Medicare for All system over a period of ten years that would be concurrent with infants and the uninsured automatically being placed into the system while other individuals would have the option to buy into the health care plan backed by the government. The plan has been met with some criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. In November 2019, during a Morning Joe interview, Harris declined to specify the inconsistencies in the Medicare For All plan of fellow Senator and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren due to believing her own plan was superior and added that she was \\"not going to take away people's choice about having a public or a private plan, I am going to give people a transition that allows folks like organized labor to actually renegotiate their contract.\\" In April 2020, Harris was one of twenty-eight Democratic senators to sign a letter to the United States Department of Health and Human Services urging the department to reopen the online marketplace of the Affordable Care Act as to assist uninsured Americans with acquiring health insurance amid the coronavirus pandemic, opining that opening the marketplace \\"would provide an easy pathway to coverage for those who under previous circumstances may have decided to forego health insurance or purchase a substandard, junk insurance plan, but now in a global pandemic are in vital need of comprehensive coverage to protect themselves, their families, and our broader community.\\" In April 2020, Harris was one of twenty senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar regarding the removal of Dr. Rick Bright as Director of the Research and Development Authority. The senators asserted that it was of \\"the utmost importance that there be stable leadership within HHS and that decisions are driven by science and the public health\\" during the coronavirus pandemic and warned that the US could not have a steady response if its leadership was \\"being constantly shuffled and if experts are being constrained or removed when they insist on following the science and sticking to the facts.‚Äù === Housing === In April 2019 Harris was one of 41 senators to sign a bipartisan letter to the housing subcommittee praising the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's Section 4 Capacity Building program as authorizing \\"HUD to partner with national nonprofit community development organizations to provide education, training, and financial support to local community development corporations (CDCs) across the country\\" and expressing disappointment that Trump's budget \\"has slated this program for elimination after decades of successful economic and community development.\\" The senators wrote that they hoped the subcommittee would support continued funding for Section 4 in Fiscal Year 2020. In November 2019, Harris and Representative Maxine Waters introduced the Housing is Infrastructure Act, a bill that would grant $70 billion toward clearing a backlog of repairs and upgrades to federal subsidized housing and apply 25 billion toward grants for affordable housing construction and maintenance in communities of low-income as well as Native American reservations, disaffected rural areas and vulnerable groups such as the elderly and disabled. ===Labor unions=== Kamala Harris meets with officials at the Port of Los Angeles In final weeks leading up to the 2010 California Attorney General election, union groups such as California Labor Federation, Service Employees International Union Local 1000 and the California Nurses Association \\"spent hundreds of thousands of dollars\\" in an attempt to help Harris defeat Republican Steve Cooley. In May 2018, Harris was a cosponsor of the Workplace Democracy Act, a bill introduced by Representatives Donald Norcross, Mark Pocan and Rosa DeLauro and Senator Bernie Sanders intended to ease the rights of workers in their attempts to bargain for higher wages, benefits, or superior working conditions. It included a mandate that there must be a union for workers when a majority of them in a bargaining unit sign valid authorization cards to join a union and prevent employers from exploiting workers through mischaracterizing them as independent contractors or denying them overtime. In June 2018, Harris led seven other senators in sponsoring a bill amending the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to include a mandate forcing farmers to pay workers time and a half for each hour worked past the standard 40-hour work week. Harris asserted that the bill would aim \\"to correct some of the injustices they face and guarantee they will get paid for the hours they work including overtime, and minimum wage which right now they are not entitled to by law.\\" In April 2019, Harris delivered a speech at a labor dinner honoring state legislators in Sacramento, California where she listed workers benefits that would not have been made possible without organized labor and condemned rhetoric that described unions as \\"special- interest groups.\\" In July 2019, Harris and Representative Pramila Jayapal introduced the Domestic Worker's Bill of Rights in Congress. The bill included protections against harassment and discrimination in addition to guarantees for meal breaks, a minimum wage, and pay for working overtime. Harris stated that for too long American workers had \\"not been afforded the same rights and benefits as nearly every other worker, and we must change that\\" and that the bill was \\"an opportunity to bring economic justice and empowerment to millions of domestic workers‚Äîparticularly those who are immigrants and women of color.\\" In July 2019, Harris signed a letter to United States Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta that advocated for the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration to initiate a full investigation into a complaint filed on May 20 by a group of Chicago-area employees of McDonald's, which detailed workplace violence incidents that included interactions with customers such as customers throwing hot coffee and threatening employees with firearms and more. The senators argued that McDonald's could and needed to \\"do more to protect its employees, but employers will not take seriously their obligations to provide a safe workplace if OSHA does not enforce workers rights to a hazard-free workplace.\\" In August 2019, Harris delivered a speech at the Nevada State AFL-CIO Convention where she asserted that workers were not being benefitted by the American economy and that the United States would be stronger if it invested in the American worker. In August 2019, a bill that which would mandate a California Supreme Court ruling that deems a greater share of workers to be employees as opposed to independent contractors be made law was seen as \\"setting up a clash between organized labor and prominent California companies like Uber and Postmates.\\" Ian Sams, a spokesperson for Harris's then-ongoing presidential campaign, said the latter supported the bill due to her belief that \\"we need to go even further to bolster worker protections and benefits and elevate the voice of workers\\" and added that Harris wanted all workers to have a \\"robust social safety net\\" and the right to join a union. === Paid leave === On October 7, 2019, Harris unveiled a six months paid family and medical leave plan that included forming a new Office of Paid Family and Medical Leave that would oversee, determine eligibility and authorize benefit payments. Harris's paid leave program would be funded through general revenue and payroll contributions and establish a federal Bureau of Children and Family Justice. In a statement, Harris said the US will be brought \\"closer to economic justice for workers and ensures newborn children or children who are sick can get the care they need from a parent without thrusting the family into upheaval\\" via a six-month paid leave guarantee. ===Small business=== In May 2020, Harris introduced a bill with Ayanna Pressley, which would allocate grants of up to $250,000 to businesses with fewer than 10 employees, providing relief to \\"micro businesses\\" shut out of the larger coronavirus relief bill. Under the Saving Our Street Act, 75% of the $124.5 billion program would go to business and nonprofit owners from underrepresented groups and businesses bringing in less than $1 million in gross revenue per year. === Taxes === Harris opposed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and has called for a repeal of the bill's tax cuts for wealthy Americans. In 2018, she proposed a tax cut for the majority of working- and middle-class Americans. An analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimated that the bill would reduce federal revenue by $2.8 trillion over a decade. She proposed to pay for the tax cuts by repealing tax cuts for wealthy Americans and by increasing taxes on corporations. In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Harris was a cosponsor of the All Dependents Count Act, legislation that expand eligibility for the $500 credit under the CARES Act in order for a taxpayer to receive a $500 credit for all dependents they care for. === United States Postal Service === In March 2019, Harris was a cosponsor of a bipartisan resolution led by Gary Peters and Jerry Moran that opposed privatization of the United States Postal Service (USPS), citing the USPS as an establishment that was self-sustained and noting concerns that a potential privatization could cause higher prices and reduced services for customers of USPS with a particular occurrence in rural communities. In April 2020, Harris was one of fourteen senators to sign a letter led by Cory Booker to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer urging them \\"to provide appropriate funding to the United States Postal Service (USPS) in the next coronavirus package that Congress takes up\\" as they reasoned that millions of Americans rely on the USPS for essential goods and duties. === Workplace harassment === In March 2019, Harris and Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski reintroduced the Ending the Monopoly of Power Over Workplace Harassment through Education and Reporting (EMPOWER) Act, a bill that would prohibit non-disclosure and non-disparagement clauses used by some employers in employment requirements. In April 2019, Harris signed onto the Be HEARD Act, legislation intended to abolish the tipped minimum wage along with ending mandatory arbitration and pre-employment nondisclosure agreements. The bill also gave workers additional time to report harassment and was said by cosponsor Patty Murray to come at a time when too many workers are \\"still silenced by mandatory disclosure agreements that prevent them from discussing sexual harassment and longstanding practices like the tipped wages that keep workers in certain industries especially vulnerable.\\" == Foreign policy == === Presidential war powers === In September 2019, The New York Times issued a questionnaire including the question \\"Under what circumstances other than a literally imminent threat to the United States, if any, does the Constitution permit a president to order an attack on another country without prior Congressional authorization? What about bombing Iranian or North Korean nuclear facilities?\\" Harris answered \\"The President‚Äôs top priority is to keep America secure, and I won't hesitate to do what it takes to protect our country in the face of an imminent threat in the future. But after almost two decades of war, it is long past time for Congress to rewrite the Authorization for Use of Military Force that governs our current military conflicts. The situations in Iran or North Korea would require careful consideration of all of the surrounding facts and circumstances.\\" === Asia === China Kamala Harris at Camp Pendleton Harris has objected to the Chinese government's unfair trade practices and theft of American intellectual property, but has sharply criticized President Trump's trade war with China, describing the administration's arbitrary use of tariffs as \\"counterproductive to its goal of ensuring a level playing field for American companies.‚Äù Harris has also condemned the Chinese government's widespread human rights abuses, emphasizing the mass detention of Uyghur Muslims in the Xinjiang re-education camps and abuse of surveillance for political and religious repression. Harris added that while cooperation with the Chinese may be necessary for global issues like climate change the United States must reclaim its moral authority to stand up forcefully for human rights in China. Harris has expressed her support for the protestors in Hong Kong, co-sponsoring the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act in October 2019. She condemned the Hong Kong government's use of excessive force against peaceful protestors and Beijing's failure to respect Hong Kong's sovereignty, as well as criticizing President Trump's weak responses to same. India Kamala Harris has taken stances on Indian legislation like CAA and Kashmir, which Indian government considers as an internal matter. Within weeks of India ending the special status of Kashmir on August 5, 2019, Senator Harris along with other leaders of the Democratic Party met members of the Kashmiri diaspora represented by an outfit called Justice For Kashmir (JFK), a NGO. According to media reports, the aim of JFK is to raise awareness on ‚Äòpolitical incursions‚Äô by India in Kashmir among the leading politicians, bureaucrats and intellectuals in the US. These meetings were arranged by Asif Mahmood, a democrat of Pakistani origin, whose stance regarding Kashmir is well documented. Mahmood himself has spoken to media outlets confirming that he did facilitate those meetings so that Kashmiris could get a platform to voice their concerns A few months later, in December 2019, Harris vehemently criticized India's foreign minister, Jaishankar‚Äôs refusal to attend a meeting with Congress delegates as it included Pramila Jayapal, who had introduced a resolution on Kashmir urging India to lift restrictions. New Delhi had described the resolution as not being a ‚Äòfair characteristic of what the government of India is doing'. During her unsuccessful presidential campaign, when Harris was asked about the lockdown in Kashmir she had responded by saying, ‚ÄúIt is about reminding people that they are not alone, that we are all watching,‚Äù leaving little doubt as to her stance. Myanmar In October 2017, Harris condemned the genocide of the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar and called for a stronger response to the crisis. North Korea Harris visiting American troops, April 2017 Serving on the Select Committee on Intelligence, Harris has characterized North Korea as \\"one of the most serious security threats\\". In February 2018, Harris was one of 18 Democratic senators to sign a letter to Trump stating that he lacked the authority to launch a preemptive strike against North Korea without authorization from Congress. The letter stated: \\"Without congressional authority, a preventative or preemptive U.S. military strike would lack either a constitutional basis or legal authority.\\" In February 2019, after former Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe claimed that President Trump believed the claims of President of Russia Vladimir Putin over U.S. intelligence agencies' reports on the subject of North Korea's missile capabilities, she told reporters, \\"The idea that the president of the U.S. would take the word of the head of Russia over the intel community is the height of irresponsibility and shameful.\\" Later that month, the 2019 North Korea‚ÄìUnited States Hanoi Summit scheduled for February 27 and 28 at the Sofitel Legend Metropole Hanoi in Hanoi, Vietnam, was cut short without an agreement after the White House claimed North Korea purportedly requested an end to all sanctions, though North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho later claimed the regime was only interested in a partial lifting of sanctions. In May 2019 on an appearance on CNN, Harris condemned President Trump's relationship with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. Following the failure of the Hanoi summit and after a North Korean ship was seized in defiance of international sanctions, Pyongyang conducted missile tests in retaliation, Harris stated that embracing the tyrant and not confronting the regime's human rights violations was \\"not in the best interests of the nation.\\" In an August 2019 interview, Harris emphasized that any diplomatic solution with respect to North Korea must involve American allies Japan and the Republic of Korea. When asked if she as president would sign an agreement with North Korea granting partial sanctions relief in exchange for some denuclearization, Harris replied that President Trump had given \\"Kim one PR victory after the next, all without securing any real concessions\\" and that she would \\"consider targeted sanctions relief to improve the lives of the North Korean people if the regime were to take serious, verifiable steps to roll back its nuclear program.\\" During the November 2019 Democratic presidential debate, Harris was asked whether she would make concessions to Supreme Leader of North Korea Kim Jong-un in order to continue the talks started by the Trump administration. Harris responded that Trump had been \\"punked\\" and that the president had compromised America's ability to slow down North Korea's nuclear program. Harris pointed out that by ending military exercises with South Korea, there were no more concessions to be made, adding that Trump \\"traded a photo-op for nothing.\\" === Central and South America === El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras In April and July 2019, Harris was one of thirty-four senators to sign a letter to President Trump encouraging him \\"to listen to members of your own Administration\\" and reverse a decision to cut off $370 million in foreign assistance to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. The senators argued that foreign assistance to Central American countries created less migration to the U.S., citing the funding's helping to improve conditions in those countries. Brazil In 2019, as the 2019 Amazon rainforest wildfires began intensifying in Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Peru as a result of slash-and- burn deforestation and the effects of climate change, Harris called out Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro for his failure to act.https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1165283684905291778 She later joined her Senate colleagues in urging U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to postpone trade negotiations with Brazil until he took steps to combat the illegal deforestation. Venezuela In early 2019, an ongoing Venezuelan presidential crisis regarding the legitimacy of the President of Venezuela erupted between factions supporting incumbent Nicol√°s Maduro and challenger Juan Guaid√≥. The opposition-majority National Assembly declared Maduro a \\"usurper\\" and announced its intentions to proceed with Guaid√≥ as the acting president under Article 233 of the Venezuelan Constitution while the Supreme Tribunal of Justice declared the National Assembly to be \\"unconstitutional.\\" Protests erupted and international condemnation of Maduro followed thereafter, with Guaid√≥ being recognized as the acting President of Venezuela by about 60 democratic countries. Recognition of the Maduro government fell along traditional geopolitical lines, with the governments of China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia, and Turkey supporting Maduro. In response, Harris condemned Maduro as a repressive and corrupt dictator, calling on the Venezuelan military not to exercise use of force against civilians. Harris committed to extending temporary protected status to Venezuelans living in America to prevent their deportation back to South America. She did not support military action by U.S. forces, criticizing John Bolton's suggestions to adopt a more hawkish position, suggesting dispersal of additional aid to humanitarian organizations working in Venezuela. In contrast, Senator Bernie Sanders received bipartisan condemnation for his response to the crisis, refusing to recognize Guaid√≥ as the interim president and refusing to condemn Maduro as a dictator. However, international recognition of Juan Guaid√≥ as opposition leader of Venezuela has been denounced by commentators such as Havard law professor Noah Feldman as \\"a fig leaf for regime change\\", noting that Article 233 does not say the assembly can remove the president and succession in the event the president is unavailable to serve only applies for 30 days. Juan Guaid√≥ has promised to allow U.S. oil companies to increase their activity in Venezuela, in the context of liaisons between the Trump administration and Guaido such as Senator Marco Rubio claiming that Guaid√≥ would create jobs refining heavy crude for American workers. ===Europe=== NATO Kamala Harris, July 2018 In July 2018, Harris, ahead of an Exercise RIMPAC, the world's largest international maritime warfare exercise between the military forces from the Pacific Rim and beyond, expressed gratitude to the member nations of NATO. She stated that President Trump's \\"disgusting\\" remarks had \\"frayed\\" the alliance but that \\"longtime mutual trust surpasses whatever happens in the White House.\\" Russia In June 2017, Harris spoke out against Russia's interference in the 2016 elections, calling out their exploitation of divisive issues on race and joining the intelligence community's unanimous assessment that the Russians assisted Donald Trump's campaign. In July 2017, Harris voted in favor of the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act that grouped together sanctions against Iran, Russia and North Korea. Harris has condemned the Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, calling it a \\"severe violation of the international norms that have guided the world since World War II.\\" She also referred to the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 as an act of Russian aggression, attributing responsibility of the 298 civilians on board to a Russian surface-to-air missile. She expressed her support for the sovereignty of Ukraine, and led her colleagues in holding the Trump administration accountable on the issue by filing a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit in hopes of releasing documents related to the Trump‚ÄìUkraine scandal that led to the President's impeachment. In December 2018, after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the Trump administration was suspending its obligations in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 60 days in the event that Russia continued to violate the treaty, Harris was one of 26 senators to sign a letter expressing concern over the administration \\"now abandoning generations of bipartisan U.S. leadership around the paired goals of reducing the global role and number of nuclear weapons and ensuring strategic stability with America's nuclear-armed adversaries\\" and calling on Trump to continue arms negotiations. ===Middle East=== Afghanistan In December 2018, Harris traveled to Kabul, Mazar-e Sharif, and Kandahar in Afghanistan with two of her Republican colleagues on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senators Burr and Lankford to visit troops, diplomats, and other national security professionals. Harris, joining her colleagues, has said the War in Afghanistan must end, albeit responsibly and in coordination with regional allies to protect gains made for Afghan women and others. Israel Signing guestbook at Yad Vashem in Israel with husband Doug Emhoff In 2017, Harris gave a public address to AIPAC attendees. She said: \\"I believe Israel should never be a partisan issue, and as long as I'm a United States senator, I will do everything in my power to ensure broad and bipartisan support for Israel's security and right to self-defense.\\" Harris noted that \\"the first resolution I co-sponsored as a United States senator was to combat anti-Israel bias at the United Nations,\\" referring to a Senate resolution celebrating the 50th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem. In that same speech, she expressed her support for a two-state solution to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. In late 2017, she traveled to Israel, where she met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and visited the Western Wall, Yad Vashem, and the Supreme Court of Israel. Executive Director of the Jewish Democratic Council of America Halie Soifer, who previously served as Harris's national security advisor, said the following of Harris: In 2018, in another speech to AIPAC, Harris reiterated her support for Israel, reminiscing about growing up in the Bay Area, collecting funds to plant trees in Israel for the Jewish National Fund. She later condemned anti-semitism in the aftermath of Tree of Life ‚Äì Or L'Simcha Congregation shooting which claimed the lives of 11 worshippers during Shabbat morning services. In 2019, she opposed the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement targeting Israel. She was a cosponsor of a Senate resolution expressing objection to the UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned Israeli settlement building in the West Bank as a violation of international law. Iran USS Theodore Roosevelt Harris supported the Iran nuclear deal. In 2018, after Trump announced the United States was withdrawing from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Harris released a statement saying the decision \\"jeopardizes our national security and isolates us from our closest allies\\" while calling the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action \\"the best existing tool we have to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons and avoid a disastrous military conflict in the Middle East.\\" In 2019, Harris said she would rejoin the agreement and expand it to cover ballistic missile testing. In the wake of the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, the commander of the Iranian Quds Force, Harris joined her Senate colleagues in introducing the No War Against Iran Act and condemning President Trump's \\"dangerous escalation\\" with the Iranian regime Saudi Arabia In late 2018, she voted to withdraw U.S. military aid for Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen. She also backed a resolution blaming Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman for the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul. Harris also condemned President Trump for turning a blind eye to the murder. Harris has called for a \\"fundamental\\" re-evaluation of the American relationship with Saudi Arabia, but acknowledged that the Saudis have been strong partners in areas of mutual interest, such as counterterrorism. Syria In April 2017, in response to the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack, Harris condemned Syrian president Bashar al-Assad with attacking Syrian children, and stated \\"the clear fact that president Assad is not only a ruthless dictator brutalizing his own people‚Äîhe is a war criminal the international community cannot ignore.\\" She called on President Trump to work with Congress on his administration's \\"lack of clear objectives in Syria and articulate a detailed strategy and path forward in partnership with our allies.\\" Later that month, in her first overseas trip as a Senator, she visited the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, the world's largest camp for Syrian refugees. In May 2017, the Trump administration decided to arm Kurds in Syria in the fight against ISIS over the objections of Turkey. In November 2017, under pressure from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Trump reversed course and cut off the Kurds' supply of arms. Then, in December 2018, President Trump announced the full withdrawal of American troops in Syria, leading to the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. Harris immediately criticized Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, which gave Turkey the green light to launch the military offensive against Syrian Kurds. In August 2019, after Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard attacked Harris for her record as a prosecutor in a presidential debate, Harris shrugged off her remarks and characterized Gabbard as an \\"apologist\\" for Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. In November 2019, during a presidential debate, Harris condemned Gabbard for her decision to meet with the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in 2017, her subsequent skepticism about claims that Assad used chemical weapons against civilians in Khan Shaykhun, and her refusal to call Assad a war criminal. == References == Category:Kamala Harris Harris, Kamala Harris, Kamala ","title":"Political positions of Kamala Harris"},{"id":"63852655","text":"Benjamin Ozegovic (born 9 August 1999) is a professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for the club Altach.

The album was released on 8 October 2010 and peaked at number 28 on the ARIA Charts. The album features the contributions from acclaimed jazz pianist Paul Grabowsky, former John Butler Trio drummer Michael Barker and vocals from Tim Rogers. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2011, the album won ARIA Award for Best Blues and Roots Album; the third time the band had won this award in as many nominations. ==Background and release== After the release of When the Flood Comes in 2008, band members Cameron Goodall and Michael Green left for other musical projects, leaving Taasha Coates and Tristan Goodall as a duo. Coates said the departure came without \\"bitter sentiments\\" saying \\"They're lovely boys, but Tristan and I found that once we got into the studio to record, it felt really liberating because we could really free up the arrangements and have different instruments on them and get in different guests, so it ended up being a really positive thing.\\" Prior to the writing of Sometimes the Stars, Coates embarked on a backpacking trip across India. Coates said \\"I went for a five-week holiday with my partner ‚Äì I used to do a lot of travel when I was younger. I've done a lot of travel with the band, but it's so different 'cause you have to lug around your shoes and your nice frocks and make-up. I wanted to travel with one pair of jeans, one pair of shoes and a sleeping bag ‚Äì it was just a really nice thing to do.\\" A few months later, and after some writing sessions, Coates and Goodall set off on a tour as a duo, road-testing some of the songs that would eventually end up on the album. Coates said \\"We've taken our time writing this record... we felt really rushed writing the second record, so we really wanted to give ourselves a bit of time. The heart of the band's always been Tristan and I, so I think it's more honest, in a way, to bring it back to the two of us.\\" Coates recorded her vocals in single takes so as to capture the spontaneity of their live performance. ==Track listing== # \\"Comfort Me\\" - 3:37 # \\"I'll Take What's Mine\\" - 4:08 # \\"Troubles Somehow\\" - 3:31 # \\"Poorhouse\\" - 3:37 # \\"Monster\\" (Part II) - 3:32 # \\"Falling Down\\" - 4:20 # \\"Sometimes the Stars\\" - 4:32 # \\"Two States Away\\" - 5:00 # \\"Little Molly\\" - 4:44 # \\"Lonesome Valley\\" - 3:46 ;Bonus Disc # \\"Banjo & Violin\\" # \\"Small Things\\" # \\"Poorhouse\\" # \\"Comfort Me\\" ==Charts== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" !align=\\"left\\"Chart (2010) !align=\\"left\\"Peak position - } ==References== Category:2010 albums Category:The Audreys albums Category:ARIA Award-winning albums ","title":"Sometimes the Stars"},{"id":"63852769","text":"'Til My Tears Roll Away is the fourth studio album by Australian blues/roots band, The Audreys.

The route serves a total of seven railway stations. The bike path is incomplete, as the section between Blackburn and Laburnum is yet to be constructed. ==Construction== Construction on the bike path first began in Mitcham in 2013, done alongside the railway grade separation at Mitcham Road. The first section, from Walkers Road in Nunawading to Mitcham Station, was eventually completed in 2014. The Box Hill section of the project was split into two parts, the first commencing in late 2014 and the second in early 2018. The first section was from Box Hill Station to Linsley Street in Box Hill. Work was completed on this section in May 2015. The second section was from Linsley Street to Middleborough Road, completed in August 2019. In May 2017, the Blackburn section (The Blackburn station and Blackburn road precinct) and the Heatherdale section (Mitcham Road to Eastlink) were completed. In 2018, the Ringwood section (Eastlink to Ringwood) was completed. After that, the only sections to be completed were the Nunawading station precinct section, which was completed in August 2019, and the Laburnum section, which is yet to commence. ==Trail route== ===Box Hill to Laburnum=== The trail begins on Bank Street, on the opposite side of Station Street to the Box Hill Station and Box Hill Central Shopping Centre. It briefly starts on road, but turns off onto a shared use path next to the road. It continues along this off-road path for about 1.9 kilometres, with a connection onto Whitehorse Road and Box Hill High School, before it reaches Middleborough Road. It does not intersect with Middleborough Road, rather, a steep ramp winds underneath the road. The trail shares the footpath with Middleborough Road for a short distance before continuing on a decline towards Laburnum. There is a ramp connection onto the Laburnum station platforms, but the main path continues onto Laburnum Street. ===Laburnum to Blackburn=== This section of the trail has not been constructed, and is due to begin being constructed around mid-2020. This proposed section of path will run along Laburnum Street, then turn onto Main Street to meet with Blackburn Station. ===Blackburn to Nunawading=== This section of the trail begins on the Blackburn Station concourse, running alongside South Parade, and then underneath Blackburn Road. It then follows the rail line for 2 kilometres, with connections onto Oliver Avenue and Morton Park. It bypasses Nunawading Christian College and Laughlin Avenue, and runs parallel to Nunawading Station, and finishes at the set of traffic lights at the Springvale Road. ===Nunawading to Mitcham=== This part of the trail begins winding through the Nunawading Station concourse towards Walkers Road. It is eventually pushed onto Walkers Road, where the bike path connects with HOME HQ Nunawading, but then goes into an off-road path which runs until Rooks Road. At Rooks Road there is a set of traffic lights with priority for patrons using the path. The path continues straight, past the Mitcham Station car parking areas, into the Mitcham Station bus bays, then turns right, goes through the concourse and finishes at Mitcham Road. ===Mitcham to Heatherdale=== The trail crosses Mitcham road and goes down a sharp decline on Brunswick Road. This decline flattens out and the path separates from Brunswick Road around 250 metres after the intersection with Mitcham Road. The path is then again running alongside the rail line with much tree cover. The trail then goes over Cochrane Street on a bridge, built to keep the trail from having a sharp decline and incline. It continues up until Talbot Street, where it crosses over the rail line to the Tennyson Street side, and continues towards Heatherdale Station, with a slight decline onto Heatherdale Road. The intersection at Heatherdale road also has traffic lights which prioritise users of the bike path. ===Heatherdale to Ringwood=== After crossing Heatherdale Road, the bike path continues along the southern part of the station, running down until it reaches Molan Street. It then uses the Molan Street bridge to cross over the Eastlink. It then merges with the Eastlink trail for a brief distance, before heading northward and then eastward, adjacent to the rail line. It continues until the Albert Street intersection, where there is a set of prioritised traffic lights for users of the path. It then continues on a low incline until it diverges away from Albert Street and runs with the rail line. It connects with Thanet Court and runs alongside the station parking until it intersects with Wantirna Road, where there are traffic lights without priority for users of the path. It then runs along Station Street until it reaches Ringwood Station, and connects with the Ringwood-Belgrave Rail Trail. This is where the trail finishes. ==Connections== Beginning at Box Hill, the rail trail connects with the Box Hill Activity Precinct. Not long after this it connects with Box Hill Town Hall, and the Linsley Street Reserve. The Box Hill section also has connections into Box Hill High School, Box Hill Cemetery and Whitehorse Road. After Middleborough Road it runs through Laburnum Park, and connects with the station and the shops on Salisbury Avenue. In the Blackburn - Nunawading section, it connects with the Blackburn Station Precinct on South Parade and Blackburn Road, as well as the Blackburn Library and Blackburn Tennis Club. It also connects to Morton Park. Towards Nunawading, it connects with Oliver Avenue, which leads down towards Blackburn Lake sanctuary, which also leads to the Gardiners Creek Trail In the Nunawading - Mitcham section, it connects with the Nunawading Station Precinct, as well as HOME HQ Nunawading. It connects with Rooks Road, which leads to the pipe track trail that runs through Mitcham to Burwood East and Mount Waverley. It connects with the Mitcham Station Precinct and the Britannia Mall. In the Mitcham - Heatherdale section, it connects to the nearby Heatherdale pre-school, as well as Heatherdale Station. In the final Heatherdale - Ringwood section, it connects with the Ringwood Retirement Village, Eastland Shopping Centre and the Ringwood RSL. == References == Category:Bike paths in Melbourne Category:Rail trails in Victoria (Australia) ","title":"Box Hill to Ringwood Rail Trail"},{"id":"63853773","text":"Remototrachyna is a genus of foliose lichens in the large family Parmeliaceae. It was separated from the genus Hypotrachyna based on the structure of the excipulum (a cup-shaped layer of sterile tissue that contains the hymenium) and genetic differences. ==Taxonomy== Remototrachyna was segregated from the large genus Hypotrachyna by Pradeep Divakar and Ana Crespo in 2010, after molecular phylogenetic work showed that a group of 15 largely South and East Asian species formed a clade that was genetically distinct from the core group of Hypotrachyna. Ancestral reconstruction suggests that Remototrachyna originated in the Indian subcontinent. The genus name, which combines the Latin remoto (far apart) and Hypotrachyna, refers to its genetic distance from Hypotrachyna. ==Description== Diagnostic characters for Remototrachyna include lobes (measuring 2‚Äì10 mm wide) that are narrow, sublinear to linear‚Äêelongate, truncate, and subdichotomously to dichotomously branched. Their rhizines are short, richly dichotomously branched. Marginal cilia are typically absent in this genus; when present, they are simple and in lobe axils. The hymenium measures 50‚Äì100 ¬µm high. The outer exciple layer is a plectenchyma with very thick cell walls. Ascospores measure 10.5‚Äì21 by 6.5‚Äì13 ¬µm. The conidia are bifusiform (resembling two adjacent spindles), and are 6 by 1 ¬µm long. Classes of secondary chemicals found in the medulla include orcinol depsides (gyrophoric acid), and beta‚Äêorcinol depsidones (such as protocetraric, salazinic, norstictic, and stictic acids). The cortex contains atranorin. ==Habitat and distribution== Most Remototrachyna species grow on bark and rocks in tropical areas, typically at higher elevations (). They are mostly found in humid and open areas of Southeast Asia. ==Species== *Remototrachyna adducta (Nyl.)

The official USGS report in their historical earthquakes list stated a magnitude of and an intensity of VIII (\\"Severe\\"). An official USGS report published in 1988 assigned the modified magnitude of . It was felt in an area of between and , which is considered a small area for a quake of this size. The farthest distance from the epicenter for the felt area was . The quake lasted several seconds. The first major aftershock was a and an intensity of VII (\\"Very Strong\\"). The epicenter was at the same location as the initial quake, and the felt area was similar. The second major aftershock was the same magnitude and intensity as the initial quake, was in the same location, and felt in a similarly sized area. This quake was reported as \\"quick and short as the detonation of a cannon\\". The quakes were felt as far north as Salina and as far south as Marysvale. ==Destruction== Damage to chimneys and brick walls from the initial quake was \\"considerable\\". Over US$100,000 in damages were caused (over US$1.44 million in 2020) by the primary quake. The town of Elsinore, reported sunken foundations, damaged roofs from collapsing chimneys and brick walls, and brick, adobe, and stone buildings were significantly damaged. More than half of the residences in the town were seriously damaged, a dozen were damaged enough to be condemned, and most residences received some cracking and plaster damage. The newly built schoolhouse had walls collapse and a damaged roof, causing it to have to be rebuilt. Damage in Monroe included collapsed pipe trenches, cracked buildings, and the hot springs at the town turned \\"blood red\\" from iron oxide. Large boulders were dislodged and some landslides were reported in canyons near Monroe. The first major aftershock‚Äîin the evening on the same day‚Äîdid further damage to structures, especially those already affected by the primary quake. Structures in Monroe received significantly more damage from this aftershock. Damage was also reported in Richfield. On 1 October, the second major aftershock destroyed many of the damaged buildings, including a paint store in Elsinore. It also caused new damage to undamaged buildings, and caused previously-damaged buildings to be completely destroyed. More large boulders were dislodged and additional landslides were caused in various canyons near the affected towns. Monroe was especially hard hit, with almost all chimneys being destroyed and many buildings being damaged beyond repair. A man seated high on a bank of a river was thrown down to the edge of the river, the hot springs were discolored by iron oxide again, and the Monroe City Hall was \\"shattered\\". No people were killed in the quake, though at least two were injured by falling bricks or plaster. ==References== Category:1921 in Utah Category:1921 earthquakes Category:1921 natural disasters in the United States Category:Earthquakes in Utah ","title":"1921 Sevier Valley earthquake"},{"id":"63854001","text":"Map of Massachusetts House of Representatives' 6th Bristol district, 2013.

Sch√ºrle is a pioneer in nanorobotic and magnetic servoing technologies. Her research program is aimed at understanding cellular mechanisms of disease and then subsequently innovating minimally invasive nano- and micro-scale therapeutic and diagnostic technologies for these diseases. == Early life and education == Sch√ºrle was born in Ulm, Germany. In 2003, Sch√ºrle pursued her post-secondary academic studies at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Karlsruhe, Germany. During her studies, Sch√ºrle travelled abroad to learn techniques and apply her expertise in engineering at two international institutes, funded by the Heinrich Hertz Fellowship and a German State scholarship. Sch√ºrle first conducted research in bioengineering at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. She studied automated drug infusion and control, completing her project in 2006. She then travelled to Kyoto University in Japan in where she worked in the Nano/Micro System Laboratory learning the fundamentals of building and applying carbon nanotube based sensors to biomedical application. After completing her studies in Japan in 2008, Sch√ºrle returned to Germany to complete additional courses and research and received her M.Sc. in Industrial Engineering and Management from KIT by 2009. Following her Master's, Sch√ºrle pursued her Ph.D. at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, in Zurich (ETHZ) within the Institute of Robotics and Intelligent Systems. While at ETHZ, Sch√ºrle explored the use of magnetic manipulation as a means to control wireless, nanoscale robots for biomedical diagnostic and therapeutic tools and devices. Sch√ºrle completed her PhD work in 2014, receiving immense recognition for her innovative thesis work on magnetic manipulation techniques. To better develop the knowledge and skills necessary to apply her techniques in cancer therapy, Sch√ºrle pursued postdoctoral studies at the Koch Institute at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts. While at the Koch, Sch√ºrle explored the use of nanosensors in tumor profiling and drug transport to tumors. Sch√ºrle completed her postdoctoral work in 2017. === Magnetic control methods and microstructure design === In her graduate work, Sch√ºrle used her expertise from her undergraduate experience in Kyoto to fabricate innovative ways to mechanically characterize the properties of carbon nanotubes (CTN) and their interfaces with other substances. Since transmission electron microscopes (TEM) are often used to observe the characteristics of novel CNTs, Sch√ºrle and her colleagues designed a fabrication technique for TEM compatible devices with which to image CNT-metal contact strength. The device design allows them to observe failures in CNT technology, such as when the CNT-metal contacts slip, which will inform future fabrication of CNTs for use in miniaturized devices. Following this development, Sch√ºrle designed a method of servoing magnetic nanostructures through magnetic fields, essentially developing a magnet-based system that can control the pose and motion of objects at the nanoscale. Their system has critical applications to translational medicine as controlled servoing is critical to designing and implementing magnetic drug carrier technology and targeting it to cancer cells. Some major challenges engineers face in the design of these systems are inducing magnetic fields deep enough into tissue, through nested coils, to enable magnetic control of multiple degrees of positional and orientational freedom of nano-objects. The technology Sch√ºrle and her colleagues developed for magnetic manipulation of magnetic nano- objects, can fit on an inverted fluorescence microscope and enables magnetic control of 3 positional degrees of freedom and 2 orientational degrees of freedom. The ability to generate independent field and magnetic gradient vectors allows for the holonomic wireless manipulation of magnetic cylindrical nano-objects, similar to what might be used in targeted drug delivery or cell manipulation medical applications. After designing the system to magnetically control microstructure movement, Sch√ºrle and her team designed improved tubular and helical magnetic microstructures as applications for this system. Both tubular and helical structures can be oriented and moved magnetically and they have enhanced drug loading capabilities due to higher surface-to-volume ration than spheres, as well as tubules having an open inner cavity that could be filled with drugs. Further, due to shape anisotropy, tubular and helical structures exhibit larger magnetization and are more easily oriented in magnetic fields. Sch√ºrle based the design of her nanostructures on biological organisms, such that the motion of the microhelices was inspired by bacterial corkscrew swimming movement. Further, both the tubules and the helices were made rigid by creating them from phospholipid like monomers, such that the overall polymer could be manipulated by a magnetic field. In her doctoral thesis, Sch√ºrle used her previous findings and experience in CNT characterization, magnetic field-based servoing system, and maneuverable nanostructures to create NanoMag, a magnetic control system enabling the manipulation of microstructures that meets the needs of biological application. NanoMag was designed to allow magnetic control of spheres, cylinders, and helices, all potential drug-carrier structures. To complement this technology, Sch√ºrle also designed a method to create helical microswimmers based on a self-assembly mechanism similar to the phospholipid bilayer. Sch√ºrle further validated her technology's potential for targeted drug delivery by assessing its efficacy in living cells, specifically macrophages, to record the dynamics of nanoparticle uptake by living cells. Sch√ºrle measured the initial contact forces and monitor the motion of the probe, providing insight into the biophysical mechanisms of phagocytosis. Sch√ºrle then used a 3D tracking system to prove that micromanipulation of tissue is possible in both zebrafish and chick embryos, highlighting the flexibility of the system to various biological applications. == Career and research == In 2017, Sch√ºrle became a tenure track Assistant Professor at ETH Z√ºrich for Responsive Biomedical Systems. The Responsive Biomedical Systems Laboratory, which Sch√ºrle is the Principal Investigator of, is a part of the Institute of Translational Medicine which was founded in 2017 right before her arrival. The goal of the institute is to walk the line between the laboratory and the clinic to move science into treatments and diagnostics as quickly as possible. In the Responsive Biomedical Systems Lab, Sch√ºrle leads a research program with a goal of exploring the cellular basis of disease and designing innovative nano- and micro-scale tools to diagnose disease and target disease processes. Specifically, her team designs responsive nanorobotic tools which can detect the biological disease environment, through pH sensing or protein activity, and then be controlled through externally applied stimuli to release drugs or report specific characteristics of the diseased tissue to act as therapeutics or diagnostics. Overall, Sch√ºrle's research program addresses the current state of health by approaching disease diagnosis and intervention in innovative ways. As such, Sch√ºrle is a member of various initiatives to work towards healthcare innovation. Sch√ºrle is an Expert Advisory Board Member of the Singularity Group, directing investors towards the most promising future technologies. Sch√ºrle also serves on the Global Future Council on the Future of Human Enhancement for the World Economics Forum. Sch√ºrle is also an advocate for women in STEM and for improving the culture of academia. After the ‚ÄúWe Scientists 2035‚Äù workshop, Sch√ºrle and her colleagues deduced that pressure due to ever increasing expectations has created a toxic culture in academia and one that does not foster scientific integrity or the most effective innovation. Sch√ºrle suggests dividing tasks that normally all fall on the back of one researcher (such as teaching, grant writing, designing experiments, and more) across multiple specialists in each individual task so that each one can be accomplished with higher quality. She advocates for science to be done in multidisciplinary teams, not in individual silos. === Nano- and microscale sensors and robotics === While at M.I.T, Sch√ºrle worked towards designing in vivo nanotools that enabled diagnosis and characterization of the tumor microenvironment. Since the first step in targeted tumor treatment is a precise diagnosis of the specific biology of the tumor and is microenvironment, Sch√ºrle began designing a system that allowed specific control and delivery of protease-activity nanosensors via alternating magnetic fields. The nanosensors were delivered to the body, unveiled at the tumor site via heat activation, and the protein contents in the particle were dissipated leading to a reaction with a detectable by-product in the urine for quantification and diagnostic information. Sch√ºrle and her colleagues validated the technology in mouse models of human colorectal cancer to successfully assess tumor activity. Sch√ºrle and her colleagues then published a pivotal paper, highlighting their design of a robotic technology capable of measuring the mechanobiological properties of cellular behavior. They designed a microrobotic probe that mimicked bacteria, such that they could characterize the attack profiles of macrophages, phagocytic innate immune cells, as they hunt and engulf bacteria. Since Sch√ºrle and her colleagues were able to dynamically control the translational and rotational movements of the robots, they could assess how macrophage attack strategies differ for different translation and rotational prey dynamics. The 5-degree of freedom magnetic tweezer system allowed for the dynamic control of robotic movement. Sch√ºrle subsequently co-founded a company, called Magnebotix, based on this technology. Magnebotix develops a range of nanorobotic technologies for applications in biological systems such as crystal capture and dissection of the mechanobiology of various cells and tissues in vivo. Sch√ºrle continues to develop innovative robotic tools, based on biological systems, that enable targeted drug delivery. In 2019, Sch√ºrle and her colleagues created two new types of micropropellers that increase the ease of nanoparticles transport through blood vessels and into tissues. The first structure is an artificial bacterial flagellum and the second is a swarm of living magnetotactic bacteria to create a stream to ease nanoparticle transport.

NBC was the official American network television broadcaster for the international association football competition in 1966 and 1986. ==Coverage history== ===1966=== The first American coverage of the World Cup consisted only of a previously filmed telecast of the 1966 Final on NBC. The Final was aired before their coverage of the Saturday Major League Baseball Game of the Week. NBC used the black & white BBC feed and aired it on a two-hour film delay. This was the first time soccer had been shown in the United States as a stand- alone broadcast. Previously, ABC's Wide World of Sports had shown England's Football Association Cup on as long as a two-week delay. ===1986=== On October 6, 1984. NBC's anthology series, SportsWorld provided World Cup soccer qualifying coverage featuring the United States and the Netherlands Antilles. 1986 marked the first time that the World Cup had extensive live cable and network television coverage in the United States. ESPN carried most of the weekday matches while NBC did weekend games. To be more specific, NBC aired seven matches, including the \\"Hand of God\\" quarterfinal, with broadcasters on- site. NBC's theme music for their 1986 coverage was Herb Alpert's \\"1980\\", from his 1979 album Rise. It was originally a cue meant for the ill-fated 1980 Moscow Summer Olympics broadcasts. Meanwhile, ESPN aired about 25 matches that year, all with broadcasters in studio. NBC's producers were forced to run the games' audio feed through telephone lines rather than through satellites. This was because the International Broadcast Center in Mexico City crossed up many communication lines. Consequently, various countries received commentary from others (or no sound or video at all). NBC in this case, received commentary from somewhere in Southeast Asia and so were forced to have Charlie Jones call collect and broadcast the Italy-Bulgaria opener via a handset telephone receiver. NBC lost the sound but still had video so Charlie Jones dialed collect again.

The deal, which began with the 2015 Women's World Cup and runs through 2026, includes rights to associated FIFA-sanctioned tournaments (including the Men's Under 20 and Under 17 World Cups, and the Men's Beach Soccer World Cup), which will be telecast on Telemundo and NBC Universo; the deal was extended on February 12, 2015, to include rights to the 2026 FIFA World Cup. On May 16, 2015, during Telemundo's 2015‚Äì16 upfront presentation in New York City, it was announced that Deportes Telemundo would be replaced by a new division initially known as NBC Deportes; the new division was formed as a branch of the English-language NBC Sports division, and be responsible for sports content for Telemundo, NBC Universo and related digital platforms. While it retained all existing sports telecast rights and programs aired by both Telemundo and NBC Universo, the latter network also began to expand its sports coverage, primarily in preparation for the 2016 Summer Olympics and the start of the division's contract with FIFA‚Äîwhose first events included the 2015 U-20 World Cup and Women's World Cup. ==See also== *List of FIFA World Cup broadcasters#United States *MLS on NBC *Premier League on NBC ==References== ==External links== *FIFA World Cup: Through the years *A brief history of the World Cup, European Championship and Copa America on US TV Category:NBC Sports Category:NBC original programming NBC NBC Category:1960s American television series Category:1966 American television series debuts Category:1966 American television series endings Category:1986 American television series debuts Category:1986 American television series endings ","title":"FIFA World Cup on NBC"},{"id":"63854148","text":"Southgate Athletic Football Club was a football club based in Palmers Green, England. ==History== Founded in May 1948 as Southgate Estate Athletic, entering the Wood Green & Southgate League.

The book concerns the 1991 mass rape by Indian security forces and is part of a series on \\"Sexual Violence and Impunity in South Asia\\" published by Zubaan Books and supported by the International Development Research Centre. The book was officially released at the Jaipur Literature Festival. Inspired by the public reaction to the Nirbhaya gang rape in December 2012, the five Kashmiri authors chronicle the night of 23/24 February 1991 in Kupwara district in the neighboring villages of Kunan and Poshpora, where the 68th Mountain Brigade of the 4th Rajputana Rifle killed several male members and allegedly raped a number of women. The Kunan Poshpora incident is the only time the Indian Army has been accused of \\"mass sexual violence\\". The authors themselves lobbied the government to reopen the investigation of the incident, which was done in 2013. == Description == The book is divided into seven chapters. The first chapter is about the overall role that women have played in the resistance movement in Kashmir. This is followed by each of the authors penning down what they personally remember of the incident. The next two chapters lay out the background of what was happening in Kashmir at the time. Here the authors analyze a police case diary, statements to the State Human Rights Commission and the interviews of the authors with those in the village. The book is the first extensive interaction with the alleged victims. The fourth chapter portrays the lives of the two villages today. The fifth chapter covers the official information on the case where the authors criticize the Verghese report by the Press Council of India team which had concluded that the incident was a hoax. The sixth chapter goes on to reconstruct the events of that night through first person interviews. The seventh and last chapter of the book narrates the struggle by the survivors and authors to get justice including a public interest litigation in 2013. February 23 is now known as ‚ÄòKashmiri Women‚Äôs Resistance Day‚Äô. == Critical reception == The book has been seen as the ability of Kashmiri women to tell their own story, lead the discourse, and show resistance. The new information, the interviews with the people of Kunan and Poshpora, as well as the case diary which the authors have brought into the public domain also add to the value of the book. The authors faced numerous hurdles in conducting a book launch. A seminar in Ambedkar University in which one of the authors was due to speak was cancelled for fear of violence. == See also == * 41 biranganas == References == == Bibliography == * Category:Rape in India Category:2016 non- fiction books Category:Books about the Kashmir conflict ","title":"Do You Remember Kunan Poshpora?"},{"id":"63854536","text":"View of Hallstatt Wilhelm Theodor Nocken (1830, D√ºsseldorf - 1905, D√ºsseldorf) was a German landscape painter of the D√ºsseldorfer Malerschule. == Life and work == At the age of ten, while working as a house painter, he attended Sunday classes in free-hand drawing for artisans, led by .

Sudip Sharma began writing Paatal Lok in the beginning of 2017. For Sharma it was his maiden attempt at writing in long-form. The writing team also consisted of Hardik Mehta, Gunjit Chopra, Sagar Haveli who were also beginners in writing a series. Sharma wrote the first and last three episodes, while the remaining five were written by the other writers. All the writers did field research visiting places in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh in 2017. The show has two directors, Prosit Roy and Avinash Arun Dhaware, both directing different portions of the series. The series has been shot in 110 cities in India. == Styles and themes == === Mythological Tropes === Socio- economic divisions in India are metaphorically compared with the mythological Indian concepts of Svarga, Dharti and Paatal (heaven, earth and the hell). Delhi is used as the story-telling playground where Lutyens Delhi is heaven, Vasant Vihar and Noida is the earth while Jamna Paar in East Delhi is hell. The climax of the story is also based on the mythological fable of Yudhisthira's dog from the Mahabharata. === Didactic themes === The show gives an insight into various forms of discrimination in India. Religion and caste are also visible in the show. Cheeni's story brings out the issues of child abuse and discrimination against transgenders. Hathoda Tyagi's background gives insight into the abysmal state of women safety in rural India. ==Reception== Paatal Lok opened to rave reviews, with many calling it India's best Hindi-language series. The day the series was released, Anurag Kashyap tweeted that Paatal Lok is \\"the best crime thriller to come out of this country,\\" adding that \\"It comes from the understanding of Real India. The dark heart of India, the communal and casteist India.\\" Filmstars Manoj Bajpayee and Alia Bhatt both took to Twitter to praise the show and the acting. Saibal Chatterjee gave the series 4 stars and wrote in his NDTV review, \\"Is Paatal Lok Amazon Prime's Sacred Games? No. It is more.\\" Jaideep Ahlawat, Neeraj Kabi and Swastika Mukherjee were praised for their performances. Namrata Joshi of The Hindu wrote that the performances are \\"powerful all around\\", adding that on display are \\"the pent up prejudices against Muslims, the dehumanisation of the lower castes and the rage and angst of the have-nots against the haves.\\" In a review in the Film Companion, Anupama Chopra praised Anushka Sharma for producing the series, writing \\"Paatal Lok is a tightly knit thriller [...] our perception of the characters shifts as the story unravels so that it becomes impossible to decide the good, bad and ugly.\\" ===Controversies=== The series garnered controversy over the use of the slur \\"Nepali randi\\" in the second episode.

The eggs are guarded and fanned by the male. ==Taxonomy== The Eastern striped grunter was first formally described as Terapon sexlineatus in 1825 by the French naturalists Jean Ren√© Constant Quoy and Joseph Paul Gaimard with the type locality given as Shark Bay, Western Australia. Georges Cuvier created the monotypic genus Helotes for this species in 1829 and most authorities retain this species as the only species in this genus. ==Fisheries== The Eastern striped grunter is of minor commercial importance to Fisheries, and is often taken as bycatch.

It is a Grade II listed building. ==History== In the 19th century the local board of health met at Bruce Castle. After the area became an urban district in 1895, civic leaders decided to procure purpose-built municipal offices: the site they selected for the new building had previously been occupied by four large residential properties: Eaton House, Wilton House, The Ferns and Hatfield House. They decided that the new municipal offices would be flanked by a fire station to the south and swimming baths to the north both to be built in the same architectural style and at the same time as the municipal offices. A school, to be built to the north of the swimming baths, was added to the scheme a few years later. The foundation stone for the new facility was laid on 6 October 1904. The building was designed by Arnold Taylor and Rutherford Jemmett in the Baroque style; it was officially opened by the Chairman of the Council, T H Camp, on 2 November 1905. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with seven bays facing onto Town Hall Approach Road; the central section of five bays featured a doorway with a stone surround flanked by Tuscan order pilasters on the ground floor; there were tall rounded-headed windows with Gibbs surround arches flanked with Ionic order columns in the centre and Ionic order pilasters beyond on the first floor; there was a cupola with a clock at roof level. The principal room was the council chamber on the first floor. The building became the headquarters of the Municipal Borough of Tottenham as \\"Tottenham Town Hall\\" when the area secured municipal borough status in 1934. In May 1962, after Tottenham Hotspur won the first FA Cup against Burnley, a victory reception was held at the town hall and Jimmy Greaves held the FA Cup trophy aloft from town hall balcony. The town hall ceased to be the local seat of government when the enlarged London Borough of Haringey was formed in 1965. In the late 1980s a memorial to Cynthia Jarrett, whose death in October 1985 was the catalyst for the Broadwater Farm riot, was erected outside the town hall. The building subsequently deteriorated and was placed on the Buildings at Risk Register. An extensive programme of refurbishment works of the building to the designs of BPTW was completed in December 2010. The works included restoration of the council chamber, which was remamed the Moselle Room after the River Moselle which flows through the area. The development also made land available behind the town hall for Newlon Housing Trust to create new affordable homes. The adjacent swimming baths and the fire station, which both formed part of the original composition, were redeveloped as an arts centre and as a restaurant in 2007 and 2015 respectively. ==References== Category:Grade II listed buildings in the London Borough of Haringey Category:City and town halls in London Category:Government buildings completed in 1905 Category:Grade II listed government buildings Category:1905 establishments in England ","title":"Tottenham Town Hall"},{"id":"63855260","text":"Serge Cornut (born 6 May 1948) is a French equestrian.

In 1914, she started working at the Central School of Art and Design, nowadays Central Saint Martins, where she taught Dress Design. Alongside her teaching job, she produced costumes for various theatres in London. Later on, in 1930, she became Head of the School of Costume at the Central School. Cochrane kept this position until 1957, when she suffered from a sudden death. == Teachings == Since her student years, Cochrane developed an interest for historical costume accuracy, which she studied in detail, something that she passed on to her students. She also believed that working on actual productions during the course would benefit the students. Such belief led to her persistence to build, attached to the school, a theatre with adjoining workshops, costume cutting rooms and design studios. In her research, she explored the theme of historical accuracy and she did a study on colour and cut, which she transformed into a book named Costume, Colour and Cut: A Sketch of the Evolution of Costume Design with Brief Notes and Patterns to Help Those Interested in Dressing the Play, published in 1955 by the National Federation of Women's Inst.Cochrane, Jeanetta. ‚ÄúCostume Colour and Cut‚Äù, Google Books == Legacy == After her death, the London County Council built the Cochrane Theatre, named after her.

With Odette Rosenstock, they saved 527 children from being taken by the Nazis and the Schutzstaffel (SS) forces. ==Early life and education== Moussa Abadi was born in Damascus, Syria in 1910. He attended the Jewish Alliance School in Damascus, where he learned to speak French and received a scholarship to study in France. He attended the Sorbonne, where he developed an interest in the theatre and was a member of the theatrical troupe Compagnie des Quatre Saisons. ==World War II== ===Background=== After Nazis invaded France, the Vichy government instituted laws that attacked the rights of Jewish people, which became increasingly intense by 1942. As the government captured children, the Jewish community looked for ways to protect the children. ===Resistance movement=== In 1939, Abadi met Odette Rosenstock, who served as a physician during the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939). She worked as a physician until Vichy laws did not allow her to be employed, then she worked as a midwife. In 1942, Abadie asked Rosenstock to join him in Nice. They joined the French Resistance movement there, where they were ignored by the Italian forces and not yet subject to German invasion. In Nice, they helped Jewish families take refuge. Odette took the undercover name Sylvie Delatre. In 1943, the Germans, along with a special Schutzstaffel (SS) force and SS Captain Alois Brunner, invaded southern France and began capturing Jews. To find Jewish people, the Germans were especially ruthless and they used bribery and torture to gain information. ===Protection of children=== Afraid for the fate of their children, Jewish parents brought their children to Abadi and Rosenstock for their protection. Paul R√©mond, the Bishop of Nice, provided them a room in his residence for safe keeping. Remond asked Catholic schools to harbor children. Hiding places were found for 527 children who were saved by their organization, (Marcel network). The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum states that \\"The R√©seau Marcel was one of the most successful Jewish rescue networks in Vichy France.\\" In 1944, Rosenstock was found out and sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau and then to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. She cared for the people who were too ill to be sent to the death chambers. ==Post-war== At the end of the war, Rosenstock was released and she returned to Paris. Abadi met up with her and they were married, with Rosenstock becoming Odette Abadi. She continued her work as a physician. Moussa and Odette were identified as the individuals who worked to save more than 500 children, but like other Jewish rescuers were not named with the Christian rescuers, like the Bishop of Nice whose helped them and was honored in 1992 by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. In 1995, driven by horrendous wars that resulted in the extermination of people, she wrote a book Terre de d√©tresse Birkenau-Bergen-Belsen about her experiences in the concentration camps during the Second World War.

During the Edo period, the temple was a seminary and was the head temple of a network of 280 temples throughout the Nanbu domains. In 1869, the kar≈ç of Morioka Domain, Narayama Sado, committed seppuku within the Hond≈ç of the temple at the time of the collapse of the ≈åuetsu Reppan D≈çmei during the Boshin War of the Meiji restoration. A notable feature of the temple is the Rakan-d≈ç, built in 1735 and rebuilt in 1858. Its central statue Rushana butsu is reported to be made by K≈çb≈ç-daishi.

The overall plan was to conquer Crete as part of Operation Merkur, with German Paratroopers landing in three main areas, Heraklion, Maleme and Retimo. The operation relied on German airborne troops, both paratroopers and in gliders. Due to a mistake, and despite being in a superior position, New Zealand troops abandoned a strategic hill, leaving it to the Germans, and then lost the airport. The airport was then used by the Germans to transport in more troops which saw the whole island lost to the Germans. Memorial to members of 30 and 33 RAF Squadrons killed in the Battle of Crete == Preparation by Allies == Ultra intelligence provided the Allied forces with information on key dates, and also that the Germans planned to invade by both sea and air. General Freybourg, the New Zealand Army officer who commanded Allied forces on Crete, or Creforce, distributed his troops to deal with these multiple threats. While the defenders at Heraklion and Retimo were well placed to resist seaborne landings, it left the airstrips exposed.James Holland, 2015.

Salem Press Encyclopedia. 2019 p=? == Initial Phase == The initial phase of the operation began on May 1941. The Germans used gliders at Maleme, with the intention of landing the troops in the gliders to initially gain control of the ground, and then the bulk of the troops and heavier equipment would be brought in using the Junkers 52 transport planes landing at Maleme airport. Gliders were launched from their towing transport plance offshore, with the Germans intent on keeping the transport planes away from the anti aircraft positions on the Island. in order to protect them from the anti aircraft positions. Maleme was particularly dangerous to planes, as the Maleme airport was heavily defended by anti aircraft guns.\\"maleme-bridge- crete-german-glider-airborne-forces\\" http://www.operation-ladbroke.com/maleme- bridge-crete-german-glider-airborne-forces/ At around 8 am of the morning of 20 May, gliders appeared in the sky over Maleme. This was followed up by German transport planes that began emptying paratroopers and supply canisters. This was West Group under the code-name ‚ÄúComet‚Äù, commanded by German paratroop general Eugen Meindl. The allied forces in the area were the 21st, 22nd and the 23rd battalions of the New Zealand Army, based at the Maleme airport and surrounding areas.Thimianos, Giannis \\"The first day of the Battle of Crete\\" Fabulous Crete.com The defending New Zealanders started firing at them, and there were heavy losses for the Germans, with many paratroopers killed before they hit the ground. Cretan civilians started attacking the landing troops with improvised peasant weapons, including shotguns, axes and spades. About 50 gliders landed in the dry riverbed, where resistance was less, however paratroopers landed to the South and East of Maleme and were largely destroyed by New Zealand forces that were in positions there \\"The Battle for Crete - Day 1 - The Battle of Maleme\\" https://nzhistory.govt.nz/war/the-battle-for- crete/the-battle-day-1-3 In the initial landing, the Germans casualties were immense, one regiment lost 112 out of 126 men, and III battalion lost 400 out of 600 men on the first day.Thimianos, Giannis \\"The First Day of the Battle of Crete\\" Fabulous Crete.com The initial landing of the gliders was successful, with them landing in the Tavronitis River.\\"maleme-bridge-crete-german-glider- airborne-forces\\" http://www.operation-ladbroke.com/maleme-bridge-crete-german- glider-airborne-forces/ The German soldiers dug in, but were doggedly resisted by New Zealand Troops, who were in possession of the strategic Hill 107.\\"maleme-bridge-crete-german-glider-airborne-forces\\" http://www.operation- ladbroke.com/maleme-bridge-crete-german-glider-airborne-forces/ The main New Zealand unit at Maleme was the 22nd Battalion, under command of Lieutenant Colonel Leslie Andrew. His unit maintained Hill 109 and the western edges of the airport. The battalion persisted engaging the Germans, and Andrew requested support from the 23rd battalion. The support was refused, under the mistaken believe that the 23rd Battalion was engaged in combat when in fact, it wasn't. Andrew decided to try to drive the Germans back from the edge of the airfield, but the two tanks he used in the assault broke down, and the assault faltered.\\"The Battle for Crete - Day 1 - The Battle of Maleme\\" https://nzhistory.govt.nz/war/the-battle-for-crete/the-battle-day-1-3 == New Zealand withdrawal from the Hill Position == Damaged and destroyed Junkers Ju 52s at Maleme Airfield However, though the New Zealand units were convinced they were winning, and the Germans thought they were lost, Andrew decided to retreat from Hill 107, and join up his forces with the 21st Battallion.

Andrew had asked for support, but the nearby units were not allowed to move up to support him, in the incorrect belief they were engaged. They were in fact not deployed, unengaged and waiting for orders, and were actually free to assist. The Germans on the other hand, were in a bad position strategically, and in addition, were only armed with small arms and grenades, as no heavy equipment had come in on the gliders. The Germans themselves were expecting to be overrun by the New Zealand troops the next day. Bell, Rachael \\"Evidence and Interpretation in New Zealand‚Äôs Official History: The Battle for Crete, May 1941\\" War in History2015, Vol. 22(3) p366 When the Germans saw the New Zealanders move off the strategic position of the hill, they moved to occupy it.

The New Zealanders did not immediately counterattack the hill. This was a decisive event. The Luftwaffe also played a part, attacking ground forces around the hill, with Stuka attacks on the allied troops.\\"maleme- bridge-crete-german-glider-airborne-forces\\" http://www.operation- ladbroke.com/maleme-bridge-crete-german-glider-airborne-forces/ At this point, the Germans started landing transport planes on the airfield. Luftwaffe Junkers Ju 52 transport planes could then land, and by 5pm the entire town of Maleme was then captured. By this time, the entire 100th Mountain Regiment, under the command of Colonel Wuillbald Utz, had landed. However, in landing the planes on the airstrip enduring hostile fire, the cost to the Germans was huge; one in three transport planes were destroyed, a total of 8 planes. The landing strip was strewn with destroyed planes.Mitcham, Samuel \\"Eagles of the Third Reich: Men of the Luftwaffe in World War II\\" Stackpole books 2007 p 122 == Allied Counter attack == Though the New Zealand troops attacked the planes as they landed, enough troops came off the remaining planes to enable the Germans to reinforce the troops that had landed previously. On the night of the 21st, the allied forces realised the importance of the airfield, and they started to organise a counter attack. two battalions moved to attack it, in an attempt to get it back under control. However, by this time, the 100th Mountain regiment had landed fully deployed, and were dug in; the attempts to take it failed.Maleme http://www.hellenicfoundation.com/Maleme.htm Another abortive attempt was made to regain the airstrip on the 22nd of May. It reached the edge of the airfield by 7.30 in the morning of that day, but could proceed no further, and was forced to withdraw.

He was castellan of Gyulafeh√©rv√°r (present- day Alba Iulia, Romania). ==Family== John (II) was born into the Barlab√°ssy (also Barlab√°si or Barab√°si) noble family, which possessed landholdings in northeastern Hungary (especially Bereg County). His parents were John (I) and his second wife, Veronica Harangl√°bi (widow of Emeric Gy√∂rgyfalvi). He had an elder brother, Michael I. Their mother came from a wealthy Transylvanian noble family. As a dowry, John, Sr. acquired portions in Kolozs and K√ºk√ºll≈ë counties ‚Äì including M√≥cs (Mociu) ‚Äì, and the Barlab√°ssy family gradually became part of the Transylvanian elite in the second half of the 15th century. It is possible that John, Jr. married an unidentified noblewoman from the wealthy Erd√©lyi de Somker√©k family. Their marriage produced three children: the eldest one John III was referred to as \\"homo regius\\" (the king's vassal) during the reign of Vladislaus II of Hungary. Leonard I was an influential vice-voivode and patron of arts in Transylvania at the turn of the 15th and 16th centuries. His youngest natural son was Michael II, vice-chamberlain of the salt chamber of Sz√©k (Sic) in 1512. John also adopted an orphan, John L√°szai, who entered ecclesiastical career and later erected a Renaissance-style chapel in the St. Michael's Cathedral of Gyulafeh√©rv√°r. ==Career and possessions== Michael and John acquired Csesztve (today part of Ocna Mure»ô town in Romania) and the surrounding lands by the 1450s. They built a country-house there, which became the permanent residence of the Barlab√°ssys. The brothers and their descendants used the prefix \\"de Chezthwe\\" (and various other write forms) thereafter. The Csesztve lordship laid along an important trade route near the river Maros (Mure»ô) and the salt mines of Maros√∫jv√°r (Ocna Mure»ô). In the subsequent years, they also bought Csombord (Ciumbrud), V√°radja (Oarda), Lomfalva and Marosszentkir√°ly (S√¢ncraiu de Mure»ô). John Barlab√°ssy acted as representative and lawyer of John Ger√©b in a lawsuit over the property of B√°lv√°nyos Castle (today ruins near Ungura»ô) on 22 May 1461. Consequently, he was familiaris of the influential Ger√©b family by that time. Barlab√°ssy did not join the Transylvanian rebellion against King Matthias Corvinus in 1467, unlike his many relatives (for instance, his aunt Julia Barlab√°ssy). For his loyalty, the monarch appointed him castellan of Gyulafeh√©rv√°r, an important stronghold in the province, which increased his political influence in the surrounding region. In the 1470s, Barlab√°ssy entered the service of Stephen B√°thory, a respected military general and Voivode of Transylvania. He participated in various campaigns and counter-attacks in response to the Ottoman incursions, which constantly harassed and threatened the province of Transylvania. Barlab√°ssy also fought in the Battle of Breadfield on 13 October 1479, belonging to the banderium of Stephen B√°thory. In the 1480s and 1490s, Barlab√°ssy was frequently styled as \\"homo regius\\" (i.e. king's vassal), when acted as pristaldus (royal commissioner or \\"bailiff\\") in several possession matters on behalf of king Matthias Corvinus, then Vladislaus II. As castellan of Gyulafeh√©rv√°r, Barlab√°ssy was a dedicated patron of arts and sciences. He and his son, Leonard financially supported a Humanist scholar circle, based in Gyulafeh√©rv√°r, which helped to spread Renaissance arts, science and architecture throughout Transylvania. He also supported the Roman Catholic Church; he bequeathed his landholdings at V√°radja and Lomfalva and his mill and its customs accessories at Sebes to the cathedral chapter of Transylvania in 1501. Barlab√°ssy made his last will and testament in 1508. He died in the next year at a relatively old age by the standard of his time, when some of his grandchildren already reached adulthood. As a result, some contemporary records in the late stages of his life referred to him as \\"John Barlab√°ssy the Old\\" () to distinguish him from his namesake son and grandson. ==References== ==Sources== * Category:1430s births Category:1509 deaths Category:15th-century Hungarian people Category:16th-century Hungarian people John 02 ","title":"John Barlab√°ssy (castellan)"},{"id":"63856359","text":"Fabio Magni (born 12 March 1967) is an Italian equestrian.

Cumberland (1894‚ÄìJune 12, 1938) was a Presbyterian missionary who was killed while living in Dohuk in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq. Cumberland was born in 1894 in Ventura, California. He served as a field artillery officer for a year between his junior and senior year of college, and enlisted to serve in the First World War in 1917, but the war ended before he was deployed. He graduated in 1919 from Occidental College in Los Angeles and then 1922 from McCormick Theological Seminary. He arrived in Iraq in April 1923 to work as a missionary. His work began with the East Persia Mission, from where he went to Mosul, and afterwards to Dohuk. His New York Times obituary noted that he \\"made long trips to the villages of tribesmen, lived with the people and established Christian centers among them.\\" The United Mission in Mesopotamia was founded in 1924 by the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A., the Reformed Church in America, and the Reformed Church in the United States. The mission had two schools: Baghdad High School Mansour, a girls' school in West Baghdad; and the School of High Hope, a boys' school in Basra. In the 1960s, the United Mission established a relief fund in Cumberland's name. His wife Harriet Gilbert Gunn, who he married in 1927, was the daughter of missionaries to the Philippines. They had two daughters. Cumberland considered himself a man of the American West. He is reported to have said, \\"The blood of the pioneer is in me. I love the frontier.\\" Cumberland left behind numerous letters describing his life in Iraq, which describe meetings with figures including \\"the Patriarch of the Nestorian Church, the American Consul Thomas Owens, and an official with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company\\". His early time in Iraq coincided with the Barzanji Revolt of 1922‚Äì24, whose upheavals he reported in his letters. His summary observations about the Kurds were published in a missionary journal in 1926. By 1926, Cumberland had bought a thousand acres of land, including the Assyrian village of Babillu, ten miles east of Duhok. The village reportedly cost $500. By 1936 a military coup had taken place and was followed with the overthrow of that military officer by Nuri al-Said in 1937. Religious liberties began to decline and Cumberland received threats. On June 12, 1938, Cumberland was visited by two men who he talked to for an hour. One was the son of the agha of the village of Besifki, an hour's drive away. When Cumberland went to get a Bible at their request, they shot and killed Cumberland and a servant. According to Dana and Dunn, \\"The murder was attributed to religious fanaticism, but the specific motives of the killers were more ambiguous.\\" There is some controversy over the rightful ownership of lands which Cumberland gave to Assyrian Christians in the area. It is possible to visit the house in Duhok where Cumberland lived. ==References== Category:American Presbyterian missionaries Category:1894 births Category:1938 deaths Category:Presbyterian missionaries in the Ottoman Empire ","title":"Roger Cumberland"},{"id":"63856408","text":"Ilian Iliev (born 2 August 1966) is a Bulgarian equestrian.

All three members were born in Puerto Rico. Domenech studied the cuatro from the age of six. At 11 he entered a five-year program at the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture studying the cuatro and music theory. He has been nominated twice for a Latin Grammy. Rivera was a semifinalist on Latin American Idol (season 2). The newest member of Sonido Tr√© is Edgar R√≠os. R√≠os was a member of the a cappella group Nota, winners of the NBC show The Sing-Off. ==History== ===Background=== Sonido Tr√© (originally called Tr√©) evolved over time, as each had occasion to work with the others on various projects. They began to work together more regularly after the death of Tony Croatto, who Domenech had recorded with regularly. Their group consisted of Rivera in vocals, Rios as a backing voice, and Domenech on Cuatro. As demand came for their sound, the trio formed, and took the name Tr√© (three in Puerto Rican Spanish). Domenech and Rivera, his wife, moved with their children to Central Florida in 2015. Domenech felt the move was necessary for the betterment of his family, and the increased opportunities to share his music. R√≠os remains in Puerto Rico, with each traveling as necessary for live performances. ==Career== === Prior to 2019 === Prior to joining Sonido Tr√©, Rivera was a semifinalist in Latin American Idol 2007. R√≠os, with the group Nota won the NBC a cappella show 'The Sing-Off‚Äô in 2009. The trio recorded their album ‚ÄòTr√©‚Äô in 2014, and 'Tr√© en Vivo' in 2015. Sonido Tr√© joined Puerto Rican tenor Fernando Varela in singing a medley of ‚ÄúEn Mi Viejo San Juan / Preciosa‚Äù for the taping of Varela's PBS Special ‚ÄúComing Home‚Äô. They performed in two concerts with the Colombian singer Carlos Vives, the first in Miami in 2016, and then in Orlando in 2017. They toured Puerto Rico in early to mid 2017, with their ‚ÄòBlessing‚Äô tour, a presentation designed to be inspirational and identifiable for their Puerto Rican audience. They returned to Puerto Rico again in late 2018 for their concert ‚ÄòLegacy‚Äô, performing together with the a cappella group Nota. In November 2017, the group joined Fernando Varela in his Fernando and Friends for Puerto Rico. The concert was held in the Sharon L. Morse Performing Arts Center at The Villages, Florida, with 100% of the proceeds being given to PRxPR to aid in the recovery efforts and rebuilding of Puerto Rico. Varela was able to give 100% of ticket sales directly to aid Puerto Rico, with every typical cost associated with presenting the concert having been donated. Fully 100% of the labor, talent and equipment for the concert was given in donation, so that all of the proceeds would go directly to help Puerto Rico. === 2019 to Present === In February 2019, while in the process of working on their latest EP, Sonido Tr√© had the opportunity to open a concert for David Foster at the Sharon Morse Performing Arts Center, The Villages Early 2020, Sonido Tr√© released their EP \\"Tributo a Juan Luis Guerra‚Äù in tribute to Juan Luis Guerra, a Dominican Musician with over 70 million records sold, and 21 Latin Grammys. The EP consisted of four songs by Guerra, but performed in a style consistent with that of Sonido Tr√©. Including ‚ÄúOjal√° que llueva caf√©; ‚ÄúEstrellitas y duendes‚Äù; ‚ÄúNo aparecen‚Äù; y ‚ÄúLa Bilirrubina‚Äù, the recordings by Sonido Tr√© honor the originals, but are arranged and performed with their own flair. In March, Sonido Tr√© joined Tenor Fernando Varela for his ‚ÄúFour Divo‚Äù concert to raise funds for the earthquake victims in Southwestern Puerto Rico, an area already recently affected by hurricane Maria. The trio joined Varela in a medley of ‚ÄúPreciosa‚Äù and ‚ÄúEn Mi Viejo San Juan‚Äù. A portion of the proceeds from the concert went to PRxPR, a Puerto Rican organization which invests 100% of their donations directly to the communities they support. During the Coronavirus lockdown Sonido Tr√© continued to work on their new music, releasing in April 2020 their music video and single \\"Let it Be\\". The song was recorded by musicians all over the world from their homes. The accompanying music video also includes dancers and families from all over the world, as well as pictures of front line workers aiding in the Coronavirus response. ==Discography== ===Singles=== * Amor Vivido (Feb 3, 2015) * Mi Barrio (Nov 24, 2016) * Amar o Morir (Apr 4, 2016) * Puerto Rico feat Lo5 (Aug 2, 2016) * Monticielo (Jan 9, 2018) * Ojal√° Que Llueva Caf√© (May 17, 2019) ===Albums=== * Sinf√≥nico (April 9, 2013) * Tr√© Rereleased as Sonido Tr√© (Feb 10 2014) * Tr√© en Vivo EP (March 25, 2015) * Tributo a Juan Louis Guerra EP (Feb 14, 2020) * Blessings Mayda Bel√©n EP (April, 2020) ==See also== * Quique Domenech * Nota * Fernando Varela == References == ==External links== *Fernando Varela/Sonido Tr√© - En Mi Viejo S√†n Juan / Preciousa Medley * *Let it Be Category:American musical trios Category:American vocal groups Category:Vocal trios ","title":"Sonido Tr√©"},{"id":"63856506","text":"Ferdinando Nelli Feroci (born 18 December 1946, in Pisa) is an Italian diplomat who served briefly as a European Commissioner in 2014.

He is most famous for serving as tribune of the plebs in 67 BC. == Career == Cornelius was elected quaestor for 70 BC, and served under the consul Gnaeus Pompeius. Alongside Pompey's ally Aulus Gabinius, Cornelius was later elected tribune for the year 67 BC. At the start of his tribunate, he brought several controversial laws before the Roman People (populus Romanus). According to Asconius Pedianus, Cornelius had tried to persuade the Senate to ban senators from lending money to foreign envoys at high rates of interest. When the Senate refused, Cornelius proposed a bill re-instating the ancient principle that no one (including a senator) was exempt from the laws unless the populus had granted them special dispensation. The Senate convinced a tribune, Publius Servilius Globulus, to veto this law. However, Cornelius ignored Servilius' veto and continued with proceedings, prompting the consul Gaius Piso to intervene. But when Cornelius' supporters attacked Piso and smashed his fasces, Cornelius panicked and withdrew the bill, replacing it with a more lenient version.Asc. 58‚Äì9 C Cassius Dio tells a different version of events. According to Dio, Cornelius brought forward a law to increase the punishments for electoral bribery. After the Senate opposed this, Cornelius proposed another law ruling that no senator could usurp the rights or decisions of the populus Romanus. The consul Piso tried to intervene, but his fasces were smashed, prompting Cornelius to withdraw the bill and replace it with a version allowing the Senate to take a preliminary vote on these matters.Cass. Dio, 36.39‚Äì40 According to both Asconius and Dio, Cornelius also passed another law concerning praetorian edicts. At the start of each year, it was customary for praetors to issue a standing edict outlining how they intended to dispense justice during that year. However, since many praetors were ignoring their own edicts and deciding cases inconsistently, Cornelius passed a law forcing them to obey the terms of their initial edicts. == Prosecutions == Because he had ignored a tribune's veto and incited violence against a consul, Cornelius was prosecuted twice in the following years. In 66 BC, two brothers, Publius and Gaius Cominius, indicted him under the lex Cornelia de maiestate. However, on the day of the trial, the presiding praetor failed to arrive, leaving Cornelius' supporters free to intimidate and threaten the Cominii brothers. On the next day, the praetor appeared but the Cominii stayed away out of fear, with the result that the praetor declared the trial null and void.Asc. 59‚Äì60 C In the next year, 65 BC, Cornelius was again accused de maiestate. This time, the prosecution was supported by the testimony of some of the most powerful men in the state, including ex-consuls such as Hortensius, Catulus, and Metellus Pius. However, Cornelius was defended by the famous orator Cicero, and was successfully acquitted. Although Cicero's speech (pro Cornelio) does not survive, significant portions are preserved by Asconius, who wrote a detailed commentary on the speech.Asc. 57‚Äì81 C ==References== * A. C. Clark, Q.

Alter Neckar) is a nature conservation area designated by decree of the Regional Council Stuttgart on the territory of the municipality Altbach and the town Esslingen in the district of Esslingen in Baden- W√ºrttemberg. A 16.0 hectare area had already been placed under protection by decree of December 2, 1985. The 21.3-hectare (ha) area is located at 245 m above sea level in the densely populated Middle Neckar Valley, directly south of built-up areas and industrial areas (Altbach/Deizisau combined heat and power plant Altbach) and is part of the natural areas of the Stuttgart Bight and the Filder. The area includes an oxbow lake of the Neckar, the woods along the banks, adjacent meadows and fields, unused former fillings and rubble areas as well as parts of the banks of the Neckar Canal. The Neckar's oxbow lake is a rare relic of earlier river history. It is also a breeding and habitat as well as a refuge for many endangered plant and animal species. The oxbow was created when the Neckar loop was punctured in 1933/34 during the course of the river's expansion and the Neckar Canal was dredged. With the excavation only a part of the former river course was filled up. == Flora and Fauna == The fish richness of the oxbow lake with mud-pepper, chub, rudd, carp and another 15 species is attractive for grey heron, kingfisher and bittern. The reed beds on the banks are populated by woodlice, spiders and digger wasp, among others, and pike find their spawning grounds there. In the shady shore areas orioles and nightingales breed. In the narrow belt of hardwood and softwood floodplains there are still some relicts of the original floodplain forest. Deadwood is left on site and is used in many ways by insects. In the area 13 species of dragonflies have been recorded. Grass snakes, red-cheeked turtles, muskrats and hares have been sighted several times.http://www2.lubw.baden- wuerttemberg.de/public/abt2/dokablage/oac_12/wuerdigung/1/1141.htm == See also == * List of nature reserves in the district of Esslingen * List of protected landscape areas in the district of Esslingen == References == == External links == * Category:Esslingen (district) Category:Nature reserves in Baden- W√ºrttemberg Category:1985 establishments in Germany ","title":"Old Neckar"},{"id":"63857117","text":"Percy Furler (20 February 1904 ‚Äì 23 January 1991) was an Australian rules footballer who played for and coached North Adelaide in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL).

The town hall, which is the headquarters of Haringey London Borough Council, is a Grade II listed building. ==History== The building was commissioned by the Municipal Borough of Wood Green to replace the ageing Wood Green Town Hall in High Road. After the old town hall had become inadequate for the council's needs, civic leaders decided to build a new town hall: the site selected for the new building, which was further south on High Road, had previously been occupied by some 19th residential properties known as the Fishmongers' and Poulterers' Almshouses. Construction work on the building, which was undertaken by Gee, Walker & Slater, started in 1956. The new building was designed by Sir John Brown, A E Henson and Partners and was officially opened by the local member of parliament, Joyce Butler, as Wood Green Civic Centre on 15 March 1958. The design, which was influenced by Aarhus City Hall and S√∏ller√∏d Town Hall, both in Denmark, envisaged a public area in the southern part of the building and workspace for council officers and their departments in the northern part of the building. It involved an asymmetrical main frontage facing onto High Road; the southern section featured a large projecting glass frontage with a doorway on the ground floor while the northern section of the frontage comprised nine bays with windows on each of the ground, first and second floors. Internally, the principal rooms were the council chamber behind the glass frontage on the first floor and the mayor's parlour in the west wing of the building. The council chamber was designed with an unusual suspended ceiling which sloped down to the back of dais on which the mayor sat. An underground nuclear fall-out shelter was established in the basement but a public hall, which had been intended for the site, was never built. The building continued to be the local seat of government, as Haringey Civic Centre, when the enlarged London Borough of Haringey was formed in 1965. A Citizens Advice Bureau was established in the building in 1975; although now known as Citizens Advice Haringey, it continues to operates from the centre. Many of the council officers and their departments moved to River Park House further south on High Road in 2005. In 2017 the civic centre, much of which is now unused, was the subject of a consultation on regeneration options including possible replacement, but after English Heritage listed the building in July 2018, the regeneration options became more restricted.

It has been in continuous use from 1831 to the present. It is of a type of sword described as a mameluke sabre. ==Background== British Pattern 1831 sabre and scabbard. This particular sword is mid-Victorian and was retailed by J.B. Johnstone of London and Dublin, who were tailors and military outfitters. The blade retains almost all of its original mirror-polished finish Both French and British army officers encountered kilij and shamshir sabres as a result of Napoleon's expedition to Egypt (1798‚Äì1801). Termed 'mameluke sabres' after the Mamluk warrior caste of Egypt, they became a fashionable accessory for officers, particularly senior officers. Similar swords were also found in India, and these probably influenced British officers also. Mameluke swords, both Middle Eastern and copies made in Europe, were adopted, unofficially, by officers of light cavalry regiments in the first decade of the 19th century, some were used as 'walking out swords' (for ornamental wear on social occasions on foot) but others were employed on active campaign. They are prominent in images of officers of the British Hussar regiments painted by Robert Dighton jr. in 1807.Mollo, plate 13 As officially regulated dress or lev√©e swords they first appear in 1822 for lancer regiments. Soon, other light cavalry and some heavy cavalry regiments also adopted similar patterns.Robson, p.69 In 1822 generals and staff officers adopted a variant of the 1822 infantry officer's sword (often referred to as the 'Gothic hilt sabre'). It differed only in minor decorative elements of the guard and in the decoration of the blade.Robson, p.143 The decision to introduce a mameluke sword as the official regulation sword for officers of the rank of major-general and above is generally ascribed to the Duke of Wellington who is known to have favoured this type of sword himself.Robson, p.145 == Design == Hilt of the Pattern 1831 sabre. This sword has grip scales of mammoth ivory. Detail of frost-etched decoration of the blade, showing a crown over the 'VR' monogram of Queen Victoria. The 1831 pattern general officer's sabre was directly influenced by existing mameluke swords worn by officers of various cavalry regiments. It differs from the lev√©e sword of the 3rd Light Dragoons only in very minor elements of decoration.Robson, p.71 The hilt and blade retain many features of the Turkish kilij from which it was derived. These include the simple cross- guard with two opposing langets and the down curving 'pistol-grip' shaped pommel; the blade retains the yelman false-edge and the step to the back of the blade (latchet) close to it. As a dress sword, it is of relatively lightweight construction. The weight of the sword is about 1 lb 10.5oz (751g) and the scabbard about 1 lb 1oz (482g).Stephens, p.140 The 31 inch-long (79 cm) blade is slab-sided and of a 'V' shaped cross-section, it is double-edged for its last 12 inches (the yelman) and comes to a relatively acute asymmetric point. The flat sides of the blade afford a large area for decoration. This decoration, of acid-etching (often described as 'frost-etched'), varies greatly between makers but usually includes: a crossed baton and sabre, the monarch's monogram under a crown, and sprigs of oak or palm (or both). Acanthus leaf and scrolling plant motifs may also be present. Many blades were produced with a reserved section where the purchaser could have his initials or family crest added.Robson, pp.144-145Busch, P. The hilt has a cross-guard with its √©cusson decorated with an oak leaf and acorn civic crown containing a crossed baton and sabre. The hilt elements (guard, grip scales and strap) are held together and attached to the blade tang by two bolts hidden by brass rosettes. The prominent sword-knot hole has bushing in two parts which also screw together, adding to the solidity of the hilt. All the metallic hilt elements are of gilt-brass.Stephens, p.140 The grip scales were originally of ivory, either elephant or mammoth, but in late Victorian times synthetic ivory-substitutes (such as 'ivorine') began to be used. Recent and modern swords were/are only produced using synthetic ivory.Robson, p.145Busch, P. The 1831 sabre was initially produced with two scabbards, a black leather scabbard with elaborate gilt mounts intended for l√©vees and evening functions and a brass scabbard for all other occasions. In practise the leather scabbard was soon dispensed with and the brass scabbard used universally. The brass scabbard has wood liners, two cross-shaped mounts for loose suspension rings and a square toe with a vestigial shoe/drag. In 1898 the brass scabbard was replaced by a steel scabbard of the same form.Robson, p.145 The pattern was also adopted for field marshals, royal equerries and lords lieutenant of counties, with only minor differences in decoration. The cross-guard √©cusson decoration of crossed baton and sabre is replaced by two crossed batons for field marshals, royal equerries employ the monarch's cypher and lords lieutenant use national symbols appropriate to their county (rose for England, thistle for Scotland, shamrock for Northern Ireland and 'Prince of Wales' feathers' for Wales).Robson, p.145 ==Use== Despite the blades of the 1831 sabre having to pass an official proving test (many specimens have brass 'proof slugs' inset into the blade near the hilt) the sword was never intended for combat use. The description of the proof test includes the phrase, \\"The blade recovers straightness after being subjected to a weight of 10 lbs vertically with 1 inch depression\\".Stephens, p.140 The blades are of too light a weight for effective cutting and are too flexible for thrusting. Throughout the 19th century, when on active campaign, generals employed the service swords particular to the corps they were a member of before their promotion. This was officially recognised in the Dress Regulations of 1900. The sabre was and is intended for dress wear, at lev√©es, parades, inspections and other formal occasions when full-dress would be worn.Robson, p.145 ==See also== * Kilij ==Notes== ==References== *Busch, P.

After the death of Seyd Abbas, the khanate was headed by his son Gara Khan. Gara Khan strengthened the borders and created a standing army. To strengthen the central government, he added the lands of unsatisfied feudal lords to the lands of the khans. To protect the khanate from attacks, he moved the capital to Lankaran. During this period, Lankaran became an important port city on the shores of the Caspian Sea. Khan built the city walls, a khan's palace, a mosque, a bathhouse, a market and a caravanserai. There were two markets in the city: upper (central) and lower. During the reign of Gara Khan, relations between Kerim Khan Zend deteriorated. Ally Kerim Khan Khan Gilana Hidayat Khan attacked the Talysh Khanate in 1768 and defeated the troops of Gara Khan. Gara Khan was forced to pay taxes to Hidayat Khan. Gara Khan sent his brother Karbalai Sultan to the shed of Khan of Quba Fatali Khan to get help against Gilan. In 1785, the Talysh Khanate joined the lands of Fath Ali Khan. 1786 Gara Khan died. After his death, the son of Mir Mustafa Khan entered the throne. ==References== Category:1786 deaths Category:Talysh Khanate Category:Talysh people Category:History of Talysh Category:Governors of Talysh ","title":"Gara Khan"},{"id":"63857462","text":"Md.

He is widely considered to be \\"a major player in the development of Classicism,\\" and \\"one of the most important artists of the Neoclassical Figurative revival movement.\\" == Biography == Civitico is known for painting in \\"styles ranging from perceptual realism, through classicism, to a highly individual Neo-Baroque Mannerism.\\" Working in the narrative tradition, his subject matter spanned \\"classic themes of the figure, still life, and landscape.\\" His \\"gently cubist-inflected\\" paintings relied on multiple perspectives to develop dialogues between the past and the present, with each illuminating the other in both simple still lifes and imaginative classical allegories.\\" In 2000, prior to the opening of a retrospective called Bruno Civitico: Portraits and Figures, Civitico described his work this way: > This group of drawings, studies, and paintings of female portraits and > figures, span nearly forty years and present an almost continuous view of a > segment of my work. There have been many other subjects ... male portraits > and figures, multi-genre compositions in the landscape and in the interior, > landscapes and still lifes, some with allegorical, mythological or narrative > themes. Overall, my work has been evenly divided between these different > subjects, themes, and modes, and it has, not inappropriately, been > identified with the realist, classicist and post-modernist tendencies in the > art of this time. I say 'not appropriately' because some of these > characteristic aspects of the art do in fact intertwine. Civitico is sometimes described as a South Carolina artist because he spent the second half of his life there. But he was the only child of Italian- speaking parents, and born in Italy. He also strongly identified with Italian art, a preference New York Times critic James R. Mellow recognized when he wrote, in 1973, that Civitico's work \\"hark[ed] back to Poussin and the Italian Renaissance masters in his landscape and allegorical paintings.\\" A former student of the painter Gabriel Laderman, Civitico shared his fascination with figuration and myth, both rare interests in an era dominated by minimalism and other forms of post-modern abstraction. \\"It is possible to find an equally strong Italian element in [the Italian-born American artist Floriano Vecchi's] works, whether still-life or figural,\\" The New York Sun's James Gardner observed in 2008. \\"He conceives them as someone who had grown up in the vicinity of the full-bodied classicism of the Renaissance and of Annibale Carracci's Bolognese Academy. There is an implicit comfort in, and respect for, these ancient traditions, such as you see in the art of Giorgio de Chirico and, more recently, in Bruno Civitico and Claudio Bravo.\\" But critic Frederick Turner had already analyzed Civitico's relationship to the past more than a decade earlier.\\"Classical realist painters such as David Ligare and Bruno Civitico illuminate a contemporary consciousness with ancient light,\\" he wrote. In 1982, Civitico described his interest\\"in the reinterpretation of mythological themes and the use of abstraction and simplification,\\" as key elements in his work. The noted critic Charles Jencks later described Civitico as a modern classicist, in search of an allegory both fabulous and real. Civitico's aesthetics echo that description. David Carbone has called his figures \\"postpainterly,\\" describing their \\"extreme sculptural tactility,\\" which he theorizes, \\"hold the key to the expressiveness of his work,\\" and which evolved from an early sympathy for \\"the closely observed perceptual representation of Philip Pearlstein, building form through large shapes in pale-toned values. This way of modeling is distinctly modernist: opaque paint strokes in both the lights and shadows, painted in sharp focus on a large scale in a pared-down environment. This initially placed his work alongside other similarly 'cool' figurative painters such as William Bailey, Gabriel Laderman, and Alfred Leslie.\\" Carbone's reference to \\"tactile\\" expressiveness is echoed by New York Times critic Hilton Kramer. \\"In Group of Bathers in Landscape,\\" he writes \\"the nude figures occupy a truly lyrical space,\\" which he then contrasted to other \\"big, finished nudes\\" in the show, he considered \\"strained and artificial.\\" The Schoelkopf Gallery's \\"interest in figurative painting that incorporated elements of allegory, myth, fantasy, and dreams,\\" The Smithsonian Archives explains in its finding aide\\"is evinced in files relating to artists such as Milet Andrejevic ... Gabriel Laderman,\\" and likely accounts for Civitico's decade-long relationship with them, beginning with his first solo exhibition in the early 1970s. He went on to spend much of the next decade exhibiting at San Francisco's Contemporary Realist Gallery, beginning in 1985. In 1990, Civitico curated the exhibition Landscape Painting 1960-1990, The Italian Tradition in American Art at the prestigious Spoleto Festival USA at Charleston's Gibbes Museum of Art under Director Paul Figeroa. A decade later, he was awarded his largest commission for a nine-foot by nine- foot tryptic mural, representing dance, music and theater for the Brooks Center for the Performing Arts, at the Clemson University College of Architecture, Arts and Humanities in Georgia. == Personal life == Civitico was born in 1942 in the municipality of Dignano D'Istria in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region of northwestern Italy. His family emigrated to the United States when he was nine, moving first to Minnesota and then to Paterson, New Jersey. == Academic affiliations == Civitico earned a BFA in Fine Arts at Pratt Institute in 1966. In 1968, he was graduated from Indiana University with an MFA. After graduation, he returned to the Greater New York area to teach first at Princeton, then Temple University where painter Amy Weiskopf credits him for being her \\"biggest influence.\\" Civitico eventually relocated to New England to teach at the University of New Hampshire, where he taught noted still life painter Jeanne Duval. In 1987, he moved to Charleston, South Carolina, where he continued to teach privately, mentoring painter Patrick Servedio while actively exhibiting and accepting commissions. == Awards == The recipient of several honors, awards and fellowships, Civitico was a recipient of the 1990 Ingram-Merrill Foundation Grant. In 1981, he won the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Painting Prize, in 1980 he was awarded a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship and, in 1979, he received the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship. ==Exhibitions== === Solo exhibitions === * Robert Schoelkopf Gallery, New York, NY, 1983, 80, 78, 76, 73. * The Gallery, Portsmouth, NH, 1987. * Manchester Institute of Arts and Sciences, Manchester, NH, 1987. * Contemporary Realist Gallery, San Francisco, CA, 1992, 1988, 1985. * College of Charleston, Charleston, SC, 1995. * Gibbes Museum of Art, Charleston, SC, 1995. * Mac Masters Gallery, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, 2000. *Opening Reception: Performing Arts Tryptic.

The fire burned a total area of 439,230 acres. It was the largest fire in Nevada‚Äôs history, and one of the biggest in the U.S. The blaze destroyed six ranches, grazing land, and animal habitats. == Origin == The fire erupted seven miles north of Paradise Valley in Humboldt County and burnt eastward into Elko County. The origin of the fire was thought to be human-based. Dry, hot, and windy conditions combined with high fuel load caused the extension of fire. == Description == NASA's Suomi NPP satellite captured this image of the fire and smoke blowing from it on July 08, 2018 with the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument. Actively burning areas (hot spots), detected by thermal bands, are outlined in red. The fire was reported around 12:25 a.m. on July 5, and by 5:00 p.m, the fire had spread over 22,000 acres. On July 8, the fire was only 8% percent contained, and 330,000 acres were burnt.\\"Martin Fire\\". Elko BLM ESR.

Due to the size and complexity of the fire, both government agencies and private contractors were deployed to gain control of the fire. By July 12, there were approximately 572 firefighters to fight the 680 mile long blaze. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) had also announced a reward of $28,000 for anyone who would give information about who started the fire. By July 21, the fire was fully contained. === Use of UAS === As per the 'Call When Needed' contract with the U.S. Department of Interior, a team of pilots and four unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) were deployed by Bridger Aerospace, a private contractor, on 11 July. The UAS were used to map 425,000 acres of the wildfire to gather data on the magnitude of damage and locate hot spots using an infrared sensor. == Consequences == The fire destroyed grazing areas and a small building. It destroyed the ecosystem for the sage grouse and the mule deer habitat. Several springs and streams were also affected. == Closures == On July 10, the Wilson reservoir and campground (HWY 226) was closed for public safety due to fire suppression activities.

The building is an example of Meiji period western style architecture in Japan, and is listed as an Important Cultural Property. The building is now used as a museum. == Overview == The building was initially constructed as the head office of the Morioka Bank, and is located at the foot of Nakanobashi Bridge, which crosses the Nakatsu River in Morioka. Work began in May 1908 and was completed in April 1911. The Morioka Bank went out of business in 1933, and the building was acquired by the Iwate Shokusan Bank in 1936, and became its head office. The bank's name was changed to the Bank of Iwate in 1960. It continued to be used as the bank's head office until a modern building was completed in 1983. It continued to be used as a brand office of the bank even after the building's designation as an Important Cultural Property, until 2012. The interior of the building was repaired and restored to its Meiji period appearance, and the building was opened to the public in 2016. Bank of Iwate Red Brick Building Official home page The main architect of the building was Tatsuno Kingo, who also designed the head office of the Bank of Japan in Tokyo. This is the only one of his works in the Tohoku region of Japan. Tatsuno was assisted by Morioka-native Kasai Manji. The unique characteristics of the building is that it has an octagonal domed tower in the southeast corner, a square tower in the southwest corner, and Japanese-style irimoya- zukuri gable roofs protruding from the sides. The outer wall is made of red brick and with stripes of white granite. Inside, there is a corridor on the second floor surrounding the colonnade on the first floor. About 910,000 bricks from Iwate prefecture are used for building materials, and Aomori Hiba cypress wood is used for the interior. Although the building is distinguished by its use of red bricks, it was painted white from 1936 until 1958 and was called the \\"White Meijikan\\". ==Current status== Currently, the interior is divided into a free \\"Iwate Bank Zone\\" and a paid \\"Morioka Bank Zone\\". The Iwate Bank Zone has a multi-purpose hall with refurbished business rooms and a library lounge that introduces the history of industry and commerce in Morioka. In the Morioka Bank Zone is a reception room and a safe room that has been used since the bank's opening. There is also a corner that introduces the financial history of Iwate Prefecture, and a theater that introduces the history and structure of the buildings. ==References== ==External links== * Official Home page * Iwate Tani tourist information Category:Important Cultural Properties of Japan Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1911 Category:Morioka, Iwate Category:Buildings of the Meiji period Category:Museums in Iwate Prefecture ","title":"Bank of Iwate Red Brick Building"},{"id":"63857832","text":"Marie Signe Hammer n√©e J√∏rgensen (1907‚Äì2002) was a Danish zoologist and entomologist who specialized in moss mites. In the 1930s and 1940s, she undertook research in Iceland, the Faroe Islands and Greenland. She later extended her investigations to North and South America, New Zealand, and Asia, discovering some 150 new genera and almost a thousand new species. Her research supported the dispersal of species as a result of continental drift as described in her 1979 thesis together with John Anthony Wallwork titled A Review of the World Distribution of oribatid mites in Relation to Continental Drift. ==Early life== Born in Copenhagen on 20 March 1907, Marie Signe J√∏rgensen was the daughter of Niels Rasmussen J√∏rgensen (1879‚Äì1967) and Alma Kristine Rasmussen (1878‚Äì1960). After her parents had divorced when she was seven, she was brought up by her mother on a farm in Niv√•. After matriculating from Rungsted State School in 1926, she studied zoology at the University of Copenhagen, earning a master's degree in 1932. ==Career== A publication by C.H. Bornebusch in 1930 on The Fauna of Forest Soil inspired J√∏rgensen to research the new field of microfauna in soils. This led to a trip to Iceland in 1931 with her twin sister Aase, reported in their Island rundt in 1935. In 1933, with a view to extending her research to Greenland, she joined Knud Rasmussen on his final Thule expedition. She studied microfauna, in particular springtails (Collembola) and moss mites (Oribatida), documenting her discoveries in later publications. On 9 October 1936, she married fellow zoology student Ole Gregers Hammer (1911‚Äì1996) who later headed Danish beekeeping research. In the 1930s and 1940s, Marie Hammer collaborated with Statens Vildtbiologiske Unders√∏gelser (Danish Wildlife Investigations), conducting work on sparrows. Together they had four children: Karen (1938), Inga (1941), Birgitte (1942), Peder (1946). In the late 1940s, she once again embarked on lengthy expeditions to continue her research on moss mites, travelling to Canada, Alaska and the Rocky Mountains (1948), Mexico, Argentina, Chile and Bolivia (1954), Panama, Ecuador, Peru, Chile and Argentina (1957), Hawaii, Fiji, New Zealand and New Guinea (1962), West Pakistan, Indonesia, Tonga, Western Samoa and Tahita (1969) and finally Java and Bali (1973). These expeditions led to papers on 150 new genera and almost a thousand new species. As a result of her research, she became convinced that animal dispersion was a result of continental drift, first presenting her findings in a paper on Mucronothrus nasalis in 1965. Together with John A. Wallwork, she described the development of 696 general in the context of continental movement over the past 200 million years in 'A Review of the World Distribution of oribatid mites in Relation to Continental Drift (1979). In 1982, Hammer was awarded Weekendavisen literature prize for her book Forsker i fem verdensdele (Researcher in Five Continents) in which she describes her travels, her work on moss mites and the people she met. Commenting on how little she had earned from her life's work, she explained: \\"50 years for Minerva. Despite this paltry financial result, I would not swap my life with anyone ‚Äî I have obtained what I wanted and lived my life in my own way.\\" Marie Hammer and her husband spent their later life in an old farmhouse near Fredensborg.

The initial version of the game, released on January 20, 2016, was a creative mode, with unlimited access to all available parts for building. On the day of its release, it was the top-selling game on Steam and is estimated to have 1‚Äì2 million sales. The survival mode update for the game, with new game mechanics including wildlife, scavenging, farming, and cooking, as well as an underwater biome, was released on May 7, 2020. It was the third-best-selling game on Steam the week after the update. == Gameplay == ===Survival mode=== Players begin at the site of a crashed spaceship, with very few items. They must search for supplies and food in order to survive. The spaceship has a basic crafting station called a Craftbot with limited functionality, primarily focused on allowing players to build a simple automobile to begin exploring the world. The second major location in the game is the mechanic station, where most complex crafting can be undertaken with the other crafting stations: the large Craftbot; the Dressbot, for making clothes; the Refinebot, for refining raw materials; and the Cookbot, for combining raw foods into recipes. Other locations include ruined structures filled with enemy robots, supply crates, and chests with loot, the trader's post, where items can be purchased with harvested and refined resources, and warehouses, large buildings storing more advanced supplies. The world is inhabited by a variety of robots that attack the players on sight. These include: spider-like Totebots, whose heads can be used to make music and deter other Totebots; Haybots, who wields a pitchfork and drop scrap metal (which can be refined for crafting); Tapebots, who guard warehouses and shoot tape rolls at intruders; and the large boss fight Farmbots, who wields a chemical gun and a large scythe. They also hold the keys to the warehouses. Players can also find a merchant with whom they can trade for special items including guns and clothing. The merchant accepts crates of fruit and vegetables as currency as well as caged farmers that can be found throughout the world. === Creative Mode === In creative mode, players start with full access to an unlimited supply of all items in the game, allowing for the creation of a variety of buildings, vehicles, and machines, none of which require energy or fuel to function. There are no enemies, and players cannot be injured or die. Creations can be saved and shared via the Steam workshop. === Challenge Mode === In challenge mode, players have to try and get through 40 levels by making or fixing contraptions using the materials they are given. A challenge builder is also available. == Backstory == The mechanics (players) are en route to a planet whose farming system is fully automated. They are headed there to manage the planet's robots. Unfortunately, something goes awry during reentry, and the mechanics crash-land. They survive, but they soon discover things have gone wrong on the planet.

There exists a unique largest open subset V_f of \\\\mathbb{C} (ordered under subset inclusion) such that \\\\pi\\\\left( f^{-1}\\\\left( V_f \\\\right) \\\\right) = 0. To see why, let D_1, D_2, \\\\ldots be a basis for \\\\mathbb{C}'s topology consisting of open disks and suppose that D_{i_1}, D_{i_2}, \\\\ldots is the subsequence (possibly finite) consisting of those sets such that \\\\pi\\\\left( f^{-1}\\\\left( D_{i_k} \\\\right) \\\\right) = 0; then D_{i_1} \\\\cup D_{i_2} \\\\cup \\\\cdots = V_f. Note that, in particular, if D is an open subset of \\\\mathbb{C} such that D \\\\cap \\\\operatorname{Im} f = \\\\emptyset then \\\\pi\\\\left( f^{-1}\\\\left( D \\\\right) \\\\right) = \\\\pi \\\\left( \\\\emptyset \\\\right) = 0 so that D \\\\subseteq V_f (although there are other ways in which \\\\pi\\\\left( f^{-1}\\\\left( D \\\\right) \\\\right) may equal 0). Indeed, \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\setminus \\\\operatorname{cl}\\\\left( \\\\operatorname{Im} f \\\\right) \\\\subseteq V_f. The essential range of f is defined to be the complement of V_f. It is the smallest closed subset of \\\\mathbb{C} that contains f(x) for almost all x \\\\in X (i.e. for all x \\\\in X except for those in some set \\\\omega \\\\in \\\\Omega such that \\\\pi\\\\left( \\\\omega \\\\right) = 0). Note that the essential range is a closed subset of \\\\mathbb{C} so that if it is also a bounded subset of \\\\mathbb{C} then it is compact. We say that f is essentially bounded if its essential range is bounded, in which case we define its essential supremum, denoted by \\\\ f \\\\^{\\\\infty}, to be the supremum of all  \\\\lambda  as \\\\lambda ranges over the essential range of f. === Space of essentially bounded functions === Let \\\\mathcal{B}(X, \\\\Omega) be the vector space of all bounded complex-valued \\\\Omega-measurable functions f : X \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C}, which becomes a Banach algebra when normed by \\\\ f \\\\_{\\\\infty} := \\\\sup_{x \\\\in X}  f(x) . Note that \\\\left\\\\ \\\\cdot \\\\right\\\\^{\\\\infty} is a seminorm on \\\\mathcal{B}(X, \\\\Omega), but not necessarily a norm. The kernel of this seminorm, N^{\\\\infty} := \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ f \\\\in \\\\mathcal{B}(X, \\\\Omega) : \\\\left\\\\ f \\\\right\\\\^{\\\\infty} = 0 \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, is a vector subspace of \\\\mathcal{B}(X, \\\\Omega) that is a closed two-sided ideal of the Banach algebra \\\\left( \\\\mathcal{B}(X, \\\\Omega), \\\\ \\\\cdot \\\\_{\\\\infty} \\\\right). Hence the quotient of \\\\mathcal{B}(X, \\\\Omega) by N^{\\\\infty} is also a Banach algebra, denoted by L^{\\\\infty}(\\\\pi) := \\\\mathcal{B}(X, \\\\Omega) / N^{\\\\infty} where the norm of any element f + N^{\\\\infty} \\\\in L^{\\\\infty}(\\\\pi) is equal to \\\\ f \\\\^{\\\\infty} (since if f + N^{\\\\infty} = g + N^{\\\\infty} then \\\\ f \\\\^{\\\\infty} = \\\\ g \\\\^{\\\\infty}) and this norm makes L^{\\\\infty}(\\\\pi) into a Banach algebra. The spectrum of f + N^{\\\\infty} in L^{\\\\infty}(\\\\pi) is the essential range of f. We will follow the usual practice of writing f rather than f + N^{\\\\infty} to represent elements of L^{\\\\infty}(\\\\pi). Theorem: Let \\\\pi : \\\\Omega \\\\to \\\\mathcal{B}(H) be a resolution of identity on \\\\left( X, \\\\Omega \\\\right).

For every T in A, the Gelfand transform of T is the map G(T) : \\\\sigma_A \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C} defined by G(T)(h) := h(T). \\\\sigma_A is given the weakest topology making every G(T) : \\\\sigma_A \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C} continuous. With this topology, \\\\sigma_A is a compact Hausdorff space and every T in A, G(T) belongs to C \\\\left( \\\\sigma_A \\\\right), which is the space of continuous complex-valued functions on \\\\sigma_A. Recall that the range of G(T) is the spectrum \\\\sigma(T) and that the spectral radius is equal to \\\\max \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ G(T)(h)  : h \\\\in \\\\sigma_A \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, which is \\\\leq \\\\ T \\\\. Theorem: Suppose A is a closed normal subalgebra of \\\\mathcal{B}(H) that contains the identity operator \\\\operatorname{Id}_H and let \\\\sigma = \\\\sigma_A be the maximal ideal space of A. Let \\\\Omega be the Borel subsets of \\\\sigma. For every T in A, let G(T) : \\\\sigma_A \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C} denote the Gelfand transform of T so that G is an injective map G : A \\\\to C\\\\left( \\\\sigma_A \\\\right). There exists a unique resolution of identity \\\\pi : \\\\Omega \\\\to A that satisfies: :: \\\\left\\\\langle T x, y \\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\int_{\\\\sigma_A} G(T) \\\\operatorname{d} \\\\pi_{x, y} for all x, y \\\\in H and all T \\\\in A (we use the notation T = \\\\int_{\\\\sigma_A} G(T) \\\\operatorname{d} \\\\pi to summarize this situation). Let I : \\\\operatorname{Im} G \\\\to A be the inverse of the Gelfand transform G : A \\\\to C\\\\left( \\\\sigma_A \\\\right) where note that \\\\operatorname{Im} G can be canonically identified as a subspace of L^{\\\\infty}(\\\\pi). Let B be the closure (in the norm topology of \\\\mathcal{B}(H)) of the linear span of \\\\operatorname{Im} \\\\pi. The following hold: 1. B is a closed subalgebra of \\\\mathcal{B}(H) containing A; 2.

He was sentenced to 24 years imprisonment for these crimes, and seven years later, he would be connected to another unsolved 2008 rape-murder. However, his sentence remained unchanged despite this new revelation. ==Murders== Born in 1983, Barkovsky, a married man with a son, worked as a gravedigger in Rostov-on-Don's northern cemetery. On March 30, 2008, he abducted 16-year-old Marina Rachkovskaya while she walking home from the Stroygorodka district. He brutally raped and beat the girl, before finally strangling her to death and disposing of her body in a drainage ditch along Taganrogskaya Stret, under some train tracks. By that time, the local media were reporting extensively on the disappearance, and many searches were organized to find Marina. About three months after the fact, her decomposing body was found by some passers-by. When the details of her brutal killing were circulated by the media, it frightened Barkovsky. In the following month, unaware that there were undercover officers out to catch him, Barkovsky approached one female operative and put a screwdriver to her chest in attempt to accost her. The woman managed to shout for backup over the radio, and the officers detained the man for questioning. However, due to the lack of evidence, he had to be released. After laying low for a while, Roman decided to commit crimes elsewhere. He bought a used Lada and periodically travelled to the villages of Rogozhkino and Kazachiy Yerik, near Azov, where he normally went fishing. Along the road connecting the two locations, there was a bar where young people often gathered and partied at a nearby farm, and knowing this, Roman decided that this would be his new hunting grounds. In July 2009, he abducted a local woman from Kazachiy Yerik and dragged her to a nearby grove, where he stripped the victim of her clothing and raped her. Since she didn't resist, Barkovsky spared her life, leaving in his car after the act. Frightened, the woman told her husband, but they were reluctant to notify the police, as they were afraid of being stigmatized. In August, a young local girl named Elena also disappeared while walking along the route in Kazachiy Yerik, in a remarkably similar fashion to how the surviving victim was abducted. After prolonged searches, her naked body was found hastily buried in a field. She too had been beaten, raped and sexually assaulted before death. Barkovsky had likely killed her elsewhere, and later transported the body in the trunk of his car. ==Arrest, trial and imprisonment== Unbeknownst to the killer, a trio of local farmers had paid close attention to the car that Elena was last seen boarding, even remembering that the license plate ended in 011. Soon after, Roman was detained at a traffic stop for marijuana possession and held for questioning, and when the news of a detained suspect was spread, the surviving rape victim finally came forward and positively identified him as her assailant. Despite his futile attempts to deny and shift the blame on his friends, Barkovsky's alibi was proven to be fake, with semen traces from him also located on the corpses. At his trial, during which his young son was present, it took the judge less than half an hour to announce a guilty verdict. Much to the dismay of the victims' families, he was given a sentence of 24 years and 7 months imprisonment, of which the first seven he would spend at a prison colony and later a maximum security penal colony. ===Link to 2008 murder=== In 2016, as a result of examining cold case murders in Rostov-on-Don and the surrounding areas, investigators connected Barkovksy to an unsolved rape-murder that took place in the city. On the night of March 1-2, 2008, he came across a woman walking home on the street, whom he grabbed, violated and then transported to the Nightingale Grove, where he proceeded to strangle the victim to death. ==See also== * List of Russian serial killers ==References== Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century Russian criminals Category:Male serial killers Category:Russian serial killers Category:Russian murderers of children Category:Russian rapists Category:Russian people convicted of murder Category:Russian people convicted of child sexual abuse Category:People convicted of murder by Russia ","title":"Roman Barkovsky"},{"id":"63858060","text":"Linda Ketner (born May 12, 1950) is a philanthropist and co-founder of the Charleston, South Carolina-based LGBTQ advocacy group Alliance for Full Acceptance. In 2008, she became the first openly gay candidate for the House of Representatives in South Carolina history when she ran as a Democrat in South Carolina's 1st Congressional District. == Biography == Linda Ketner was born on May 12, 1950 in Salisbury, North Carolina to Ralph Wright Ketner and Ruth Jones Ketner Hope. Ralph Ketner co-founded Food Town, which later became the Food Lion grocery store chain. In 2008, Ketner ran as a Democrat for South Carolina's 1st Congressional district against Republican incumbent Henry Brown. Brown won the race with 52% of the vote to Ketner's 48% , a distance of 16,000 votes. She remained popular with many Charlestonians, and publicly contemplated running for mayor of Charleston in 2013. Ketner has been involved in extensive volunteer and advocacy work with the LGBTQ community in South Carolina. She worked with the Charleston chapter of the NAACP as a committee chair, receiving a Special Recognition Award from the group in 2013. She and her partner, Beth Huntley, did volunteer work in Pass Christian, Mississippi, after Hurricane Katrina, coordinating supplies. Ketner co-founded the Alliance for Full Acceptance in 1998 and served as president until 2004. She was cofounder and president of the South Carolina Equality Coalition (now known as SC Equality) in 2005 during the group's campaign against South Carolina Amendment 1. A homeless and housing activist, she cofounded the Mayor's Council on Homelessness and Affordable Housing in Charleston, SC; and led the citizen's group which achieved passage of the SC Housing Trust Fund in the South Carolina legislature, 1992. Click here for more about her social justice work. In \\"Finding Home Without a Map,\\" an essay published in 2018, Ketner discussed her attempts to \\"pray and will myself into heterosexuality\\" as a young woman and, after ending her marriage to a man and living as a lesbian, her long spiritual journey. \\"It was actually almost two decades before I could attend a traditional Christian service without weeping,\\" she wrote. Her study of non-Christian religions and her three-year affiliation with an all-Black congregation gave her a deeper connection to God and strengthened her commitment to social justice. Ketner also noted that many LGBTQ people do not \\"feel that love of God that never leaves you isolated and alone. That‚Äôs the spiritual path of some gays and lesbians, but most of us have not made that journey. The tragedy of the lack of support for LGBTQ spirituality and relationship in houses of worship is that so many gays have permanently left the church and God and never make it.\\" == References == == External links == * Linda Ketner's campaign website Category:1950 births Category:Lesbian politicians Category:LGBT rights activists from the United States Category:LGBT people from North Carolina Category:LGBT people from South Carolina Category:Living people Category:South Carolina Democrats ","title":"Linda Ketner"},{"id":"63858086","text":"Pomper is a surname.

This button sends an infrared(IR) signal to the television and opens up the Netflix app. Many popular TV companies have adopted the Netflix button, including: LG, Samsung, and Sony. Some of the TVs have made it to a list that Netflix has dubbed the \\"Netflix Recommended TVs\\". These are TVs that have a Netflix button on them which Netflix recommends to their subscribers to get the best viewing experience for their service.

It was planned to have first-class, one-day and Twenty20 cricket competitions throughout England and Wales and as well as the launch of a new franchised 100 ball competition, The Hundred; it would have been the 131st year in which the County Championship has been an official competition.ECB announce domestic fixtures for 2020, England and Wales Cricket Board On 24 April 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) confirmed that no professional cricket would be played in England before 1 July 2020. In late May 2020, the ECB looked at the scheduling of domestic cricket for the summer, with the Royal London One-Day Cup likely to be abandoned. The ECB also confirmed that no domestic cricket would be played before 1 August 2020. In June 2020, some clubs raised concerns about the logistics of travelling and the financial viability of playing first-class cricket, with 50-over matches being a more realistic possibility. On 29 June 2020, the ECB confirmed that the county cricket season would begin on 1 August 2020, with the formats to be agreed in early July. On 7 July 2020, the majority of counties voted to play first-class and Twenty20 cricket, with the Royal London One-Day Cup being cancelled. The launch of The Hundred was also postponed to 2021 due to the pandemic. A one-off first-class competition, named the Bob Willis Trophy, was created to replace the County Championship, which was suspended until 2021; the counties were split into three regional groups with a final to be held at Lord's. As a result of the pandemic, the vast majority of clubs placed players and staff on furlough. The traditional start to the season between the County Championship teams and the six Marylebone Cricket Club University teams (MCCU) of England and Wales, was cancelled. The first two rounds of fixtures would have been first-class matches, with the ECB stating that the 2020 University Matches would have been the last ones to have first-class status. Cricket returned on 8 July 2020 when England and the West Indies began a three match test series behind closed doors at the Rose Bowl with subsequent Tests also played behind closed doors at Old Trafford. ==References== Category:English cricket seasons from 2001 ","title":"2020 English cricket season"},{"id":"63858224","text":"Mabel Frenyear (August 25, 1880 ‚Äì died after 1921) was an actress and chorus girl on stage and in three silent films. == Career == Frenyear appeared in three silent films, A Fool There Was (1915), a Theda Bara vehicle, Tit for Tat (1915), a comedy, and Social Quicksands (1918), written by Katharine Kavanaugh. On her first trip to make films in Los Angeles in 1914, she made headlines for criticizing local women's fashion. \\"Southern California is a wonderland to me, but the women in Los Angeles; oh, they dress so terribly,\\" she declared. On Broadway, Frenyear's roles included parts in The Girl in the Barracks (1899), The Stronger Sex (1908-1909), The Only Law (1909), Where There's a Will (1910), You Can Never Tell (1915), The Importance of Being Earnest (1921, as Miss Prism), and Montmartre (1922). She also appeared in productions of The Wizard of Oz, Babes in Toyland, Father and the Boys (1910), The 'Mind-the-Paint' Girl (1912), Nothing But the Truth (1916), and Kissing Time (1921). Frenyear took chorus roles to prepare for her role as a chorus girl in The Only Law. A Minnesota reviewer in 1921 noted that Frenyear was \\"really pretty and plays her part with spirit.\\" Her stage work was not always so admired; \\"If Miss Frenyear would not shriek her lines unintelligibly,\\" commented one reviewer in 1915, \\"the worst defect of the production would be removed.\\" == Personal life == Frenyear married twice. In 1900 she married Edward F. Dunn. She only lived with Dunn for eight weeks, when he sold all her jewelry and gambled the proceeds; they divorced in 1904. By the end of 1904 she remarried, to Thomas R. Finucane; that marriage was almost immediately annulled, because both parties admitted they were \\"married while intoxicated\\".

Arbery had been pursued by three white residents--Travis McMichael and his father Gregory, who were armed and driving a pickup truck, and William \\"Roddie\\" Bryan, who followed Arbery in a second vehicle--and was confronted and fatally shot by Travis McMichael. Arbery's killing and the delayed investigation and arrests of suspects reignited debates about racial inequality in the United States. The case has been widely reported internationally. The Glynn County Police Department (GCPD) said the Brunswick District Attorney's Office advised them on February 23 to make no arrests. The Brunswick District Attorney's Office denied that such advice was given to the GCPD by either the Brunswick District Attorney or her Assistant District Attorneys. On February 24, Waycross Judicial Circuit District Attorney George Barnhill, who had not yet been assigned to the case, advised the GCPD that no arrests should be made. Barnhill officially took over the case on February 27. On April 2, Barnhill again advised the GCPD to make no arrests, while announcing his intention to recuse himself from the case due to connections between his son and Gregory McMichael. Barnhill requested recusal on April 7. The case was ultimately transferred to the Cobb County District Attorney's Office, the fourth prosecutor's office to handle it. At the behest of Gregory McMichael, a local attorney provided a copy of the video of the shooting to local radio station WGIG, who posted it to their website on May 5. The video went viral, having also been posted on YouTube and Twitter. Within hours, District Attorney Tom Durden said a grand jury would decide whether charges would be brought, and accepted an offer from Governor Brian Kemp to have the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) investigate the case. The GBI arrested the McMichaels on May 7 and Bryan on May 21, charging them with felony murder and other crimes.Tim Stelloh, Man who recorded Ahmaud Arbery's shooting death on video arrested, charged with murder, NBC News (May 21, 2020). On June 4, additional evidence was presented by the prosecutor to support the murder charges, including a statement to the GBI by William Bryan that Travis McMichael said \\"fucking nigger\\" as Arbery lay dying.Prosecutors describe use of racial slur as Ahmaud Arbery lay dying. Russ Bynum, Associated Press, June 4, 2020 A grand jury subsequently indicted each of the three men on charges of malice murder, felony murder (4 counts), aggravated assault (2 counts), false imprisonment and criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment. The fact that the McMichaels were not arrested until 74 days after the killing, after the video went viral, sparked debates on racial profiling in the United States. Numerous religious leaders, politicians, athletes, and other celebrities condemned the incident. The GCPD and the Brunswick District Attorney's Office were nationally criticized for their handling of the case and the delayed arrests; Georgia Attorney General Christopher M. Carr formally requested the intervention of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the case on May 10, which was granted the following day. == Persons involved == * Ahmaud Marquez Arbery, aged 25, graduated from Brunswick High School in 2012. He attended South Georgia Technical College during fall 2012 and spring 2013 to train for a career as an electrician. Family and friends said he frequently jogged for exercise in and around his neighborhood. * Gregory McMichael, age 64, previously worked as a GCPD officer from 1982 to 1989, and as an investigator for the Brunswick Judicial Circuit District Attorney's Office from 1995 to his retirement in May 2019. * Travis McMichael, age 34, is Gregory McMichael's son. * William \\"Roddie\\" Bryan, age 50, was a neighbor of the McMichaels. == Video of the shooting == A video of the incident was recorded by William \\"Roddie\\" Bryan, a neighbor of the McMichaels, using his cellphone from his vehicle as he followed Arbery jogging down the neighborhood road. The video showed Arbery jogging on the left side of the road when he encountered a white pickup truck that had stopped in the right lane. Gregory McMichael is standing in the truck bed, while Travis McMichael initially stands beside the driver's door with a shotgun. The vehicle of the person who was recording comes to a stop behind Arbery and the pickup truck. As Arbery approaches the pickup truck, shouting can be heard. Arbery then crosses from the left side of the road to the right side and runs around the passenger's side of the truck. After passing the truck's front, Arbery turns left. Meanwhile, Travis McMichael, holding his shotgun, approaches Arbery at the truck's front. The camera's view of the confrontation between Arbery and Travis is momentarily blocked. Several media accounts of the video report that the audio of the first gunshot seems to be heard before Arbery and Travis struggle with each other. Some media accounts first report a struggle, and then mention the gunshot(s). Other media accounts describe that it was \\"not possible\\" to see from the video what was happening when the first gunshot was fired, or report that the truck \\"blocks the view of how the men first engage each other\\" with regard to when the gunshot is heard. Travis and Arbery are seen to grapple over the shotgun. While struggling, both men disappear off camera view on the left side of the frame, after which the audio of a second gunshot is heard. When they reappear, Arbery throws punches and tries to grab the shotgun. A third gunshot is heard being fired by Travis at point-blank range as Arbery appears to throw a right-handed punch at his head. Arbery recoils, stumbles, and collapses face down in the middle of the road while Travis walks away. Gregory McMichael, who has taken out a handgun but not fired, runs towards his son and Arbery. == Investigation by Glynn County Police == === Prior thefts and trespassing incidents reported === In December 2019 and January 2020, residents of Satilla Shores reported thefts, trespassing, and activities they deemed suspicious to police and posted on the Satilla Shores Facebook page and Nextdoor account. Three break-ins or thefts were reported. On December 8, 2019, a Satilla Shores resident reported rifles stolen from their unlocked car. Police recorded a theft on December 28, 2019. On January 1, 2020, Travis McMichael filed a report of a firearm stolen from his unlocked truck. On February 11, 2020, Travis called 9-1-1 to report a slender 6-foot-tall black man with short hair, wearing red shorts and a white shirt, who was trespassing on the site of a house under construction. Travis said, \\"I've never seen this guy before in the neighborhood.\\" The dispatcher asked whether Travis was OK, and he said, \\"Yeah, it just startled me. When I turned around and saw him and backed up, he reached into his pocket and ran into the house. So I don't know if he's armed or not. But he looked like he was acting like he was.\\" \\"We've been having a lot of burglaries and break-ins around here lately,\\" Travis said on the call. He told the dispatcher that he was out in his truck, and that as many as four neighbors were out looking for the man. His father Gregory was one of the people out searching that night, and Gregory and at least one other neighbor were armed. Police responded and searched the house along with a neighbor, but found no one. However, surveillance video from that evening showed a man who reportedly looked like Arbery, briefly walking in and out of the house under construction. He did not take anything. ===Security cameras and 9-1-1 calls before the shooting=== On February 23, in the minutes before the shooting, a security camera installed on a residence across the street from the house under construction, recorded a man identified by his family as Arbery coming down the road and walking into the house. A second security camera installed within the house recorded a man, identified as Arbery by his family, looking at the interior of the house. Approximately five minutes later, he left and resumed jogging down the street. After the man left the house, the first camera on the residence across the street showed a white pickup heading in the man's direction, followed a few minutes later by two police cars. Two calls to 9-1-1 were made just before the shooting. In the first, a male caller said another man was in a house that was \\"under construction\\". The 9-1-1 dispatcher asked if the man was \\"breaking into it right now?\\" The caller replied: \\"No ... it's all open.\\" After the caller said the man was now \\"running down the street\\", the dispatcher said police would respond. The dispatcher asked at 1:08 p.m., \\"I just need to know what he was doing wrong. Was he just on the premises and not supposed to be?\\" The caller responded, with some parts garbled, saying: \\"And he's been caught on camera a bunch at night. It's kind of an ongoing thing.\\" The caller identified the man as a \\"black guy, white T-shirt\\". In the second call, beginning at 1:14 p.m., a male caller said: \\"I'm out here at Satilla Shores ...There's a black male running down the street.\\" The 9-1-1 dispatcher asked, \\"Where at Satilla Shores?\\" The caller replied: \\"I don't know what street we're on.\\" The caller shouted, \\"Stop! ... Watch that. Stop, damn it! Stop!\\" The dispatcher tried to speak to the caller but did not receive a reply for several minutes. The caller later hung up. === Responding officer's report === The GCPD reached the scene immediately after the fatal shooting. The responding officer's report relied almost entirely on an interview with Gregory McMichael, who was described as a witness. Gregory said he was in his yard when he saw an unidentified man running by. He said he recognized the man from a prior incident \\"the other night\\", when he said he saw the man reach into his pants as if for a weapon. He called to his son Travis and said \\"the guy is running down the street; let's go\\". Gregory brought a .357 Magnum revolver, while Travis brought a shotgun in their pickup truck. The McMichaels said they pursued the man because he resembled a suspect in a string of local burglaries. But the police said there had been only one recent theft from an unlocked car in the neighborhood. Travis attempted to cut off the man with the truck. The man turned and began \\"running back in the direction from which he came\\". The report states a third person, who was identified as \\"Roddy \\", also tried to cut off the man, but failed. Gregory said they saw the unidentified man and yelled: \\"Stop, stop, we want to talk to you\\", and that they pulled up to the man, with Travis exiting the truck with the shotgun. Gregory claimed the man \\"began to violently attack Travis\\" before two shots were fired. The man died at the scene after \\"bleeding out\\", the report concluded. Authorities later identified the man as Arbery. === Autopsy === The autopsy report released by the GBI ruled Arbery's death was a homicide and that it was caused by three gunshot wounds he sustained \\"during a struggle for the shotgun\\" that fired those shots. One gunshot wounded the upper left chest, one gunshot wounded the lower middle chest, and one gunshot caused a \\"deep, gaping\\" graze wound to the right wrist. There were no signs of alcohol or drugs in Arbery's body. ==Legal proceedings== === Brunswick Judicial Circuit District Attorney === The case started under the jurisdiction of Brunswick Judicial Circuit District Attorney Jackie Johnson. Because Gregory McMichael had previously worked as an investigator in her office, she recused herself from further involvement in the case. On February 27, 2020, the case was transferred by the Georgia Attorney General's Office to the Waycross Judicial Circuit District Attorney's office. The Waycross Judicial Circuit is south of Brunswick Judicial Circuit. Dispute with the GCPD over whether to make arrests On March 8, two Glynn County commissioners, citing discussions with Glynn County police, accused Johnson, or her office, of preventing the McMichaels' immediate arrest. Commissioner Allen Booker said: \\"The police at the scene went to her, saying they were ready to arrest both of them. These were the police at the scene who had done the investigation. She shut them down to protect her friend [Gregory] McMichael.\\" Commissioner Peter Murphy said that officers who responded at the scene had concluded that there was probable cause to make an arrest, but when they contacted Johnson's office, they \\"were told not to make the arrest.\\" Johnson's office said that Johnson did not \\"have any conversation with any GCPD officer about this case\\" on February 23, and that \\"no Assistant District Attorney in the office directed any Glynn County police officer not to make an arrest\\". Johnson's office also blamed the GCPD for being \\"unable to make a probable cause determination on its own\\" and argued that it was the local police's responsibility, not the District Attorney's responsibility, to make arrests. It is common for police to consult with the district attorney's office in the aftermath of homicides or other complex cases. On May 9, the GCPD said that on February 23 the Brunswick District Attorney's Office \\"became involved in the investigation ... The McMichaels were deemed not to be flight risks and officers were advised by the [Brunswick District Attorney's Office] that no arrests were necessary at the time.\\" The local police also said that on February 24, Waycross Judicial Circuit District Attorney George Barnhill told them that the killing of Arbery \\"was justifiable homicide.\\" === Waycross Judicial Circuit District Attorney === Waycross Judicial Circuit District Attorney George Barnhill gave Glynn County police \\"an initial opinion the day after the shooting\\" on February 24, according to a memorandum written by Barnhill to Glynn County police on April 2. In the April 2 memorandum, Barnhill wrote: \\"The autopsy supports the initial opinion we gave you on February 24, at the briefing room in the Glynn County Police Department after reviewing the evidence you had at that time. We do not see grounds for an arrest of any of the three parties.\\" But, according to the Office of the Georgia Attorney General on May 10, Barnhill had not yet been appointed to handle Arbery's case on February 24, and he had not put in a request to handle the case. The Georgia Attorney General's Office on May 10 identified the following events as having happened on February 27: the Georgia Attorney General's Office received the request from Jackson's office to transfer Arbery's case to another prosecutor. On the same day, the Georgia Attorney General's Office appointed Barnhill as the presiding prosecutor. Neither Jackson nor Barnhill informed the Georgia Attorney General's Office that Barnhill had already actively participated in the case by reviewing evidence and giving his opinion on whether arrests should occur. On April 1, Arbery's autopsy report was given to Barnhill. On April 2, Barnhill wrote a memorandum to Glynn County police, recommending that no arrests be made. Barnhill wrote that the McMichaels were within their rights to chase \\"a burglary suspect, with solid firsthand probable cause\\"; that \\"Arbery initiated the fight\\"; and that Travis McMichael \\"was allowed to use deadly force to protect himself\\" when \\"Arbery grabbed the shotgun\\". Barnhill cited Georgia's citizen arrest law, dating to the Civil War era, as justifying the killing of Arbery (the Georgia law says that either a crime must be committed within the citizen's \\"immediate knowledge\\", or there must be \\"reasonable and probable grounds of suspicion\\" for a felony crime). Barnhill alleged that videos of Arbery entering the home under construction on the day of the shooting showed Arbery \\"burglarizing a home immediately preceding the chase and confrontation.\\" The attorneys representing the Arbery family responded: \\"This video is consistent with the evidence already known to us. Ahmaud Arbery was out for a jog. He stopped by a property under construction where he engaged in no illegal activity and remained for only a brief period. Ahmaud did not take anything from the construction site. He did not cause any damage to the property. He remained for a brief period of time and was not instructed by anyone to leave but rather left on his own accord to continue his jog. Ahmaud's actions at this empty home under construction were in no way a felony under Georgia law. This video confirms Mr. Arbery's murder was not justified, meaning the actions of the men who pursued him and ambushed him were unjustified.\\" The owner of the unfinished home, who was away at the time of the shooting, later said, \\"I've never had a police report [on my property], or anything stolen from my property, or any kind of robbery.\\" Barnhill wrote that \\"Arbery's mental health and prior convictions help explain his apparent aggressive nature and his possible thought pattern to attack an armed man.\\" Lastly, Barnhill informed the Glynn County police that he was going to recuse from the case due to connections between his son and Gregory McMichael. On April 7, Barnhill wrote to Georgia's Attorney General, Christopher M. Carr, saying Arbery's \\"family are not strangers to the local criminal justice system\\", noting that Arbery's brother and cousin's had encounters with the law. Barnhill told Carr that there was \\"video of Arbery burglarizing a home immediately preceding the chase and confrontation\\". The Georgia Attorney General's Office on May 10 said the following events happened on April 7: it received a request from Barnhill's office to transfer Arbery's case to another prosecutor, and Barnhill revealed that he had learned \\"about 3-4 weeks ago\\" that Arbery had previously been prosecuted by his son, a prosecutor for the Brunswick Circuit District Attorney's Office, in an earlier case. He also said that one of the defendants had served as an investigator on the same prosecution (this is a reference to Gregory McMichael, who was employed by the Brunswick D.A.'s Office). The request did not explain why Barnhill had delayed in recusing his office from the case, did not mention that Barnhill had advised Glynn County police on April 2 to make no arrests, and omitted Barnhill's involvement on February 24, instead recounting only his involvement \\"upon taking the case\\". On April 13, after Barnhill's recusal, the Georgia Attorney General's Office appointed Atlantic Judicial Circuit District Attorney Tom Durden to take over the handling of the case. The Atlantic Judicial Circuit is the immediately adjacent circuit to the north of Brunswick Judicial Circuit. === Video of the shooting released === A video of the shooting was uploaded on May 5 on the website of local radio station, WGIG; it was received from Gregory McMichael. After two hours, WGIG removed the video for being too graphic. The video was uploaded to YouTube that day. The Arbery family's attorney posted a 28-second segment of the video on Twitter. The video of the shooting went viral. Glynn County police requested the Georgia Bureau of Investigation look into how the video was publicized. The Guardian published an edited version of the video on May 6. TMZ published a longer version of the video on May 5. On May 7, Alan David Tucker, a local criminal defense attorney, said that he had sent the cell phone video to WGIG, and that it had been recorded by William \\"Roddie\\" Bryan, who was in the second truck following Arbery. WGIG confirmed that Tucker had provided the video to the radio station. Tucker had informally consulted with the suspects in the case, but said he had not been retained to represent anyone involved. Tucker said that he released the video to provide \\"absolute transparency\\" due to \\"erroneous accusations and assumptions\\", and that \\"my purpose was not to exonerate them or convict them.\\" Within hours of the video becoming public, Tom Durden, the district attorney for Georgia's Atlantic Judicial Circuit, said that he would present the case to \\"the next available grand jury in Glynn County\\" to decide if charges should be filed. The convening of grand juries had been postponed until after June 12 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Durden accepted Georgia Governor Brian Kemp's offer to bring in the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) to investigate. ===Prosecution of the McMichaels and Bryan=== The GBI found probable cause to charge Gregory and Travis McMichael within 36 hours of taking over jurisdiction of the case, and, on May 7, arrested and charged them with felony murder The McMichaels were booked into the Glynn County Jail. At an appearance before a judge the following day, the McMichaels were both denied bond. Given the \\"size and magnitude\\" of the investigation, Durden requested that the case be reassigned to another prosecutor with a larger staff. Pursuant to Durden's request, the Georgia Attorney General's office reassigned the case on May 11 to the Cobb County District Attorney's Office, led by Joyette M. Holmes. She was the fourth D.A. to take on the case. Arbery's family welcomed the transfer of the case from a southeast Georgia district attorney to one the metro Atlanta area away. On May 21, William \\"Roddie\\" Bryan was charged with felony murder and attempt to commit false imprisonment.Angela Barajas & Erica Henry, William Bryan Jr. -- the man who recorded the fatal shooting of Ahmaud Arbery -- has been arrested, GBI says, CNN (May 21, 2020). According to the arrest warrant, Bryan tried \\"to confine and detain\\" Arbery without legal authority by \\"utilizing his vehicle on multiple occasions\\" before Arbery was shot. The GBI said their investigators found \\"a number of pieces of video\\" that linked Bryan to the case. Bryan was alleged to have attempted to block Arbery, which was unsuccessful. Arbery's palm print was found on the rear door of Bryan's truck, cotton fibers near the truck bed were attributed to contact with Mr. Arbery, and a dent was found below the location of the cotton fibers. At the June 4 preliminary hearing, a Glynn County Magistrate Court judge ruled that there was probable cause for the murder charges against all three men.Richard Fausset, \\"Judge Finds Probable Cause for Murder Charges in Arbery Case\\", New York Times (June 4, 2020).Cleve R. Wootson Jr., Annie Gowen & Abigail Hauslohner, \\"Judge advances murder trial for all three white men charged in death of Ahmaud Arbery\\", Washington Post (June 4, 2020). The prosecution presented additional evidence to the court to support the murder charges, including hours of testimony from the lead GBI investigator. At the hearing, the prosecutor said that the three men \\"chased, hunted down and ultimately executed\\" Arbery, with the McMichaels striking Arbery with their pickup truck while chasing him.Eliott C. McLaughlin, \\"Ahmaud Arbery was hit with a truck before he died, and his killer allegedly used a racial slur, investigator testifies\\"], CNN (June 4, 2020). The investigator testified that none of the three had called 9-1-1; he said: > \\"I don't believe it was self-defense by Mr. McMichael. I believe it was > self-defense by Mr. Arbery. I believe Mr. Arbery was being pursued, and he > ran until he couldn't run anymore. And it was: turn his back to a man with a > shotgun, or fight with his bare hands against a man with a shotgun, and he > chose to fight.\\" The prosecution also introduced a statement to the GBI by William Bryan that Travis McMichael said \\"fucking nigger\\" while standing over Arbery's body, and testimony that Travis McMichael had previously used the same slur on previous occasions in social media postings and in text messages. The alleged use of a racial slur could affect a federal investigation of whether hate crime charges will be brought. Body camera footage showed that the McMichaels' truck had a Confederate flag sticker on its toolbox. On June 24, it was announced that a Glynn County grand jury had issued an indictment against all three defendants, each on nine counts: malice murder, four counts of felony murder, two counts of aggravated assault, false imprisonment and criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment.Richard Fausset, Suspects in Ahmaud Arbery's Killing Are Indicted on Murder Charges, New York Times (June 24, 2020). At a hearing on July 17, all three defendants waived arraignment and entered not guilty pleas. During the hearing the lead prosecutor disclosed that Arbery‚Äôs palm print had been found on the side of Bryan‚Äôs truck and texts taken from Bryan‚Äôs cellphone were \\"replete with racist remarks.\\" At the conclusion of the hearing the judge denied bond to Bryan. On August 6, attorneys for each McMichael filed separate motions seeking the granting of bond and seeking dismissal of the malice murder and felony criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment charges. That date Bryan's attorney filed an adoption of the motions to dismiss by the McMichaels for his client. == Aftermath == === State and federal review of the case === On May 10, Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr said that his office would review how the investigation into Arbery's death \\"was handled from the outset\\". At Carr's request, the GBI is investigating whether District Attorney Johnson or District Attorney Barnhill committed misconduct by \\"possibly misrepresenting or failing to disclose information during the process of appointing a conflict prosecutor to investigate\\" the death of Arbery. Carr also called for a federal investigation into how local investigators and authorities handled the case, including \\"investigation of the communications and discussions by and between the Office of the District Attorney of the Brunswick Judicial Circuit and the Office of the District Attorney of the Waycross Judicial Circuit related to this case.\\" The next day on May 11, the U.S. Department of Justice responded that the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, the FBI, and the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Georgia \\"have been supporting and will continue fully to support and participate in the state investigation. We are assessing all of the evidence to determine whether federal hate crimes charges are appropriate.\\" === Prior allegations of misconduct by local authorities === Following Arbery's killing, media investigated the history of the GCPD. The New York Times noted that in preceding years, the department had \\"been accused of covering up allegations of misconduct, tampering with a crime scene, interfering in an investigation of a police shooting and retaliating against fellow officers who cooperated with outside investigators.\\" Days after Arbery was fatally shot, the chief of police, who had been brought in to clean up a police force described by the county manager in 2019 as poorly trained and characterized by a \\"culture of cronyism\\", was indicted on charges arising from an alleged cover-up of a sexual relationship between an officer and an informant. In response to a grand jury report issued in November 2019, which had condemned the GCPD over \\"alleged officer misconduct and poor coordination with the local sheriff's office\\", State Senator William Ligon of Brunswick in early 2020 introduced legislation to allow voters to abolish the Glynn county police department. Although the legislation initially stalled in the General Assembly, after the legislature returned following the COVID-19 recess, the House passed the legislation 152-3. The Senate then passed the legislation as Senate Bill 509, which Governor Kemp signed. The legislation allows a November 3, 2020 binding referendum such that the police department would be abolished if a majority of Glynn County voters agreed. The involvement of the GCPD as the primary investigator in a case involving its former officer Gregory McMichael was controversial. Arbery's death also prompted re-examinations of the way prosecutions of shootings were handled by the Brunswick Judicial Circuit District Attorney's Office. In 2010, two police officers fatally shot an unarmed white woman through her car windshield. Four former prosecutors, who had worked under Brunswick Judicial Circuit District Attorney Jackie Johnson, alleged that Johnson shielded the officers from criminal prosecution. A 2015 investigation by WSB-TV revealed that Johnson had agreed to withhold a draft murder indictment from the grand jury and had \\"allowed the officers' department to present a factually inaccurate animation they created showing the car escaping through a gap and running over the officers.\\" == Reactions == === Involved parties and their families === Arbery's mother said her son was jogging when he was killed and called for arrests to be made. The Arbery family retained Benjamin Crump, S. Lee Merritt, and Chris Stewart as attorneys. Meritt described the McMichaels as \\"vigilantes\\" and \\"a posse\\" who \\"performed a modern lynching in the middle of the day.\\" Arbery's family attorney charged that videos of earlier police encounters show a pattern of unfair treatment of Arbery based on his skin color. On May 1, Gregory McMichael told The Daily Beast he \\"never would have gone after someone for their color\\". He also said he had no direct evidence Arbery had stolen anything in the neighborhood. However, McMichael argued Arbery was on property \\"without permission\\". A lawyer for William Bryan Jr., the man who recorded the shooting using cell phone video, said his client had done nothing wrong, had fully cooperated in the investigation, and \\"is not now, and never has been, a 'vigilante'.\\" The attorney also described Bryan as \\"a mechanic with a high- school education\\" who was simply a witness to the shooting.Grace Hauck, \\"Man who recorded Ahmaud Arbery's shooting on video was just a witness, his lawyer says\\", USA Today (May 9, 2020). Attorneys for Arbery's family called for Bryan's arrest. They said that because Bryan had participated in chasing Arbery and had \\"corralled\\" him, Bryan participated in the killing.Richard Fausset & Rick Rojas, \\"Man Who Filmed the Arbery Killing Faces Calls for Arrest\\", New York Times (May 18, 2020). === Current and former elected officials === After the video went public, Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr said, \\"I expect justice to be carried out as swiftly as possible.\\" Governor Brian Kemp said on May 7 that \\"Georgians deserve answers\\" about the incident. Two Glynn County Commissioners, Peter Murphy and Allen Booker, called for a federal probe. After viewing the video, Georgia U.S. Representative Doug Collins and U.S. Senator Kelly Loeffler said it was \\"disturbing\\" and called for a full investigation and answers. Speaking to reporters, President Donald Trump commented, \\"My heart goes out to the parents and to the loved ones of the young gentleman. It's a very sad thing.\\" Then-presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, said that \\"the video is clear: Ahmaud Arbery was killed in cold blood.\\" Biden offered condolences and called for \\"a swift, full, and transparent investigation into his murder.\\" Biden also described the shooting as a lynching. Legislative response In late June 2020, Georgia enacted new bipartisan hate crimes legislation (House Bill 426). Previous versions of the legislation had passed the state House but failed to pass the state Senate. Arbery's killing was a catalyst for passage of the bill; at the time Georgia was one of just four states without any hate-crimes legislationJason Slotkin, \\"After Ahmaud Arbery's Killing, Georgia Governor Signs Hate Crimes Legislation\\", NPR (June 26, 2020). although Georgia did have a previous hate-crimes law that had been struck down as unconstitutionally vague. === Civil rights groups, commentators, and the public === rightthumbMural on Bruswick African American Cultural Center, painted in May 2020 Mural painted in July 2020https://thebrunswicknews.com/news/local_news/brunswick-mural-calls-for- end-to-citizens-arrest-law/article_1bfb2d31-7e3c-5678-838a-c4173b0d4da7.html Brunswick News After the video was released, demonstrators gathered outside the Glynn County Courthouse to demand an arrest in the case, and called for the resignation of District Attorney Jackie Johnson. The local Brunswick NAACP chapter also called for the resignation of the Glynn County police chief. The Southern Poverty Law Center called for a Federal investigation into the incident, citing their belief Arbery's death was racially motivated. Attorney and journalist David A. French wrote that, under Georgia's stand-your-ground law, because the McMichaels initiated the confrontation, > \\"It's a crime under Georgia law to point a gun (loaded or unloaded) without > legal justification. When Arbery was confronted by armed men who moved > directly to block him from leaving, demanding to 'talk,' then Arbery was > entitled to defend himself. Georgia's 'stand your ground law' arguably > benefits Arbery, not those who were attempting to falsely imprison him at > gunpoint.\\" On May 8, which would have been Arbery's 26th birthday, thousands of supporters of Arbery's family took part in a run of in honor of the date of his death; they documented it to social media with the hashtag #IRunWithMaud.Fortin, Jacey, \\"On Ahmaud Arbery's Birthday, Thousands Say #IRunWithMaud \\", The New York Times (May 8, 2020). Many clergy and celebrities have voiced support for review of the case, and concern about the violence. Russell D. Moore, head of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, said, \\"under any Christian vision of justice, there is no situation in which the mob murder of a person can be morally right, nor grounds for a person to be chased down and shot by private citizens.\\" Athletes such as LeBron James, Brian Orakpo, Torrey Smith, Enes Kanter, and Marcus Stroman used Twitter to demand justice, and offer their thoughts and prayers. Others posted tributes to Arbery, such as Lecrae, David A. French, Scott Sauls, Christine Caine, Jack Graham, J.D. Greear, Viola Davis, Wanda Sykes, Padma Lakshmi, Gabrielle Union, and Andy Lassner. On social media, far-right and neo-Nazi groups spread falsehoods about Arbery; their white-nationalist supporters attacked President Trump for his sympathetic comments regarding Arbery. They falsely claimed that Arbery was wielding a hammer and wearing boots when he was shot dead; Arbery was wearing running shoes. They spread racist remarks about Arbery, claiming the McMichaels were victims. Far-right groups said that the arrests of the McMichaels reflected a bias against whites. ==Notes== == References == == External links == * ‚Äì includes anonymous video of incident * * Category:2020 controversies in the United States Category:2020 deaths Category:2020 in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:2020 United States racial unrest Category:African-American history of Georgia (U.S. state) Category:African- American-related controversies Category:Brunswick, Georgia Category:Deaths by firearm in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Deaths by person in the United States Category:February 2020 events in the United States Category:Filmed killings Category:Glynn County, Georgia ","title":"Killing of Ahmaud Arbery"},{"id":"63858320","text":"Laurel Hill Cemetery is an historic cemetery in Saco, Maine, United States.

After the IFA to replay or terminate the tie, Association pulled out of the competition and folded as a club. On 27 October 1892, Nomads were one of five football clubs present at the foundation of the Leinster Football Association (LFA), at a meeting in the Wicklow Hotel on Exchequer Street, Dublin. Shortly after the LFA became affiliated to the Irish Football Association and the LFA soon organized their own cup competition, the Leinster Senior Cup which was first played for in 1892‚Äì93. The inaugural final saw Nomads defeat Dublin University 2‚Äì1. After the inaugural win by Nomads, Bohemians and Shelbourne monopolised the cup for the next twenty-four years.

Also in the game is Merlin's Shop, in which the player can obtain Tokens and attractions through Elixirs, which are obtained by exchanging them for decorations and concessions in Merlin's cauldron. The game also includes floats based on each franchise, which grant Magic, Tokens or Gems through parades. Playing during Events can unlock limited-time characters and attractions.

He became an archbishop in 1932 and served as an Apostolic Nuncio from then until 1962. He was Vice Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church from 1962 to 1969. ==Biography== Luigi Centoz was born on 2 April 1883 in Saint-Pierre, Aosta Valley, Italy. He was ordained a priest on 9 June 1906. In 1909 he joined the staff of the Holy See's Secretariat of State, where he worked directly for the Cardinal Secretary of State Rafael Merry del Val. On 6 January 1921, he was assigned to the nunciatures to Germany and Bavaria (and from 1925 to Prussia), working for the Nuncio Eugenio Pacelli, later Pope Pius XII. He participated in the conclave of February 1922, as aide to Cardinal Merry del Val. On 28 January 1932, Pope Pius XI named him titular archbishop of Edessa in Osrho√´ne and Apostolic Nuncio to Bolivia. He received his episcopal consecration in 14 February 1932 from Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, the future Pope Pius XII. He chose as his episcopal motto \\"Dominus Fortitudo Mea\\" (The Lord is my Strength). On 16 September 1936, Pope Pius appointed him Apostolic Nuncio to the Venezuela. On 19 February 1940, Pope Pius XII appointed him Apostolic Nuncio to Lithuania. He was expelled from Lithuania on 24 August after the Soviet invasion and returned to Rome. There he led a new Vatican commission considering how to counter Soviet Communism and held \\"long conferences\\" with the Pope. On 3 December 1941, Pope Pius appointed him Apostolic Nuncio to Nicaragua, Panama, and Costa Rica. Hostilities prevented him from taking up those posts and he remained in Rome for the duration of World War II. He worked instead at the Secretariat on relief for prisoners of war and displaced persons. right In 1946 he donated a building in his home town for use as a nursery school and childhood education center. It is named for him. He finally reached Central America in February 1946. His role in Nicaragua ended with the appointment of his successor on 4 October 1948. He resigned the two other posts on 26 April 1952 and returned to Rome. On 29 November 1954, Pope Pius named him Apostolic Nuncio to Cuba. His half-century in the diplomatic service ended on 5 July 1962, when Pope John XXIII named him Vice Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church. His term as Vice Camerlengo ended with the appointment of his successor, Vittorio Bartoccetti, on 24 March 1969. Centoz retired to his home town.

Crokin (born February 8, 1977) is an American columnist and conspiracy theorist. ==Education== Crokin grew up in Glenview, Illinois and graduated from New Trier High School. She attended the University of Iowa studying political science and journalism. While there, she was an organizer for Students for Bush, a large organization supporting the George W. Bush 2000 presidential campaign. She later interned at the U.S. State Department during Bush's first term and for conservative pundit Bill O'Reilly's show The O'Reilly Factor on Fox News. == Career== Crokin began working in 2002 for the Chicago Tribune, before moving to their RedEye daily tabloid writing a column called \\"Liz in the Loop\\" (previously \\"Eye Contact\\") which covered celebrity news in the Chicago area. In 2010, Crokin moved to Los Angeles and began working as a freelance entertainment reporter for National Enquirer, Star, In Touch Weekly, US Weekly where she focused on celebrity breakups. Crokin returned to Chicago in 2012 to work for Splash, a Chicago Sun-Times publication at the time, writing a column called \\"LA LA Liz\\". In September 2012, Crokin developed a viral form of meningitis which progressed into meningoencephalitis and caused daily migraines, vertigo, and photophobia resulting from brain damage. Her health problems resulted in a loss of work, including being laid off in 2013 by American Media Inc., parent company of Star and National Enquirer. Crokin and others had previously accused AMI content officer Dylan Howard of sexual harassment, and has suggested that the layoffs were done in retaliation. Crokin's column in Splash ended in February 2014. ==Conspiracy theories== Crokin became a self-declared follower of QAnon, a conspiracy theory alleging liberals and elites are running secret sex- trafficking rings of children. QAnon is derived from a belief the 4chan imageboard has been used by members of the Trump administration to disseminate top secret information about the presidency. The QAnon source making \\"intel drops\\" on 4chan and 8chan, she believed, was Trump himself or Stephen Miller. Crokin is a believer in The Storm, derived from a comment Trump made on October 6, 2017, which theorized the Mueller Inquiry was a cover for a pedophile investigation. She claimed on Twitter at the end of December 2017 that photographs posted on Snapchat by Chrissy Teigen, which showed the model with her one-year-old daughter, contained concealed messages suggesting Teigen was connected to Pizzagate, the discredited conspiracy theory. After Twitter removed her verification, Crokin went on to contend that Teigen might be under the CIA's Project MKUltra mind control program (long since scrapped). Other people possibly under MKUltra, according to Crokin, include Harvey Weinstein and Jeff Bezos. Crokin continues to believe Pizzagate is true, as of 2020. She featured in Out of The Shadows, a documentary uploaded to YouTube in April 2020. For her, Jeffrey Epstein and the NXIVM scandal demonstrated the continuing validity of Pizzagate. Crokin was the original source for Roseanne Barr's deleted tweet in March 2018 claiming President Donald Trump had released hundreds of children from bondage each month. Crokin had used fake figures in a 2017 blog post for the conservative Townhall website entitled \\"Why the MSM Is Ignoring Trump's Sex Trafficking Busts\\" claiming a \\"staggering 1,500-plus arrests\\" of involved individuals in the first 30 days of Trump's presidency. Another thesis she has spread is that John F. Kennedy Jr. did not die in 1999, but faked his death, and is behind QAnon. According to Right Wing Watch, she predicted in March 2018 that the conspiracy theories suggesting \\"thousands of high-level political, business and entertainment figures are involved in cannibalistic satanic pedophilia\\" will be proven as true before President Trump leaves office. ==References* Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:People from Glenview, Illinois Category:Journalists from Illinois Category:American women television journalists Category:21st-century American journalists ","title":"Liz Crokin"},{"id":"63858620","text":"Sinan Idrizi (born 20 July 1968) is a key figure and major shareholder of Air Albania and is also the president of Albanian football club Flamurtari FC. ==Early life== Idrizi was born in Vlor√´ to a Cham father and a Lab mother.

Oliver Matthew Ridley and his first wife Laura Pole Stuart (died 1858), daughter of Sir William Stuart; Henry Nicholas Ridley was a younger brother. For the first years of his life his father was rector of West Harling in Norfolk, moving to Cobham, Kent in 1860. He was educated at Haileybury College.Edward J. Salisbury, Henry Nicholas Ridley. 1855-1956, Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society Vol. 3 (Nov., 1957), pp. 141-159, at p. 142. Published by: Royal Society Ridley matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford in 1872. He moved in 1873 to Exeter College, where he graduated B.A. in 1875 (1st class in Natural Sciences), M.A. in 1881. He also studied under Ernst Haeckel. He taught at Friars School, Bangor, and worked in 1878 at the British Museum as an assistant. ==Clerical career== In 1887 Ridley was ordained deacon, and in 1888 priest at Carlisle. He was a curate at Maryport 1887 to 1890, then at Wareham, Dorset 1891 to 1895. He was curate at Milborne Port in Somerset 1895 to 1897, where he gave a magic lantern talk on the voyage of HMS Challenger; and was vicar of Staverton, Wiltshire from 1897 to 1905. At Milborne Port and Staverton, his parish work was supported by his sister Miss Ridley. He had two sisters, of his father's first marriage, one of whom was a deaconess of the Church of England. Miss Ridley, described as \\"sister of the well-known Singapore botanist\\" (i.e. Henry Nicholas Ridley), was a botanist, and resided for a time in the Peppard ward of Reading, Berkshire, where she was in 1910. Ridley became vicar of Scarisbrick, where he was from 1905 to 1911, succeeding his brother Charles William Ridley (1856‚Äì1905); and of Compton Bishop, near Axbridge in Somerset, where he was from 1911 to 1916. Ridley in 1917 was curate of St John's Church, Reading, where he was in 1929. ==Later life== In later life Ridley was a naturalist, and he was a herbarium curator at Reading Museum. He joined the Botanical Society of the British Isles in 1929. He died in 1935. ==Works== In 1881 Ridley published a zoological paper on the expedition of HMS Alert off the coast of South America. In 1883 his paper was one of a number arising from Francis Day's collection on the 1882 survey cruise of HMS Triton off Scotland. He published on the genus Lophopus of bryozoa in 1886. Also in 1886, he published a paper in The Zoologist with his brother Henry Nicholas Ridley, Animal Life in High Latitudes on the Norway Coast. Ridley worked on the report of the Challenger expedition. He was succeeded in his position in the Zoological Department of the British Museum in 1887 by Arthur Dendy. They published joint papers on the expedition's sponge specimens, and then Dendy and Ridley wrote for the Challenger report Part LIX (Volume XX.), Report on the Monaxonida (1887).

The Staatsanwaltschaft, is the public prosecutor's office in Germany. They are the offices of the public prosecutors which are criminal justice bodies attached to the judiciary but separate from the courts. In Germany, the police have an obligation to investigate every single crime reported and subsequently send all investigations to the Staatsanwaltschaft. The public prosecutor, the Staatsanwalt (state attorney), reviews the findings of the police and decides whether to indict the accused or halt the proceedings. The prosecutor's office has (in theory) the duty to investigate and pursue any matter in its jurisdiction as soon as it learns that a criminal offence may have been committed (Legalit√§tsprinzip). However, there are some offences which require the victim to explicitly request prosecution (Antragsdelikt), other cases may be dropped due to \\"small guilt\\" or \\"non-importance\\" or the complainant may be told to prosecute on his own (common in defamation cases unless a VIP is involved). Prosecutors are authorised to undertake investigations themselves or can request the police to do so and the police are obliged to carry out such requests. Moreover, prosecutors can order witnesses and expert witnesses to testify before them and can even ask an investigating judge (the Ermittlungsrichter) to interrogate witnesses or to examine the evidence. The investigating judge only reviews the legality of the interrogation or inspection and must comply with the prosecutor's request as long as it is legal. However, due to their superior manpower, training and experience, the police conduct the vast majority of criminal investigations on their own. Cases are normally only turned over to the prosecutor's office when they are considered to have been solved or all leads have gone cold. A prosecutor is usually only involved from the very beginning in homicide or serious white-collar crime cases. Police also contact prosecutors at an early stage when significant publicity is expected or they need help gaining a judicial arrest or search warrant etc., or when the Ermittlungsrichter is to interrogate a witness. In court, the approximately 5,200 public prosecutors in Germany are the prosecuting counsels. Unlike judges, public prosecutors are civil servants and therefore subject to the orders of their superiors. In investigations and in court, the prosecution is supposed to be \\"objective\\" and \\"neutral\\". However, instead of the legal principle of the maxim \\"in dubio pro reo\\" (Latin: \\"benefit of the doubt\\", see presumption of innocence) which applies to judges, the maxim for the prosecution is in dubio pro duriore, that is presumption of guilt. The reason for this is that the courts would be stripped of their proper role if in case of a doubt there were not even a trial, and because proof may yet be found within the trial. Still, it is (or should be) common for the Staatsanwaltschaft to request the acquittal of the defendant if the evidence that came to light in the courtroom or before suggests he or she is innocent. Naturally the defense's opinion often differs from that of the prosecution in this matter. The next investigating criminal justice body above the Staatsanwaltschaft is, according to the authorities of the separation of powers (Legislative, Exekutive and Judicative) of the German Grundgesetz, the Generalstaatsanwaltschaft. ==See also== * Prosecutor * Parquet (legal) * Public prosecutor's office ==External links== * Eurojustice Report on Germany Category:Law enforcement in Germany Category:Judiciary of Germany Category:Prosecution ","title":"Public prosecutor's office (Germany)"},{"id":"63858828","text":"Tamara Scheer (born 1979 in Vienna) is an Austrian Historian.

It was initially housed in a wood and nipa structure which was converted from a public schoolhouse as a response to a cholera outbreak. In 1919, the hospital was named the Misamis Public Hospital. A new wooden building was constructed in 1932 at the present site of the hospital near the Provincial Capitol. The hospital had a 25-bed capacity.

The hospital was renamed as the Misamis Oriental Provincial Hospital in 1945. The hospital was expanded once again in 1956 through the construction of additional buildings and the expansion of the bed capacity to 75. The Misamis Oriental Provincial Hospital was renamed as the Northern Mindanao Regional Training Hospital (NMRTH) through Republic Act 4662 which became law on June 18, 1966. The legislation also mandated the departmentalization of the hospital's services and gave the facility capability in being a teaching hospital. Bed capacity was also increased to 200.

She received her undergraduate degree in 1915, and her master's degree on the subject of economics, specializing in labor issues, in 1916.Barnes, B. (1990, September 27). LABOR EXPERT CLARA BEYER DIES AT 98. Washington Post. She served as an instructor at UC Berkeley for one year before agreeing to teach labor economics at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania in 1917. ==Career== While teaching at Bryn Mawr College, Beyer encouraged students to join picket lines and to investigate tenement sweatshops in Philadelphia.Boris, Eileen. (2000). Beyer, Clara Mortenson. American National Biography Online, American National Biography Online. Not long after the beginning of her time at Bryn Mawr, Beyer met Felix Frankfurter, a then Harvard University faculty member and future Supreme Court Justice, who had come to Bryn Mawr in order to deliver a lecture. He was impressed with Beyer and asked her to come and work with him in Washington, D.C. on the War Labor Policies Board, and she accepted his invitation. Beyer served on the War Labor Policy Board throughout World War I, creating labor policies related to the war. She worked with Elizabeth Brandeis on these policies, daughter of Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, and Justice Brandeis went on to become one of Beyer's mentors. Beyer served as secretary of the District of Columbia Minimum Wage Board. Clara Mortenson Beyer. (1921). A minimum wage conference at work--Award for District of Columbia laundry workers. Monthly Labor Review (pre-1986), 12(000003), 109. In that position, Beyer established procedures, set minimums, and went so far as to physically go to mercantile houses at the end of the daily shift and inform clerks about the District of Columbia's minimum wage. At the same time, Beyer was a member of the National Consumers' League, where she found a mentor in the secretary of organization, Florence Kelley. In 1920, Clara married economist Otto Beyer, with whom she had three sons, Donald, Morton, and Richard. They moved to New York in 1921. She took on only part-time work while the boys were still at home, and one such part-time position was with the New York Consumers' League. It was there that she met and befriended Molly Dewson and Frances Perkins, both of whom she would go on to work with at the U.S. Department of Labor's Division of Labor Standards. Beyer also worked other part-time jobs at the same time, and served as the executive secretary of the Women's Joint Committee for the Minimum Wage and Hour Legislation, as well as a researcher for the American Federation of Labor. However, Beyer waited until 1928, when all three of her sons were enrolled in school, before she took on full-time work. The Beyer family moved back to Washington D.C. in 1928 and Clara returned to full-time work as Director of the Department of Labor's Children's Bureau, and from 1931 to 1934 she was the director of the Industrial Department of that Bureau. During this time, Dewson and Beyer worked together to engineer Frances Perkins' appointment to the position of secretary of labor in 1933. In 1934, Perkins and Dewson encouraged Beyer to take the freshly-minted position of Associate Director in the Division of Labor Standards, and take it she did; Beyer served as Associate Director there from 1934‚Äì1957, working on issues of apprenticeship, vocational education, programs for elderly and migrant workers, and other foundational American labor issues. Beyer was excited about working with a newly founded Bureau because she was eager to build an organization from the beginning. Frances Perkins expressed her political inability to appoint another woman to a leading role in an important Labor Department organization, which she told Beyer was why she was not promoted further within the organization, and which Beyer happily accepted. Beyer did go on to become Acting Director of the Division of Labor Standards for one year, 1957‚Äì1958. During her time at the Bureau of Labor Standards, Beyer was a member of the so-called ‚ÄúLadies‚Äô Brain Trust,‚Äù working alongside Molly Dewson, Mary La Dame, and Congresswoman Mary T. Norton to advise Frances Perkins in her position as Secretary of Labor during the 1930s and 1940s. It was through this advisory position that Beyer became an influential voice in New Deal era labor policies. Also while serving at the Bureau of Labor Standards, Beyer worked closely with Perkins and Arthur Altmeyer to develop the provisions that went into the Social Security Act of 1935. Beyer's most recognized achievement at the Bureau of Labor Standards is her instrumental work towards the establishment of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which set minimum wage and maximum hour standards nationwide. Beyer's bureau helped Ben Cohen and Thomas Corcoran draft the legislation, and when Beyer herself was resisted by organized laborers who worried that minimum wage would lower wages overall, she worked with Congresswoman Mary T. Norton to lobby William Green, president of the American Federation of Labor. With his support, the law passed, and when the act was challenged and appealed to the Supreme Court, Beyer helped prepare the government's successful defense. Beyer left the Department of Labor in 1958 and went to work at the International Cooperation Administration, which eventually was combined with several other organizations to become the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). She would work with USAID until her retirement in 1972, visiting 32 countries and studying labor conditions there. In 1972, when Beyer retired, she was awarded a certificate of appreciation for her contributions to the social and economic development of people both in the United States and overseas. After her retirement, Beyer still served as a consultant for USAID and co-authored the Percy Amendment to the International Cooperation Assistance Act of 1973, which designated certain amounts of U.S. foreign aid to programs for women. == Death and legacy== Beyer died in her Washington, D.C. home on September 25, 1990 due to acute cardiac arrhythmia. She was survived by her three sons, twelve grandchildren, and 23 great-grandchildren. One of her grandchildren, Don Beyer, serves as a Congressmen from Virginia's 8th congressional district since 2015, and was the Lieutenant Governor of Virginia from 1990 to 1998, and the United States Ambassador to Switzerland from 2009 to 2013 Don Beyer inaugurated the Clara Mortenson Beyer \\"Women and Children First\\" Award in 2011, which honors women leaders making positive change for women.

Along with her husband, Friedrich Dahl, she was a co-author and editor of the zoological series Die Tierwelt Deutschlands, published between 1925 and 1968. == Life == Maria Johanna Grosset was born on 26 July 1872 in Boromlya, Russian Empire (currently in Poltava Region, Ukraine). She was an honor graduate from the Girls Gymnasium in Kharkiv. In 1889, Grosset became a teacher of culture. In 1890, Grosset immigrated with her family to Kiel, Germany, where she attended a vocational school. She planned to study medicine, however, at that time only men could attend medical schools in Germany. In 1891, Groset had to retake the exams, as her Russian diploma was not recognized in Germany. On 19 June 1899 Grosset married Friedrich Dahl. The couple had four children. Due to Friedrich Dahl's health problems, the Dahl family moved to Greifswald where Dahl continued to live after her husband's death in 1929. Maria Dahl died on 6 January 1972 at the age of 99. == Career == From 1892 to 1899 Dahl was employed as an assistant to Karl Brandt at Zoological institute in Kiel where she was working with the collections from the 1889-90 Plankton-Expedition. In the two decades after getting married in 1899, Dahl was mainly occupied by the birth and education of her four children. However, around 1907 her husband, Friedrich Dahl, encouraged her to pursue the work he had started on the corycacid copepods of the Plankton- Expedition. Working at home, by 1912 Dahl had completed a monograph of excellence, planned as one part of the series. In the foreword to her analysis of the copepod genus Corycacinen, Dahl apologized for not having a PhD in zoology and for taking too long to complete the task. After World War I Dahl was engaged in arachnid research along with her husband. In 1920, Dahl began her research at the University of Berlin and was occupied with it until 1925. Dahl's and her husband's joint research culminated in publishing Die Tierwelt Deutschlands in 1925. Friedrich Dahl was its founder and author of the first three volumes, while Maria co-authored the fifth volume and edited 15 volumes. A review in Nature called Die Tierwelt Deutschlands \\"a reference book necessary to every library of zoology\\", noting that \\"each species is given an excellent and well-illustrated systematic description\\". After Friedrich Dahl‚Äôs death in 1929, Dahl continued editing Die Tierwelt Deutschlands until 1968. Dahl also published several works on spiders and finished editing her husband‚Äôs book on Melanesia. == List of works== Selected works: * 1926 - Dahl (M.) (Maria), Spinentiere oder Arachnoidea.

In 2001, Walker was named a Chevalier de L'Ordre des Arts et Lettres by French Minister of Culture Catherine Tasca. Walker lives and works in Paris and has exhibited widely in France, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, Australia, and the United States. ==Early life and education== Walker was born in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1933. Walker graduated in 1955 from Smith College. She spent her junior year in Paris, working at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re in Montparnasse. In 1956 she returned to Paris to study with Johnny Friedlaender at his atelier; her first etchings were done there. == Career == Walker continued to make prints, create etchings, and a number of fine-press books in Paris. To date, she has made more than 330 prints, as well as a number of fine-press books illustrated with etchings. Since the 1960s Walker has been participating in group, collective, and solo exhibitions in France and abroad. In Paris, she has been involved in the Salon de Mai, the Salon de la Jeune Gravure Contemporaine and the Salon d'Automne, of which she was a member for a time. In 1986 Walker took up painting, using gouache combined with pastel, a technique that has predominated in her work since then. With these materials she began exploring the format of the artist‚Äôs book, which has allowed her to collaborate with poets and writers whom she admires, including Michel Butor, Kenneth Koch and Peter Davison (poet), to name a few. Much of her book work is concerned with the language of color and is characterized by a lyricism that pairs well with literature. Walker also illustrated single-copy, or very limited edition books, and worked on \\"painted books\\" over texts by writers such as Bernard No√´l, Jean Cortot, Henry David Thoreau, Charles Baudelaire, Walt Whitman, Arthur Rimbaud and Eug√®ne Guillevic. Her solo exhibition Anne Walker: Painted Books at the Boston Athenaeum in 2003 featured handwritten poems by an impressive roster of writers: Emily Dickinson, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and others, including the artist herself and one of her major collectors and collaborators, Edward Kessler. A major exhibition in 2005 Poetics of Color: Books by Anne Walker featured thirty-two artist's books‚Äìlikened to poetic jewel boxes‚Äìwhich she donated to the Mortimer Rare Book Collection at Smith College on the occasion of her 50th college reunion.Exhibition brochure for Poetics of Color: Books by Anne Walker, Neilson Library, Smith College, 8 November 2005‚Äì28 February 2006.

Cole is an American political scientist. She is a professor of Political Science, Women's and Gender Studies, and American Studies at Queens College, City University of New York and the Graduate Center, CUNY, where she has also served as the Executive Officer of the political science program. Cole studies political philosophy and American culture, and has published works on the politics of victimhood and vulnerability in America, the politics of gender equality, and the nature of capitalism as a way of life. ==Research== Cole holds a PhD from the University of California, Berkeley. In 2007, Cole published her first book, The cult of true victimhood: from the war on welfare to the war on terror. The book builds on the study of the rhetoric of victimization in American politics, in which the notion of victim is viewed as a useful device for the political establishment to translate failures of the system into individual faults with some group of people. Early writers on this topic include the psychologist William Ryan. Cole studies competing claims to victimhood in contemporary American politics, particularly claims on either side of the culture wars that began in the 1980s and 1990s regarding welfare, feminism, racism, and eventually the War on Terror that followed the September 11 attacks. The notion of victimhood maps naturally onto social groups because a particular set of people is claimed to be disadvantaged by the system, and it is politically salient because claims of victimhood often seek state remedies. Disagreements about victimhood can therefore cause inter- group conflicts through processes like identity politics. Cole argues that part of the source of this tension in the United States is the conflict between the idea of victimhood and the dominant American political culture: because liberal individualism is a fundamental virtue in American political identity, the notion of claiming to be a victim can be cast as pathetic and undeserving. Cole focuses on how \\"anti-victimist\\" figures like Charles Sykes, Robert Hughes, Shelby Steele, Alan Dershowitz and Dinesh D'Souza have used anti-victimhood rhetoric to undermine the credibility of those claiming to be victims of an unjust political system, which in turn positions those figures as victims of other peoples' professed victimhood. Conversely, Cole also studies the rejection of victimhood by some second-wave feminists, studying how authors like Naomi Wolf and Camille Paglia rejected the political tactic of identifying with victimhood as a means to accrue power by appearing powerless. Cole's study of victimhood has implications for understanding the right and left in American politics from the 1960s onwards, but primarily focuses on political disputes regarding multiculturalism, identity politics, and feminism during the 1990s, as well as how America was rhetorically cast as a victim to justify the country's response to the September 11 attacks. She also studies the implications of these rhetorical tools to policies including civil and criminal justice reform and the extent of the welfare state. In addition to The cult of true victimhood, Cole has also written about the political use of victimhood and vulnerability in peer-reviewed journal articles. Together with George Shulman, Cole co-edited the 2019 book Michael Paul Rogin: Derangement and Liberalism. She was also a co-editor in 2019, with Estelle Ferrarese, of How Capitalism Forms Our Lives. Cole has served as an editor of numerous academic journals, including as an editor-in-chief of philoSOPHIA: A Journal of Transcontinental Feminism. Cole has published on topics like victimhood and vulnerability in news publications like Salon and Fortune, and her work has been covered in outlets like the BBC and Truthout. ==Selected works== *The cult of true victimhood: from the war on welfare to the war on terror (2007) *\\"All of Us Are Vulnerable, But Some Are More Vulnerable than Others: The Political Ambiguity of Vulnerability Studies, an Ambivalent Critique\\", Critical Horizons (2016) *How Capitalism Forms Our Lives, co-editor with Estelle Ferrarese (2019) ==References== Category:Living people Category:American women social scientists Category:American political scientists Category:Women political scientists Category:21st-century American women writers Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:Date of birth missing (living people) Category:Graduate Center, CUNY faculty Category:Queens College, City University of New York faculty ","title":"Alyson Cole"},{"id":"63859864","text":"Md.

Das (August 19, 1918 - October 7, 1964) was a Filipino yachtsman and immigrant to the United States who holds the earliest record of Single- handed sailing from Hawaii to the Philippines on a 27-footer homebuilt sailboat. ==Early Years== Das was born in the northernmost town of Allen, Northern Samar. Having been exposed at an early age in traditional fishing, and learning this in the most treacherous waters of the San Bernardino Strait, Das has picked the skills of boat handling. Allen is also the terminus of the ferry between Luzon and Samar, and this has impressed upon Das to pursue a life of seafaring. His father also owned a traditional double-outrigger sailing boat called a paraw, which is powered by a crab-claw sail along with a small foresail. With the paraw, the Das patriarch and his sons conducted trading around Eastern and Central Visayas. Part of his learning was also in the traditional knowledge of boat building, wayfinding, celestial navigation, and weather forecasting. Das shared \\"Me, I have loved them (boats) since I was a kid. Whenever my father was building a new boat, I was sure to be there beside him, when I was still very little.\\" At the age of 12, Das got into trouble with his local school authorities, and thus he fled to the neighboring town of Lavezares, where he found work as a cabin boy in the inter-island ferry. Das found his way to the capital Manila later on, and survived by taking various jobs, such as a stevedore or boat crewman. On February 1934 he boarded the English freighter Silverbeam as a stowaway, but was discovered after a few days en route to San Francisco. The captain put him and his fellow stowaway to work, and by the time they arrived in Hawaii he was given a choice whether to offload or continue to San Francisco with a guaranteed work on board the ship. Das opted to disembark, and arrived in Honolulu at the age of 16. In Hawaii, Das took on work as a ship scalar, chipper and painter for interisland vessels, a security guard, and as a vocation he also pursued an amateur boxing career. He met his wife, Gloria Espartino, a Filipino-American who grew up in Hawaii, and gave Das eight children. During World War II Das was employed as a fishing boat captain and learned modern navigation. ==Solo Sailing== Das was inspired by the French sailor √âric de Bisschop, who arrived in Hawaii from France on his sailboat Kaimiloa. Das was mentored by de Bisschop on modern sailing techniques, and in turn the former helped work on the repairs of de Bisschop's boat. Receiving sponsorship from a local fraternity called Timarau Club, along with proceeds from the sale of three fishing boats Das was able to acquire a surplus US Navy S-Bottom hull. Along with his four sons, Das worked on the boat, and rigged it with canvas sails and a 25hp outboard motor. He named her Lady Timarau. On May 14, 1955, Das slipped out of Kewalo Basin in Honolulu in front of family and friends, and sailed into open ocean without modern communication or navigational systems, except for a compass. A month into his adventure, after encountering a number of storms and damage to his boat, he came across a Japanese fishing vessel, Daisan Shinsei Maru, who offered to tow him to Ponape in Micronesia. His sponsor have requested that he return to Hawaii, but Das instead took on odd jobs for the next eight months to generate funding for the continuation of his trip. On February 22, 1956, Das was able to secure clearance from the local authorities and sailed off towards the Philippines. Along the way, Das passed Truk Island, Hall Island, as well as Yap Island, and finally on April 25, 1956, after almost 12 months into his personal adventure, he saw the Philippines for the first time in two decades, landing Siargao Island at Masayay, Alegria, in the town of Santa Monica, Surigao del Norte. The locals did not know who Das was, nor what he achieved, but he became a local curiosity. However, the news of his arrival soon spread and the Philippine Navy dispatched a ship to escort Das on his plan to return to his hometown of Allen, Northern Samar, where he was welcomed as a local town hero. In Manila, President Ramon Magsaysay received Das on May 11, 1956 with a fluvial parade along Pasig River, and conferred him an honorary rank of Commodore of the Philippine Navy, as well as the Philippine Legion of Honor rank of Officer [OLH]. The Mayor of Manila Arsenio Lacson received a letter from his counterpart from Honolulu as hand carried by Das, and gave the latter Keys to the City. ==Later Life and Death== The celebration of Das' achievement was shortlived, and no sooner did he find himself lacking in funding or a means of getting back to Hawaii. He tried to sell Lady Timarau to the Philippine government, but he did not receive any positive feedback on this. Personal tragedy also struck Das as his wife divorced him during his absence. To make ends meet, he again took on odd jobs. He also met Herminia Cipriano, whom he married as his second wife and is a school teacher, and they were able to get hired as caretakers of a resort on Corregidor Island. Das was also hired by the Philippine Tourist and Travel Authority. Das and his wife moved to Mindoro where his wife took on teaching job with the Divine Word College of San Jose. He attempted once more to sell his boat to the Philippine government for it to be preserved in a museum, but sadly Lady Timarau sank in Pasig River in one of the storms. On the seventh anniversary of his feat, he celebrated by sailing solo once more, on a 27-footer utility boat from San Jose, Occidental Mindoro to Manila, but by this time he was already suffering from diabetes and was losing his vision because of glaucoma. Das was admitted to the Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Hospital for glaucoma surgery, but by 1964 his health was deteriorating and he lost his sight. Das died on October 7, 1964, at the age of 46 due to uremia at a hospital in Manila. During his funeral, he was accorded Navy Honor Guards, and was buried at the Manila North Cemetery. ==Memorials== There are a number of memorials to commemorate his achievement: *A memorial plaque in Kewalo Basin, Honolulu. *A memorial plaque in Santa Monica, Surigao del Norte *A historical marker and statue in Allen, Samar. == References == Category:1964 deaths Category:Sailing Category:Philippine Navy Category:Recipients of the Philippine Legion of Honor Category:1918 births Category:Sailors Category:Single-handed sailing Category:People from Hawaii Category:People from Northern Samar Category:Filipino sailors ","title":"Florentino Das"},{"id":"63860176","text":"Austroparmelina is a genus of foliose lichens in the large family Parmeliaceae.

He compiled 5,454 rushing yards in his career and was a two-time Pennsylvania Class 2A first-team all-state selection. He was one of the top recruits in Pennsylvania and signed with West Virginia. ==College career== Askew-Henry started a school-record 51 games in four seasons at West Virginia. As a true freshman in 2014, he started 13 games and compiled 45 tackles (36 solo) and two interception. Askew-Henry posted 59 tackles and one interception as a sophomore. Coming into the 2016 season, he was one of three returning starters on defense but was forced to redshirt the 2016 season after sustaining an ACL tear in the preseason. Askew-Henry was the team's fourth-leading tackler as a junior with 57 tackles (42 solo), 2.5 tackles for loss, and one interception, earning him Honorable Mention All-Big 12 honors. As a senior, he made 54 tackles (37 solo), including five tackles for loss, and intercepted two passes. Askew-Henry was named Honorable Mention All-Big 12 for the second consecutive season.

It is surrounded by a public park known as Woodside Park and is a locally listed building. ==History== The building, which was designed in the Italianate style, was built as a private residence for Thomas William Smith Oakes, an East India Company merchant; it was initially known as Earlham Grove House and was completed in 1865. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with three bays facing onto High Road; the central section featured a doorway with fanlight flanked by paired Doric order columns on either side on the ground floor; there were single windows on each of the first and second floors above the doorway. The philanthropist Catherine Smithies, who founded the Band of Mercy animal welfare group which later merged with the RSPCA, lived in the house in the mid 19th-century. Her son, Thomas Bywater Smithies, who was the publisher of The British Workman, also lived in the house at that time. The house was acquired by the local board of health for use as a public library in 1893 and it then became the offices of Wood Green Urban District Council in 1913. It was expanded with a single storey extension of five extra bays to the south at that time. Internally, the principal room in the extension was the council chamber but a mayor's parlour and a court for the local petty sessions were also created in the complex. The building went on to become the headquarters of the Municipal Borough of Wood Green when the area secured municipal borough status in 1933. The house remained the local town hall until the council moved to Wood Green Civic Centre in March 1958. Its role subsequently changed to that of a local register office for Haringey Council under the name Woodside House. The house was extensively refurbished by T&B; Contractors at a cost of ¬£4 million between September 2017 and June 2018. It was renamed George Meehan House, in memory of Councillor George Meehan, a former leader of Haringey Council, in 2018.

He was previously president of the Spanish Supreme Court and of the General Council of the Judiciary (1990-1996), and was later president of the Spanish Constitutional Court (2011-2013). == Early life == Sala was born on 18 June 1935 in Valencia, and went on to study a law degree at the University of Valencia. He became a judge in 1962, and in 1970 became a magistrate of administrative disputes, presiding over courts in Valencia, Albacete and Santa Cruz de Tenerife. During the same decade, he formed part of Justicia Democr√°tica, a movement composed of lawyers and other legal professionals in opposition to Franco's dictatorship in Spain and in favour of democracy. After the end of Franco's dictatorship, Sala became a member of the professional association Judges for Democracy until he took up his post as the President of the Supreme Court and the General Council of the Judiciary. In 1982, he became the member of the Spanish Court of Auditors representing the Congress of Deputies, as proposed by the Spanish Socialist Workers Party, and taking on the role of the President of the Prosecutions Division. == Supreme Court and General Council of the Judiciary == In 1986, Sala became a magistrate of administrative disputes on the Supreme Court, and in 1988 was elected to the presidency of the Court of Auditors by its members. On 7 November 1990, Pascual Sala became the President of the Supreme Court and the General Council of the Judiciary, with a vote of 13 in favour to 4 against of an electorate of 20 of the members of the General Council. As president of the General Council of the Judiciary, Sala played a crucial role in the reaction to the scandal surrounding Luis Pascual Estevill, and requested Estevill resign after he was implicated in a number of offences. On 25 July 1996, Sala left the presidencies of the Supreme Court and the General Council of the Judiciary, and returned to his previous position as a Supreme Court judge. He was replaced in the presidency by Judge Javier Delgado Barrio. == Constitutional Court == From 2004 to 2013 Sala was a member of the Constitutional Court of Spain, and on 20 January 2011 he was elected its president. Sala was the first career judge ever to have been president of the Constitutional Court, with all the others having been professors. He remained in this post until 19 June 2013, when he was replaced by Francisco P√©rez de los Cobos. Notable and controversial cases his presidency of the court covered include the legalising of the Basque political party Sortu, which passed by one vote, and in whose case El Pa√≠s attributed the speed of the decision to Sala's effort; the case considering the constitutionality of same-sex marriage in Spain; and the beginning of the case regarding the declaration of sovereignty made by the Parliament of Catalonia (not to be confused with the Catalan declaration of independence of October 2017). In a 2013 interview with Escritura P√∫blica, a Spanish magazine related to law and the legal profession, Sala spoke of his concern about the politicisation of the court, saying that \\"the necessary institutional respect has sometimes become unknown to politicians who criticise decisions they do not approve of that the Court takes, confounding legitimate criticism with discreting, and even sometimes with insult\\". == Politics == In an interview with RAC 1 in late 2018, speaking about the Catalan declaration of independence, Sala said \\"for me, it's very difficult - almost impossible - that there might exist a crime of rebellion, and very problematic, not to say also impossible, that there might exist one of sedition\\". == Awards == On 1 December 1995, Sala was awarded the Order of Constitutional Merit by the Council of Ministers. The next year, on 13 September 1996, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Raymond of Pe√±afort. On 5 December 2014, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Charles III. == Published works == * (Building law, 2001; ) * (Procedural administrative law, 2001; ) * (Jurisdiction and competency in the administrative judicial process: problems of definition of competencies in the new Law on Regulation of the Administrative Judicial Jurisdiction, 2002; ) == References == Category:Valencian people Category:Members of the General Council of the Judiciary Category:University of Valencia alumni Category:Spanish jurists Category:Spanish judges Category:Presidents of the Supreme Court of Spain ","title":"Pascual Sala"},{"id":"63860368","text":"Chantal Lynch (born 16 August 1993) is a Canadian-raised Guyanese former footballer who played as a defender.

She fought at the Battle of St. Lucia on 15 December 1778, where she was tasked to bombard the British battery on the Southern peninsula, along with the 32-gun Chim√®re. On 8 July, Sagittaire and Fantasque forced the frigate HMS Mermaid to beach herself at Cape Henhlopen. On 9 June 1779, Vengeur and Sagittaire, along with the frigates Chim√®re and Aimable, departed for Martinique under Brach as a distraction to cover Du Rumain's departure, who was sailing for his Capture of Saint Vincent with Lavely, Lys and four transports.

As one of the \\"Greens\\" (so called because of their uniforms which bore the green triangle identifying them as criminal prisoners) Brodniewicz was considered relentlessly brutal and is believed to have been responsible for the deaths of many fellow inmates. He decisively influenced the camp atmosphere in what was to become a reign of terror. Brodniewicz had illegally hidden gold and other valuables in his parlour, which the SS found after fellow inmate Otto K√ºsel (inmate No. 2) tipped them off.

He spent his early childhood in Ludwigshafen am Rhein before the family moved to Mannheim in 1908. His brother Lothar was born in 1909 (‚Ä† 1977 in the USA). After his father's death, the family moved back to Ludwigshafen in 1918. In 1920 he took his Abitur in Mannheim at the secondary school, then he studied law and political science, sociology and economics at the University of Heidelberg. He received his doctorate in 1924 from the Faculty of Philosophy, the topic of his dissertation: The average as statistical fiction. In 1928 he became director of the Mannheim Adult Education Center, which in a few years developed into one of the most important institutes of this kind in Germany. On August 14, 1930, he married Dr. Hedwig Strauss (1903-1944). Eppstein taught sociology at the University for the Science of Judaism in Berlin in the 1930s. In 1933 he published the paperback \\"The Symptoms in Business Cycle Research\\". In the same year he had to resign the management of the adult education center due to the rise of the Nazis. At the request of the board of the Reich Representation of German Jews in Berlin, he joined the latter, where he was mainly concerned with administrative issues and social tasks. After the November pogroms, Eppstein received an invitation from England to lecture in sociology, which he refused because he did not want to leave Germany. In the following period he was arrested several times by the Gestapo. From July 1939 he worked in the Reich Association of Jews in Germany and had to appear several times in the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA) in the so-called Eichmann department. In late summer 1941, as representative of the Reich Association, together with Josef L√∂wenherz from the Vienna Israelite Community, Adolf Eichmann in the presence of Rolf G√ºnther and Friedrich Suhr announced that in September 1941 all Jews in the Reich would be required to be labeled:Esriel Hildesheimer: J√ºdische Selbstverwaltung unter dem NS-Regime. Mohr Siebeck, 1994, , S. 204. As of September 19 the Star of David had to be worn by anyone who legally was considered a Jew. In January 1943, he was deported to the Theresienstadt ghetto with his wife and Leo Baeck, where he was elected to succeed Jakob Edelstein as leader. As such, he was forced, among other things, to prepare deportations to the extermination camps. On September 27 or 28, 1944, he was shot by SS men in the Little Fortress of Theresienstadt for alleged breaches of the law. His wife Hedwig was deported to Auschwitz on October 28, 1944, where she was also murdered. ==Literature== John F. Oppenheimer (editor) u. a .: Lexicon of Judaism. 2nd Edition.

Thomas Woltz became a named partner in 2004 and sole owner of the firm in 2013. Building upon the work of Byrd, who was Woltz's mentor and professor at the University of Virginia, the firm has expanded its focus over the past ten years to include restoring damaged ecological landscapes and developing projects that combine agriculture, ecological restoration, and cultural use. Today, NBW projects include public parks, academic institutions, botanical gardens, memorial landscapes, corporate campuses, and urban planning. The firm has worked in Mexico, Italy, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada, China, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. The firm guided the cultural and ecological revitalization of Memorial Park, a nearly 1,500-acre municipal park in Houston. The project incorporated the many disparate parts of the park‚Äôs program while supporting its overall ecology. At the Citygarden Sculpture Park, NBW transformed an unused plot within the 1.1-mile-long strip of open space called the Gateway Mall, located on one of downtown St. Louis‚Äôs busiest streets, into a series of meandering paths meant to evoke the nearby Mississippi River. The park features sculptural work from contemporary and modern artists. The park, which opened in July 2009 to coincide with the Major League Baseball‚Äôs All-Star Game to be held in the city that year, was conceived to be a ‚Äúsculpture garden, urban park, and urban garden‚Äù that took advantage of the existing change in elevation of the terrain to create distinct areas or bands containing trees, gardens, support and maintenance buildings, lawns, and water areas, with sculptures sited throughout. Another significant project is the Hudson Yards Plaza at the Hudson Yards development in New York City. Located within the largest private development in United States history, the plaza is formed by a series of elliptical forms that give shape to landscaped spaces. The attached public square has 28,000 plants and 225 trees, located on the platform upon which Hudson Yards is built, which is itself located on top of an active train yard. The plaza's southern side includes a canopy of trees, while the southeast entrance also contains a fountain. A \\"'seasonally expressive' entry garden\\" stands outside the entrance to the New York City Subway's 34th Street‚ÄìHudson Yards station. The plaza also connects to the High Line, an elevated promenade at its south end. ==Notable Projects== * Rothko Chapel Master Plan, Houston, Texas * Mt.

Set in the year 3126, the player commands a fleet of spaceships and engages in combat, trade, and exploration in a procedurally generated world. Reviewers praised the game on release and on every update, calling it a sort of \\"Mount & Blade: Warband in space\\". Fractal Softworks have continued to regularly update the game with new ships, weapons, and missions. ==Gameplay== Starsector is an open world single-player space combat role playing and exploration game, with a procedurally generated map. The player is able to interact with and join one of 7 factions, remain as an independent, or become a mercenary. At the start of the game, the player is given the option to choose their headshot and spawns in the world with a small fleet of ships. After an extremely short series of tutorial missions, the player is given complete freedom to do whatever they desire. Movement of your fleet in the game is controlled by your mouse, or can be set on autopilot. You can either travel freely through space or select a destination to travel to various colonies where you can purchase materials. During the game, one can hire crew members, purchase ships, and conduct trade. As of the 0.9 patch, you are able to establish your own colony and manage it yourself later in the game. Missions are offered as you fly through space or go to colonies, and will disappear soon after, as transmissions travel in real time. Completing these missions rewards you with credits which you can use to repair ships, purchase fuel, buy new ships, or hire officers. The game sports a real-time simulated economy on every colony, with an open market (subject to a tariff of 30 percent) as well as a black market, where one can purchase goods without a tariff, as well as various illegal materials such as recreational drugs, humans organs, and AI cores. All ships in the game are extremely customizable, and the player can equip different weapons, perks, and special abilities to every ship. ===Combat=== Combat occurs when one fleet intercepts another in space. The game interface then changes and the player is able to take control of a ship directly. The player is also able to control all other ships with basic commands such as \\"avoid\\" or \\"full retreat\\". Different weapons do more damage against different types of targets (shields, hulls, etc.). The game uses standard WASD movement, with the option to strafe using your mouse. A ship generates flux when it fires or takes damage, which has to be vented out into space through a process which leaves it momentarily defenceless, or face being rendered totally nonfunctional for a longer period. Victory provides the player an opportunity to loot the ships or add some to their fleet. Failure means they may attempt a full retreat. If they fail at the retreat and their fleet is destroyed, the player will not die but will escape and be given a minuscule fleet in order to start over again. Combat rewards players with experience, which they can use on their character to gain more skills. ==Plot== The game itself has minimal plot, and the player is involved in very few story moments. The player is instead intended to create their own story. Lead developer Alexander Mosolov has stated that the player is intended to uncover lore as they travel throughout the world. The game takes place in the year 3126, after humanity figured out faster-than-light travel using transport gates. For many years, this travel caused a sort of space golden age. However, exactly 206 cycles ago, all gates abruptly stopped functioning and humanity entered a Dark Ages of sorts. This event is referred to as \\"the collapse\\". 206 cycles after the collapse, our player enters the sector. In the sector, there are various different factions that have taken hold and reached a strategic stalemate, with no faction being able to win. These factions are: * The Hegemony, a martial state that believe that they are the true successor to the galaxy. In game, the hegemony are the largest faction with the most colonies. They use relatively low-class ships. * The Persean League, a faction whose sole purpose is to revolt against what they believe to be the illegitimate martial law enforced by the Hegemony. They use relatively mid-class ships and control many markets on various worlds. * The Tri-Tachyon are the remnants of the Tri- Tachyon corporation, one of the most powerful corporations in the sector before the collapse. They make and sell most of the technology found in game, and use high-class ships. * The Sindrian Diktat, a faction founded after a revolt against the Hegemony. They are considered by the system at large to be a military dictatorship. They primarily manufacture fuel. * The Luddic Church, also known as The Church of Galactic Redemption, is a faction inspired by a martyr named Ludd. They blame technology for the downfall of humanity and seek a return to a simpler time. The use simple, low-class ships. * The Luddic Path is an extreme sect of the Luddic church that claim to have a truer interpretation of Ludd's teachings. They believe that only through extreme violence will humanity return to a simpler age. The Luddic path is hostile to every faction except the Luddic Church and pirates. * Pirates are a loose faction of mercenaries, bandits, looters, and terrorists. Bounties are often put on pirate's heads, and collecting said bounties is one of the main ways to earn money. Pirates are hostile to every faction except the Luddic Path. ==Development== The game was made entirely by Fractal Softworks, led by indie developer Alexander Mosolov. The Alpha Version of Starsector was released on April 29, 2011 with six missions and a tutorial, as well as some basic modding tools. Starsector is written in Java using LWJGL, and has been receiving steady updates for nearly a decade. The game is currently available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. Though the game is not currently available on digital distribution platforms such as Steam, a release on those platforms is planned in the future, when the game is more \\"ready\\". ==Reception== Since the Alpha version of the game, the game has received critical acclaim, most notably from Rock, Paper, Shotgun, who said in 2012 that the game was \\"already top-notch stuff\\". ==References== Category:2011 video games Category:Video games set in outer space Category:Action-adventure games Category:Single- player video games ","title":"Starsector"},{"id":"63860638","text":"Kalanidhi or Kalanithi may refer to: *Kalanidhi Indira Sangeet Mahavidyalaya, a Nepal classical music school *Sangeetha Kalanidhi, an award given by the by the Madras Music Academy ==People with the surname== *A.

Despite the definition of being Cuban often being tied directly to Cuban nationality, many still consider themselves Cuban despite their loss of official Cuban nationality by birth or having never been born in Cuba at all. Being Cuban has been considered a mere national origin to a broader ethnicity. There are three main concepts that have been used to describe what is Cuban. Cubanidad is the whole general condition of being Cuban, Cubaneo is the condition of being Cuban based on the practice of customs and other cultural expressions considered to be Cuban, and Cuban√≠a is the condition of being Cuban based solely of off the personal want to be considered Cuban. Differing views exist on to what extent Cubanidad can be claimed and to what degrees it exists for those who do not reside in Cuba, usually based on that persons relationship to life and family in Cuba. Cuban culture and people were formed from a mixture of indigenous people, African slaves, and European migrants. Most often residing in Cuba meant defining oneself in relation to the foreign power that controlled Cuba, such as the Spanish Empire. The origins of a Cuban identity can be traced to the earliest debates about Cuban self-determination, and expanded more greatly with the Cuban independence movement. As more Cubans began emigrating during the Cuban exile the idea of Cuban identity began to expand to those outside Cuba and the idea of being Cuban took on a racialized definition. ==See also== * Cubans * Cuban culture ==References== Category:Ethnicity Category:National identity Category:Cuban people Category:Cuban culture ","title":"Cuban identity"},{"id":"63860687","text":"Sabri Kiraz (1918 ‚Äì 12 January 1985) was a Turkish football manager.

The cartoon, which first appeared in USA Today in December of 2009, around the time of the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference, depicts a conference presenter listing the many advantages of curbing climate change including \\"energy independence, preserving rainforests, sustainability, green jobs, livable cities, renewables, clean water/air, healthy children, etc., etc.,\\" only to have a climate change denier interject that if it were all a hoax, we'd create a \\"better world for nothing\\". Shortly after the conference was over, Pett got a request for a signed copy from former EPA administrator Lisa P. Jackson, who framed the comic and put it on her wall. Pett has repeatedly gotten requests from over 40 environmental groups, in the United States, Canada and Europe to use the cartoon in campaigns. The Australian Greens used it in a campaign which resulted in the Australian parliament adopting the most rigorous carbon tax regime of any country in the world. \\"I've drawn 7,000 cartoons in my life, but really only one,\\" Pett said. \\"It's an example of one of these ideas I had in my head for 10 years before I realized I hadn't cartooned it...I was thinking, you know, 'It doesn't matter if global warming were a hoax, if the scientists made it up, we still have to do all that shit.'\\" Pett said in a 2012 editorial that in the 27 months since its first publication, not a week had gone by where he didn't have a request to use the image. \\"I see hundreds of great comics, images, memes etc about climate change every year and still nothing has surpassed this,\\" wrote Jennifer Harrison, in a tweet that was retweeted over 50,000 times. \\"It's perfect.\\" ==References== Category:2009 works Category:Climate change and society Category:Individual printed cartoons Category:2009 in the environment ","title":"What if it's a big hoax and we create a better world for nothing?"},{"id":"63860891","text":"Antique's at-large congressional district, also known as Antique's lone district, is the sole congressional district of the Philippines in the province of Antique.

The leaves may be stalked or without stalks and vary considerably in size (40-120 mm by 8-20 mm). There are about 8-12 parallel leaf veins but no obvious midrib. The flowers occur in spikes and the calyx lobes are about 2 by 1.9 mm and have hairy margins. The stamen filaments are about 1.5 mm long with anthers about 0.6 by 0.2 mm. The ovary has 8-10 locules. The fruits are squashed globules (about 5-6 by 7-9 mm diameter), and the calyx persists at the base. This subspecies is found only in north-east Queensland and New Guinea. ===Leucopogon malayanus subsp. malayanus=== This subspecies is called Styphelia malayana var. malayana by Hermann Sleumer.

Her parents were James (1896‚Äì1981) and Kathleen Barry Moloney. She had two younger sisters other than her twin, and a brother. Her younger sister Katherine (1928‚Äì1989) went on to marry Patrick Kavanagh after a long relationship. Both sides of Moloney's family were involved in the Irish republican movements. Her paternal grandfather, Patrick James Moloney (1869‚Äì1947), was a pharmaceutical chemist and Sinn F√©in TD in Tipperary from 1919 to 1923, being re-elected in June 1922 as an anti-treaty candidate. Her father was an officer in the 2nd Southern Division and the 3rd Tipperary Brigade during the war of independence, serving with the anti-treaty IRA as director of communications. Her uncle, Con Moloney (1897/8‚Äì1951), was adjutant of the 2nd Southern Division serving under Ernie O'Malley and Liam Lynch. Moloney's mother was the older sister of Kevin Barry and was active in Cumann na mBan, the Gaelic League, and Sinn F√©in. She worked in the D√°il √âireann department of home affairs, and served as a judge of the republican courts. She toured America and Australia in the early 1920s raising money for the Irish republican cause and was the general secretary of the Irish Republican Prisoners' Dependants' Fund. Moloney's father was a chemist, and struggled to find work until he took a post with the Irish Sugar company in Carlow in 1934. ==Artistic career== One of Moloney's windows at the Archangel Saint Michael Church, Creeslough Moloney left school just before her 14th birthday, going on to studying drawing part-time at the National College of Art (NCA) with Art O'Murnaghan. She was awarded a series of bursaries and awards which allowed her to attend full-time to train as a painter, and she graduated in 1948. She lived in Paris for nine months where she studied life drawing at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re, Montparnasse. In 1952, she returned to Dublin and moved into a studio flat at 5 Waterloo Road, Ballsbridge, Dublin, where she would live for the rest of her life. She took a position teaching art part- time at Blackrock Technical School from 1952 to 1964. Having seen the stained glass of Sainte-Chapelle and Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, and then seeing the memorial exhibition of work by Evie Hone in 1958, Moloney took up stained glass as her medium. Moloney studied stained glass under John Murphy (1921‚Äì2006) at NCA from 1958 to 1961. She went on to work as an assistant to Patrick Pollen at his studio on the premises of An T√∫r Gloine from 1960 to 1962. In 1962, she was exhibited at the third Salzburg Biennale of Sacred Art, and she assisted Pollen with the large commission for stained glass windows at a new church designed by Liam McCormick, St Patrick's church, Lifford, County Donegal, in 1964. In 1964, having received a grant from the Arts Council, Moloney established her own studio where she worked full-time as a stained glass artist. She went on to work numerous times with McCormick on the Catholic churches he designed, completing 11 commissions for him. Her windows worked in keeping with the radical and modern architectural style of these buildings, using semi-abstract designs in strong primary colours against his white surfaces. Moloney was one of a group of craftspeople and artists McCormick assembled, including John Behan, Ruth Brandt, Ray Carroll, Ois√≠n Kelly, Patrick McElroy, Patrick Pye, Veronica Rowe, and Imogen Stuart. Her first independent commission was on a McCormick church, Star of the Sea, Desertegney, County Donegal in 1964. The 1967 Church of St Aengus, Burt, County Donegal by McCormick featuring her work is one of the most famous, and was awarded the gold medal from the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland for the period 1965‚Äì1967. The RIAI noted \\"the loving care that has been lavished on it by architect, builder, client, artists, craftsmen\\". The church was named Irish building of the twentieth century in 2000 by the RIAI based on a public and RIAI members' vote. In 1977, Moloney was commissioned to work on a non-catholic church, Donoughmore Presbyterian church, Liscooley, County Donegal, creating the windows and designing a reredos hanging depicting the burning bush. Other architects she worked with were Richard Hurley, Philip Shaffrey and Andrew Devane.

It ran from the city wall (Altenwall} to Sielwall (today's Deichstra√üe to Siel am Dobben). Originally called the Sieldeich, the Punkendeich was incorporated into the larger Osterdeich in 1850. A road and houses were built along the top of the dike, the road later becoming part of the Osterdeich trunk road. ==Etymology== Punke is an obsolete German word for prostitute that was used in Bremen and the surrounding areas. The name probably dates from the Seven Years' War (1756-1763), when the soldiers' prostitutes - the so-called Punken - were not tolerated within Bremen itself and set up on the dike outside the city wall. An alternative origin was proposed by Harro Koebnick of the Hal √∂ver ferry company. In Low German the words for barge and prostitute are similar, and that Punkendeich takes its name not from the prostitutes but the barges that ran from the dike as a ferry across the river. ==Ferry== A ferry across Weser river used to run from the Punkendeich. Later it ran from the nearby Sielwall. The Bremen passenger shipping company Hal √∂ver, which operates the ferry across the Weser, christened one of its passenger ships the \\"Punke\\" in 1990 as a memory of the Punkendeich and the prostitutes that frequented it. ==Bremer Eiswette== Every year on 6 January, the Bremer Eiswette (Bremen Ice Bet), a local folk festival whose history dates back to 1829, takes place on the former Punkendeich. The custom originated in the winter of 1828, 18 Bremen merchants had a bet as to whether the Weser would be ice-free on Epiphany (6 January). The sooner the ice cleared enough to allow the passage of ships, the sooner the merchants could earn money again. A \\"skinny little tailor\\" had to cross the river carrying a glowing iron as a test of the river being completely iced-over. The losers of the bet would have to pay for a meal for all concerned on 17 January. Originally the meal was one of cabbage, but today is a banquet for 700 including guests of honour. Most of the previous German Presidents and Chancellors have been guests of honour at the meal. A collection during the meal goes to the German Society for the Rescue of Castaway (DGzRS), who have a rescue boat on hand to assist the tailor crossing the river during the ice bet. In recent years the collection has exceeded 400,000 euros. The meal was traditionally only for men. Although public opinion wanted women to be allowed to attend the meal in 2013, this was resisted. Following pressure from the Senate, women attended in 2020. The current format of the celebrations dates back to 1928 when the centenary of the ice bet was being planned. The tailor, who has a pointed beard and is dressed in an old tailcoat, must weigh 99 pounds. The \\"President of the Ice Bet\\", assisted by Novices and Pages, oversees proceedings, and the Notarius publicus, complete with legal wig, ensures fair play. The Medicus publicus is carried by the Three wise Men to check that the tailor's iron is hot. (In Western Christianity tradition, Epiphany is the time of the visit of the Magi). At 12 noon, the tailor attempts the crossing. The Weser hasn't been completely frozen over since 1946. ==References== ==External links== (in German) Category:Bremen (city) Category:Red-light districts in Germany ","title":"Punkendeich"},{"id":"63861219","text":"Plaque commemorating Anna Maria Hinel on the building at Florianska Street 8, in Warsaw in Poland Anna Maria Hinel, (; born 31 January 1924 in Warsaw, died on March 19, 1943 in Auschwitz-Birkenau), Polish girl scout, activist of the underground independence movement during World War II, author of a diary from the German Nazi occupation.., auschwitz.org == Early life == Anna Maria Hinel was born on January 31, 1924 in Warsaw, in Poland.

Judd and her Daughter Juliet Isabel', oil on canvas painting by James Gay Sawkins, 1850, Mission Houses Museum (Honolulu) Laura Fish Judd (April 2, 1804October 2, 1872) was an American missionary, teacher and historian noted for her works on the Kingdom of Hawaii. She was also the wife of Gerrit P. Judd, an American missionary who was appointed advisor and minister of finance to King Kamehameha III. == Biography == Judd was born to a family of seven on April 2, 1804 in Plainfield, New York. She grew up in poverty after her mother's premature death. Her father also suffered an accident that left him crippled. Judd had to stay among relatives' households and village schools until she started teaching at age 16. She continued to work in this capacity to raise money to fund her education at Clinton Female Seminary in Oneida County, New York. Judd became a Protestant missionary when she was nineteen and was involved in missionary work in Mexico, New York. Later, she enlisted in a foreign mission to the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii) in the North Pacific Ocean. Judd married Gerritt Judd on September 20, 1827. The couple had nine children. She died on October 2, 1872, in Honolulu. == Career == Weeks after their marriage, Judd and her husband and other missionaries sailed on the ship Parthian, departing from Boston on November 3, 1827, and landing on Oahu on March 30, 1828. They were part of the third company of missionaries sent by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) to evangelize the Hawaiian Islands. An account stated that she learned the local language quickly and assisted her husband as he practiced medicine, preached as a missionary, and taught young students. Judd developed a strong relationship with Queen Ka ªahumanu, the widow of King Kamehameha I, who asked Judd to live with her and teach her how to make western dresses. She wrote how \\"Kaahumanu treated us [the missionary wives] like pet children\\" and \\"could dandle any of us in her lap, as she would a little child, which she often takes the liberty of doing\\". In 1832, she and other missionary wives created the first school for Native Hawaiian children. Previously, only the adult population had been educated. Judd started writing about Hawaii and her missionary work. When her husband retired as minister, for instance, she published his accomplishments in Honolulu... from 1828 to 1861 (1880). Judd also recorded an account of Queen Kalama and her marriage to King Kamehameha III in 1837. Her work also included observations on Hawaiian culture such as her descriptions of Hawaiian dining etiquette and cuisine. == References == ==External links== * Category:1804 births Category:1872 deaths Category:People from Plainfield, New York Category:American women historians Category:American women educators Category:American Congregationalist missionaries Category:Writers from Hawaii Category:Writers from New York (state) Category:Burials at Oahu Cemetery Category:Educators from Hawaii Category:Congregationalist missionaries in Hawaii Category:American emigrants to the Hawaiian Kingdom Category:People from Honolulu Category:Judd family ","title":"Laura Fish Judd"},{"id":"63861561","text":"Christopher Richard John Hawke RCOG (born 12 April 1934) is an English former physician and first-class cricketer.

She was the leader of five examination boards in the United Kingdom before becoming the first head of exams regulator Ofqual. ==Early life== Kathleen Tattersall was born in Burnley on 11 April 1942, the only child of Ellen Tattersall (n√©e Mason) and Tom Tattersall. She studied at the University of Manchester, gaining a bachelor's degree in 1963, Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) in 1964 and, later, a Master of Education degree in 1975. ==Teaching career== Upon completing her PGCE, Tattersall spent the next seven-and-a-half years as a teacher, working in three different types of school from the mid-1960s to early 1970s. She began as a history teacher at Paddock House Convent Grammar School in Oswaldtwistle. Wishing to escape 'the oppressive nature of the examinations system', she moved to St. Augustine's Junior School in Burnley. This move was short-lived, as Tattersall found working at a primary school exposed 'all [her] faults and limitations as a teacher'. She returned to secondary education, becoming head of history at St Hilda's Roman Catholic Girls' High School, a comprehensive school, also in Burnley. It was at this school that Tattersall first taught for Certificate of Secondary Education (CSE) exams, as well as O Level and A Level. ==Exam boards administrator== Despite having no experience as an examiner, Tattersall successfully applied to be an assistant secretary (manager) at the Associated Lancashire Schools Examining Board (ALSEB), the smallest of England's 13 regional CSE examination boards, beginning employment in 1972. She worked her way up to deputy secretary before becoming secretary (leader) of the ALSEB in 1982. Tattersall jumped directly from the smallest CSE board to the largest when she became head of the neighbouring North West Regional Examinations Board (NWREB) in 1985. The same year, the NWREB entered into a consortium with the ALSEB and three other local exam boards, forming the Northern Examining Association (NEA) to offer the new General Certificate of Secondary Education qualification, which replaced the O Level and CSE from 1988. In 1990, Tattersall moved to become leader of the oldest member of the NEA, the Joint Matriculation Board (JMB). As well as providing GCSEs through the NEA, the JMB also offered A Levels independently. The JMB merged with the other four members of the NEA ‚Äì the ALSEB, the NWREB, the North Regional Examinations Board and Yorkshire and Humberside Regional Examinations Board ‚Äì in 1992, creating the Northern Examinations and Assessment Board (NEAB). The merged organised appointed Tattersall as its chief executive. While Tattersall led NEAB, it grew to be the biggest provider of GCSEs across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. By the late 1990s, Government policy was to reduce the number of exam boards in the UK, replacing them with larger awarding bodies offering vocational, as well as academic, qualifications. Thus, in 1997, Tattersall led NEAB into a federation with AEB/SEG (an academic exam board) and City & Guilds (a vocational qualifications provider) called the Assessment and Qualifications Alliance (AQA). AQA, the UK's largest awarding body, appointed Tattersall as its first director general in 1998. She continued this role when NEAB and AEB/SEG (but not City & Guilds) formally merged under the AQA name in 2000. During her time at AQA, Tattersall was also chair of the Joint Council for General Qualifications, an umbrella group representing all British exam boards. In this role, Tattersall sought to ensure that examiners' professional judgements, rather than statistics, were used to award grades when revised A Level exams were introduced in 2002. Tattersall retired from AQA in 2003, the same year she was awarded an OBE for services to education. She soon came out of retirement, however, to become chair of the Chartered Institute of Educational Assessors, a professional body for examiners, in 2005. ==Chief regulator== In 2008, Tattersall was appointed the inaugural chair and chief regulator of Ofqual, the new exams 'watchdog'. Initially, Ofqual operated as part of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority in London, but moved to Coventry and became a non-ministerial government department in 2010, still led by Tattersall. At Ofqual, Tattersall was open about the difficulties of comparing exam results over time and urged better communication between exams authorities and the general public. Tattersall resigned from Ofqual with immediate effect in July 2010, two months after the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government came to power. In her resignation letter, Tattersall stated it was 'clear that the Government is bringing a fresh perspective to public policy, in education as in other areas' and it was 'in the best interests both of Government and of the education sector for Ofqual to have a new chair'. ==Later life== Tattersall was critical of exam reforms under Secretary of State for Education Michael Gove in the early 2010s. In response to Gove's later-aborted plans to scrap GCSEs and replace them with a new qualification only accessible to higher ability students, she said: > No one who is responsible for the education of young people should be proud > to introduce a system which will result in a greater number of students > leaving school with no qualifications. Education is about encouraging > success and the raising of aspirations, not the writing off of a generation, > which is what this new, untried, untested policy, based on prejudice and > untruths, will bring about. In November 2012, Tattersall became president of the Association for Educational Assessment‚ÄìEurope. Tattersall died of stomach cancer in Aughton, Lancashire on 23 January 2013, aged 70. She was survived by her partner, Geraldine Boocock. ==References== Category:1942 births Category:2013 deaths Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire Category:Alumni of the Victoria University of Manchester Category:LGBT people from England ","title":"Kathleen Tattersall"},{"id":"63861672","text":"The 1991 Football Championship of the Belarusian SSR () was the 55th and last regular annual competition in football of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic at all-republican level.

It tells the deeply connected stories of three people against the backdrop of the complex history of the United Kingdom and Jamaica. It premiered at the National Theatre in 2019 to critical acclaim. ==Synopsis== Hortense yearns for a new life away from rural Jamaica, Gilbert dreams of becoming a lawyer, and Queenie longs to escape her Lincolnshire roots. In these three intimately connected stories, hope and humanity meet stubborn reality, tracing the tangled history of Jamaica and Britain. ==Productions== Small Island premiered in the Olivier Theatre at the National Theatre, London in 2019. Previews began on 17 April, with an official opening on 1 May, and the production ran until 10 August. The production was directed by Rufus Norris. As well as selling out its run at the National Theatre, it was broadcast to cinemas as part of National Theatre Live on 30 May 2019. Andrea Levy, who wrote the novel on which the play is based, died in February 2019, just a few months before the play premiered. The playwright, Helen Edmundson, called working with Levy 'a joy and a privilege', saying: > Like her books, she was uncompromising and funny, wise and honest. There was > nothing I couldn‚Äôt ask her, and always something we could laugh about. > Although we sometimes fantasised about miracles, we knew it was very > unlikely that she would ever see the play. Her support for the script I > arrived at meant everything. I once told her that adapting Small Island was > as complex and important as adapting War and Peace. She loved that. She was, > and is, one of the greats. Following the success of the 2019 run, the production is scheduled to return to the Olivier Theatre from 28 October 2020 to 9 January 2021, again directed by Rufus Norris. The NT Live recording will also be streamed on YouTube as part of the National Theatre at Home programme during the COVID-19 pandemic from 18 to 25 June 2020. ==Critical reception== Small Island received critical acclaim. Michael Billington of The Guardian praised Helen Edmundson's 'remarkable adaptation' and the play's 'willingness to confront racism', giving it five stars and calling it one of the top two theatre shows of 2019 and 'one of the most important' plays of the year. Kate Kellaway of The Observer gave the play five stars, praising Edmundson's 'virtuoso' adaptation. Claire Allfree of the Metro also gave the play five stars, praising it as 'accessible and excellent'. Ann Treneman of The Times gave the production four stars, praising the 'immediacy' of the adaptation. Matt Wolf of The New York Times and The Arts Desk described the production as the 'complete theatrical experience', and praised the play as 'Sweeping when needed but also touchingly intimate'. Andrzej Lukowski of Time Out gave the production four stars, praising Edmundson's 'supreme work'. Sarah Crompton of What's On Stage gave the 'all-encompassing and absorbing production' four stars. Marianka Swain of BroadwayWorld gave the production four stars, praising Edmundson's 'fleet- footed' adaptation. Mark Shenton of LondonTheatre.co.uk gave the production four stars, writing that it was 'big, bold, poignant and powerful storytelling theatre. It has a grand epic sweep but also a surprising intimacy on the vast Olivier stage that made a vocal, refreshingly diverse audience really respond to it'. ==Publishing== The play is published by Nick Hern Books. == References == Category:Helen Edmundson Category:2019 plays Category:Plays based on novels Category:British plays ","title":"Small Island (play)"},{"id":"63861727","text":"Thomas Dixon Savill (7 September 1855 ‚Äì 10 January 1910) was a British physician and writer. ==Biography== Savill was born in Kensington.

In 1885 he was appointed medical superintendent of the Paddington Infirmary. He was president of the Infirmary Medical Superintendents' Society, and was recognised as an authority on many of the questions raised in both the majority and minority reports of the Poor Law Commission in 1909. Much of his medical experience as medical superintendent was embodied in his chief work, A System of Clinical Medicine (2 vols. 1903‚Äì5). Savill also made a reputation as a dermatologist, and was appointed in 1897 physician to St. John's Hospital for Diseases of the Skin. Meanwhile, he had retired in 1892 from Paddington Infirmary to become a consulting physician, mainly with a view to pursuing his study of neurology. He was soon appointed physician to the West End Hospital for Diseases of the Nervous System. In 1899 he brought out a course of clinical lectures upon Neurasthenia (originally delivered at the Paddington Infirmary and the West End Hospital). The book showed Savill to be an original thinker and clear expositor. He married in 1901 Dr. Agnes Forbes Blackadder, then assistant and later full physician to St. John's Hospital for Diseases of the Skin. She aided her husband in his book on Clinical Medicine. Besides the works mentioned, Savill contributed, mainly to The Lancet (1888-1909), many papers upon neurological and dermatological subjects. Another valuable piece of work was the Report on the Warrington Small-Pox Outbreak, 1892-3. ==Death== Savill died at Algiers on 10 January 1910 from a fracture of the base of the skull caused by a fall from his horse. ==Selected publications== *Clinical Lectures on Neurasthenia (1906) *A System of Clinical Medicine (1909) ==References== * Category:1855 births Category:1910 deaths Category:19th-century British medical doctors Category:British dermatologists Category:People from Kensington ","title":"Thomas Dixon Savill"},{"id":"63861807","text":"Kim Se-hee (born 28 November 1995) is a female South Korean modern pentathlete.

Founded in 1992, XAIU sits on 1.26 square kilometers of land. The university has about 20,000 students and 1,700 faculty and staff. XAIU includes 8 colleges offering 67 major fields of study, which cover Management, Economics, Humanities, Medicine, Engineering, Agriculture, and Arts. Over nearly 30 years of development, Xi'an International University has grown into a multi-discipline comprehensive university. As of 2020, XAIU has more than 200,000 alumni. ==History== Founded in 1992, Xi'an International University was originally a service training college (original name: Ë•øÂÆâÂ§ñ‰∫ãÊúçÂä°ÂüπËÆ≠Â≠¶Èô¢). In 1996, with the approval of the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education, the college became one of the first private academic institutions in Shaanxi province to award diplomas through examination. In May 2000, with the approval of the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government, XAIU became a vocational college. In March 2005, with the approval of China's Ministry of Education, XAIU became an undergraduate college and was officially renamed Xi'an International University (Chinese: Ë•øÂÆâÂ§ñ‰∫ãÂ≠¶Èô¢). Successfully adapting to its new role, in June 2009 (4 years after the first students enrolled in the first undergraduate programs), Xi'an International University was granted the right to award bachelor's degrees. In May 2009, XAIU also established the College of Entrepreneurship (Chinese: Âàõ‰∏öÂ≠¶Èô¢), the first entrepreneurship college established by a private university in China. In 2010, the university established a training platform for students to obtain a 'Master's degree in Business Administration and Entrepreneurship'. In 2014, XAIU established the 'Qi Fang Academy of Classical Learning'. The academy teaches a combination of theory and practice with Chinese characteristics (‚ÄòCollege + Academy‚Äô-system). It offers moral education, postgraduate education, and liberal arts education. Qi Fang Academy collaborates with various party groups, associations, campus culture, career planning, etc. to further promote student self-management. In 2017, Xi'an International University opened a new sports center, covering an area of more than 50,000 square meters, making it one of the largest multipurpose sports venues in Northwest China. On January 6, 2020, XAIU established Laozi Academy to provide traditional Chinese culture. Laozi Academy is the first traditional cultural education academy in a second-level college named after Laozi. The academy has seven departments: the Department of Chinese Studies, the Department of Chinese Painting, the Department of Chinese Music, the Department of Calligraphy, the Department of Wushu (Kungfu), the Department of Tea Art, and the Department of Chess Art. ==Campus culture== === Values=== { class=\\" collapsible\\" ! ! Values -   -   -   -   - } ===Motto=== The university motto ÂåñÈ±ºÊàêÈæô (English: the fish that evolves into a dragon), is the spirit of the campus culture. Legend has that in the university's Yuhua Lake, a fish turned into a dragon. ===Legend=== XAIU is located in Yuhuazhai (Yuhua Village), in Xi'an's Yanta District. According to legends, it is the place where Princess Yuhua, daughter of King Wu of the Zhou Dynasty, built a stage to offer sacrifices to Heaven (The remains from the Yangshao Civilization, around 5000 ‚Äì 3000 B.C.). This stage was found during the construction of the campus and a beautiful park was built around that platform. In the Tang Dynasty (618 ‚Äì 907 A.D.), this area was the auspicious place where imperial examination candidates prayed for good luck, hoping that they could be someone useful to society, in other words, \\"to become a dragon\\". After that, people changed the name Yuhua Èõ®Ëä± (English: the flower in rain) into Yuhua È±ºÂåñ (English: the fish evolves). Since then, it is said that whoever comes to this land will achieve their goals and fulfill their aspirations. ==International education== XAIU was among the first private universities to deliver international cooperation education and foreign student education in Shaanxi Province. It is cooperating with more than 100 universities around the world and has joint educational programs with the US, Canada, UK, France, Korea, Japan, etc. and has educated over 2,000 international students (mainly for Chinese language learning). XAIU is also one of the initiators of the Association for Global Advancement of Universities and Colleges (AGAUC). ==Academic research== ===Overview=== XAIU conducts applied researches into the fields of private education development, teaching reforms, academic quality and local economic development. Since 2016, the University has been in the lead among Chinese private universities regarding a number of projects, with mentions from government departments at provincial, ministerial and national levels, and papers published in SCI, SSCI, EI, etc. XAIU is ranked top 15 in the number of patents filed by universities in Shaanxi province.

It stars John-Paul Howard, Piper Curda, Zarah Mahler, Kevin Bigley, Gabriela Quezada Bloomgarden, Richard Ellis, Blane Crockarell, Jamison Jones, and Azie Tesfai. The film follows a defiant teenage boy who faces off with an evil witch, who is posing as the neighbor next door. The Wretched had its world premiere at the Fantasia International Film Festival on July 19, 2019, and was released in drive-in theaters and through Premium VOD on May 1, 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic limiting the amount of films in theaters, The Wretched became the first film since Avatar (2009) to top the box office for six consecutive weekends. == Plot == In 1985, Megan arrives at the home of the Gambels to babysit their daughter Ashley. In the basement, she finds an inhuman creature feeding off little Ashley. Terrified, she tries to escape, but Mr. Gambel purposely shuts the door on her. A strange sign is shown on the door. In the present, Ben Shaw comes to live with his father Liam as his parents are in the middle of a divorce. Liam gives Ben a job working at the marina, where he befriends Mallory. He notices Liam kissing a co-worker named Sara. In the woods, Dillon, the son of Liam's neighbor Abbie, finds a tree with the same symbol seen at the Gambel house. He hears what sounds like Abbie's voice coming from the tree, calling to him before Abbie appears. They bring a buck home that they hit, and later that night, something crawls out of the buck's corpse. Ben investigates strange noises he hears on the roof. He follows the sounds to Abbie's house, but all he finds is an animal. He catches a glimpse of a witch on the porch, but cannot be sure what he saw due to Abbie's husband Ty turning on the porch light. Ben befriends Dillon and makes him promise to tell him if he sees anything strange around his house. That night, Abbie goes to check on her infant son Sam (Dillon‚Äôs younger brother) in his crib. However, she finds that he disappeared and replaced by a bundle of sticks. She is then attacked by the witch. Ben later notices Abbie walking into the forest with a child. Ben returns home one night to find Dillon hiding in his house, claiming that there is something wrong with his mother. Abbie comes looking for Dillon, threatening Ben and attempting to get into the house. Ty comes and takes Dillon home. Dillon tells Ty that Abbie is acting weird, but Ty dismisses his concerns. Ben is also concerned that something strange is happening with Abbie. At work, Ben learns that Dillon never showed up for his sailing lesson. When he goes to Dillon's house, Ty denies that he has a son. Later, Abbie whispers something demonic to Ty that makes his ears bleed. She then takes a shower and her body starts to decay. Ben is suspicious and reads about a witch that is known for possessing people and \\"feeding on the forgotten\\". He confides in Mallory, but she does not take him seriously. She slips a taunting note under Abbie's door. Ben sneaks into Abbie's cellar and finds a picture of the family with Ty's face scratched out, along with a picture of Mallory and her sister Lily. He realizes that the witch is after Lily next. He calls Mallory to warn her that Lily is in danger, but Mallory does not remember her sister. Ben rushes to save Lily, but is too late, as the witch has pulled her into her tree. He is knocked out after hitting his head on a rock. Upon returning home, he finds that Liam has called the police due to Ben being missing. Ben attempts to explain what is happening with the neighbors, but is accused of being on drugs. Ben confides in Sara but notices flowers decaying, and realizes she is possessed by the witch. When she tries to attack, he slashes her arm, but the witch makes it look like he attacked Sara for no reason. He is taken into custody. Ben sees Sara whispering in the officer's ear. He tells Liam that Sara is possessed and pleads with him to check the neighbors' cellar. Instead of taking Ben to the station, the officer attempts to drown him at the beach until a dog attacks. The officer shoots the dog and then himself as he realizes that something is controlling him to kill Ben. Meanwhile, Liam finds the dead bodies of Ty and Abbie at their house. Sara attacks Liam and is nearly about to kill him, but Ben arrives and shoots her with the officer's gun. The witch crawls out of Sara's corpse and goes after Ben, but he takes Liam to safety as their house burns down. As a picture of Ben and his family burns, Ben suddenly remembers that he has a little brother, Nathan, implying the witch had made Ben forget about him. Ben and Mallory go to the tree to rescue their siblings. As Ben rescues Nathan and Lily, Liam arrives and rams his car into the witch. Afterwards, Ben and Nathan are leaving to return to their mother's house. Liam says he will stay with his brother while he heals from the witch's attack. Ben and Mallory kiss goodbye, and she puts a flower in his hair before leaving to give sailing lessons. Ben notices the flower is fake, revealing that the witch is alive and now possessing Mallory, who is alone with three children. == Cast == * John-Paul Howard as Ben Shaw * Piper Curda as Mallory * Jamison Jones as Liam Shaw * Azie Tesfai as Sara * Zarah Mahler as Abbie * Kevin Bigley as Ty * Gabriela Quezada Bloomgarden as JJ * Richard Ellis as Gage * Blane Crockarell as Dillon * Judah Abner Paul as Nathan Shaw * Ja'layah Washington as Lily * Amy Waller as Nora * Ross Kidder as Officer Guthrie * Kasey Bell as Officer Kopitar * Sydne Mikelle as Megan * Tug Cocker as Mr. Gambel * Madelynn Stuenkel as The Wretch * Owen Thomas Pierce as Baby Sam * Kenzie Jones as Ashley Gambel * Ryan Alexander Holmes as Adam * Pamela Gray as Counselor Rutland ==Production== Filming took place around Omena and Northport, Michigan, near the Pierces' hometown.https://www.thecinemaholic.com/the-wretched-filming-locations/ Composer, and childhood friend of the Pierce Brothers, Devin Burrows composed the film's score. According to Burrows in a 2020 Nightmare on Film Street interview, he visited the film's shooting locations prior to principal photography, to work the natural influence and inspiration into the music. The trio also worked together on the Pierce Brothers' 2011 film Deadheads. ==Release== The film premiered at the Fantasia International Film Festival on July 19, 2019. It also screened at the Traverse City Film Festival. It was released in selected theaters (mainly drive-ins), and through Premium VOD in the United States on May 1, 2020. The film was released in cinemas in the Netherlands on June 25, 2020. ==Reception== ===Box office=== The Wretched grossed $1.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $2.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $4 million. Due to limited theater exposure and few films playing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, The Wretched was #1 at the box office in its opening weekend, earning $65,908 from 12 theaters. The film finished first again the following weekend with $69,608 at 19 theaters, for a 10-day running total of $165,294. The film remained in first the following four weekends, making $91,975 from 21 drive-in theaters in its third, $215,836 from 59 in its fourth, and $181,000 from 75 in its fifth. It became the first film to top the box office five weekends in a row since Black Panther, which opened in February 2018, although it was noted that Trolls World Tour would have likely come in first over the course of its release had its weekly grosses been made public. The film then made $207,212 from 99 theaters and crossed the $1 million mark, topping newcomer Becky by $1,415 to remain in first for the sixth straight weekend (the first film since Avatar in 2009 to do so). It was finally dethroned in its seventh weekend, finishing third, behind Becky and Infamous with $148,583. ===Critical response=== On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 75% based on 102 reviews, with an average rating of 6.27/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \\"The Wretched stirs up a savory blend of witch-in-the-woods horror ingredients that should leave genre fans hungry for a second helping from writer-directors Brett and Drew T. Pierce.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times gave the film a largely positive review, writing, \\"Blessed with shivery setups and freaky effects‚Äîhere, skin-crawling is literal‚ÄîThe Wretched transforms common familial anxieties into flesh, albeit crepey and creeping.\\" Geoff Berkshire of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"What the Pierce brothers lack in flavorful storytelling or compelling characters, they almost entirely make up for in good old-fashioned atmosphere and suspense. The Wretched rarely surprises, but it's well-crafted enough to get under your skin anyway, with an able assist from the creepy camerawork of cinematographer Conor Murphy and unsettling score by Devin Burrows.\\" Writing for RogerEbert.com, Simon Abrams gave the film 1.5 out of 4 stars, saying that \\"unlike Stranger Things, The Wretched is a little too cute about teen angst, and not light enough on its feet to make you want to root for its ostensibly typical adolescent.\\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:2019 films Category:2019 horror films Category:2019 independent films Category:2010s supernatural horror films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:American supernatural horror films Category:Films about spirit possession Category:Films about witchcraft Category:Films shot in Michigan Category:IFC Films films ","title":"The Wretched (film)"},{"id":"63861863","text":"Ilija Barjaktaroviƒá (Paraƒáin, circa 1771 - Svilajnac, spring 1828) was a Serbian voivode and participant in the First Serbian Uprising.

The 1991 mass protests against Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá regime which have continued throughout the wars reinforced young people's antiwar orientation. The demonstrations in Belgrade were held mostly because of opposition the Battle of Vukovar, Siege of Dubrovnik and Siege of Sarajevo,≈Ωenski sud, 2013 while protesters demanded the referendum on a declaration of war and disruption of military conscription. More than 50,000 people participated in many protests, and more than 150,000 people took part in the most massive protest called ‚ÄúThe Black Ribbon March‚Äù in solidarity with people in Sarajevo. It is estimated that between 50,000 and 200,000 people deserted from the Yugoslav People's Army, while between 100,000 and 150,000 people emigrated from Serbia refusing to participate in the war. According to professor Renaud De la Brosse, senior lecturer at the University of Reims and a witness called by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), it is surprising how great the resistance to Milo≈°eviƒá's propaganda was among Serbs, given that and the lack of access to alternative news. A month after the Battle of Vukovar, opinion polls found that 64% of Serbian people wanted to end the war immediately and only 27% were willing for it to continue. Political scientists Orli Fridman described that not enough attention was given to anti-war activism among scholars studying the breakup of Yugoslavia and the wars, as well as that independent media and anti-war groups from Serbia did not attract the international attention. ==The main participants== The most famous associations and NGOs who marked the anti-war ideas and movements in Serbia were the Center for Antiwar Action, Women in Black, Humanitarian Law Center and Belgrade Circle. The Rimtutituki was a rock supergroup featuring Ekatarina Velika, Elektriƒçni Orgazam and Partibrejkers members, which was formed at the petition signing against mobilization in Belgrade. The band organized a concert on the Republic Square and also they performed anti-war songs in an open truck while circulating the Belgrade streets. The most prominent politician who supported protests was Ivan Stamboliƒá. The Democratic Party, People's Peasant Party, Serbian Liberal Party and Reform Party of Serbia took part in the ‚ÄúThe Black Ribbon March‚Äù.≈Ωenski sud, 2013 The famous architect Bogdan Bogdanoviƒá was one of the most prominent anti-war dissident. The Belgrade citizens who protested against the Siege of Dubrovnik were joined by prominent artists, composers and actors such as Mirjana Karanoviƒá and Rade ≈†erbed≈æija, who sang jointly ‚ÄúNeƒáu protiv druga svog‚Äù (‚ÄúI can‚Äôt go against my friend‚Äù). Independent media in Serbia reported on anti-war activities with much difficulty, in contrast to Milo≈°eviƒá's propaganda, which was aimed at reviving ethnonational sentiments and mobilizing people. An important role in media coverage was played by the independent electronic media B92 and Studio B. One of the more famous scenes during the anti-war protests was a tank parked in front of the Parliament Building, which was returned from the battlefield in Vukovar by soldier Vladimir ≈Ωivkoviƒá. ==See also== * 1992 anti-war protests in Sarajevo * Concert Yutel for Peace ==References== ;Books * * * ;Journal articles and documents * * Category:1991 in Serbia Category:1991 protests Category:1992 protests Category:1990s in Belgrade Category:Yugoslav Wars Category:Breakup of Yugoslavia Category:Protests in Serbia Category:Events in Belgrade Category:Anti-war Category:Pacifism ","title":"1991‚Äì1992 anti-war protests in Belgrade"},{"id":"63862257","text":"Douglas Charles \\"Doug\\" Rees (born 1952) is an American biochemist, biophysicist, and structural biologist.

The Monterey Peninsula Regional Park District (MPRPD) manages the Garland Ranch Regional Park. ==History== The Rumsen Indian tribe lived in the lower Carmel River Valley and neighboring Monterey Peninsula at the time of Spanish colonization. In 1923, Marion Hollins bought 2,000 acres from the Del Monte Properties that held property in Carmel Valley. In 1926, developer Frank Porter acquired a portion of the Hollins ranch and sold it to Byington Ford. Byington used 400-acres as a summer ranch and named it Moon Trail Ranch. The ranch was later sold to William May Garland II around 1970, who also bought other ranches in the area. The ranch was located off Carmel Valley Road and extended across the Carmel River up to the hayfield called \\"La Mesa\\". This area is now just off Via Las Encinas road, which is now one of the trailheads, on the Garland Ranch Regional Park, called the Via Las Encinas trailhead. On June 19, 1976, the Monterey Peninsula Regional Park District opened the 541-acre Garland Ranch Regional Park, 18 miles from Salinas at the south side of Carmel Valley Road on a one-half mile of the Carmel River. The park district acquired the Garland ranch in March 1975 from the late William May Garland II for $1.1 million, along with a $250,00 gift from Garland. After Garland died on May 10, 1975, the park district named the park after him. ==Habitat and conservation== Garland Ranch Regional Park; Mesa Trail Several ecosystems exist in the park and preserve. Garland Ranch Regional Park is home to native species such as deer, mountain lion and bobcat. Visitors are warned of the presence of the animals with signs at the entrance to the park and at the Visitor Center. Along with deer, other commonly seen animals are California quail, cottontail rabbits, crows, hawks, jays, lizards, squirrels, turkeys, voles, white tailed kites, woodpeckers. ==Recreation== The of hiking and riding trails in Garland Ranch Regional Park are very popular with riders, hikers, and joggers. One trail leads past a waterfall, and another is a 800-foot high \\"Inspiration Point\\" overlooking the valley. The Carmel river is a fun area for families. The park contains various hikes such as the La Mesa Trail which leads to the high grassland area. Other trails provide shorter easier loops. The park has beautiful views of Carmel Valley and interesting vegetation, with dense oaks woodlands, and canyons. Within the Park, equestrians are allowed. Almost all miles of trails in the Open Space Preserve are open equestrians.

According to legend, the Silvii were the royal dynasty of Alba Longa, Rome's mother city, and presumably came to Rome when that city was destroyed by Tullus Hostilius in the seventh century BC. Notwithstanding their connection with Rome's foundation myths, the Silvii were plebeians, and hardly any members of this gens played a significant role in history.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 827 (\\"Silvius\\"). However, from inscriptions, several Silvii appear to have had distinguished military careers, and Silvius Silvanus was governor of Moesia Inferior in the time of Diocletian. ==Origin== Both Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus relate the tradition that the Silvii were descended from Silvius, the second king of Alba Longa, who was so called because he was born in the woods. His descendants took the \\"cognomen\\" Silvius, which was then passed down to his descendants until the time of Numitor, the grandfather of Romulus and Remus.Livy, i. 3.Dionysius, i. 70, 71.Cf. Plutarch, \\"The Life of Romulus\\", 3. Plutarch only alludes to the name, in mentioning \\"Silvia\\" as a name assigned to the mother of Romulus and Remus; but unlike Livy and Dionysius, he mentions his sources for the myths concerning their ancestry. When Alba was destroyed by Tullus Hostilius, and its populus transferred to Rome, members of its leading families were enrolled in the Roman Senate, but the Silvii are not mentioned among them. Nowhere are Numitor's immediate successors named, nor is it stated whether they were descended from the Silvii; in the time of the war with Tullus Hostilius they were ruled by Gaius Cluilius, who died in the course of the war, and was replaced by a dictator, Mettius Fufetius. Unlike the Silvii, the Cluilii, presumably the royal house that succeeded them, are included in the list of Alban families accorded senatorial rank.Livy, i. 29, 30.Dionysius, iii. 29. ==Praenomina== The main praenomina of the Silvii were Lucius, Gaius, and Quintus, which were among the most common names at all periods of Roman history. The inscriptions of this gens also afford examples of other common praenomina, including Marcus, Sextus, Publius, and Titus, as well as one instance of the rare praenomen Appius. ==Branches and cognomina== The nomenclature of Appius Silvius Junius Silanus would seem to indicate that he was a descendant of the noble house of the Junii Silani, though whether Silvius was his paternal nomen, or came in through his mother's side, is not readily apparent. ==Members== ===Silvian Dynasty=== * Silvius, the son, or brother, of Ascanius, was born in the woods, and raised by herdsmen in the mountains, according to Dionysius, who relates that he reigned for twenty-nine years. In Diodorus, he reigned for forty-nine years. In Ovid, his original name was Postumus, with Silvius being given him as an epithet. * Aeneas Silvius, the first to affix his father's name, Silvius to his own, to distinguish himself from his ancestor, reigned thirty-one years, according to Dionysius, and thirty in Diodorus; he is omitted by Ovid. * Latinus Silvius, established a number of colonies, later known as the Prisci Latini, or \\"Old Latins\\". Dionysius assigns him a reign of fifty-one years, Diodorus fifty. The latter adds that he was a martial king, who founded colonies to repopulate the region that he had destroyed by war. * Alba Silvius, reigned for thirty-nine years in Dionysius, thirty eight in Diodorus. He is omitted by Cassius Dio. * Atys (Silvius), called Capetus by Dionysius, Epitus by Diodorus, and Epytus by Ovid, reigned twenty-six years. * Capys Silvius, ruled over Alba for twenty- eight years. * Capetus (Silvius), called Calpetus by Diodorus, and in the Fasti, reigned thirteen years. He is omitted by Cassius Dio. * Tiberinus (Silvius), drowned in the river then known as the Albula, but subsequently called Tiber after him. Dionysius says that he reigned for eight years, and was slain in a battle near the Albula, his body being carried off by the river; Diodorus that he was swept away by the river while leading his army against the Etruscans. * Agrippa (Silvius), assigned a reign of forty-one years. In the Fasti, he is the father of Remulus, but in Metamorphoses, Ovid calls him \\"Acrota\\", and makes him the younger brother of Remulus, fierce, but less rash. * Romulus Silvius, struck by lightning. He is called Alladius by Dionysius, who makes him a terrible tyrant, contemptuous of the gods, who contrived to imitate thunder and lightning to intimidate his subjects; his death, after a reign of nineteen years, was thus an ironic punishment. Diodorus calls him Aramulius, and says that when thunder and lightning threatened the harvest, he bade his soldiers to beat upon their shields with their swords to drown out the noise, and thus he was struck down for his impiety. Ovid calls him Remulus, and mentions him rashly imitating lightning, but says nothing else of him except that he was killed by lightning, and succeeded by his younger brother. Cassius Dio relates his impiety, but says that he drowned when the Alban Lake overflowed. Both Dionysius and Diodorus mention that the ruins of his house could be seen beneath the waters of the Alban Lake. * Aventinus (Silvius), commemorated by a shrine on the Aventine Hill, reigned thirty-seven years. Diodorus relates that during a war, he and his army retreated to the Aventine as a redoubt. Cassius Dio states that he perished in war. Ovid describes the hill as his seat of power, and the site of his tomb‚Äîperhaps implying that he was slain there, during the war alluded to by Diodorus and Cassius Dio. * Proca (Silvius), called Procas by Dionysius, and Palatinus by Ovid, ruled for twenty-three years, bequeathing his throne to his elder son, Numitor. Cassius Dio relates that in one account, Aventinus, not Proca, was the father of Numitor and Amulius. Ovid has Palatinus ruling from the Palatine Hill, as a parallel to his father, Aventinus. * Numitor (Silvius), the elder son of Proca, was deposed and exiled by his younger brother, his sons killed, and his daughter made a Vestal Virgin. * Amulius (Silvius), the younger son of Proca, deposed his brother, and attempted to extinguish his line; Dionysius relates that he ruled for forty-two years; Diodorus, forty-three. * Aegestus (Silvius), the son of Numitor, according to Dionysius and Cassius Dio, was ambushed and slain while on a hunt arranged by his uncle, Amulius. In Ovid, his name is Lausus. Livy does not name Numitor's sons, but refers to them in the plural. * Rhea Silvia, also called Ilia, the daughter of Numitor, was made a Vestal when her father was deposed; when violated, she gave birth to the twins Romulus and Remus, and named Mars as their father. Amulius threw her into prison, and ordered the boys thrown into the Tiber. * Antho (Silvia), the daughter of Amulius, pleaded with her father to spare the life of her cousin, Rhea Silvia. She is mentioned, but not named, by Dionysius, but named only in Plutarch.Livy, i. 3, 4.Dionysius, i. 70, 71, 76‚Äì79.Diodorus Siculus, vii. 5.Cassius Dio, i. 1‚Äì5.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Romulus\\", 3.Ovid, Fasti, iv. 19 ff., Metamorphoses, xiv. 609 ff. ===Historical Silvii=== * Silvia L. f.

He fled to Bristol, Pennsylvania, and later moved to Florence, Massachusetts, where he lived for the remainder of his life. __TOC__ == Early Life in Maryland == Basil Dorsey was born in 1808 in Libertytown of Frederick County, Maryland. He was known at the time as Ephraim Costly, and was enslaved by Sabrick Sollers. Dorsey married an enslaved woman named Louisa, and together they had two children while in Maryland, Eliza (born November 3, 1834) and John Richard (born May 18, 1836). Dorsey had been promised freedom upon Sollers‚Äô death, but when it came on July 17, 1834, Dorsey was instead purchased by Sabrick's son, Thomas Sollers, for $300. Thomas Sollers offered to sell him his freedom for $350, but when Dorsey found Richard Cole, who agreed to be his bondsman for the sale, Sollers raised the price to $500. Cole encouraged Dorsey to escape by foot, and on May 14, 1836, he set out North with his brothers Thomas, Charles, and William. == Escape to Pennsylvania and Trial == The four brothers traveled to Gettysburg, then Harrisburg, then Reading, until they reached Bristol, PA, where they worked on abolitionist Robert Purvis‚Äô farm. Thomas preferred to live in the city, while Charles and William lived with neighboring farmers, and Basil lived with Purvis. In July 1837, Dorsey's brother-in-law betrayed him to slave-hunters hired by Thomas Sollers, and they tracked him to Purvis‚Äô farm and had him seized by local authorities. Upon learning about Dorsey's imprisonment, Robert Purvis organized an escape to New Jersey for William and Charles, to prevent them from being recaptured as well. From New Jersey, they would travel to freedom in Canada. Thomas had also been captured by the slave-hunters, and he was sent back into slavery in Maryland. Friends in Philadelphia quickly raised $1000, with which they bought his freedom. He returned to Philadelphia and lived there for the rest of his life as a popular caterer. Purvis brought lawyer Thomas Ross and Dorsey's wife and children, who had recently come to Pennsylvania, to the court in Doylestown. They urged the judge, Judge Fox, to postpone the case, claiming that Dorsey had free papers currently being held by a friend in Columbia, PA. Fox agreed to postpone the trial by two weeks. Purvis also believed the judge felt sympathy for Dorsey, as he recalled in an 1883 account: > \\"Doubtless the judge was deeply impressed by the appearance in the court- > room of the delicate and beautiful wife and the young children clinging to > the husband and father, who, looking the picture of despair sat with the > evidence in his torn and soiled garments of the terrible conflict through > which he had passed.‚Äù During those two weeks, Basil Dorsey remained in a jail cell, and Robert Purvis organized his legal support. He drove to Philadelphia and enlisted the service of renowned lawyer and philanthropist David Paul Brown, who refused to accept any payment for defending Dorsey. Purvis spread the word about the trial, encouraging the local African-American population to show up to his trial and aid Dorsey if the ruling was in favor of Sollers. During the trial, Sollers offered to settle the case by offering Dorsey for sale for $500. When Purvis agreed to pay that amount, he raised it to $800. When Purvis agreed again, he raised it to $1000. Dorsey interrupted and declared, \\"Do not pay it. I am prepared to take my life in court, if the case goes against me, for I will never go back to slavery.\\" Abel M. Griffith, a young lawyer, represented Thomas Sollers. He presented documents that proved Sollers‚Äô ownership of Dorsey, and he argued the legality of Sollers‚Äô right to recapture him. According to Purvis‚Äô account, it seemed all likely that the court would rule in favor of the prosecution. David Paul Brown then rose and demanded that Griffith produce proper evidence that slavery is legal in the state of Maryland. Griffith left the courthouse and returned with The Laws of Maryland, which Brown declared was not a certified copy. Griffith pleaded with the judge to offer him more time to find proof, but Judge Fox dismissed the case. Purvis immediately brought Dorsey to his mother's home in Philadelphia, and shortly after they traveled to New York in search of greater security. == New York and Charlemont, MA == Once in New York, he met The Emancipator editor Joshua Leavitt and David Ruggles, who encouraged him to go to Northampton, MA, where he stayed with Haynes K. Starkweather for a few days. Colonel Samuel Parsons then brought him to Charlemont, MA, to the farm of Roger Hooker Leavitt, father of Joshua Leavitt. Dorsey lived on Leavitt's property for about six years. During that time, he and Louisa had a third child, Charles Robert, on August 29, 1838. Louisa died two months later, on November 7, and she was buried in the town's cemetery. == Florence and Northampton, MA == In January 1844, Dorsey moved with his children to Florence (then called \\"Bensonville\\") and began working at the Bensonville Manufacturing Company, run by George W. Benson, founder of the Northampton Association of Education and Industry, and a brother-in-law of William Lloyd Garrison. On November 12, 1849, Dorsey bought lot No. 12 of the Bensonville Village Lots for $35. He built a home on the land, which was purchased by Mary Jones in 1852. The Dorsey-Jones House is now considered a historic site. Dorsey was a \\"teamster\\", or a driver at the cotton mill, then general \\"jobber\\". His job as a teamster meant a lot of traveling, which suddenly became dangerous after The Fugitive Slave Act was enacted in 1850, as he frequently made visits to Boston and Providence which had a higher chance of slave catchers. A month after it was enacted, Dorsey and 9 other fugitives publicly called out to locals to help them resist any attempts to return them to the South. He and many of his friends were strongly against paying for his natural right to freedom, but with the passage of the act, Dorsey was in significantly higher danger while doing his job. His friends in Northampton and Florence then gathered $150, and with $50 of Dorsey's own earnings he officially bought his freedom which settled on May 14, 1851, fifteen years after his escape. The bill of sale was registered to George Griscom, a Philadelphia lawyer, who then manumitted Dorsey. Basil Dorsey remarried to a woman named Cynthia, with whom he had 11 children. He died in Florence on February 15, 1872 and is buried with his daughter, Louisa, in Park Street Cemetery in Florence, MA. == References == Category:American slaves Category:Fugitive American slaves Category:American abolitionists Category:African-American abolitionists Category:People from Frederick County, Maryland Category:People from Northampton, Massachusetts Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:1872 deaths ","title":"Basil Dorsey"},{"id":"63862519","text":"The South Australian Chamber of Manufactures was founded in 1868 to promote manufacturing industries in the Colony and State of South Australia. Strongly Protectionist, it lobbied on such subjects as unionized labour, Federation, rail standardization, penny postage, preference in Government contracts to locally manufactured goods, Government agencies competing with private industries, Government inspectors, industrial health and safety, cultivation of vines and olives, water conservation and irrigation, patent rights, workers' compensation, education, training and apprenticeships. ==History== The Chamber was the outcome of a meeting held on 26 March 1868 in Adelaide, convened by J. A. Holden and W. F. Gray, and came into being on 25 July 25 of the same year; it was the first such body founded in the Australian colonies. One of its first successes was persuading the Government to offer a bonus of ¬£2,000 for the first 10,000 yards of woollen cloth made in the colony, and resulted in the development of Onkaparinga Woollen Mills at Lobethal. Another success was the encouragement given to technical education. In 1876 the Chamber established night classes in mechanical drawing, at the Grote Street Public School, which led to the establishment of the South Australian School of Design. The successes achieved as a result of these classes led to the establishment of other technical classes, which led to the formation in 1887 of a board which established the South Australian School of Mines and Industries. ===Presidents=== *Samuel Davenport (later Sir Samuel) 1868‚Äì88 *A.

A museum of early manufacturing efforts was established there, but it was dispersed in 1927 with the move to the new building, as there was no space available. In 1889 the Government provided offices in the Eastern annexe of the Jubilee Exhibition Building. Subsequently it removed to a large room in front of the Exhibition Building.

Frederick was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross during the Vietnam War, where he spent over six and a half years as a prisoner of war before he died in captivity. == Early life and service == John W. Frederick Jr. was born on December 13, 1923, in Manito, Illinois. On May 7, 1942, he enlisted in the Marine Corps and subsequently attended Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego, California. During 40 combat missions in World War II, Frederick served as a tail gunner and radar operator on Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers. After the war, Frederick flew reconnaissance missions in China during Operation Beleaguer. Frederick often flew over Communist Chinese camps, although the rules of engagement did not allow him to fire at the Communists unless fired upon. During the first year of the Korean War, Technical Sergeant Frederick flew 90 combat missions as the co-pilot in Grumman F7F Tigercats with Marine All Weather Fighter Squadron 542 (VMF(AW)-542). He was awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross for his service before rotating home in July 1951. After the war, Master Sergeant Frederick was stationed at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina, and Naval Air Station Atsugi, Japan. He was assigned to Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland, in August 1961, where he worked on the F4H-1 Phantom II project. On October 25, 1961, Frederick was promoted to warrant officer. In December 1964, he was assigned to Marine Attack Squadron 533 (VMA-533) at Cherry Point. In May of the following year, Frederick transferred to Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 323 (VMFA-323). == Vietnam War == On December 1, 1965, Chief Warrant Officer 2 Frederick deployed to Vietnam with VMFA-323. On the night of December 7, Frederick was the radar intercept officer of an F4B Phantom during an escort mission out of Da Nang Air Base when his plane was shot down by a surface-to-air missile over North Vietnam. Although he severely burned his hands when his part of the cockpit was enveloped by flames, he successfully ejected from the aircraft. The pilot, Major John H. Dunn, also survived the crash and was captured six days later. The next morning, Frederick accidentally walked into an enemy gun emplacement and single-handedly attacked the position. He managed to kill a few North Vietnamese soldiers before he was overpowered and captured. Frederick was subsequently beaten and taken to a prisoner of war camp in Hanoi. As one of the first Marines to be taken as a POW during the war, Frederick helped set the standard for conduct of other captured Marines, unifying the men and increasing morale. Frederick strictly adhered to the code of conduct and refused to take part in North Vietnamese propaganda programs. Frederick's resistance to the enemy also caused him to be routinely tortured and beaten during countless interrogations. Frederick also faced extended periods of solitary confinement for refusing to bow and refusing to provide biographical information. In 1972, he was held in solitary confinement for 90 days and contracted either typhoid fever or meningitis. Falling into a coma, Frederick was likely being transported to a hospital in Hanoi when he died on or about July 19, 1972, after more than 2,400 days in captivity. While other American prisoners of war were released between February and April 1973 during Operation Homecoming, Frederick's remains were returned to the United States on March 13, 1974. He was buried at Mount Hope Cemetery in Tremont, Illinois. == Posthumous honors == Frederick was posthumously promoted to chief warrant officer 4. He was recommended for the Medal of Honor, however this award was downgraded to the Navy Cross. Frederick was also awarded the Silver Star, two Legions of Merit, and the Bronze Star for his actions while a prisoner of war; making him one of the most decorated warrant officers in Marine Corps history. In 1999, a study lounge at The Basic School in Marine Corps Base Quantico was dedicated in Frederick's name. == See also == * List of Navy Cross recipients for the Vietnam War * U.S. prisoners of war during the Vietnam War == References == Category:1923 births Category:1972 deaths Category:People from Mason County, Illinois Category:Military personnel from Illinois Category:American Marine Corps personnel of World War II Category:American Marine Corps personnel of the Korean War Category:United States Marine Corps personnel of the Vietnam War Category:American military personnel killed in the Vietnam War Category:Recipients of the Navy Cross (United States) Category:Recipients of the Silver Star Category:Recipients of the Legion of Merit Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United States) Category:United States Marine Corps officers Category:Vietnam War prisoners of war Category:Shot-down aviators ","title":"John W.

Military families from Fort Adams requested a Catholic school; Cluny opened in September 1957 as a kindergarten and added grades until 1965, when the first eighth grade graduation was held. Since the period, the overall population of Newport declined and the concentration of the middle class declined; much of the housing became too expensive for families with young children, and there were relatively few houses being sold in Newport to new residents. In addition many families previously going to Cluny instead sent their children to the Portsmouth School Department. From circa 2014 to 2017 the enrollment decreased by one fourth; the school administration stated that this decline and the general competition among private schools in the Newport area caused the operation of the school to be no longer viable. It closed in 2017.

The plan involved entering the country by boat into Macuto port from 3 to 4 May 2020 in order to take control of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var International Airport in Maiquetia, capture Maduro and other high-level figures in his government, and expel them from the country. The operation had been infiltrated by supporters of the Maduro government early on. Commentators and observers, including Guaid√≥ officials who initially contracted with Silvercorp, described the operation as amateurish, underfunded, poorly-planned, having little or no chance of success, and a suicide mission. The operation occurred in the broader context of an ongoing international dispute beginning in January 2019 over the identity of the legitimate president of Venezuela; Nicol√°s Maduro or Juan Guaid√≥. Throughout 2019, Maduro has maintained control of Venezuela's governmental and military institutions. The state intelligence agencies, as well as the Associated Press, had prior knowledge of the plot, which was intercepted before the first boat reached land. The attack went forward despite its impracticality, with Silvercorp founder Jordan Goudreau possibly motivated by a multi-million dollar reward offered by the United States to arrest or assist with the arrest of Maduro and his high-ranking officials in connection with federal indictments filed in late March 2020 alleging involvement in drug-trafficking activity. The raid involved two fiberglass motorboats owned by Silvercorp which launched from eastern Colombia toward the Caribbean coast of Venezuela north of Caracas. The boats were carrying approximately 60 Venezuelan dissidents and two American former Green Berets employed as mercenaries by Silvercorp. Eight Venezuelan dissidents were killed and seventeen invaders were captured, including the two American security contractors, whose interrogations were broadcast on state television in the hours following the event. After the attack, it became public that a formal document setting out the objective of the operation was signed in October 2019 between Silvercorp and Guaid√≥'s Strategy Committee, which Guaid√≥ had formed with the goal of exploring all available options for removing Maduro from power and installing himself as president. Guaid√≥'s Strategy Committee reportedly withdrew from the agreement and cut off ties with Silvercorp and Goudreau in November 2019. Juan Guaid√≥, his Strategy Committee, and officials of the Colombian and United States governments have all denied any role in the actual attack that went forward on 3 May 2020. == Background == A power struggle concerning who is the legitimate president of Venezuela began in January 2019, when Juan Guaid√≥, president of the opposition-majority National Assembly, declared that incumbent Nicol√°s Maduro's 2018 re-election was invalid; that the office of the president of Venezuela was therefore vacant; and that he was assuming office as acting president of the nation. Guaid√≥ has been officially recognized as the legitimate president of Venezuela by almost 60 governments internationally, including the governments of the United States and Canada; Colombia, Brazil, and the majority of Latin American countries; and the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Spain, among other European countries. Other nations, including Russia, China, South Africa, Iran, Syria, Cuba, Nicaragua, North Korea and Turkey, have continued to recognize Maduro as the legitimate head of state. ==Planning== Operation Gideon was primarily planned by Cl√≠ver Alcal√° Cordones and Jordan Goudreau. Alcal√° was a Major General in the Venezuelan Army until he defected in 2013 and began gathering other defectors in Colombia, stationing them in the La Guajira Peninsula. Alcal√° was sanctioned in September 2011 by the United States Department of the Treasury for allegedly helping FARC obtain weapons and smuggle drugs. Goudreau served in the Canadian Armed Forces after attending the University of Calgary from 1994 to 1998, where he studied computer science. He later moved to Washington, D.C. and enlisted in the United States Army a few months prior to the September 11 attacks in New York City, eventually reaching the rank of Sergeant first class in the 10th Special Forces Group. He became a naturalized US citizen and retired at the age of 40 due to injuries. In 2018, Goudreau founded Silvercorp USA, with the initial idea being \\"to embed counter-terror agents in schools disguised as teachers.\\" Goudreau is reported to have provided security at a political rally for Donald Trump in Charlotte, North Carolina in October 2018 based on material on the Silvercorp website and Instagram account. In February 2019, Silvercorp provided security services at Venezuela Aid Live, resulting in Goudreau turning his attention to Venezuela. According to Goudreau's friend and business partner, Drew White, he saw a business opportunity in the Trump administration's intensified efforts to remove Maduro from power. White distanced himself from Silvercorp and Goudreau when Goudreau began discussing launching a military operation in Venezuela. === Initial promotion === Through connections within the private security community, Goudreau was acquainted with Keith Schiller, the longtime director of security for Donald Trump. Schiller brought Goudreau to a March 2019 fundraising event focused on security in Venezuela, which took place at the University Club of Washington, DC. , the director of humanitarian aid for Guaid√≥'s government, was also in attendance. After an unsuccessful uprising attempt against Maduro supported by Guaid√≥ on 30 April 2019, some troops who sided with Guaid√≥ subsequently took refuge in Colombia. According to the Associated Press, weeks later, Lester Toledo introduced Goudreau to Major General Cl√≠ver Alcal√° Cordones at JW Marriott Bogot√°, where groups of opposition politicians and dissident soldiers held conferences on strategies for accomplishing the removal of Maduro from power. During the two-day meeting with Toledo and Goudreau, Alcal√° disclosed that he had recruited some 300 men currently stationed in training camps on the Guajira Peninsula near Riohacha, Colombia, ready to carry out \\"a 'mad plan' to push across the western border, take the oil center of Maracaibo and force their way to Caracas, the capital.\\" Goudreau indicated that instead of 300 as Alcal√° promised, there were only 60 trainees. Goudreau proposed an alternative approach, suggesting that his company, Silvercorp, could train and equip the soldiers for a rapid strike at a cost of US$1.5 million. Goudreau bragged about having contacts with Trump administration officials, though he did not provide support for his statements. In May 2019, Keith Schiller and Goudreau met with Guaid√≥ administration officials in Miami, Florida, where Goudreau promoted the idea of providing security for Guaid√≥ officials. Schiller disassociated himself from Goudreau following the meeting, believing that Goudreau was incapable of providing the services he was offering. === Colombia === In June 2019, Alcal√° met with the National Intelligence Directorate of Colombia asking for support, saying Goudreau was a former CIA agent. However, the Colombians' CIA contacts in Bogot√° reportedly denied that Goudreau had ever been a CIA agent. US officials learned of the militants in Colombia and discussed a plan to organize them to assist victims of the Venezuelan refugee crisis, thus diverting them from illegal activities. When reports emerged that they might be used for an armed operation, one anonymous US official described the notion as \\"completely insane.\\" By 16 June 2019, Goudreau had compiled a list of required equipment, according to former United States Navy SEAL Ephraim Mattos, who met with Alcal√°'s troops while working in Colombia. The list included \\"320 M4 assault rifles, an anti-tank rocket launcher, Zodiac boats, US$1 million in cash and state-of-the-art night vision goggles.\\" The trainees reportedly believed they had the backing of the U.S. government. === General Services Agreement === forgery. In August 2019, Guaid√≥ established a Strategic Committee and named J.J. Rend√≥n as the General Strategist. The Strategic Committee was tasked with exploring possibilities and testing scenarios for the removal of Maduro from office, with methods ranging from increased international condemnation of Maduro to armed action. In August 2019, shortly after the formation of Guaid√≥'s Strategic Committee, Maduro stated there was a \\"plan ... to get 32 mercenaries into Venezuela to kill me and to kill Venezuelan revolutionary leaders.\\" Rend√≥n stated that his orders upon being named as General Strategist were to consider every option, quoting Guaid√≥ as \\"saying all options were on the table, and under the table.\\" Among the scenarios considered by the group was the removal of Maduro by capturing him and his high-ranking officials and sending them to another country for prosecution. The Committee studied the \\"universal enemy\\" doctrine and analyzed the unsuccessful Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba in April 1961. The Strategic Committee adopted the position that the Venezuelan Constitution, the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, and other treaties constituted legal justification for taking action to remove Maduro. Rend√≥n told The Washington Post that the Strategic Committee had contacted numerous groups about ousting Maduro, but they demanded prices from US$500 million to US$1.5 billion. Goudreau then made contact with Rend√≥n on 7 September 2019 at a condominium in Miami, where Goudreau made a sales pitch, proposing the capture of Maduro and his officials and their extraction from Venezuela. Goudreau offered a self-financed plan at a cheaper cost of $212.9 million, backed by future oil sales. According to a source interviewed by the PanAm Post, Goudreau said he needed a signed agreement from the interim government in order to raise funds, but the opposition representatives initially put him off. On 10 October 2019, Goudreau text messaged Rend√≥n saying, \\"Washington is fully aware of your direct participation in the project and I don't want them to lose faith.\\" Further text messages displayed Maduro's inner circle warehouses filled with US dollars; Goudreau was offered 14% of funds recovered during the operation. A 41-page document containing various attachments of the General Services agreement was signed in Washington, D.C., on 16 October 2019, by Jordan Goudreau on behalf of Silvercorp and J.J. Rend√≥n and Sergio Vergara on behalf of the Guaid√≥ administration. Rend√≥n described the agreement as a \\"trial balloon\\" and a test of what Goudreau could do that was never officially implemented. The language of the agreement of \\"Operation Resolution\\" expressly stipulated that the end objective was to forcibly remove Maduro and to install Guaid√≥ as president of Venezuela. Within a week of signing the agreement, Goudreau reported back to the opposition that he had secured funding for the operation, but provided no proof. The General Services Agreement Attachments signed between Guaid√≥ government officials and Silvercorp USA in October 2019. Vergara and Rend√≥n, who have since resigned their positions on the Strategy Committee, acknowledge they signed the agreement and the attachments.In the agreement's attachments, rules of engagement (ROE) were drafted that included the protection of Venezuela's cultural sites, unless used for illicit activity, and the targeting of infrastructure and economic objectives. The ROE also designated numerous enemies: Nicol√°s Maduro, Diosdado Cabello, their supporters, colectivos, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the National Liberation Army (ELN), and Hezbollah. Also included in the agreement's ROE were riot control guidelines, permitting the use of non-lethal weapons such as rubber bullets, tear gas, shields and batons against any person who became \\"unruly\\" and attacked operatives. The contract also permitted Silvercorp to detain civilians on reasonable suspicion. The agreement also established a chain of command: Juan Guaid√≥ as commander-in- chief, Sergio Vergara as overall project supervisor, and J.J. Rend√≥n as chief strategy officer. The agreement was signed by Rend√≥n, Vergara, Goudreau, and Manuel J. Retureta, a Cuban-born attorney based in Washington who signed as a witness. It has been reported that Juan Guaid√≥ himself also signed the contract, which he and his allies have denied. Rend√≥n told reporters that shortly after signing the agreement, Goudreau began acting suspicious, failing to provide evidence of financial backing, the armed support of 800 men, and demanded immediate payment of the $1.5 million retainer that was due within a five-day period according to the agreement. Rend√≥n transferred Goudreau $50,000 for \\"expenses\\" to buy more time, but the relationship between the two quickly deteriorated. On November 8, 2019, Goudreau met Rend√≥n at the latter's condominium, where a heated argument took place. A witness to the argument at Rend√≥n's condominium reported that \\"Jordan came to the apartment very upset, complaining about the alleged breach of the agreement. He demanded payment immediately, or he would screw everything up.\\" Witnesses also reported that Goudreau threatened to join forces with Chavista businessmen if Rend√≥n failed to pay, referring to supporters of the regime currently in power, and warning Rend√≥n that \\"Whoever pays is in charge.\\" According to Rend√≥n, he and other opposition officials \\"considered the operation dead\\" after this encounter in early November.  Controversy over Guaid√≥'s alleged signature  In the immediate aftermath of the incident, Goudreau provided a copy of a General Services Agreement purporting to bear the signature of Juan Guaid√≥ himself. Guaid√≥ and his allies have denied that Guaid√≥ signed the document, insisting that Rend√≥n and Vergara signed on Guaid√≥'s behalf. A report in The Washington Post described the dispute over who signed the contract, or what parts of the contract, as follows: In the days following the operation, Goudreau disclosed what purported to be a copy of a contract containing Guaid√≥'s signature, whose first and last page were missing, along with a covert recording supposedly depicting Guaid√≥ in a video call on 16 October 2019 with Goudreau. On the recording, Guaid√≥ purportedly says, \\"We are doing the right thing for our country\\" and \\"I'm about to sign.\\" Guaid√≥ and his allies have repeatedly insisted that Guaid√≥ did not sign any contract with Silvercorp and never spoke with Jordan Goudreau directly or in a video or telephone call. In a statement on EVTV following the incident, Guaid√≥ stated \\"That is not my signature. The dictatorship goes to great lengths to plant evidence.\\" Guaid√≥'s National Assembly described the document supposedly bearing his Guaid√≥'s signature as a \\"false document as justification to try and kidnap and illegally detain the interim president Juan Guaid√≥.\\" Hern√°n Alem√°n, a politician from the opposition party Acci√≥n Democr√°tica from Zulia who described Goudreau as \\"an extraordinary man and friend with extraordinary skills\\" and \\"even spent Christmas with Jordan, somewhere in Colombia,\\" indicated in an interview following the event that he did not know about any details surrounding the contract or the discussions that took place in the United States. When first asked about his contacts with Silvercorp by the AP, Rend√≥n said that this information was confidential and that he could not confirm or deny signing a contract, even if it existed. Subsequently, Rend√≥n stated that Guaid√≥ had signed a \\"preliminary\\" agreement with Silvercorp. Ultimately, Rend√≥n insisted that the document Goudreau produced was never signed by Guaid√≥ and provided previous and subsequent agreements to The Washington Post that did not bear Guaid√≥'s signature, saying that Guaid√≥ knew only the rough outlines of an \\"exploratory plan\\" but grew suspicious of Goudreau based on the reports of the committee. Rend√≥n said that \\"We were all having red flags, and the president was not comfortable with this.\\" === Alcal√° and Goudreau resume preparations=== Goudreau and Alcal√° reportedly distanced themselves from the Venezuelan opposition due to their perception that the opposition was insincere and hypocritical because of alleged secret negotiations with the Maduro government. Though Alcal√° and Goudreau no longer had the support of the opposition government, they resumed their preparations to go forward with the plot. Without aid from the US government or the Guaid√≥ administration, Goudreau and Alcal√° did not have the means required for a successful operation. By December 2019, Silvercorp had purchased a fiberglass boat in Florida that was equipped with navigational equipment two months later. In January 2020, two other former Green Beret operators, Airan Berry and Luke Denman, arrived in Colombia. According to an article published by the PanAm Post on 26 May 2020, the three Americans traveled to Colombia on a private flight from Opa-Locka, Florida, to Barranquilla, Colombia, on 16 January 2020, arriving at approximately 10:30 a.m. (English translation) The PanAm Post reported that the passenger list for the flight \\"included a high-ranking Venezuelan government official, Yacsy Alezandra √Ålvarez Mirabal, who, according to OpenCorporates, is the director of Lubricantes VENOCO de Centroam√©rica, a Venezuelan state-owned company attached to PDVSA.\\" In March 2020, Goudreau traveled to Jamaica in the Silvercorp-owned fiberglass boat where he met with former special forces friends and discussed Operation Gideon. According to Jack Murphy, self-identified as a former US Ranger, the CIA learned about the plan and warned Silvercorp not to go through with it on numerous occasions. The Wall Street Journal reported that the planned operation was \\"widely known to former Venezuelan soldiers who considered participating, Venezuelan opposition figures, senior Colombian intelligence officials and even the CIA, which monitored their activities in La Guajira, said the people with knowledge of the plans.\\" Speaking after the attack, Goudreau stated the operation was forced to rely on \\"donations from Venezuelan migrants driving for car share service Uber in Colombia\\" because he was not paid by Guaid√≥'s team. \\"It's almost like crowdfunded the liberating of a country,\\" Goudreau reportedly told the AP. In an interview after the operation, Hern√°n Alem√°n stated that Rend√≥n never financed the operation and that he and Alcal√° undertook the operation with Goudreau without his party's knowledge. According to Alem√°n, he and Alcal√° took it upon themselves to finance the operation. Alem√°n said that at its peak, the group consisted of four camps occupied by 150 militants. In the weeks leading up to the attack, many militants reportedly began to abandon the operation when Goudreau's promises failed to materialize and due to rumors that Maduro had infiltrated the operation. Alem√°n said the operation was compromised and had been infiltrated, saying that after Alcal√°'s arrest, the operation's control was transferred to other people, there was no contact with the new leaders, and the rest of the mercenaries supposedly still in hiding in Venezuela have said Captain Antonio Sequea was a mole. === Extradition of Alcal√° to the United States === Cl√≠ver Alcal√° Cordones A shipment of weapons and tactical gear was confiscated on 23 March 2020 by Colombian authorities tipped off by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), with former DEA officials initially believing that the equipment was being sent to leftist guerrillas. The impounded truck was headed for Venezuela carrying 26 semi-automatic rifles, night vision goggles, radios, and 15 combat helmets produced by High-End Defense Solutions, a company owned by Venezuelan Americans. On 26 March 2020, the United States accused Maduro of narcoterrorism and through its Narcotics Rewards Program, offered a US$15 million reward for information leading to his arrest, plus an additional US$10 million each for information leading to the arrest of four close Maduro allies: Diosdado Cabello, Maikel Moreno, Tareck El Aissami, Vladimir Padrino L√≥pez and Cilver Alcal√°, one of the alleged leaders of the operation.The United States accused Nicol√°s Maduro of narco-terrorism and offered USD 15 million for data leading to his arrest Infobae, 26 Mar 2020 Alcal√° assumed responsibility on 26 March for \\"a military operation against the Maduro dictatorship\\" that included the shipment of weapons captured in Colombia, stating that the United States, Colombia, and Guaid√≥ officials had signed an agreement to overthrow Maduro. After Alcal√° assumed responsibility for the weapons shipment, the Colombian attorney general announced on 28 March that an investigation into Alcal√°'s role in the shipment had been opened. Guaid√≥ denied knowledge of the event while United States Special Representative to Venezuela Elliott Abrams described Alcal√°'s statement as \\"despicable and quite dangerous.\\" Abrams later said that Alcal√° \\"was put up to making those terrible charges by the [Maduro] regime.\\" Alcal√° was extradited to the United States on drug trafficking charges after voluntarily surrendering on about 27 March. The Venezuelan government said that Alcal√° was a US agent and that, after the operation failed, the United States government used narcoterrorism charges as a way to transport him to the United States to prevent him from revealing more secrets. In the context of reacting to the intercepted shipment on 26 March, Maduro stated during a press release that Alcal√° was hired by the DEA to assassinate him, \\"but he failed because we made him fail.\\" According to Hern√°n Alem√°n, who admits to participating in the planning of the operation up until the point Alcal√° was extradited to the United States, Sequea took control of the operation and replaced militants. Alem√°n remarked that Goudreau was unable to exercise command because he was in the United States. Alem√°n, saying he was basing his statements on mercenaries who stayed behind in the boats, accused Sequea of being a mole and of selling the militants out. === Prior knowledge of Maduro government === Maduro's officials had advance knowledge of minute details of Goudreau and Alcal√°'s plans. The Washington Post wrote that Maduro \\"was well-informed of the effort virtually from its start.\\" Two days after the confiscation of weapons and munitions in Colombia, on 25 March, the Venezuelan Minister of Communication and Information, Jorge Rodr√≠guez gave a televised press conference in which he published details related to the training camps. Rodr√≠guez named Robert Colina Ybarra, whom he identified as a murderer, as the leader of one of the training sites with the support of Colombian President Iv√°n Duque. (Ybarra was later killed during the operation.) Rodr√≠guez went on to mention that there were three American instructors at the training camps. \\"We know their cover names: agent Jordan, agent Luke, and agent Aaron,\\" Rodr√≠guez announced. On 28 March, Diosdado Cabello identified Jordan Goudreau as an adviser for Alcal√° during episode 294 of the show Con El Mazo Dando, which aired on state-owned Venezolana de Televisi√≥n. Cabello also identified by first name the two Americans who were eventually captured during the foiled plot. Cabello referred to the Americans only as \\"Luke\\" and \\"Aaron\\" [phonetic spelling] as special forces operatives allegedly training dissidents in Colombia for an armed invasion into Venezuela, without specifying their last names. Cabello also exhibited photographs purportedly showing Goudreau, Silvercorp and content from their social media profiles. The program also showed photographs from Instagram depicting Goudreau providing security services during the Venezuela Aid Live concert in C√∫cuta and at a Trump rally in Charlotte. The purpose of broadcasting the images was to show that the United States was allegedly behind the international effort to remove Maduro from power and was conspiring with narcotics traffickers, referring to Alcal√°. During the program, Cabello thanked \\"\\" for the information on Goudreau and the training camps in Colombia. The program also exhibited excerpts from various media organizations discussing the alleged contract between Guaid√≥ and Silvercorp, with Patricia Poleo of the US-based Factores de Poder political analysis platform explicitly stating that she confirmed there existed a written contract regarding an operation organized from within Colombia, with the knowledge of the Colombian government, signed by Juan Guaid√≥, JJ Rend√≥n, Sergio Vergara, and \\"American advisers\\" (asesores americanos), a statement Alcal√° had made days earlier. After news of the event broke, Maduro was explicit about the level of insider knowledge his government had, saying in his first public appearance: \\"We knew everything: what they were talking about, what they ate, what they drank, what they didn't drink, who financed them.\\" === Caribbean Sea incidents === Naiguat√° (GC-23), which sank after colliding with the RCGS Resolute while searching for mercenaries, according to the Maduro government On 28 March, as Goudreau was preparing for the attack, the fiberglass boat was damaged and an emergency position-indicating radio beacon was triggered. Authorities in Cura√ßao rescued Goudreau and returned him to Florida, with public health measures in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic delaying Goudreau from traveling again. Two days later on 30 March, the Venezuelan patrol boat Naiguat√° sank after engaging and colliding with the RCGS Resolute cruise ship. Venezuela alleged that the Portuguese-flagged RCGS Resolute was carrying mercenaries to attack the country's military bases and that the ship's inflatable Zodiac boats were intended to transport them to shore. According to its operator Columbia Cruise Services, the RCGS Resolute had a crew of 32 on board, but was not carrying passengers. Maduro stated on 1 April that RCGS Resolute had \\"mercenaries\\" aboard destined to attack Venezuela. The head of the Strategic Command Operations of Venezuela, Remigio Ceballos, tweeted on 2 April \\"The cruise ship RCGS Resolute has on board no fewer than 6 inflatable boats to move a minimum of seven commandos (42) to carry out incursions.\\" On 6 April, the Office for the Investigation of Maritime Accidents and the Aeronautical Meteorology Authority ( or GAMA) of Portugal released a technical investigation report on the incident, reaching the conclusion that the collision was caused by deliberate action on the part of the Naiguat√° crew. In an interview with Al Mayadeen on 12 April 2020, Remigio Ceballos alleged that the RCGS Resolute attempted to \\"plant mercenaries\\" in Venezuela. The Maduro government's Misi√≥n Verdad would write in May 2020 that the RCGS Resolute incident was possibly linked to US operations in Cura√ßao and the attack. When discussing the attack, Bellingcat stated \\"While there is no evidence that the RCGS Resolute was in any way involved in 'Operaci√≥n Gede√≥n', the Venezuelan government's statements following the sinking of the Naiguat√° suggest that they were on high alert for a seaborne incursion into Venezuela by one or more small teams of mercenaries.\\" Caracas Chronicles wrote that the RCGS Resolute incident \\"shows how tense the Venezuelan Navy has been around the idea of a maritime armed incursion.\\" === Final preparations, Associated Press article === In the final days of April 2020, Rend√≥n was contacted by Silvercorp's legal advisors demanding a payment of US$1.45 million, with Guaid√≥'s officials reacting to the demands in fear, believing they were being blackmailed for money with the threat of the cancelled plans being revealed to the public. The Associated Press (AP) published an article on 1 May 2020 about Goudreau, his plan and its history, and his training camps, writing that the plans to attack Venezuela were \\"far-fetched\\" and that people who knew him believed he was \\"in way over his head.\\" The article suggested that the Maduro government may have known of the plan since late-March 2020, but certainly knew by 1 May. Maduro confirmed that he knew of the plan by the evening of 1 May, and said that it had been initially planned for 10 March, but postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. By the time of the attack, many of the mercenaries had abandoned their camps following the arrest of Alcal√°, investigations by Colombian authorities, and the growing pandemic. It has been suggested that Goudreau went ahead with the attack despite its poor planning because he was seeking the US$15 million reward that the US government placed on Maduro. == Attack == alt= Venezuelan authorities monitoring the Caribbean coast during the Bolivarian Shield exercises On 3 May, Diosdado Cabello, president of the National Constituent Assembly and vice-president of the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), released a statement indicating that the government had \\"received information that there was going to be an attack on Venezuela by sea; some people in boats attempted it, an action which was repelled by our security agencies on the beaches of Macuto, with an unfortunate tally of eight deceased, two detained people who were there; a lot of significant weapons, in addition to vehicles that they had ready to carry out actions directly on institutions and authorities.\\" The boats had launched from Colombia at 17:00 the day before in two waves, with many of the soldiers experiencing motion sickness and vomiting while at sea. According to Venezuelan state intelligence, the first boat, which was smaller and faster, arrived at Macuto, and the second boat arrived at Chuao in Aragua state. The Venezuelan military reported that the mercenaries had \\"war materials\\" on their boats. The naval attack force was composed of 60 soldiers, including two former United States Army Special Forces members employed as private military contractors for Silvercorp USA. An initial fight in the early morning of 3 May involved the first boat and the Venezuelan Navy. Goudreau said that the second boat, yet to arrive at Venezuela, was running low on fuel at this point, but that refueling boats were sent from Aruba to help the incursion force. In the initial fight, eight mercenaries were arrested on the shore. Another six were killed on the beach; this had initially been reported as eight. Goudreau said that he had safe houses along the coast for his men. Videos of the fight, including gunshots, were shared on social media; the Venezuelan government first acknowledged the attack at 07:30, in an announcement from Interior Minister N√©stor Reverol. One of the men killed was former Venezuelan army captain Robert \\"Pantera\\" Colina. Goudreau and former Venezuelan National Guard officer Javier Nieto Quintero released a video in the afternoon taking responsibility, calling the attack \\"Operation Gideon\\" and explaining that they intended to launch an army into Venezuela to overthrow Maduro and his allies; Goudreau said that as well as the naval attack, his forces had entered Venezuela by land and were still operating. Speaking on national television that day, Reverol said that the Venezuelan military's defensive operation was ongoing, and would be for several days. The second wave arrived on 4 May, but was intercepted by the navy, fishermen, and local police; the attackers were all captured. Two other suspects were detained in Puerto La Cruz later that day. Venezuelan Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino L√≥pez later said that one of the landing boats had been sunk by the navy, and the country's military sent ships to look for survivors. == Aftermath, indictments and arrests == On 4 May, Maduro said Venezuelan forces had detained 13 mercenaries, including two Americans working with Goudreau; Airan Berry and Luke Denman. Goudreau said that eight of his soldiers had been captured on 4 May, the two Americans and six Venezuelans, and that an unknown number had been captured on 3 May. Goudreau gave an interview by telephone from Florida to a reporter from the Associated Press on 4 May. Goudreau said that his intention in launching the raid was to \\"introduce a catalyst,\\" acknowledging that it is impractical to believe \\"60 guys can come in and topple a regime.\\" Despite the long odds, Goudreau expressed his belief that \\"60 guys can go in and inspire the military and police to flip and join in the liberation of their country, which deep down is what they want.\\" It was reported that \\"dozens\\" of mercenaries had been captured on 5 May. Regarding the detainees, Goudreau told the AP, \\"I've tried to engage everybody I know at every level ... Nobody's returning my calls. It's a nightmare.\\" Another three mercenaries were arrested on 6 May. Seized items from the mercenaries included weapons and uniforms embroidered with an American flag. Venezuelan Prosecutor General Tarek William Saab later announced that 25,000 national troops were mobilized in a Venezuelan military mission named \\"Bolivarian Shield\\" (Spanish: Escudo Bolivariano) to protect the country from similar attempts. Robert Colina Ybarra (alias Pantera or \\"Panther\\"), the former captain alleged to have directed one of the training camps in Riohacha, was killed in action. Adolfo Baduel, son of former Ch√°vez Defense Minister, Ra√∫l Baduel, was among the detainees. By 6 May, the Defense Minister announced an additional three arrests via his Twitter account, publishing a photo of the purported detainees with pixelated faces on their knees with their wrists zip-tied together without disclosing the names or any other additional details regarding the accused. The same day, Trump announced his intent to appoint James B. Story as Ambassador of the United States to Venezuela. Former Captain Javier Nieto Quintero, one of the organizers of the operation, said on 7 May that the events were only an \\"advanced tactical reconnaissance\\" and that the Carive group had 3,000 troops. Venezuelan media and Reuters also reported that Russian Special Operations Forces were assisting Venezuelan soldiers with surveillance from unmanned aerial vehicles. Among the seized equipment, there was an airsoft gun and seven condoms. === Luke Denman === On 6 May, Nicol√°s Maduro held a virtual press conference broadcast on state television in which he presented portions of Luke Denman's interrogation. In introducing the video, Maduro said that both Americans had \\"confessed, and we will ensure that justice is done and the truth surfaces.\\" In the video, Denman states that his instructions were to seize Sim√≥n Bol√≠var International Airport in Maiquet√≠a and fly Maduro to the United States, which Maduro cited as proof that the orders came directly from United States president Donald Trump. The video shows Denman answering questions that were asked in English, also indicating that he was hired through Goudreau and that they trained 50 combatants in Colombia in January 2020. Ephraim Mattos, a Navy SEAL who had visited the rebel training camps in Colombia but was not involved in the operation, noted that Denman made an unusual and exaggerated gesture with his eyes during his recorded interrogation, noting that it may have been a covert signal, that \\"special operation soldiers are trained to find creative ways to discredit any propaganda videos they are forced to make if captured by the enemy\\" and that the odd eye movement immediately after saying Trump was Goudreau's boss is \\"a clear sign from Luke that he is being forced.\\" Denman, who was 34 years old at the time of the incident, is a former Army Special Forces communications sergeant who left the Army in December 2011. During his five years in the Army, Denman was trained in field medicine and deployed to Iraq at least once. Texas Monthly wrote that after his separation from the Army, Denman \\"seemed, like many combat veterans, to be unable to find excitement and meaning in post-military life, missing his closest buddies and the fulfilling ideal of service to country.\\" He had worked jobs as a security guard, and then as an offshore welder out of Louisiana before moving to Oregon in the fall of 2019. Denman's home town is Austin. Denman reportedly believed the United States government backed the naval attack. Denman's childhood friend, Daniel Dochen, told The Wall Street Journal that Denman believed the operation had personal approval from President Trump. A lifelong friend of Denman also reported that Denman indicated in October 2019 that one of his friends from the military was in the process of obtaining government approval for training operations or operations aimed at paving the way for more substantial engagement by the United States government. Denman reportedly told his father \\"that he had a job offer in Florida that he couldn't talk about,\\" though he did not disclose it had anything to do with Venezuela. He did say, however, that \\"it was the most meaningful thing he's ever done.\\" Denman's mother told reporters that she \\"had no idea\\" of his intention to participate in a military operation in Colombia. Similarly, Luke's girlfriend since 2014, told the Military Times she was unaware of the planned operation. Denman's girlfriend reported she \\"didn't know very much, other than Luke trusted [Goudreau] and that he had a job opportunity with him.\\" In the weeks following the attack, Luke's brother, Mark Denman, an attorney, took on the task of advocating for the release of both Luke Denman and Airan Berry. === Airan Berry === Airan Berry, who was 41 years old at the time of the raid, was a special forces engineer sergeant in the Army from 1996 to 2013. Berry deployed to Iraq in from March to June 2003, from November 2004 to June 2005, and from February 2007 to March 2007. During his career, he obtained a multitude of decorations and designations, including the Ranger tab, the Parachutist Badge, and the Special Operations Diver and Diving Supervisor Badges. Berry was also subject to interrogation which was videotaped and presented in parts on state television on 7 May, during a press release presented by the Vice President of Communication, Tourism, and Culture, Jorge Rodr√≠guez, from Miraflores Palace. Venezuela's state-run media aired footage of Berry saying that the operation's planners met with Elkin Javier L√≥pez Torres, whom the Maduro government described as a \\"drug trafficker\\". During his interrogation, Berry said that he was to advise the capture of an airport and the extraction of Maduro along with his officials. The video ends with Berry showing a document allegedly signed by Guaid√≥ and Goudreau. Berry is married to his wife of 19 years, Melanie, who is German-American. In the aftermath of the event, among the identity documents exhibited on television by Maduro's officials was a driver's license issued to Berry in Schweinfurt, Germany, where Berry, his wife, and two children lived since 2013. Berry's home town is Fort Worth, Texas, where his father lives. Berry also had previously made several social media posts in support of QAnon, a far-right conspiracy theory centered on U.S. President Donald Trump that has been linked to several violent incidents. === Criminal charges and extradition requests === On 8 May, the Attorney General appointed by the Constituente Assembly, Tarek William Saab, announced that Luke Alexander Denman and Airan Berry would face charges for terrorism, conspiracy, \\"illicit trafficking of weapons of war\\" and \\"(criminal) association.\\" These charges carry a maximum prison sentence of 25 to 30 years. Saab also announced that his office requested arrest warrants for Jordan Goudreau, Juan Jos√© Rend√≥n, and Sergio Vergara. Speaking on state television, he said that the three persons were involved in the \\"design, financing and execution of this war action against the territory, the authorities and the people of Venezuela.\\" He elaborated that \\"given that they are outside the country, we will request their inclusion in the Interpol system, as well as their extradition to Venezuelan territory.\\" William Saab announced on 15 May 2020 an arrest warrant against Popular Will politician Yon Goicoechea. Goicoechea rejected the accusations of any involvement with Operation Gideon, and accused Maduro's administration of paying and leading the uprising attempt to victimize itself and \\"persecute political dissent\\". On 16 May 2020, according to a press release published by Venezuela's highest court, several trial courts dedicated to terrorism-related crimes ordered that some 40 individuals alleged to have participated in the raid be remanded to preventive detention. Antonio Sequea Torres was also in pretrial confinement and charged with commission of aggravated intentional homicide in connection with his alleged attempt to assassinate Maduro. The Supreme Tribunal of Justice also indicated that most of those involved in the operation are alleged to have committed the crimes of treason, rebellion, arms trafficking, criminal conspiracy, and colluding with a foreign government. Local newspaper El Pitazo reported that the mother of one of the accused had demanded assurance that her son was alive after receiving a phone call from her son requesting his brother's telephone number \\"so that they would stop torturing him.\\" Five individuals who have been accused by the Maduro administration of participation in the operation, including the two detained American mercenaries, had not been publicly charged as of 16 May. State television aired an additional video of Airan Berry on 18 May, in an orange jumpsuit, answering questions about the planning of the raid. According to Berry's videotaped statement, Antonio Sequea Torres and the drug trafficker Elkin Javier L√≥pez, better known as Doble Rueda [], also referred to as la silla [] ‚Äì met multiple times during the planning period of the operation in order to coordinate logistics. The estate of L√≥pez Torres in the Colombian Guajira is alleged to be the point of departure for the two boats involved in the raid. The Valledupar-based L√≥pez Torres was arrested in December 2019 and his extradition was requested by the United States. An additional interrogation video depicting Luke Denman in an orange jumpsuit was also aired on state television on 18 May 2020. In the video, Luke indicates that his objective in embarking on the operation, as relayed by Jordan Goudreau, was to arrive in Colombia to train Venezuelans, accompany them to Venezuela for the landing, and once the Venezuelan dissidents' objectives had been achieved, \\"put Maduro on a plane,\\" and provide support at the airport in order that humanitarian aid could arrive. As of 21 May, 66 arrests took place and 99 arrests warrants had been issued, 63 of which remained outstanding.  Terrorism charges  Venezuelan Attorney General Tarek William Saab put forth a request to the Supreme Tribunal of Justice to declare Guaid√≥'s political party Popular Will a terrorist group due to the attempted sea incursion. Saab's request asked for the tribunal \\"to determine if the Voluntad Popular political organization is a terrorist organization\\". Guaid√≥ responded to the charges, stating that Maduro defends \\"irregular groups\\" like the National Liberation Army and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.\\"  Sentences  After Luke Denman and Airan Berry, admitted to \\"conspiracy, association (to commit crimes), illicit trafficking of war weapons and terrorism\\" a Venezuelan court sentenced the two to 20 years in prison for their part in the attack aimed at overthrowing President Nicol√°s Maduro. The sentencing took place on 6 August 2020.https://www.dn.pt/mundo/20-anos-de-prisao-para-dois-ex-militares-dos-eua- envolvidos-em-invasao-falhada-da- venezuela-12506499.htmlhttps://www.france24.com/en/20200808-venezuela-jails- two-americans-over-failed-invasion === Maduro government response === The Los Angeles Times writes that \\"For Venezuelan President Nicol√°s Maduro, it's the propaganda gift that keeps on giving, buoying a leader long in Washington's crosshairs\\" and that the failed operation \\"quickly became a Maduro rallying cry, a Bay of Pigs in miniature, complete with a pair of captured U.S. gunmen\\". Human Rights Watch criticized Maduro for alleging that the human rights NGO PROVEA had connections to the United States Central Intelligence Agency after the organization called for due process of the captured militants. Human Rights Watch wrote: \\"An international community that's closely watching what happens in Venezuela needs to send the message loud and clear: subjecting human rights defenders to politically motivated prosecution, detention or other abuses would be crossing a line for which those responsible will have to answer\\". ==Reactions== === Domestic ===  Maduro government  The Maduro administration accused the United States and Colombian governments of masterminding the attack, which both denied. Goudreau has also denied receiving any help for his operation from US and Colombian authorities. Vice President Delcy Rodr√≠guez called Goudreau \\"a supremacist fanatic\\" and warned that \\"the Venezuelan women are waiting for you, for free, but with deep homeland passion.\\" Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza criticized foreign governments and international organizations for their \\"deafening silence in the face of the mercenary aggression against Venezuela\\" and said that \\"the same people who always condemn us immediately based on biased or false information, today remain silent in the face of such a serious and full case of evidence.\\" He added that \\"all those involved in the armed aggression against Venezuela confess that they trained in Colombia, with the knowledge of the Bogot√° government and the financing of drug traffickers from that country.\\" Luis Parra, the president of the pro-Maduro National Assembly, stated \\"The deputy Juan Guaid√≥ must give an explanation to the parliament and the country, about his alleged participation in Operation Gideon, according to the testimonies of those involved in it and the contract with his alleged signature\\" and said that his National Assembly would investigate Guaid√≥ regarding the allegations.  Opposition  J.J. Rend√≥n, who resigned due to his interactions with Silvercorpalt= Juan Guaid√≥ has accused the Maduro administration of \\"trying to create a state of apparent confusion, an effort to hide what's happening in Venezuela,\\" citing recent events like the gasoline shortages, the Guanare prison riot, a violent gang battle in Caracas, and the COVID-19 pandemic in Venezuela. Guaid√≥ also demanded that the human rights of the detainees be respected. Iv√°n Simonovis, security and intelligence commissioner for the Guaid√≥ administration, stated that the events in Macuto would be used by the Maduro government as a pretext to harass opponents and intensify repression, saying that Guaid√≥'s administration would investigate the events and clarify its details. According to J.J. Rend√≥n, the operation was compromised for months and that intelligence gathered by the Maduro government allowed the Venezuelan armed forces to set the militants up for an ambush, in order to create a \\"montage\\" of the events. The opposition political party Justice First demanded that Guaid√≥ immediately dismiss the officials involved with the plot and charged that they \\"used his government's name for individual purposes.\\" Julio Borges, Guaid√≥'s foreign minister, called for the dismissal of all officials related to the plot, stating \\"we worry that energies are put into the creation of a bureaucratic caste and not into political change.\\" J.J. Rend√≥n and , who initiated talks with Silvercorp about the operation, resigned from Guaid√≥'s team on 11 May, with Guaid√≥ thanking the two for \\"dedication and commitment to Venezuela\\". According to a Guaid√≥ aide, the two officials \\"sacrificed themselves\\" in order to prevent \\"further embarrassment\\" towards the opposition.  NGOs  The human rights NGO PROVEA asked about the well-being of the people arrested in Macuto and in Chuao and indicated that the Attorney General appointed by the Constituent Assembly, Tarek William Saab, and the Ombudsman appointed by Maduro, Alfredo Ruiz, would be responsible for possible forced disappearances or torture of the detainees, while stressing that it would only support and promote peaceful and constitutional means that lead to the \\"restoration of democracy in the country.\\" Maduro accused PROVEA of being \\"financed by the CIA\\" and giving coverage to \\"terrorists\\" as a response, accusations that PROVEA rejected. The Futuro Presente Foundation was accused by Maduro's administration of financing the operation. Futuro Presente categorically rejected the accusations of the participation of the organization and any of its members, alleged they were being persecuted, asked for it to end, and said that it was based on \\"completely false and unfounded accusations.\\" === International === *: The Colombian government rejected the accusations, calling them an attempt by the \\"dictatorial regime of Nicol√°s Maduro\\" to divert attention from problems in the country. President Iv√°n Duque M√°rquez said that he did not sponsor invasions or tricks in response to the accusations and stated \\"I do things up front because I am a defender of democracy.\\" *: The Russian Foreign Ministry said that United States' denial was \\"unconvincing\\" and pointed to earlier warnings made by the Trump administration that \\"all options\\" are on the table, including the possibility of military action. It also said that the actions of the mercenaries deserve \\"unequivocal and decisive condemnation.\\" **On 20 May 2020, Russia convoked a virtual open debate of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) for the purpose of urging the members of the council to condemn the attack as a threat to peace in Venezuela and to security in the region. The United States doubled down on its previous denials of any involvement in the operation, and accused the Maduro government of using the event as a pretext to persecute political dissidents and distract from other problems in Venezuela. Russia reasserted its assessment that the statements by the United States government that it had no knowledge of the operation were dubious in light of the attackers' plans to fly their captives to the United States. Russia's U.N. ambassador, Dmitry Polyansky, asked how does the attack correlate with the \\"all options are on the table\\" messages. *: Various US officials (including President Trump) have denied the accusations made by the Maduro administration. **President Donald Trump said that the incident \\"has nothing to do with our government.\\" Speaking on Fox News, Trump said \\"If I wanted to go into Venezuela, I wouldn't make a secret about it.\\" and said that the operation would be called an \\"invasion\\" if he sends an army into Venezuela. **Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that there was no US government direct involvement in this operation and added: \\"(If) we'd have been involved, it would have gone differently.\\" Regarding the detention of two Americans, Pompeo said that the US will use \\"every tool\\" available to secure the return of Americans if they are being held in Venezuela. **Secretary of Defense Mark Esper told reporters at the Pentagon that \\"the United States government had nothing to do with what's happened in Venezuela in the last few days.\\" **A State Department spokesperson said that Maduro government has been consistent in its use of misinformation in order to shift focus from its mismanagement of Venezuela. It also said that there was \\"little reason to believe anything that comes out of the former regime.\\" == See also == *Machurucuto incident *Attack on Fort Paramacay *Caracas helicopter incident *Colombia‚ÄìVenezuela relations *El Junquito raid *Golpe Azul *2018 Caracas drone attack * 2019 Venezuelan uprising attempt ==References== Category:2020 crimes in South America Category:2020 in international relations Category:2020 in Venezuela Category:Battles in 2020 Category:Crisis in Venezuela Category:May 2020 crimes Category:May 2020 events in South America Category:Venezuelan presidential crisis Category:Violence in Venezuela Category:Violent non-state actor incidents in South America Category:Insurgencies in South America Category:Rebellions in Venezuela Category:Covert operations Category:Political repression in Venezuela Category:Naval battles involving Venezuela Category:Diplomatic incidents Category:International maritime incidents Category:Colombia‚ÄìVenezuela relations Category:United States‚ÄìVenezuela relations ","title":"Operation Gideon (2020)"},{"id":"63862689","text":"Winborn, also known as Reids Switch, is an unincorporated community in Benton County, Mississippi, United States. ==History== The area surrounding Winborn was found to have large deposits of carbonate iron ore.

She is a Professor in the Department of Political Studies at the University of the Witwatersrand, where she is also affiliated with the Institute for Social and Economic Research. In 2019 she became a Canada 150 Research Chair in Gender and African Politics, beginning a seven-year term in the Institute for African Studies at Carleton University. Hassim was the first black woman full professor of political science in South Africa. ==Career== Hassim holds a PhD from York University in Toronto. In 2006, Hassim published the book Women's organizations and democracy in South Africa: Contesting authority, in which she uses archival research, interviews, and observational studies to analyse the role of women in the South African liberation movements of the 1980s and 1990s. Hassim particularly focuses on the tension between the ideologies of feminism and nationalism as motivators for the women's movement in the last several years of Apartheid and the first few years of democratic governance. Part of this tension stemmed from the perception that issues important to women specifically were distractions from the goal of dismantling the racist political system, even though women were a key constituency in the fight to build a new political regime. Hassim incorporates feminist scholarship from Africa, Latin America, Europe and the United States to demonstrate that the women's organizations she studies were not just feminist or nationalist but rather were both at the same time. Hassim also builds on work by Maxine Molyneux to study the autonomy of the women's movements in South African liberation activism, and particularly to understand the potential for women's activism to be co-opted by one of the other ideologies it followed or employed rhetoric from. Women's organizations and democracy in South Africa won the 2007 Victoria Schuck Award from the American Political Science Association, which is an annual prize granted to the author of the best book published in the previous year on the topic of on women and politics. Hassim was a co-editor of the book No Shortcuts to Power: African Women in Politics and Policy Making (2003) with Anne Marie Goetz, and the co- editor with Eric Worby and Tawana Kupe of Go Home Or Die Here: Violence, Xenophobia and the Reinvention of Difference in South Africa (2008). During the 2017‚Äì2018 school year, Hassim was the Matina S. Horner Distinguished Visiting Professor at The Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University. At Radcliffe she worked on Fatima Meer: Voices of liberation, which she published in 2019. Fatima Meer: Voices of liberation was included on the Mail & Guardian's Humanities Awards 2020 Long List Collection among the best Non-Fiction Monographs.

TMEM275 has two, highly-conserved, helical trans-membrane regions. It is predicted to reside within the plasma membrane or the endoplasmic reticulum's membrane. == Gene == === Locus === In humans, the gene is located on chromosomal band 1p33 on the minus strand. It specifically resides on chromosome 1 at chr1:46,532,166-46,543,969. TMEM275 is 11,804bp long. TMEM275 Gene in genomic location: bands according to Ensembl. The red line representing TMEM275's genomic location within chromosome 1. === Gene neighborhood === Upstream, on the minus strand, of TMEM275 is another gene; KNCN. Birdseye view of TMEM275, pictured here in red, within its gene neighborhood. == Transcripts == The TMEM275 gene encodes four exons, only three of which are included within the final mRNA transcript. Two of those three are within the 5‚Äô UTR and the coding sequence codes for 177 amino acids. TMEM275 is found two have two potential isoforms outside of its reference transcript. The reference isoform does not include exon 1, while isoform X1 has a shortened 5' UTR and isoform X2 has a shortened 3' UTR. However, all versions of mRNA transcripts yield the same 177 amino acid sequence. == Protein == === General properties === The TMEM275 protein contains 177 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 17.2 kDa and a pI of 8.13. TMEM275 was found to have a higher presence of alanine and proline amino acid residues than most proteins. When looking at orthologous proteins sequences within other species, the alanine presence was conserved throughout, but the same could not be said of the proline presence. Analysis was conducted through EMBL-EBI SAPS bioinformatics program. === Primary sequence === TMEM275's protein consists of 177 amino acids. The protein, or polypeptide chain, that is encoded by the coding sequence is made through the process of translation and is shown below among other regions of interest. There is also a poly-A, or polyadenylation signal, towards the end of the 3'UTR. Conceptual translation of TMEM275's mRNA sequence with the amino acids labelled. Also includes some post-translational modifications and sites of interests. === Domains === TMEM275 has two, highly-conserved, helical trans-membrane regions. The regions can be seem within the amino acid sequence above within the conceptual translation in purple. Evolutionary analysis showed that these trans-membrane domains are highly conserved across all ortholog taxa. Viual depiction of the two helical transmembrane domains plotted through Protter and EMBOSS Pepwheel. === Secondary structure === Many programs were used to analyze the predicted secondary structure for TMEM275. It was found to have a highly varied structure. However, prediction data supports the alpha helical structure of the two transmembrane domains. == Regulation == === Gene level regulation ===  Promoter  The predicted promoter region is 1116 bp long and located on chromosome 1 on the minus strand and extends from 46535401- 46536515. Bird‚Äôs eye view of TMEM275 annotated with locations of promoter (yellow), exons (green), introns (grey), untranslated regions (blue) and possible transcription start sites (red).

Representative diagram of TMEM275‚Äôs GXP_8972667‚Äôs promoter, labelled with the top 20 TF binding site matches found by Genomatix and decided by high matrix similarity scores, proximity to possible transcription start sites, and/or high conservation through primates.  Expression pattern  TMEM275's RNA levels are very high at around 11 weeks of gestation within the intestines. Some other notable peaks include the lungs, kidneys, and adrenal tissues at 10, 16, and 20 weeks, respectively. It has also been found that of the 20 human tissues tested, RNA was notably present within fetal brain tissue. Further testing on tissue types lead to the discovery that TMEM275 may have tissue-specificity with the testis, the brain, and the prostate. Along with the thyroid and ovaries. === Protein level regulation ===  Subcellular Localization  TMEM275 is predicted to be within the plasma membrane or the endoplasmic reticulum's membrane.  Post- translational modifications  Various PTMs were analyzed for association with TMEM275. This includes looking for the presence of a SUMO-motif, acetylation sites, the presence of signal peptides, and any O-GlcNAc site and N-myristylation predictions.  Cleavage site  Cleavage site of methionine shown within the amino acid sequence of TMEM275.  Phosphorylation  PTM. Analysis was conducted through NetPhos server and scores are included the bolded locations of possible sites. == Homology == === Paralogs === There are no known paralogs for TMEM275. === Homologs === No homologs or homologous domains exist within TMEM275. === Orthologs === A total of 105 organisms are found to have orthologs with the human TMEM275 genes, all of which are a part of the Teleostomi, or jawed vertebrates, clade. Of the 105 organisms that have an orthologous TMEM275: 49 are mammals, 27 are birds, 3 are turtles, 3 are lizards, 3 are amphibians, 19 are bony fishes, and 1 is an alligator. The group with the most similar sequences by percent identity was unsurprisingly Mammalia. The percent identities of those orthologous proteins in relation to humans ranged from 52.1% to 70.9%. The group that had the orthologous TMEM275, but was the least similar was Actinopterygii or Bony Fishes. Their percent similarities ranged from 38.5% to 47.6%. Percent similarities were found by conducting a pairwise analysis of each orthologous protein within each species against the human protein.

In psychology, the nature and scope of the collaborations can vary in their application and in the benefits it offers. ==What is crowdsourcing?== ===A complement to the traditional way of doing science=== Crowdsourcing is a collaborative sourcing model in which a large and diverse number of people or organizations can contribute to a common goal or project. First examples of crowdsourcing science can be found during the 19th century. A Yale University professor launched a call for open participation of citizens to maximize the number and diversity of observations he could get on the Leonids of 1833 meteor storm phenomenon. Crowdsourced science has been set aside for a long time and has only recently gained popularity in science. Actually, it helps overcoming several limits of the classic model on which science has been conducted up till now. For example, in psychology, scientific research has often been limited by small sample sizes and a lack of diversity in studied populations. These limits can be tackled with a more collaborative approach of scientific research (i.e., crowdsourced science). ===A two-dimensional concept=== Crowdsourcing initiatives can be described along two different continuous axes. The first dimension represents the degree of communication between project members, ranging from very few collaborators and little communication, to a large crowd of collaborators with a rich amount of communication. The second dimension corresponds to the degree of inclusiveness, varying from only selecting groups of people with a high expertise in the field of interest, to open to anyone‚Äîwith or without expertise‚Äîinterested in collaborating. This twofold distinction draws four types of crowdsourced science projects. However, these two dimensions lie on a continuum: A single project is neither entirely inclusive (vs. selective) nor entirely high (vs. low) in communication. ==Why crowdsource psychological science?== ===Limits of the traditional vertical model=== In psychology, the traditional way of doing research follows a vertical model. In other words, most of the time, research is carried out by small teams from a specific lab or university, and organized around one or two main researchers (often referred to as Principal Investigator, or PI). This small team contributes to all different stages of the research project: conception of the research question, design of the study, data collection, data analysis, discussion of the results, and publication of the manuscript. However, vertical science has its own limitations that can impede the progress of science. Conducting science within small independent teams makes it difficult to conduct large- scale projects (with large samples, large databases and high statistical power), which may limit the scope of research. In traditional science, researchers have access to less resources, data, and methodologies. Small, independent team projects are also limited in the feedback they can get from other perspectives. Nowadays, research teams do not necessarily have to make compromises anymore (e.g., small sample size, same stimuli, same contexts and no replication), because much of these limits could be tackled by a more crowdsourced research. ===The replication crisis=== In the scientific method, replicability is a fundamental criterion to qualify a theory as scientific. The replication crisis (or credibility crisis) is a methodological crisis in science that researchers began to acknowledge around the 2010s. The controversy revolves around the lack of reproducibility of many scientific findings, including those in psychology (e.g., among 100 studies, less than 50% of the findings were replicated). Some of its main underlying causes are referred to as ‚Äúquestionable research practices‚Äù (QRPs). These include p-hacking (i.e., exploiting researcher degrees of freedom until a significant result is obtained), HARKing (i.e., hypothesizing after results are known), publication bias (i.e., the tendency among scholarly journals to only publish significant results), statistical reporting errors, and low statistical power often due to small sample sizes. Among these various issues, small sample sizes and the lack of diversity within samples can be addressed through crowdsourced science‚Äîincreasing the generalizability of findings and therefore their replicability as well. Indeed, samples in psychology often rely on college students and Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic (WEIRD) populations. For these reasons, the replication crisis has contributed to the rise of crowdsourced, large-scale projects, especially replication projects held at an international scale like the Many Labs project, and the Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA). These crowdsourced projects aim at solving some issues raised by the replication crisis, more specifically by assessing the replicability of studies and generalisation of the results to other populations and contexts. ===Ambitions of the horizontal model=== In contrast to the vertical model of doing research, the horizontal model‚Äîan inherent principle of crowdsourced science‚Äîmainly relies on variations in terms of inclusiveness and communication. Its core principle is about the non- authority of one or two researchers in terms of resources, ownership and expertise. Following this principle, the different tasks within a project are distributed among many researchers. The whole project is then supported by a team, which ensures the coordination of the contributors. A perfect horizontal model does not really exist because vertical and horizontal models are more conceptualized as extremes of a same continuum. This distributed model of science work is gaining popularity in the scientific community. In about 40 years and across different scientific disciplines, research teams have roughly doubled in size (from 2 to 4 people on average). By encouraging larger crowds to contribute to research projects in psychology, the horizontal model aims at reducing some limits of the vertical one. It has three distinct ambitions: * Carry out wide-ranging works * Encourage a democratized psychological science * Establish robust findings Large-scale research projects The first ambition of the horizontal model is to enable researchers to conduct more large-scale research projects (i.e., ambitious projects that cannot be conducted by small teams). By aggregating various skills and resources, it is possible to move from a model where research is defined by available means, to a model where research itself defines the necessary means to answer the research question. Democratizing psychological science The second ambition of the horizontal model is to compensate for inequalities (e.g., in terms of recognition, status, and success in a researcher's career). Psychology and more generally social sciences show a strong bias of what is called the Matthew effect (i.e., academic advantages going to those who are already the most renowned). Early career researchers from less renowned institutions, less economically developed countries or underrepresented demographic groups are generally less likely to have access to high-profile projects. Crowdsourcing enables such researchers to contribute to impactful projects and gain recognition for their work. Robust findings The third ambition of the horizontal model is to improve the robustness, generalizability, and reliability of findings in order to increase the credibility of psychological science. Horizontal collaboration between research teams facilitates the replication of studies and makes it easier to detect biased effect sizes, p-hacking, and publication bias‚Äîdifferent problems raised by the replication crisis (see also #The replication crisis). ==Crowdsourcing in practice== ===Contributions at different stages of research=== This section aims at detailing how crowdsourcing can contribute to the different stages of the research process, from the generation of research ideas to the publication of the outcomes. Ideation Ideation is the first step of any research project. In psychology, it refers to the process of defining the general idea behind a project‚Äîpurpose, research question, and hypotheses. This step can be done in collaboration between several researchers to scan a broader spectrum of ideas and select those of broadest interest and impact. Faced with a research question, the different collaborators can bring their expertise in the construction of hypotheses. Crowds can also help to generate new ideas to solve complex-problems, such as illustrated by the Polymath project. Assembling resources When assembling resources, crowdsourcing can be useful, especially for labs with less resources at their disposal. Online platforms such as Science Exchange and Studyswap allow researchers to establish new communication lines and share resources between labs. Matching resources from labs across the globe minimizes waste and facilitates research teams‚Äô ability to meet their goals. Sharing tasks across labs can improve the efficiency of a research project, especially highly time- consuming ones. In biology, for example, studying the entire genome takes a lot of time. By distributing its investigation and combining resources across multiple labs, it is possible to accelerate the research process. Study design There can be many ways to design a study. Research teams across the world neither have the same theoretical background, nor are they all equipped with the same materials. Crowdsourcing can be useful in the case of conceptual replications (i.e., testing a same research question through different operationalizations). When testing a same research question, variations in study designs can lead to strong variations in effect size estimations. Diversifying the methods used to test the same hypothesis across different populations‚Äîthrough collaborative projects‚Äîenables better estimations of the true consistency of a scientific claim. Data collection In psychology, data collection often relies on samples drawn from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic (WEIRD) populations, which impedes the overall generalizability of findings. Crowdsourcing the data collection process by relying on multi-lab data collection and online crowdsourcing platforms (e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk, Prolific) makes it easier to reach a wider audience of participants from different cultural backgrounds and non- WEIRD populations. When the research question makes it possible to rely on internet samples, it is also an easy way to recruit larger samples of participants with minimal financial input and within short amounts of time. Most of the time, members of the general public are recruited to undergo studies as research participants but they can also be recruited to collect data and observations. Data analysis In research, data analysis refers to the process of cleaning, transforming, and modeling data using statistical tools, often with the purpose of answering a research question. Within a research project, this is typically done by a single analyst (or team) and results in a single analysis of a dataset. Analytic strategies can differ greatly from one team to another. For example, a study found that among 241 published articles on fMRI, 223 different analytic strategies were used. Moreover, there can be many ways to test a single hypothesis from the same dataset. Although defensible, decisions in data analysis remain subjective, which can greatly affect research results. A way to counter this subjectivity is transparency. When data, analytic plans, and analytic decisions are made transparent and open access to the rest of the community, it facilitates criticism and gives the opportunity to explore alternative ways to analyse data. ‚ÄúCrowdsourcing the analysis of the data reveals the extent to which research conclusions are contingent on the defensible yet subjective decision made by different analysts.‚Äù‚ÄîUhlmann et al., 2019 Writing research reports A research report is a document reporting the findings of a research project. The overall quality of a research report can benefit from crowdsourcing practices, especially during the writing process. Aggregating a large number of contributors increases the range of expertise and perspectives, which contributes to build more solid arguments. It also makes proofreading easier (e.g., catching grammatical errors, weird phrasing, typos, biases, factual errors, claim-checking). To facilitate collaborative writing, some researchers have suggested guidelines for writing manuscripts with many authors. There should always be a leading author (or a few, but with individual responsibilities) who takes care of managing the writing process and takes explicit responsibility for any mistake‚Äîavoiding diffusion of responsibility in case of errors. It is also recommended that the leading author(s) follow the four general principles mentioned below: * Care in crediting the coauthors team * Clear and frequent mass communication * Make sure materials associated to the manuscript are well-organized * Early and deliberate decision-making Peer review Before getting published in an academic journal, submitted papers undergo peer review (i.e., the process of having an author's academic work reviewed by experts from the same field). Typically, it is performed by a limited number of selected reviewers. Crowdsourcing the peer review process increases chances of getting reviews from a larger number of experts in the relevant domain. This is also a way to significantly increase opportunities for better criticism and faster fact- checking before an article gets published. Crowdsourced peer-review can be accomplished alongside open access peer-review (e.g., through centralized platforms dedicated to the discussion and criticism of research reports). ===Examples in psychology=== The replication crisis served as a prelude for the emergence of many large-scale collaborative projects. Some of the most important ones include the ManyLabs project, the ManyBabies project, the Reproducibility Project, the Collaborative Replication and Education Project (CREP), and the Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA). ===Projects surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic=== In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, several initiatives to improve collaboration between scientists from a variety of fields have been launched. Studies exploring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on behavior and mental health are conducted and widely shared across social media such as Twitter. In this context, the PSA made a call for studies surrounding the COVID-19 disease and retrieved 66 study proposals from different experts within one week. At the date of May 2020, three studies have been selected and are being conducted worldwide. Two of these studies aim at reaching a better adoption of health behaviors to avoid the spread of COVID-19, and one aims at helping people regulate their negative emotions during the crisis. This project aims to get results that could help all countries to face the pandemic with means adapted to their population. ==Challenges and future directions== ===Confronting the vertical and horizontal models=== Although a horizontal model of conducting science seems promising to overcome some limits of the vertical model (see also #Limits of the traditional vertical model and #Ambitions of the horizontal model), it is difficult to empirically assess its benefits. It remains unclear whether two sets of research that study the same question‚Äîeither through a vertical or horizontal way of doing science‚Äîwould lead to different outcomes or not. ===Financial independence=== Currently, to sustain a collaborative project, researchers either have to use money from their own grants or apply for fundings. Such projects are thus limited in the studies they can conduct without financial independence. Coordinating hundreds of labs to conduct a study requires consequent administrative work. Structures like the Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA) have to ensure each participating lab retrieves ethics approval to conduct a given study (see also Institutional review board). Within the PSA, this background work is currently completed voluntarily by dedicated teams or researchers beside their main occupation. By reaching a financial independence (as it is the case for the CERN), these projects could optimize their functioning through the opening of jobs dedicated to these missions. ===Authorship in the era of crowdsourced science=== A researcher's career path in the academic world (i.e., job opportunities, grant attributions, etc.) depends on major contributions to research projects, which is often assessed through the amount of publications where one appears as the lead author. In psychology, it is common practice to list authors in order of contribution, with involvement decreasing as we move down the list. Truth is, it is not rare that multiple authors on the same paper contributed equally to the project, but in different ways. In that sense, contributors on a project do not always get the credit they deserve‚Äîas the order the authors are listed in does not capture well the contribution of each author. This is especially true for large-scale collaborative projects with many contributors (e.g., the PSA001 project has over 200 contributors). An alternative to the current authorship system is the CRediT taxonomy, a taxonomy describing 14 distinctive categories (e.g., conceptualization of the project, administration of the project, funding acquisition, investigation) that represent the roles typically played by contributors in a scientific project. Papers relying on this taxonomy allow for a more representative description of the involvement of each contributor on a project. ===Developing open-science and crowdsourced practices=== The enrolment of students through different collaborative projects could foster open science and crowdsourced practices early in a researcher's career. For instance, in the Collaborative Replication and Education Project (CREP), students are taught the roots and importance of such practices toward the replication of recent major findings in psychology. Editorial policies of scientific journals also play a role in the adoption of open science and crowdsourced practices, especially by defining new publication criteria. For instance, more than 200 journals now adopt an ‚Äúin principle acceptance‚Äù format of peer-reviewing papers. In this publishing format, articles are accepted for publication prior to data collection, on the basis of the provided theoretical framework, methodology, and analysis plan. ===Remaining issues=== Flexibility in data analyses and other biases that collaborative projects should address by aggregating experts are not always overcome. It has also been shown that crowdsourced projects involving low-trained and low-involved actors (e.g., students) can lead to the falsification of data. Linking up a wide array of contributors can thus imply structural problems that may impact research outcomes. Both issues highlight the importance of educational practices on open science and crowdsourced practices (see also #Developing open-science and crowdsourced practices). ==Controversies== Controversies surrounding crowdsourced science do not directly involve a criticism of crowdsourced science itself, but rather its costs‚Äîboth in terms of financial and time investment. Collaborative practices in research remain very expensive and face an important number of challenges. Solutions to address these challenges require important structural changes within research institutions and have important repercussions on researchers‚Äô academic careers (see also #Challenges and future directions). The shift from a vertical model toward a more horizontal one was partly motivated by the replication crisis in psychology. However, some authors are skeptical about the extent of this crisis in psychology. According to these authors, the failure to replicate most findings is overestimated and mostly due to a lack of fidelity in replication protocols. These claims mitigate whether large collaborative research projects are worth the cost, suggesting that a shift towards a horizontal model of doing science may not be necessary. Given the cost of crowdsourced projects and the resources they require, crowdsourcing may not always be the most optimal approach. Nonetheless, the crowdsourced science approach helped the development of tools from which any project‚Äîeither collaborative or not‚Äîcan benefit. An optimal approach would be a compromise between both vertical and horizontal models, which would depend on the research question at hand and on the constraints of each project. ==See also== * Crowdsourcing * Citizen science * Open science * Replication crisis * Reproducibility Project * Scientific method ==External links== * Psychological Science Accelerator * Science Exchange * Study Swap ==References== Category:Psychology Category:Crowdsourcing ","title":"Crowdsourced psychological science"},{"id":"63862974","text":"The Nasarawa State House of Assembly is the unicameral legislature of Nasarawa State in Nigeria.

He was the son of Rev. Job Edwards (1802-1871) and his second wife Susannah Haywood (1808-1895). James attended Pennington Seminary (today The Pennington School) and graduated from Wesleyan University in 1860.

He intended to study law under William L. Dayton, but these plans were cut short after Dayton was sent to France as its new ambassador. In 1862 James married Emma Atwood Baker (1838-1921). Their children were Grace Ella Baker (1864-1921), Laura Alice Lyman (1868-1944), and Florence Emily Sumwalt (1876-1959). He enlisted in the 11th Regiment Rhode Island Volunteer Infantry to fight in the Civil War. He enlisted as a private, but was immediately given a commission by Governor William Sprague as second lieutenant. He was quickly elected first lieutenant of a company of YMCA volunteers. He was later made adjutant of a parole camp outside of Alexandria. When he left the army in 1864, James returned to the East Greenwich Academy, where he was elected principal. He was also elected to the Rhode Island Senate, where he served from 1865 to 1869. While in the Senate, he helped to get the Fifteenth Amendment and a prohibition bill passed in the Senate, although both failed in the Assembly. In 1868, John was a Presidential Elector for Ulysses S. Grant, and was a Rhode Island Delegate for the 1866 National Union Convention. In 1870, James left Rhode Island for the Chamberlain Institute in Randolph,Cattaraugus County, New York. He served as principal of the Institute for the next 22 years, resigning in 1892. He also received a Degree of Divinity from Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania in 1876, and in 1890 was made a Doctor of Laws. In 1891, the Republican James was nominated for the New York State Senate's 32nd District (Cattaraugus and Chautauqua counties) by the Democratic Party, the People's Party, and an Independent Republican Party. He won the election over Commodore P. Vedder and served in the State Senate in 1892 and 1893. After he left the State Senate, he served as principal of McDonogh School in Owings Mills, Maryland from 1893 to 1898. James was a Methodist minister, and was an elected delegate to the 1884 and 1892 General Conferences of the M. E. Church, a delegate to the 1884 Methodist centennial, and a member of the 1893 World's Parliament of Religions. James died on August 20, 1914 in his family home in Randolph. He was buried in Randolph Cemetery. == References == == External links == *History of Cattaraugus Co., New York: With Illustrations and Biographical Sketches of Some of Its Prominent Men and Pioneers.

The building is listed as neo- Gothic style, but after the renovation in 1959, almost the entire interior of the church was changed. The church's original altarpiece, a copy of Adolph Tidemand's altarpiece at Tyristrand church, was then replaced with a new, painted wooden relief by Maja Refsum with the motif of Jesus in Gethsemane. The church's interior was redone in 2007. A new altar table was installed on a platform at the front of the nave, while the choir appeared as a separate chapel. The choir's walls were dressed with monotypes by Borgny Farstad Svalastog. The exterior appears today as when the church was finished with the exception of the entrance doors that were replaced in 1959. The church was re- roofed in 2007, and the old slate roof was replaced with a new one except for the tower where the slate plates were removed and copper plates were laid. The church can seat 650 people. A medieval stave church was demolished in 1733 and replaced with a timber church with a cruciform floor plan erected some tens of meters northeast of the stave church, in the corner of the old cemetery.

He has served as sheriff of Charleston County, South Carolina, since February 1988 and is serving his eighth term in office. == Early life == Cannon was born October 9, 1946, in Charleston, South Carolina, to Margie Elizabeth Fuller Cannon and James Alton Cannon, a World War II veteran. His parents owned and operated a grocery store in North Charleston before his mother went on to become a judicial clerk and later the first female judge in Charleston County. Cannon was raised in North Charleston, where he attended Chicora High School and played on the varsity basketball team. He was known for his hook shot. After graduation in 1964, Cannon entered a pre-law program at the University of South Carolina, where he studied until dropping out to join the U.S. Air Force in 1967. === Military service === In the military, he studied Russian at Syracuse University and became a Russian translator for the Air Force Security Service stationed at Tempelhof Air Base, West Berlin, during the Cold War. He served in that role for the last 30 months of his active-duty deployment, which ended in 1971. In 1978, Cannon joined the Air Force Reserve and was commissioned as a second lieutenant. In his career as a reservist, Cannon worked as a special agent with the Air Force Office of Special Investigations. He directed felony criminal investigations and participated in counterintelligence and anti- terrorism operations. He was deployed in various countries, including Egypt, Peru, Bangladesh and Japan. Active-duty deployments came for months at a time during his tenure as sheriff in 1992, 1995, 1996 and 1999, when he served for 60 days as deputy commander of the U.S. military's joint counterintelligence office in support of American air war efforts in Kosovo. Meanwhile, his assistant sheriff, Kathy Hare, took the reins of the agency. Through these experiences, Cannon became known as an expert on counterterrorism and counterintelligence. Cannon retired from the Air Force Reserve in October 2006 as a colonel, a capacity in which he served as reserve commander of the 3rd Field Investigations Region at Scott Air Force Base in Illinois, where he led investigative, counterintelligence and counterterrorism support to fifteen Air Mobility Command bases nationwide. == Early law enforcement career == After leaving the active-duty Air Force, Cannon enrolled in a bachelor's degree program at the College of Charleston. In the six months he waited before starting class, he signed up in 1971 to be a patrol officer for the Charleston County Police Department. After graduating from the College of Charleston in 1973, Cannon was hired at the North Charleston Police Department shortly after the founding of that agency and the city in 1972. As a patrolman in 1974, he was appointed by the North Charleston police chief to form a police-community relations program. As a corporal in 1974, he was named the department's public information officer. About three years after his hiring, Cannon was promoted to lieutenant in North Charleston. In 1977, while on the police force, he earned a master's degree in criminal justice, then resigned from the department to pursue a law degree. Cannon earned a juris doctorate from the University of South Carolina School of Law in December 1981 and was admitted to the South Carolina bar the next year. He later was admitted as a member of the U.S. Supreme Court bar. He tried becoming a prosecutor as a deputy county attorney for Charleston County, before being appointed in March 1984 as North Charleston police chief. In August 1987, North Charleston Mayor John Bourne fired Cannon for failing to enforce a city ordinance requiring police officers to be residents of the city. In 1987, Cannon served for a brief time as a captain at the Charleston Police Department before taking a leave of absence to run for sheriff after Sheriff Charles F. \\"Chuck\\" Dawley, 54, died on October 23, 1987, of a heart attack while on a trip in Florida. == Tenure as sheriff == Cannon was first elected sheriff on February 23, 1988, in a special election to complete the rest of Dawley's term. Cannon ran as a Democrat, beating interim Sheriff Michael O'Dowd, a Republican. He won that special election with 20,035 votes to O'Dowd's 6,726. In November 1988, he ran unopposed and won his first full term in office. Among the efforts he told prospective voters he would focus on were jail overcrowding, an outdated computer system and a communications system that didn't permit separate police agencies to communicate with each other. In his first six years in office, Cannon became an independent, then a Republican in 1994. He has remained a Republican in his career since then. Cannon has run unopposed in eight general elections, winning reelection each time. His most significant electoral challenge came in the 1996 Republican primary when retired FBI Agent Bill Nettles, retired sheriff's Captain Paul Hawkins and former Folly Beach Police Chief Steve Shephard ran against him. In the primary, Cannon got 49.6 percent of the vote, 80 votes short of the majority share needed for outright re- election. Nettles had 32.7 percent, Hawkins 12.1 percent and Shephard 5.6 percent. The results forced a runoff in which Cannon took 58.5 percent of the vote. Nettles had argued that he would be a sheriff who would get along with city police chiefs, citing Cannon's disagreements with Charleston Police Chief Reuben Greenberg, who at times had objected to Cannon's deputies enforcing state laws within Charleston city limits, where the agencies technically share jurisdiction. Cannon argued he was not to blame for the dispute and had made numerous services available to the Charleston police. === County law enforcement merger === Following through on early campaign promises to consolidate law enforcement functions in Charleston County, Cannon successfully pushed for the merger of the Charleston County Police Department and the Charleston County Sheriff's Office. In 1937, the South Carolina General Assembly had put control of the police force into the hands of the Charleston County Council instead of the sheriff. The Charleston County Police Department handled primary law enforcement duties throughout the county while the sheriff oversaw the jail, courthouse security and delinquent tax collection. But the county police over its 67-year history was beleaguered by in-fighting, high turnover of personnel and chiefs, and corruption that saw two of the chiefs get convicted of crimes. One of the chiefs had allowed the distribution of untaxed whiskey from police headquarters, and the other was imprisoned for extortion and racketeering. At least 15 officers had also been convicted of crimes. Cannon started pushing for the two agencies to be consolidated shortly after his election. When County Police Chief William Sidoran resigned in March 1990, Cannon campaigned for the move until voters in November 1990 approved it by a slim margin. The Charleston County Council also approved it in a vote, and on January 1, 1991, Cannon took control of the 300-employee county police force. Critics said Cannon had pushed for the consolidation to increase his power base in a bid for higher office. === Countywide police consolidation === After successfully merging the county Police Department and the Sheriff's Office in the early 1990s, Cannon has at times pushed for the consolidation of all city and county law enforcement agencies in Charleston County. The possibility emerged in 2006 as parts of the Charleston suburb James Island attempted to incorporate into its own town that needed its own police services. Town leaders had no plans to start their own police department and instead called on the Charleston County Sheriff's Office to provide law enforcement. While county government leaders pushed for the county to charge the new town for the service, Cannon argued that county law enforcement protection should be free to all who pay county taxes. But he also pushed for a referendum on whether all police services in the county should be consolidated. A similar vote that asked residents to approve the consolidation of all governments in Charleston County had failed in the 1970s. After the town of James Island successfully incorporated in 2012 after years of legal challenges from the neighboring city of Charleston, the town started paying off-duty deputies to patrol the town. === Jail overpopulation === A 2003 report by the National Institute of Corrections faulted Charleston County for an inefficient criminal justice system that carried higher incarceration rates than other counties in South Carolina. Charleston County, which includes numerous law enforcement agencies, had 4.6 inmates per 1,000 residents compared with 2.7 in Greenville County, 2.5 in Richland County and 1.4 in Horry County in the years studied (2000 and 2001). Funded by a grant from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Charleston County Criminal Justice Coordinating Council formed in 2015 and included more than a dozen agencies. It included a \\"cite and release\\" approach for low-level, nonviolent offenses such as shoplifting. Cannon said in a 2016 editorial in The Washington Post that some people wind up in jail despite not needing to be there in the first place. These included minor offenders, homeless people, the mentally ill and drug addicts. === Jail expansion === Throughout his tenure as sheriff, Cannon has pushed for the expansion of the Charleston County jail that he oversees. The facility had suffered overcrowding in the early 2000s, with the capacity in 2003 pegged at 660 inmates but the population topping 2,000. $100 million in funding for a large 2010 addition was secured after Cannon pleaded with the county's governing council. After the expansion, the jail had 21 dormitory units and could hold more than 2,100 inmates. In November 2010, the jail was named the Sheriff Al Cannon Detention Center. === Counterintelligence and security === Cannon has remained active in counterintelligence and cyber security efforts locally and nationally, frequently being named to advisory boards and as a speaker at events. That involvement has included multiple trips to Israel, including one in 2004 sponsored by the National Sheriffs' Association, to learn about efforts by law enforcement to deal with terrorism threats. After a series of crashes involving tractor-trailer trucks in Charleston County, Cannon stepped up enforcement of traffic law violations by commercial vehicles, hoping to stem major incidents exacerbated by the hazardous cargo that the trucks could be carrying. He said at the time that this enforcement was also necessary to potentially stop terrorist threats. He said the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris were a sign of the type of threats to come in the U.S. and called on local law enforcement to step up their game in localized counterintelligence efforts. As Republican leaders in South Carolina argued against admitting Syrian refugees from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in 2015, Cannon said immigration also posed a challenge because of the difficulty of vetting people seeking to enter the country. Cannon holds top secret security clearance. === Gun control === Cannon has opposed increased gun control measures in the wake of mass shootings, including the killings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012. He similarly criticized the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who had visited the Charleston area a month after the July 2012 mass shooting by James Holmes at an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater. Jackson called for a ban on assault weapons, but Cannon said Jackson was taking advantage of a \\"horrendous situation.\\" \\"It would never end until all the guns were gone. Gun control doesn't work as a crime control method,\\" Cannon told The Post and Courier newspaper in August 2012. == Controversies == === Assault and battery charge === On January 30, 2012, Cannon attempted to conduct a traffic stop on Timothy Shawn McManus' pickup truck after it nearly struck his SUV on Mount Pleasant's Hungryneck Boulevard. McManus led Cannon and several deputies on a 25-mile chase that hit 120 mph and wound through suburban and rural areas. On a dirt road in the Francis Marion National Forest, Cannon fired nine shots from a .45-caliber pistol at the tires of McManus' truck. At least two other deputies later shot at the truck until one of its tires shredded, sending the car to the roadside. Dashboard camera footage showed McManus being pulled from his truck, punched at least six times, and detained by four officers. The officers allowed a police dog to bite McManus' right arm for more than 20 seconds. While McManus was handcuffed in the back of a law enforcement car, Cannon confronted him, said \\"What the (expletive) is wrong with you?\\" and then slapped McManus and slammed the door. The next day, Cannon admitted to slapping the handcuffed suspect. \\"That was inappropriate and was especially inappropriate for the head of a law enforcement agency to act in such a manner,\\" he said in a public apology. \\"I'm expected to set the example and I failed to do so in that act.\\" McManus filed a lawsuit stating that Cannon had \\"busted him in the nose\\" and that he needed ‚Äú17 staples to his upper right arm where the dog chewed at and ripped apart his flesh‚Äù and sought $600,000 in damages. The lawsuit was dismissed in March 2015 after McManus failed to attend a court date. The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division arrested Cannon on August 28, 2012, on a misdemeanor charge of third-degree assault and battery. He was later cleared of civil rights violations, and the misdemeanor charge was dismissed after Cannon completed a pre-trial intervention program. Cannon's criminal record was erased after he did 30 hours of litter cleanup and completed an anger management class. No other sheriff's office employees were disciplined or arrested. ===Conditions of Juvenile Center=== Officials with the Charleston County Sheriff‚Äôs Office, in charge of Charleston County‚Äôs juvenile lockup are being sued in federal court by an advocacy group after years of complaints that conditions endanger and traumatize children held there. Since the lawsuit, The children have been moved to the adult detention Center. https://www.postandcourier.com/news/lawsuit-filed-against-charleston-county- juvenile-lockup-alleges-inhumane-conditions/article_2963b512-ccde-11ea- ae14-f39185577218.html The Department of Justice filed a statement with the court stating conditions similar to those alleged in the lawsuit have been found unconstitutional by other courts. The statement says the federal government has investigated, and worked to remedy, other isolation practices much like those mentioned in the lawsuit. https://www.postandcourier.com/news/feds-weigh-in-on-juvenile-lockup-lawsuit- as-sheriffs-office-school-district- respond/article_62c4fb1a-f36f-11ea-a956-37cd52ec2faf.html === Nullification of gun laws === In January 2013, Cannon announced to local press that he would refuse any new restrictions on firearms that he deemed to be in violation of the Second Amendment. He made the comment after President Barack Obama proposed measures including universal background checks and bans on high- capacity ammunition magazines following a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Cannon compared Obama's proposal to Nazism, saying in a press conference, \\"Throughout history, 'I was following orders' or ‚ÄòI was just enforcing the law' is not enough to protect you from liability if you knew or should've known. That didn't work in Nuremberg at the World War II trials.\\" Local business developer Brady Quirk-Garvan, who would later serve as chairman of the Charleston County Democratic Party, started a petition calling for Cannon to resign. The petition received 597 signatures. === Firing of political opponent === In February 2020, Cannon placed longtime Charleston County Sheriff's Deputy Kristin Graziano on leave after finding out she intended to challenge him in the November 2020 sheriff's election as a Democrat. Graziano said Cannon ordered her to surrender her badge after 18 years at the sheriff's office, leaving her to live off of accrued vacation pay until it ran out. Charleston County Republican Party Chairman Maurice Washington criticized the firing as a \\"wrong-headed decision\\" that \\"discourages individuals who have every right to seek public office without fear of retribution.\\" ===2020 campaign expenditure on Wikipedia article creation=== Ethics expenditure disclosures filed with the South Carolina Ethics Commission in July 2020 for Cannon‚Äôa 2020 Charleston County Sheriff campaign showed that the campaign paid a sheriff's office employee $500 to create a Wikipedia page during their off-duty hours. The off-duty employee did not include disclosures required by Wikipedia when creating the article. The off-duty work did not violate South Carolina's ethics rules according to a representative from the South Carolina Ethics Commission. His 2020 opponent Kristin Graziano said to the Charleston City Paper \\"The fact that an employee is doing paid political work for the department head raises some ethical questions, such as the culture of the department and whether employees are feeling intimidated to support their boss.‚Äù == Personal life == Cannon lives in Isle of Palms, a beachside community in Charleston County. In 1971, Cannon married Wallis Baldwin Cannon, a native of Sumter, South Carolina. The couple has two children: a son, James Alton Cannon III, and a daughter, Sara Hanson. They have five grandchildren. Al Cannon III has served as a K-9 deputy at the Greenville County Sheriff's Office in Upstate South Carolina. == References == Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:Military personnel from Charleston, South Carolina Category:Politicians from Charleston, South Carolina Category:People from North Charleston, South Carolina Category:College of Charleston alumni Category:South Carolina sheriffs Category:South Carolina Democrats Category:South Carolina Independents Category:South Carolina Republicans ","title":"Al Cannon"},{"id":"63863440","text":"Little Trout River may refer to: * Little Trout River (Michigan), a tributary of Lake Huron in Presque Isle County, Michigan, United States * Little Trout River (New York), a tributary of the Trout River in New York, United States * Little Trout River (Florida), a tributary of the Trout River near Jacksonville, Florida, United States ","title":"Little Trout River"},{"id":"63863480","text":"Catcher Technology Corporation, is an electronics casing manufacturing company founded on November 23, 1984.

After a brief theatrical run in April 2016, the documentary was quickly pulled when independent theaters reported receiving legal notices of copyright infringement from Tommy Wiseau, the director, writer, producer, and star of The Room. Another attempt to release the film in 2017 to capitalize on the film The Disaster Artist was stymied by Wiseau, who filed an injunction in Ontario courts, preventing a DVD release of the film and setting up a lengthy legal battle. After a final trial in January 2020, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice judge Paul Schabas ruled in favour of the makers of Room Full of Spoons, therefore allowing the film to be marketed and released. He ordered Wiseau to pay roughly $700,000 to them in court costs and lost revenue. ==ReferencesCategory:Documentary films about films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian documentary films ","title":"Room Full of Spoons"},{"id":"63863611","text":"thumb Francisco de Miranda station (Spanish: Estaci√≥n Francisco de Miranda), also known as Rectorado station, is one of the stations of the Valencia Metro in Venezuela. ==History== The system opened in 2006, but Miranda Station was not among the original stations.

She is best known as the founder of the reading network Well-Read Black Girl. Edim received the 2017 Innovator's Award at the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for her work. == Early life and education == Edim was born and raised in Washington, D.C. to Nigerian immigrant parents who had survived the Biafra war. Edim's father moved back to Nigeria in the early 90s; when she was in kindergarten, she and her mother joined him. The two soon returned to the States after Edim fell ill. Her mother, previously a historian, pursued a nursing degree. They frequently visited her father in Nigeria. Edim attended Trinity College on a full scholarship before transferring to Howard University, her father's alma mater, where she studied journalism. == Career == Edim launched Well-Read Black Girl (WRBG) on Instagram after moving to New York City in 2015. An avid reader, the WRBG moniker came from a nickname that her boyfriend gave her printed on a t-shirt for her as a gift. Edim was frequently asked about the shirt by strangers on the subway, which often turned into conversations about what she was reading at the time. Each Instagram post featured an archival photo of an African American woman writer with a caption that featured a quotation by that writer. Eden stated that her goal for WRBG was to develop a community for Black women to discuss their interest in literature by Black women writers. The commenters (mostly Black women) began conversations in the comments, which prompted Edim to launch a Brooklyn-based book club for WRBG. Authors such as Naomi Jackson and LaShonda Katrice Barnett attended the meetings upon her invitation. Edim developed the idea for an annual literary festival of the same name with the help of writer Tayari Jones. In June 2017 Edim used Kickstarter, where she worked full-time, to raise $40,000 for the event. The inaugural festival took place in September 2017 in Brooklyn and sold out. ===Books=== She published an anthology called Well-Read Black Girl: Finding Our Stories, Discovering Ourselves (Ballantine Books) on October 30, 2018. Edim studied anthologies by Toni Cade Bambara to inform the style of the anthology. The book includes authors at various stages in their careers, such as Morgan Jerkins, Jacqueline Woodson, and Jesmyn Ward. Edim wrote the foreword. Of putting together the anthology, Edim stated \\"I was trying to replicate the intimacy you have in a book club within the community, where it feels like someone is sitting next to you and telling you a very personal and loving story.\\" The anthology received positive critical reception. Utibe Gautt Ate wrote in a review for LA Review of Books, \\"The anthology‚Äôs premise, ‚ÄúWhen did you first see yourself in literature?‚Äù is a seemingly simple question each author is asked to illuminate, yet for the black women here it opens a glorious Pandora‚Äôs box and sparks a telling journey of how black girl readers become black woman writers.\\" Publisher's Weekly stated, \\"Speaking directly to black women readers, this book contains a journey from which anyone can derive enjoyment and benefit.\\" Edim is planning the release of two more books: a memoir titled Raised By Books, and a second Well-Read Black Girl anthology. == Accolades == * Innovator's Award, Los Angeles Times (2017) * Hurston/Wright Merit Award, Hurston/Wright Foundation (2019) * Outstanding Literary Work ‚Äì Instructional (Nominee), NAACP Image Awards (2019) == References == == External links == *Official website‚ÄîWell-Read Black Girl Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:21st-century American women writers Category:Businesspeople from Washington, D.C.

In 1878, when Sun Yat-sen was 13 years old, she brought Sun Yat-sen from Macau to Honolulu via boat, so that he could live with his elder brother, Dezhang. Madame Yang returned that same year to China. In 1883, Sun Yat-sen finished his schooling in Honolulu and returned to Cuiheng, where he shortly got in trouble for breaking a statue inside of a temple, and fled to Hong Kong. After the failure of the Guangzhou Uprising in 1895, Sun Yat-sen was placed on the wanted list by the Qing court and his family became at risk of being captured. Lu Muzhen, Sun Yat-sen's first wife, took her children and Madame Yang to stay with Dezhang in Honolulu. Later, Dezhang fell into bankruptcy as a result of funding Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary activities, and all of the members in Honolulu moved to Ngau Chi Wan in Kowloon, Hong Kong. Madame Yang and Dezhang eventually lived at No. 24 Tung Tau Tsuen. == Grave == Madame Yang died at the Tung Tau Tsuen home on July 19, 1910, on her 83rd birthday.

In May 2000, the government contacted Sun Yat-sen's descendants to form long-term maintenance plans for the site. A large hole was discovered on top of the tomb, and the Hong Kong Chung Shan Research Institute began to fund-raise HK$1,000,000 for the repair. The Institute received permission from Sun Yat-sen's eldest grandson for repairs, and emergency repair works were carried out in October 2000. The Antiquities and Monuments Office was tasked with monitoring the grave, and repairing it when necessary. The Antiquities Advisory Board also undertook studies to determine whether to consider the grave a declared monument. In 2017, markers pointing to her grave were vandalized. The Sun Yat-sen Institute's president, Lee Sung-wai, had his friends repair the markers. == Gallery == File:Madam Yang Grave.jpgGravesite File:Madam Yang Grave Closeup.jpgTomb Inscription File:Madam Yang Inscription.jpgStone Inscription File:Madam Yang Grave Pavilion.jpgGrave Pavilion File:Madam Yang Grave Markers.jpgGrave Markers on Fei Ngo Shan road File:Madam Yang Grave View.jpgView from the grave == See also == * Google Maps location of tomb * Hong Kong Sun Yat-sen Institute * Red House (Hong Kong) * Dr Sun Yat-sen Historical Trail * Dr Sun Yat-sen Museum * Sun Yat Sen Memorial Park == References == Category:Sun Yat-sen family Category:1910 deaths ","title":"Madame Yang"},{"id":"63863844","text":"Joshua Pieters (born September 17, 1993) is a South African YouTuber known for pranks on celebrities.

Catalan galley sailing a long. Maltese galley, Catalan style The Catalan galley (formerly galea), has its own entity with respect to the galleries of the other maritime nations (referenced from the s. XIII), since Corominas provides a reference to a Catalan galley from the year 1120 (100 years earlier than the other countries). Joan Corominas. Josep Balari i Jovany. It was a type of warship and trade ship, powered entirely by the power of oars and sometimes by the wind, thanks to the presence of masts with their sails (usually Latin). At least as of the 12th century, the Catalans built the \\"Catalan galleys\\", making extensive use of them for wars with the different maritime republics (as enemies or as allies) or for trade with most Mediterranean ports, guaranteeing trade routes with Catalan consulates. Its use began to decline from the seventeenth century, when they were progressively replaced by sailboats, finally becoming extinct in the late eighteenth century . Nicolas (rev) Aubin. === Captain Galley === The captain's galley was a large galley, accompanied by a subtle, or light, squad of galleys and rowing logs. They regulated subordination, rewards, punishments, dangers, and profits. The men in arms constituted the admiral's guard, in combat, they never had to leave helpless, until they lost their lives. Their ordinary armament was the already mentioned crossbowmen, except what the admiral ordered. They were appropriate people for boarding, and they fought on all occasions; his prize was a quarter of the loot, apart from what the admiral could promise. The most desired prey was the cape's armor and all that the enemies wore at the time of the boarding, since once this was accomplished, they prescribed their rights. All the armed people were directly commanded by the so-called constable. === Combat === On board the Catalan galleys, the battles with other galleys were resolved only on boarding, in which the crews faced each other and, from the 16th century onwards, with arcabus fire . Sometimes the rowers also joined the fight. Compared to the medium-sized galleons, which had twelve to twenty guns of greater caliber and range, the galleys had a fragile structure that was not very resistant to enemy fire, with a maximum of five guns at the bow . In combat the low structure of the galleys was overwhelmed by the high edges of the galleons, while their crew fired from the higher decks.. === The crossbowmen \\"in table\\" === Crossbowmen were the most important offensive forces aboard a traditional galley. And they coexisted for many years with the arcabusseros and artillerymen. Ramon Muntaner was a supporter of professional crossbowmen, only recruited to act as crossbowmen (crossbowmen hired on the table to be agreed; hence the name \\"on board\\"). Ram√≥n Muntaner.√Ångel San Mart√≠n. It was mandatory that every sailor with crossbowman duties in the galleys, had to have two crossbows with two feet and another one with a strap (that had a strap to arm it), three hundred pins, a steel helmet, a stitching (it could be the union of weight and point: heavy-point) or breastplate and sword or saber. The same armament had to be carried by crossbowmen ex officio in smaller ships. * The galleys were the same. Normal galleys only carried two rowers per bank: a dovecote and a postic. The galleys with third parties went with a third rower in each bank: the thirdol. They were faster but the number of professional crossbowmen was smaller. * Some foreign scholars have wanted to translate (without justification or success) the \\"table\\" by a type of castle or protection reinforcement that only the Catalan galleys wore. Charles D Stanton. == Catalan tartanes == Tartane de Nicol√°s de Cardona fishing pearls Definition of tartane: Veitia and Lineage 1670. Tartane in English and in most European languages (although in some it changes to tartana or tartan ) is a small Mediterranean Latin sail boat (or bow-stern rig ) used between the 16th and 19th centuries. The different tartanes were used as couriers, for cabotage, as fishing boats, and as military ships . In their more than three hundred years of history, they had different designs, different numbers of masts and even varied sailing gear. Low on board, the tartanes measured between 16 and 20 m, with a mast perpendicular to the keel planted in the middle, in which a Latin sail (master sail) and a jib called the Polacia were hoisted. There are many cases of mizzen candle tartanes and other cases without mizzen candle. Jos√© Veitia Linaje (1670) refers to the tartanes as \\" levantisco tide \\", being used in navigation to the Indies. In the work \\"Norte de la Contrataci√≥n\\" (Seville, 1672), he points out that: ¬´ Tartanes ... of Latin sails, lifting of levantisks ... but it is necessary to allow them 3 or 4 sailors from foreigners (\\" levantisks \\") for the sails, because the Spaniards do not understand their maneuver\\"...¬ª (referring to the maneuver of the Latin sails).

Bernard Alart, Inventario de la Lengua catalana (Documentos del Rosell√≥n) Tartanes were present in the Western Mediterranean from the Middle Ages until the advent of the steam bous, LA TARTANA CHIOGGIOTTA, Mario Marzari especially in Occitania where these boats were traditional along the Languedoc, Catalonia and Provence coasts Tipolog√≠a de los aparejos latinos en Pierre Blasi for fishing and cabotage throughout the Mediterranean . By extension the same name was also given to fishing nets. Towards the 16th century there is news of a single deck tartane with three small masts in Provence ( France ).

Regarding its military use, one of the first mentions of the tartane in the 17th century is found in the 1614 book, Pantero-Pantera \\"el Armata Navale\\", where there is an explanation of the maneuvers of the tartanes of the navy French. == Etymology == On the origin of the name, there are several sources that refer to the Occitan tartane (a bird of prey), being in Catalan tartana, and . According to studies on the basis of linguistic and literary analysis, the origin of the tartanes would be the coasts of the Gulf of Le√≥n (Roussillon in 1313) where they were initially of smaller dimensions. The word is present in several languages, there are even authors who claim that it comes from the Arabic \\"taridah\\" which means ship. Patrimoine maritime et fluvial - Label BIP . But it is accepted by Corominas and others who defend that its etymology is Occitan by loan of the meaning, since the same Tartan word also designates the common buzzard or other birds of prey, and its origin would be onomatopoeic by imitating the cry of the bird when hunting. Etimolog√≠a dentro del /lexicx.jsp?GECART=0131473 == Images of tartanes == Jean Jouve in the album \\"Plans of all ships sailing the Mediterranean Sea\\" (in French, \\"Dessins de tous les B√¢timents qui Naviguent sur la M√©diterran√©e \\") from 1679, shows these four images of single-mast tartanes: File:Jean Jouve, pl.18, Tartane 4.jpg File:Jean Jouve, pl.16, Tartane 1.jpg File:Jean Jouve, pl.17, Tartane 3.jpg File:Jean Jouve, pl.15, Tartane 1.jpg File:Jean Jouve, pl.19, Tartane 5.jpg File:Jean Jouve, pl.20, Tartane 6.jpg == Bilge pump on Catalan ships == Roman bronze pump (3rd century, Huelva) In the high Middle Ages there does not seem to be any reference of any kind.

They generally carried a central bay bombardment plus a few smaller caliber pieces to port and starboard. The power of these bombards, especially the side ones, was limited because the recoil from the shots shook the ship. == Shipyards of Barcelona == New interior view of the wall, mausoleum and side nave (2013) The shipyards of Barcelona, where all kinds of ships were built until the end of the 17th century, can be considered a great production complex from the Medieval Period and the Modern age, a true great modern factory: where hundreds of men worked, with their various activities, supported by the corresponding guilds, from their neighborhood inside the wall. The galleys were built \\"in series\\", anticipating the shapes of the modern assembly line. The productive capacity of Barcelona was impressive for the time: in 1571, in the imminence of the Battle of Lepanto, fifty ships were launched ready to go to Italy and Greece . In the battle of Lepanto, the Catalans (among others) experienced with great results the galleys made in Barcelona. They were larger and more stable galleys that could load batteries of large-caliber guns and fire in all directions; instead, it was impossible to maneuver the galleys with the oars, so they had to be towed by two smaller galleys. == Dead-reckoning in the Catalan Navy == Reversible bulb with a \\"hanging\\" support with four columns With the Atlantic navigations of the time of the discoveries - apart from the compass - the tables, the astrolabe and the rod of Jacob or the quadrant were necessary, but it must be said that during these navigations - like the Mediterranean navigations - the distance navigated calculated by estimate, and, \\"navigation by appreciation\\" is not possible without an instrument to measure time. === Marine sandglass === For more than 500 years (from 1300 to 1800) the instrument for measuring time at sea was \\"the Ampoule of hours\\". Waters, David W.. In Catalonia there are references of its manufacture since the middle of the 14th century made of Catalan transparent glass according to the formulas of the alchemist Guillem Sedacer, using as a fundent the soda obtained by burning the barrella (its ashes dissolved in water and cast with a sieve have been the basis from the \\"laundry\\" to wash clothes from the Neolithic). The barrella grows on the Catalan coast from Orihuela to Montpellier and the Italian manuals for making Italian glass (La Sedacina and Arte Vetraria) say: \\"bisogna comprare la soda di Spagna\\". In an extensive inventory of the things owned by Charles V of France that were in his possession at the time of his death on September 16, 1380. There is an article cited as \\"heures de naviguer\\" from the king's study to his castle at Saint Germain in Laye, which is described as follows: This \\"orloge de mer\\" or \\"heures de naviguer\\" was sent to him, as a gift, when he was still only a prince (being, therefore, before 1356 when he took the place of his father in prison), by John the hunter, through his aunt Yolanda de Arag√≥n, when Juan asked him for a manuscript by Joan de Mandeville, \\"to translate it into the Aragonese language\\". This point is essential to know the language of the original, since it does not tell you \\" to translate it into the Catalan language \\", which was the most important because it was yours - implying that you did not need any translation - on the other hand, if you had in Catalonia a copy in the Catalan language would not have been requested by her aunt, ergo the Yolanda de Arag√≥n manuscript was in Catalan. The most interesting of this reference from Charles V of France, is that an Ampoule of hours is defined as \\"ung grant orloge de mero\\" (\\"a great sea watch\\"), this together with the fact that the first explanation of its use at sea it appears in \\" the twelfth of the Cresti√† \\" (work by M.Llaurad√≥ on Francesc Eiximenis ) and that it was given to him by his aunt Yolanda de Arag√≥n, suggests that, in this period, the importance of an hourglass was commonly Related to its use at sea and its manufacturing demand, it could have originated from the navigation needs of the Crown of Aragon, a maritime power of the moment in the Mediterranean.

Founded in a treaty of 1113 between the Republic of Pisa and the Count of Barcelona, it had the objective of taking the island from the Muslims and preventing the attack and obstruction of the convoys and ships of the Christian merchants who at that time were sailing in the Mediterranean Sea. Although Mallorca was once again in Muslim power, it served to lay the foundations for the future Catalan naval power and to strengthen business contacts in the Mediterranean. == See also == *Barcelona Royal Shipyard *Ordinamenta et consuetudo maris * Catalan cartography * La Cartograf√≠a Mallorquina * Consulate of the Sea * Antoni Palau i Dulcet * Hist√≤ria de la Marina Catalana * Pr√≥spero de Bofarull y Mascar√≥ * Memorias hist√≥ricas (Capmany) *Tartane == References == == Bibliography == * Capmany Montpalau, Antoni. \\"Ordinances of the naval navies of the Crown of Aragon approved fear the king D.

She was the second ship of the Stoomvaart Maatschappij Nederland (SMN) and was lost after barely two years of service. == Context == === Steamships for the Suez Canal === SS Prins Hendrik was the third ship of the Willem III class, which were the first ships built for the Stoomvaart Maatschappij Nederland (SMN). The SMN was founded in May 1870 for the express purpose of establishing a steam shipping line to Java via the Suez Canal, which opened in 1869. This would require steamships of a \\"new\\" class, the Willem III class. == Characteristics == === Dimensions === SS Prins Hendrik was 352 feet long. It was an increase of 30 feet compared to the first two ships of the class, SS Willem III and SS Prins van Oranje. The change increased the (calculated) cargo size from 2.789 tons GT to 3,065 tons GT. Which is almost 10% more. === Machinery === The compound steam engines were of nominal 400 hp, effective 1,600 ihp. The high pressure cylinder had a diameter of 50 thumbs (either Dutch cm or English inches), the low pressure cylinder of 86 thumbs. Steam pressure was 60 pounds, 6 pounds in the low-pressure cylinder. On average the engine made 53 turns per minute with an average effective power of 1,200 ihp and a speed of 10 knots. === Accommodation === There was accommodation for 90 passengers first class, 32 passengers second class, and 400 soldiers As she was the third ship of the class, the media did not show much interest in the interior. Even so, somebody gave an account of a stylish and luxurious saloon 1st class of 10 meters square with broad comfortable canap√©s, mahogany tables and a buffet. The saloon was painted, and had a piano that passengers could use. The second class saloon was a bit less luxurious. Furthermore, there was a library, a lady's saloon, a smoking lounge, a pharmacy, and an officers mess. The corridor along the cabins was 40 m long. === Complement === The crew of Prins Hendrik consisted of 69 persons, but this was probably not counting civilian staff. == Service == === Construction and transfer === Prins Hendrik was built for Stoomvaart Maatschappij Nederland (SMN) by John Elder & Co. of Govan on the River Clyde. She was launched on 17 August 1871. A strike in Glasgow then delayed delivery, so the first voyage to the East Indies was delayed from 10 to 15 November 1871. On Tuesday 24 October 1871 Prins Hendrik left the shipyard in Glasgow. She would make her trials on Thursday 26 October. After the trials she left Glasgow on Saturday 28 October. At 7:56 in the morning of Thursday 2 November Prins Hendrik of Captain J. Hendriks, arrived before Nieuwediep, and was soon towed into the harbor. This probably happened later than expected, because her departure was simultaneously postponed to 18 November. On the 17th a detachment of troops under Major A.j. Diepenbroek left Harderwijk for Nieuwediep. === First voyage to the East Indies === On 18 November 1871 Prins Hendrik steamed to the Texel roadstead to prepare her departure. On 19 November she finally steamed to sea for her first voyage to Batavia. On Monday 20 November she passed Dungeness at 5 AM. On 3 December she arrived in Port Said, and on 7 December she left Suez. On 29 December Prins Hendrik arrived in Batavia in the early morning. On 13 January she continued to Surabaya. On 16 January 1872 Prins Hendrik arrived in Surabaya. A visitor noted that the ship was very clean, and did not suffer from the stench of mixed paint, oil and tar, which made the stay on steamships in the East Indies so suffocating, and caused so much sea sickness and nausea. Everywhere on board, in the saloons, the cabins and on deck, the air was fresh. The cabins were found to be small, except towards the stern. The cabins on port and starboard had enough ventilation and light. The cabins in the midships were good as long as the ships was at anchor, and everything was open. The space in the regular cabins was small compared to cabins in regular ships (i.e. sailing ships). This was made good by the other rooms, and especially the much shorter trip. On 29 January 1872 Prins Hendrik left Surabaya. On the 1872 return trip Prins Hendrik was towed to Aden by HMS Serapis. On 30 January 1872 Prins Hendrik captain J. Hendriks arrived in Pasuruan from Surabaya. In the early morning of February 1 a dozen boats and tambangans (a local vessel) had assembled. At 6 o'clock these then sailed to Prins Hendrik with music in front. Prins Hendrik saluted the resident, and all flags were hoisted. On board the officers and Louis de Wilde, agent of SMN, welcomed the Resident, the Regent and family, the Lieutenant of the Chinese and his wife and the other guests. These were shown around the ship, and then all sat down to lunch in the saloon. Of course there were many toasts to Prins Hendrik, the SMN etc. By 11 o'clock AM the guests left the ship while Prins Hendrik fired 11 shots to salute the authorities. On 2 February Prins Hendrik left Pasuran carrying about 50 passengers for Batavia, as well 1,400 piculs of sugar and 1,000 piculs of coffee. On 9 February 1872 Prins Hendrik arrived back in Batavia towing the sailing ship Kosmopoliet III. On 15 February 1872 Prins Hendrik left Batavia for the Netherlands. On 2 March 1872, while steaming , she lost her propeller blades. She was noted by the British warship Serapis, which towed her for the last 360 miles to Aden, where they arrived 13 March. Now 600 tons of cargo was unloaded to get the propeller above water, and by 23 March new blades had been attached. Captain Hendriks blamed the loss of the propeller blades on hitting a wreck floating below the surface. In a letter of 23 March he noted that right after feeling the shocks from the breaking blades, the water was sounded and found to be over 30 fathoms (180 feet) deep. In the evening of 27 March Prins Hendrik continued her voyage to Suez. On 3 April she arrived in Suez, and on 6 April she left Port Said. On 16 April she passed Gibraltar. On 22 April Prins Hendrik anchored at Douarnenez in Brittany to bunker coal after consuming too much due to severe storm. In the end bunkering was done in Brest. Later somebody sent a letter claiming that all kinds of wood had been used to keep the machines going when during a storm, the chief engineer discovered that the ship was out of coal. On Friday morning 26 April Prins Hendrik finally continued to Nieuwediep. On 29 April she arrived before Nieuwediep conmpleting her first round trip to the East Indies. === Second voyage to the East Indies === On 1 June 1872 Prins Hendrik captain J. Hendriks started her second voyage to Java. On 15 June she arrived in Port Said. On 19 June she left Suez for Batavia. On 25 June Prins Hendrik arrived in Aden for small repairs to the machine. On 30 June she continued her voyage to Batavia. On 16 July 1872 Prins Hendrik arrived in Batavia. On 26 July she left Batavia for Semarang, where she arrived the next day. There she loaded coffee for a tariff of 120 guilders per last, promising a very good profit. On 4 August Prins Hendrik left Semarang for Surabaya, where she arrived 6 August. She continued to Pasuruan, from whence she left again for Semarang on 14 August. On 19 August Prins Hendrik arrived back in Batavia. On 25 August 1872 Prins Hendrik left Batavia. On 11 September she passed Aden. On 18 September she arrived in Suez. On 20 September she arrived in Port Said, and on 22 September she continued to Nieuwediep. On the 25th she passed Malta. On 7 October she passed Dungeness, and on 8 October she arrived in Nieuwdiep. === Third voyage to the East Indies === On 8 November 1872 Prins Hendrik captain J. Hendriks left Nieuwediep for her third voyage to Java. On 14 November she passed Gibraltar. On 22 November she arrived in Port Said with minor engine trouble. These repairs took some time. On 4 December 1872 Prins Hendrik left Port Said for Suez. On 6 December she left Suez for Batavia. On 23 December 1872 Prins Hendrik anchored at Galle to make some small repairs to the engine. On 31 December 1872 Prins Hendrik arrived in Batavia. On 13 January 1873 she arrived in Surabaya. In late January she continued to Pasuruan. On 8 February 1873 she was back in Batavia from Pasuruan. On 18 February 1873 Prins Hendrik left Batavia for Nieuwediep. On 1 March she arrived in Galle to repair her boilers. On 6 March she left Galle again. On 23 March she arrived in Suez. After some problems with ships stuck in the canal, she arrived in Port Said on 30 March. On 16 April she passed Brest, and on 19 April in the morning she was at Nieuwediep. === Fourth voyage to the East Indies === The fourth voyage of Prins Hendrik to the East Indies was planned for mid-May 1873, but was delayed to 14 June. She was commanded by Captain E. Oort, known for having commanded Willem III when she was wrecked. On board were 400 soldiers with their officers, and 40 extra officers. She also carried two steam launches, four howitzers, 29 crates with rifles, 350,000 rifle cartridges, 38,000 kg of gunpowder., all meant for the Second Aceh Expedition. On 20 June she passed Gibraltar, on 24 June Malta, and on 28 June she was in Port Said. In the morning of 30 June Prins Hendrik arrived in Suez. Here she heard and was asked to assist SS Tromp, which was in trouble in the Red Sea and had been beached in the Gulf of Suez. Prins Hendrik went to search for her. After reaching Ras Ghareb in the early hours of 1 July, she continued about 7.5 km along the coast till Tromp was seen getting smashed to pieces on the cliffs near Ras Shokeir. She was also transporting soldiers and equipment to the East Indies. The troops and crew were seen on shore in tents. After major delays due to bad weather, the passengers, soldiers, bullion and mail were transferred to Prins Hendrik on 2 July, which arrived in Aden on 8 July. On 7 July Prins Hendrik got engine trouble, and so she was towed on the last stretch to Aden by SS Java of competitor Stoomvaartmaatschappij Java. Later, a passenger complained about all the inconveniences of the extra soldiers on board. Prins Hendrik had to undergo repairs in Aden. A ring through which the piston moved was broken. This part could not be cast in Aden, and had to be wrought there, causing a probable delay of 12 days. In the end this was done by the crew using a local workshop. The extra soldiers were disembarked in Aden and would continue on another ship. The mail was transferred to Java. After repairs Prins Hendrik continued her voyage on 23 July. It seems she anchored in Galle, from whence she left on 31 July. On 7 August she arrived in Batavia. By 3 September Captain Oort was known to have been appointed as knight in the Order of the Netherlands Lion. A number of letters were written from on board Prins Hendrik on this trip by an officer. He starts with a letter about the departure from Nieuwdiep. Next came letters desrcibing the ship. and life on board. Together with some other officers he made a visit to Gibraltar. He next described (2-7 July) a visit to Port Said and the rescue of the soldiers from Tromp. He then explains how Prins Hendrik was picked up again by Java, and described a visit to Aden., which he continued to describe on 27 July. Next (4 August) came some words about the soldiers in Aden, and why the extra soldiers did not fit on Prins Hendrik == Fate == Big Brother Island; the lighthouse was built later, in 1883. === Shipwrecked on the Brothers Islands === On 4 September 1873 SS Prins Hendrik captain E. Oort began her final voyage from Batavia. In the afternoon of 21 September Prins Hendrik arrived in Aden, and after bunkering, she would continue the same night. On 26 September 1873 at half past noon Prins Hendrik passed Daedalus Reef at about 7.5 km distance to the W.S.W. On the 27th the crew thought to have passed the El Ikhwa Islands (a.k.a. Brothers Islands) on a course 6‚Äì7 miles E.N.E. of them. Suddenly, at quarter past one in the morning, the first and fourth officer, who were on guard, then suddenly reported these islands in front. Immediately the rudder was turned to port, and the engines were ordered to be reversed. Nevertheless, the port-side of the ship scratched the islands. The engines were then put forward again, and the valves between the bulkheads were opened so all pumps could be used to pump out water. Some minutes later the carpenter and fourth officer reported a meter of water in the hold near the bow. The valves between the bulkheads were now closed, and attempt were made to stop the leak. Meanwhile, course was set W.S.W. for the Egyptian coast. Immediately the boats were readied and provisioned. When the water in the ship continued to rise, a council was held. At ten o'clock six boats were lowered with passengers and crew, and ordered to make for El Qoseir (Kosseir). The passengers were 18 adults and 6 children, as well as 74 returning soldiers. A skeleton crew was left on board to try and save the ship. The ship sunk ever further by the bow, and soon became unmanageable. At three o'clock in the afternoon there was 12 feet of water in the hull and the fires were extinguished. At half past three the machines stopped, and the 14 crew that were left abandoned ship. Prins Hendrik then sunk at about nine o'clock in the evening on in 1,800 feet of water. The rest of the crew then went in search of the other boats. The people on these had bivouaced in the open, and were found near Gouay on the 28th at one in the afternoon. In the afternoon the whole party then continued to Kosseir, part on land, part in the boats, where they arrived in the afternoon. Here they were housed by the governor and population till the Egyptian steam vessel Hedjaz brought them to Suez, where they arrived on 9 October. All that was saved from Prins Hendrik was: Seven boats, 12 rifles, a sextant, a chronometer, a silver watch, binoculars, the Certificate of registry, the log, and the muster roles. === Aftermath === Prins Hendrik seems to have been fully insured, so the direct financial loss for the SMN was limited. The lost cargo was a serious affair for the Dutch government, which lost about 500,000 guilders in profit, which was sourly needed for the Aceh War. After the passengers and crew had returned to the Netherlands, an investigation of the disaster was started by prosecutor Mr. S.J. Hingst. A preliminary investigation of the witness did not put the slightest blame on Captain E. Oort, neither for fault nor for negligence. The captain nevertheless asked for his dismissal. He understood that a captain who had been so unlucky in such a short time-frame (losing two capital ships in two years), would not be favorite for passengers. == References == * == Notes == == External links == *Prins Hendrik I at Scottish Built ships *Prins Hendrik at Stichting Maritiem-Historische Databank Category:Steamships Category:Passenger ships of the Netherlands Category:Ships built on the River Clyde ","title":"SS Prins Hendrik (1871)"},{"id":"63864131","text":"Jonathan Carroll (born 1949) is an American fiction writer.

The film's planned theatrical release on March 27, 2020 was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Director Robert Jury said, \\"The timing has just been so strange with this. While it‚Äôs personally disappointing for me that we don‚Äôt have a theatrical release, in a very strange way, we might have a bigger audience, or at least an audience that maybe can relate to the movie even more because the topic of unemployment is so relevant and prevalent right now.\\" Working Man was released on Apple TV, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play, Vudu and Fandango Now video on demand services on May 5, 2020. ==Reception== On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 93% based on 42 reviews, with an average rating of 7.36/10.

Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times rated the film 3.5 stars out of 4, praising the performances of Gerety, Brown and Shire - noting that \\"Gerety delivers a performance that is simply great.

He added that \\"Billy Brown gives a screen-commanding performance as Walter, who comes across as an exceedingly kind and decent man but is battling to keep the demons inside him from bubbling to the surface\\", and of Talia Shire's performance: \\"Her mannerisms and social awkwardness are reminiscent of Shire's Adrian when we first met her in 'Rocky.'\\" Stephen Farber of The Hollywood Reporter called the film a \\"potent tribute to out-of-work Americans.\\" ==References* Category:2019 films Category:2019 directorial debut films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:2019 drama films Category:American drama films Category:Films about the working class Category:Films not released in theaters due to the COVID-19 pandemic Category:Films set in factories Category:Films shot in Chicago ","title":"Working Man (film)"},{"id":"63864315","text":"Jos√© Gallegos y Arnosa (1892) Jos√© Gallegos y Arnosa (3 May 1857, Jerez de la Frontera - 20 September 1917, Anzio) was a Spanish painter and sculptor; best known for his church and clerical scenes. Biography @ JerezSiempre == Biography == His father was employed by a winery. He was attracted to drawing and painting at an early age. He and his friend, Salvador S√°nchez Barbudo, who shared his interests, frequently visited the studios of Luis Sevil (1817-1893), a local still-life painter. After learning as much as he could in Jerez, he left for Madrid in 1873 with the support of his father's employer, Guillermo Garvey (1834-?). There, he enrolled at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando. At his father's prompting, he initially studied architecture, but soon switched to painting and became a student of Federico de Madrazo. Later, he developed an interest in Orientalist painting; travelling throughout North Africa. In 1878, his painting \\"Arab Wedding\\" was bought by the government. Urged on by Garvey, he used some of the money he received to continue his studies in Italy. By 1880, he had decided to settle in Rome. \\"Gallegos, pintor y escultor jerezano\\" In: Diario de Jerez, 2018 He continued to travel, however, visiting Munich, London, Paris and Berlin, as well taking an occasional trip home. His paintings sold well and he was able to enlist the Van Baerle brothers, of the Netherlands, as his agents. His works were also sold by Arthur Tooth & Sons in London. In 1887, he married Giuseppina Trelanzi, of Milan. They had four children, including the architect, . She died in 1897. Three years later, he married Constance Harding, the daughter of an English clergyman, whom he had met while she was vacationing in Italy with her mother. She was twenty-three years younger than him and they had five children. He was awarded a gold medal at the International Exposition of Fine Arts (1891) in Berlin. His paintings may be seen at museums in Germany, Russia, and throughout North America. One was owned by William Randolph Hearst. Few of his paintings are in Italy, as he rarely exhibited there; possibly out of concern for creating jealousy among the other Spanish-born artists, of which there were many. He spent every summer at a rented villa in Nettuno, near Anzio, where he painted en plein aire and hunted. One day, he was out hunting wild boar, when he fell from a tree and injured his spine. As he was recovering, he died from a stroke while watching a Corpus Christi procession. His death came less than twelve hours after the death of his eldest son, Lucas. They were buried together in Nettuno. ==Selected paintings== File:Gallegos-Arabs.jpgArabs Meditating File:Gallegos-Church.jpgIn the Church File:–ì–∞–ª—å–µ–≥–æ –∏ –ê—Ä–Ω–æ—Å–∞.jpgPlaying Chess File:Gallegos-Dowry.jpgThe Bride's Dowry == References == == External links == * Gallegos y Arnosa website Homepage * More works by Gallegos @ ArtNet Category:1857 births Category:1917 deaths Category:Spanish painters Category:Spanish genre painters Category:Spanish orientalists Category:Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando alumni Category:People from Jerez de la Frontera Category:Spanish emigrants to Italy ","title":"Jos√© Gallegos y Arnosa"},{"id":"63864370","text":"The Mysterious City is a 1988 Cambodian-North Korean film directed by Norodom Sihanouk, former King of Cambodia.

Recorded in January 2020, it was written by M√Ωa with production by hip-hop producer Bink!. A sequel song, \\"You Got Me, Part II\\" serves as a conceptual continuation to its original version. Significantly different from the original version ‚Äì both musically and lyrically, \\"You Got Me, Part II\\" is a sensual, hypnotic ode to throwback 90's R&B;, while lyrically it addresses the protagonist's unexpected feelings for someone she had no intentions of falling for. As tradition and a standalone single, \\"You Got Me, Part II\\" was released on April 20, 2020 in celebration of her debut album M√Ωa (1998). ==Background and release== \\"You Got Me, Part II\\" was first announced as a single during a brief interview with Fox 5 Washington D.C.s anchorman Wisdom Martin. Beginning on April 13, 2020, \\"You Got Me, Part II\\" was made available for pre-order. A week later, \\"You Got Me, Part II\\" was officially released April 20, 2020 on all digital platforms. ==Artwork== Taking to Instagram, M√Ωa uploaded the single's official artwork.

The ensemble is paired with high-waisted skintight pants with a white strip going down to the side and black heels with white spots all over. To complete the look, M√Ωa wore a red hat with her hair sported in a bun while black lipstick and nail polish was applied. ==Composition== Constructed around throwback 90's R&B;, \\"You Got Me, Part II\\" is a sensual, hypnotic midtempo production with a runtime of four minutes and twenty-eight seconds. Written by M√Ωa with production courtesy of Bink! and additional live instrumentation provided by producer Chucky Thompson, \\"You Got Me, Part II\\" is a conceptual continuation of its original version performed in the key of B major with a common time of 127 beats per minute. Lyrically, the song chronicles the protagonist's realization that she has unexpected feelings for someone she had no intention of falling for. \\"You got me boy/Yeah you got me/I thought I was stronger than this/ You had at me hello/ I ain't use to this\\" M√Ωa sings with conviction on the song's chorus.

His work has been described as a multidisciplinary approach to Latin America to US migration and involves ethnographic analysis of migrant stories, forensic science, and archaeological research. It has also been described as an ‚Äúintersection of physical geography, cultural geography, and archaeology,‚Äù as he uses tools like GPS to document sites. He says that archaeology is ‚Äústudying the past through material traces.\\" We tend to think these must be ancient things‚Äù and asks us to question, ‚ÄúWhat happens if you think about the archaeology of the recent past, as recently as this morning in some cases‚Äù? == Undocumented Migration Project (UMP) and Hostile Terrain 94 (HT94) == The Things They Carried: Undocumented Migration Project As Executive Director of the long-term Undocumented Migration Project (UMP) Inc., a 501(c)(3) that began in 2009, De Le√≥n uses fieldwork to ‚Äúcollect, catalogue, and interpret nearly 10,000 objects left in the desert by migrants making the treacherous, undocumented border crossing from Mexico into the United States‚Äù and says these objects become artifacts. The UMP project has focused on the last 20 years, but broadened more recently in 2020 to include longer histories of migration, labor, and environmental changes centered on Arizona, which is a main area of undocumented crossings from Mexico; they will conduct interviews and collect oral histories. As part of UMP, De Le√≥n directs Hostile Terrain 94 (HT94), a participatory art project resulting in an exhibition of ‚Äú3,200 handwritten toe tags that represent migrants who have died trying to cross the Sonoran Desert of Arizona between the mid-1990s and 2019. These tags are geolocated on a wall map of the desert showing the exact locations where remains were found‚Äù. HT94 was shown in the US and around the world, debuting a virtual exhibition on July 17, 2020. This exhibition is slated to be installed in 130 locations on six continents through the end of 2021.

Located at 21 East 52nd Street, near Madison Avenue, it opened in 1926 and was designed by architects Warren & Wetmore in Classical Revival style. It was built as a residential hotel and was part of the \\"Terminal City\\" project consisting of hotels and apartment buildings in the area around Grand Central Terminal. It previously had up to 500 suites, but by the time it closed in 2020, it had 395 guestrooms and suites. == Early history == The hotel, designed by architects Warren & Wetmore in Classical Revival style, opened in 1926. At the time of construction, it was 10 stories tall, located on a plot measuring . Two years later, J.C. and M.G. Mayer leased the hotel for 21 years with plans to renovate it. ==Connection to the arts== The Berkshire has historic ties to Broadway and the arts. Ethel Merman lived at the property for many years, and Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote the musical Oklahoma! in a suite that was later named the Rodgers and Hammerstein Suite. Alfred Hitchcock was also a regular. The hotel was for many years the home of an exclusive private dining club founded by drama critic Alexander Woolcott and designed by Norman Bel Geddes. The club was known as the Elbow Room upon its opening in 1938. Its founding members included Harold Ross, George S. Kaufman, Robert E. Sherwood, Moss Hart, William S. Paley, Raymond Massey, and Cedric Hardwicke. Later renamed the Barberry Room, it was known as \\"the most exclusive restaurant in New York\\". Rodgers and Hammerstein collaborated at a reserved table, Edward R. Murrow dined there each Friday before the airing of his Person to Person show, and Frank Sinatra dined there in 1955 with heiress Gloria Vanderbilt. Marc Connelly, David Sarnoff, and Richard Rodgers continued to be regulars into the 1950s. Salvador Dali dined at the Barberry in 1960 and took offense at a William-Adolphe Bouguereau painting in the dining room depicting a satyr surrounded by nymphs. Dali reportedly considered Bouguereau's nymphs to be bad art and struck a deal with the hotel to trade his own painting of nymphs for the Bouguereau. Dali returned to the dining room days later and, as well- heeled diners watched and dodged paint, created an abstract impression of nymphs. He used a rubber cap on his head to apply the paint to a seven-foot canvas. The Barberry Room displayed Dali's nymphs for a time, but it was later relegated to a linen closet. In 1979, the New York Daily News reported that the Dali had disappeared. ==Subsequent sales and renovations== Look building at center. The hotel was purchased in 1959 by the Knott Hotels Corporation and renamed the Knott Berkshire Hotel. Knott subsequently announced plans to build a 15-story, 158-room addition to the Berkshire Hotel. In 1977, the hotel was acquired by the Dunfey Family Hotel Co., a subsidiary of Irish International Airlines, for $9.7 million, becoming the first hotel in New York City to be run by that chain. The new owner evicted Ethel Merman in 1978, stating that it did not want permanent residents. In 1979, the Dunfey group renamed the hotel the \\"Berkshire Place Hotel\\". Dunfey renovated the hotel the same year at a cost of $9 million to designs by Peter Gisolfi Associates and interior architect Roland Jutras. The project involved renovating all of the guest rooms. The refurbished hotel opened in June 1979. Its restoration was described by media as part of a \\"building boom\\" that followed the city's near- bankruptcy in 1975, as well as part of a general trend of foreign airlines renovating hotels in New York City. The Dunfey group acquired the Omni hotel chain in 1983. In a 1986 rebranding effort, the hotel was renamed the \\"Omni Berkshire Place\\". Omni bought the Berkshire Place hotel outright in March 1992 for $83.5 million. The hotel was further renovated in 1995 and 2003. During the 1995 renovation, which cost $50 million, the Omni Berkshire Place was downsized from 415 to 395 rooms, and numerous amenities were added to each room. After the renovation, the average guest room was and there were 20 handicapped-accessible guest rooms.

Casaccia is a pioneer in the study of myelin and her research focuses on understanding the neurobiological and neuroimmune mechanisms of multiple sclerosis to translate their findings into treatments. Casaccia co-founded the Center for Glial Biology at Mount Sinai and CUNY and is one of the Directors of the center. == Early life and education == Casaccia was born in the coastal town of Giulianova in the province of Teramo, Italy. She grew up with her mother, father, and younger brother in Giulianova. Her father was a physician in Giulianova and her brother grew up to pursue a career in medicine as well. Casaccia attended the Scientific High School of Giulianova, where she graduated with the M. Curie Diploma. Casaccia attended medical school at the Catholic University of Rome, in the Policlinico A. Gemelli. She graduated with honors from medical school and began to pursue her residency in Neurology at Policlinico A. Gemelli in Rome. Two years into her residency, she was inspired by her Neurology professor to study in America to explore prion proteins and neurodegenerative disease. She pursued her Ph.D. at the State University of New York Health and Science Center in Brooklyn. She first explored the role of the PrPSC protein in scrapie pathogenesis and also innovated new methods of gene transfer in organotypic hippocampal brain slices to explore kainate receptor biology and electrophysiology. Her doctoral thesis explored sleep dysregulation in patients suffering from brain illness. She completed her PhD in Molecular Biology and Neurobiology, and stayed in New York City to pursue postdoctoral research at Weill Cornell Medical Center and at the Skirball Institute for Molecular Medicine. Casaccia published a first-author Nature paper in 1996 showing that nerve growth factor highly specifically promotes the death of oligodendrocytes but not neurons, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, or astrocytes. She went on to explore oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) development, discovering that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 is critical to OPC development, such that differentiation in impaired and proliferation continues. In addition to her research on oligodendrocytes, Casaccia studied neurotrophins and their role in cell survival and differentiation in the central nervous system. == Career and research == Casaccia was recruited to Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in 1999. Casaccia started as an assistant professor, and was promoted to Associate Professor while running a lab that explored the neurobiological basis of demyelinating disorders. In 2008, Casaccia was recruited to the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. She holds titles as the Professor of Neuroscience, Professor of Genetics and Genomic Science, and Professor of Neurology. In 2016, Casaccia was appointed to Director of the Neuroscience Initiative within the Advanced Science Research Center at the City University of New York (CUNY). At CUNY, Casaccia is Einstein Professor of Biology within the Graduate Center. In 2017, Casaccia and her colleague Anne Schaefer founded, and now co-direct, the Center for Glial Biology that spans the educational spaces of both Mount Sinai and CUNY. Casaccia's research program focuses on translation in order to move basic science from her lab into therapeutic approaches in the clinic to help patients suffering from multiple sclerosis (MS) and other neurodegenerative processes. One major area of research in Casaccia's lab is probing the molecular and genetic mechanisms of oligodendrocyte development, myelin formation, and myelin loss. Through analysis of epigenetic changes and transcriptional changes in glial cells, mostly oligodendrocytes, they are able to understand how certain stimuli or environmental influences may lead to disease phenotypes. While probing the basic biology of glial cells, Casaccia's lab also dissects the mechanisms of neurodegeneration in demyelinating disorders, such as MS. She looks at mitochondrial activity in neurons exposed to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients suffering various neurodegenerative disorders, and she also analyses this CSF for insight into therapeutic targets and molecular pathways. === Oligodendrocyte and myelin development === Early into her professorship at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Casaccia returned to her postdoctoral findings, exploring the role of p27 in oligodendrocyte differentiation, to understand how myelin development occurs. She found that p27 regulates the differentiation of oligodendrocytes by modulating transcription of the gene for myelin basic protein. Casaccia found in 2002 that the delicate balance of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic molecules determine the propensity for cell death. The accumulation of proapoptotic molecules throughout development correlates with increased apoptosis, suggesting that manipulating the balance of these pro- and anti- apoptotic molecules could be useful as a strategy to prevent oligodendrocyte death. Casaccia made her first discovery about the epigenetic regulation of oligodendrocytes in 2003, showing that their process outgrowth, which is critical to proper function and myelination in the brain, is regulated by chromatin modifiers. Casaccia found that male and female sex hormones have the capacity to regulate differentiation and maturation of oligodendrocytes. Casaccia and her colleagues later found a critical transcription factor, Yin Yang 1, in the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitors. === Therapeutic strategies targeting oligodendrocytes and myelin === Casaccia shifted her focus more towards translation after becoming a professor at Icahn School of Medicine. Focusing on demyelinating diseases, Casaccia found that inhibition of p53 leads to decreased oligodendrogliopathy, myelin preservation, and decreased microglial infiltration, serving as a potential future therapeutic target. Casaccia contributes to the development of a new model of multiple sclerosis pathogenesis that takes into account genetic risk susceptibility and cell-specific epigenetic changes that occur in the immune system and the nervous system. Casaccia and her team turned to a mouse model of social isolation and found that it had impaired myelination. They were able to reverse the demyelination and enhance oligodendrocyte development through the administration of Clemastine, an antimuscarinic. Overall, they showed that enhancing or repairing myelination can act as a therapeutic strategy towards depressive-like social behaviors in mice. Casaccia has also begun to explore how altering the gut microbiota affects patients with relapsing MS. Casaccia and her team exposed rats to the cerebrospinal fluid of patients suffering from multiple sclerosis. They found increased levels of ceramide in the CSF, and it led to oxidative stress and bioenergetic failure in the neurons of rats exposed to MS CSF. === Subventricular zone neurogenesis === Casaccia also explored the molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying neurogenesis. She has found that both p53 and p27, early found important in the regulation of oligodendrocyte development, modulate proliferation and self-renewal of adult subventricular zone cells. == Awards and honors == * 2001 New Jersey Cancer Commission Award for Scientific Excellence * 2005 Rutgers Women in Neuroscience Award * 2007 Stem Cell Research Grants from the NJ Commission on Science and Technology (NJCST) == Select publications == * S.

Moritz Manheimer was one of his brothers. Valentin Manheimer settled in Berlin in 1836, along with his brothers Moritz and David. They founded the textile processing company \\"Gebr. Manheimer\\". Valentin Manheimer separated from his brothers in 1839 and founded the company \\"Valentin Manheimer\\" one of Berlin's first manufacturers of women's clothing. Manheimer used the traditions and experiences of the old Berlin tailoring trade to build a large-scale clothing company. This was partly based on the Verlagssystem. He primarily produced inexpensive women's coats made of thick wool. His products were sold in Germany as well as abroad. Manheimer had a branch in London. He invented the measurement system for producing ready-to-wear clothing, making it possible to mass-produce good quality garments at low costs. His innovation changed the way people dressed in the 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1856 Valentin Manheimer joined the Gesellschaft der Freunde, a Jewish relief organization in Berlin whose members supported each other in cases of poverty, unemployment, illness, and death. In 1862 he contracted architect Friedrich Hitzig to design a mansion for his family on Bellevuestr. 8 in the new Tiergarten district. After the founding of the German Reich in 1871, Manheimer gained a foothold on the international market, competed with manufacturers from Paris, and delivered to the USA. In terms of clothing industry sales, Manheimer's company ranked second after Herrmann Gerson's. In the late 1890s, it employed around 8,000 people. In 1873 he was appointed to Commercial Council and in 1884 he was nominated as Privy Council. On the occasion of Manheimer's seventieth birthday, his wife Philippe commissioned a painting from Anton von Werner. After his death, he left a fortune of about 10 to 12 million marks, and the business was led by his sons Ferdinand, Gustav, and Alfred. In 1903 and 1904 Gustav and Alfred left, Ferdinand became sole owner and subsequently, his son Adolf took over. The company went bankrupt during the Great Depression.

It is the headquarters of Harrow London Borough Council. ==History== Harrow Urban District Council, which was formed in 1934, initially established itself at council offices in Peel Road in Wealdstone. However, after its responsibilities increased, having become a municipal borough in 1954 and a London borough in 1965, it sought larger premises and moved to a private residence known as Harrow Weald Lodge. After this arrangement became inadequate for their needs, civic leaders decided to procure a purpose-built civic centre: the site selected in Station Road had previously been occupied by a primary school and a builder's yard. Construction on the new building, which was undertaken by F.G. Minter, started on 2 July 1970. The new building was designed by Eric G. Broughton and was officially opened by the mayor, Alderman Henry Gange, on 6 May 1973. The design involved a six-storey square concrete-framed structure with 30 bays on each side; the bays contained a window on each floor flanked by concrete slabs; there was a landscaped courtyard in the centre of the building. The council chamber was contained in an entirely separate structure built to the north east of the main building; it was connected to the main building by a bridge structure containing a large glass decorative screen made by Whitefriars Glass. The \\"Kodak Mural\\", a composite creation of nearly 1,000 tiles bearing Harrow-related photographs, which was designed by Pentagram and made by Kenneth Clark Ceramics, was installed on the first floor landing in 1974. In April 2004, Queen Elizabeth II, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, visited the civic centre as part of the celebrations in respect of the 50th anniversary of the borough's royal charter. In October 2014, as part of its regeneration strategy, the council announced proposals to move its headquarters to a more modern facility in Wealdstone and to release the civic centre site for residential use. However, in March 2019, it indicated that there would be delays and, in July 2019, the council decided to find a regeneration partner to help to expedite the development. In September 2020 the council indicated that it had identified that partner although the name of the partner was not revealed. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Harrow Category:City and town halls in London Category:Government buildings completed in 1973 ","title":"Harrow Civic Centre"},{"id":"63865034","text":"The Far Eastern University ‚Äì Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management or (ITHM) is one of the academic institutes that comprised Far Eastern University.

After being diagnosed as HIV-positive, she became the first Nigerian woman to publicly announce her status. She experienced discrimination and set up the Nigerian Community of Women Living With HIV/AIDS organisation to raise awareness of HIV/AIDS in Nigeria. In 2006, she gave birth to a healthy HIV-negative baby. == Early life == When she was 19 and living in the city of Ilesa, Nigeria, Jegede-Ekpe was concerned by rashes on her body and decided to take a blood test. She then found out that she was HIV-positive. After the blood test for her boyfriend (her only sexual partner) came back negative, she remembered a visit to a dentist who worked in unsanitary conditions and assumed she had come into contact with contaminated blood. In the early 2000s, Jegede-Ekpe decided to make her HIV-positive status public, which at the time was a controversial course of action. She was the first Nigerian woman to do this. She experienced discrimination and was shunned by friends and colleagues fearful of HIV/AIDS: her choir refused to sing with her any more; she was studying medicine at Wesley Nursing School and the administration pressed her to stop. However, she continued to study and graduated as a nurse in 2001. == Career == Jegede-Ekpe became an activist raising awareness of HIV/AIDS in Nigeria and set up the Nigerian Community of Women Living With HIV/AIDS organisation. The organisation aimed to transmit information and to help the voices of women to be heard. It planned to set up funds to help women in crisis and to educate orphans. She commented later that \\"when people like myself come out, you see the faces of the epidemic for the first time. I'm not a fact or figure. And they can see that people like me can live a normal life\\". As of 2004, nearly 6 percent of the Nigerian population (7 million people) had HIV/AIDS and 75 percent of all HIV-positive Africans aged between 15 and 24 were female. Speaking at the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts, Jegede-Ekpe remarked that the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Nigeria would not be solved until women and men were treated equally. Jegede- Ekpe became a consultant for UNICEF and in 2001 the organisation helped her to access antiretroviral drugs for her own health after a friend was shocked by her weight loss. She married a fellow campaigner who is also HIV-positive. In 2006, she gave birth to a healthy baby girl, who tested HIV-negative. In 2004, Jegede-Ekpe won a Reebok Human Rights Award for her work on HIV/AIDS awareness. == See also == * Bisi Alimi * HIV/AIDS in Africa * Women in Nigeria == References == == Further reading == * Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:HIV/AIDS activists Category:People with HIV/AIDS Category:Nigerian activists Category:Nigerian women activists Category:HIV/AIDS researchers ","title":"Yinka Jegede-Ekpe"},{"id":"63865324","text":"The 1913‚Äì14 United States collegiate men's ice hockey season was the 19th season of collegiate ice hockey. ==Regular season== ===Standings=== ==References== *1913‚Äì14 NCAA Standings ==External links== *College Hockey Historical Archives College ","title":"1913‚Äì14 United States collegiate men's ice hockey season"},{"id":"63865328","text":"The Philippine War Crimes Commission was a commission created in late 1945 by Gen. Douglas MacArthur as Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers to investigate the war crimes committed by the Imperial Japanese Army and Imperial Japanese Navy during the invasion, occupation, and liberation of the Philippines. The investigation by the Commission of the Japanese war crimes has led to the dozen high-profile tribunals, culminating to the extradition, prosecution, and conviction of Class A, Class B, and Class C defendants in Manila, Tokyo, and other cities in East and Southeast Asia through the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. ==Background== Japanese atrocities. Philippines, China, Burma, Japan - NARA - 292599 During the invasion of the Philippines in December 1941, the Japanese Japanese Fourteenth Area Army headed by MGen. Masaharu Homma, and the Imperial Japanese Navy's 3rd Fleet swept through Luzon and the United States Army Forces in the Far East headed by Gen. Douglas MacArthur was ordered to fall back to Bataan and Corregidor Island under the War Plan Orange - where Manila Bay will be denied for use by the Japanese Navy. The defenders put up a stubborn resistance against the invaders in what is known as the Battle of Bataan, and delayed the timetable of the Japanese expansion into Southeast Asia and Australia. However, after five months of fighting with limited supplies, food, and medicine, the forces in Bataan headed by MGen. Edward P. King surrendered on April 9, 1945 to Gen. Homma, making this the largest capitulation of the United States Army. King surrendered about 80,000 Americans and Filipinos, and the Japanese committed them to what is now known as the Bataan Death March, where an estimate of 15,000 died from heat, exhaustion, or summary execution. The following day, units of the Japanese Army committed the Pantingan River Massacre, where 600 officers of the Philippine Army's 91st Infantry Division were summarily executed with the use of swords. For those who reached Tarlac POW Concentration Camp at Camp O'Donnell, the suffering from malnutrition and disease took a toll of another 20,000 of the captive Prisoner of War. The Filipino POWs were released August 1942, while the American POWs were distributed in other POW Camps around the country and were pressed to forced labor on building airfields, railroads, and other civil works. Some POWs were later transported on hell ships and brought to China, Taiwan, or the home islands of Japan, using them as human shields or for forced labor. During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, a number of atrocities were recorded against local government officials such as the execution of former Chief Justice Jose Abad Santos and the Mayor of Daet Wenceslao Vinzons. There were also a number of former military officers who were executed such as BGen. Vicente Lim, and the former Philippine Constabulary Intelligence Division Chief, Lt. Col. Alejo Valdes, brother of the Philippine Army's Chief-of-Staff MGen. Basilio Valdes. Diplomats such as the Chinese Embassy staff were all massacred in the Manila Chinese Cemetery. Civilians were also not spared as the Japanese military police also known as Kenpeitai, subjected them to torture or summary executions without the benefit of a trial by a mere suspect of being a supporter of anti-Japanese guerilla forces, or finding oneself at the end of an argument with a pro-Japanese Filipino organizations, such as the Makapili. There is also a lingering issue of comfort women where the Japanese military systematically forced young Filipino women into sexual slavery. In 1944, during the Battle of Luzon the forces under MGen. Tomoyuki Yamashita have perpetrated attacks and massacres against civilian population. ==Activities== The Commission was headed by former Justice and future Solicitor General Col. Manuel Lim, who also became one of the Assistant Prosecutor during the trials of Gen. Masaharu Homma and Gen. Tomoyuki Yamashita. Col. Lim enlisted the help of SCAP War Crimes Investigation Section, and brought in more than 100 military and legal personnel in this effort, and investigating more than 300 individuals and 600 cases, interviewing thousands of witnesses. The Commission should not be confused with the Commonwealth of the Philippines' National War Crimes Office in Manila as well, established by President Sergio Osmena in 1945. ==Legacy== Overall, the Commission handled the prosecution of more than 169 defendants, of whom 133 were found guilty. 25 were given death sentence, and 16 received life imprisonment. Aside from Homma and Yamashita, the Commission helped in the prosecution of the following: *LGen. Shizuo Yokoyama, commanding general of the \\"Shimbo Group\\" of the Forty-First Army (Japan) and was responsible for the defense of Manila and Southern Luzon during the Battle of Luzon. *LGen. Akira Muto, Chief-of-Staff of Gen. Tomoyuki Yamashita's Japanese Fourteenth Area Army. He was extradited to Tokyo to face the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, and was charged for being responsible for the torture and execution of Filipino civilians and anti-Japanese guerillas. *LGen. Hong Sa- Ik, assigned to the Philippines in 1944, and commanded the Prisoner-of-war camp across the country. *LGen. Shigenori Kuroda, the Japanese Governor- General from May 28, 1943 to September 26, 1944, to whom more than 2,400 civilian deaths and executions were attributed to. == References == Category:History of the Philippines Category:Military history of the Philippines during World War II Category:War crimes ","title":"Philippine War Crimes Commission"},{"id":"63865331","text":"The 1914‚Äì15 United States collegiate men's ice hockey season was the 20th season of collegiate ice hockey. ==Regular season== ===Standings=== ==References== *1914‚Äì15 NCAA Standings ==External links== *College Hockey Historical Archives College ","title":"1914‚Äì15 United States collegiate men's ice hockey season"},{"id":"63865335","text":"The 1915‚Äì16 United States collegiate men's ice hockey season was the 21st season of collegiate ice hockey. ==Regular season== ===Standings=== ==References== *1915‚Äì16 NCAA Standings ==External links== *College Hockey Historical Archives College ","title":"1915‚Äì16 United States collegiate men's ice hockey season"},{"id":"63865336","text":"DamEttan (called Division 1, 2007‚Äì2015) is the second-highest women's ice hockey league in Sweden, below the SDHL and above Damtv√•an.

February 1884) was a Prussian General der Kavallerie. T√ºmpling commanded a division in the Austro- Prussian War and VI Army Corps during the Franco-Prussian War. ==Biography== Born in Pasewalk as a scion of the noble family von T√ºmpling, Wilhelm initially opted for a civilian career and studied law in Heidelberg. On 25 July 1830 he entered the Guard Corps as a candidate-officer and on 18 June 1831 he was appointed second lieutenant. In the fall of 1833 he went to the general war school and in 1837 was appointed to the topographical office. From 1839 he belonged to the general staff. In 1840 he was promoted to first lieutenant. On 12 April 1842, he was appointed to the General Staff of the VIII Army Corps in Koblenz with the rank of captain. From there, in 1848, now promoted to major, he was transferred to the Great General Staff in Berlin. In 1849 he took part in the campaign in Baden. In 1850 he was again in the field, firstas a staff officer in the 4th Dragoons Regiment, and in 1853 with his own command in the 5th Cuirassier Regiment. In 1854 T√ºmpling took command of the 1st Guard Uhlan Regiment in Potsdam. At the end of 1857 he was appointed colonel and commander of the 11th Cavalry Brigade in Breslau. T√ºmpling stayed there until in 1863 he took over the 5th division in Frankfurt an der Oder. In the Second Schleswig War in 1864, parts of his division came into combat at the D√ºppeler Schanzen and the occupation of Fehmarn, but he was not perqonally involved. During the Austro-Prussian War in 1866 T√ºmpling distinguished himself in the Battle of Gitschin, where he was wounded. For Gitchin he was awarded the Pour le M√©rite. After the war he was governor-general of the occupied Kingdom of Saxony for a few weeks. In October 1866 T√ºmpling was given command of the VI Army Corps. At the beginning of the Franco-Prussian War the VI Army Corps was kept in Silesia in order to be a deterrent to Austria entering the war on the French side. After it became clear that Austria would not participate in the war, the corps moved to France in August 1870 and was assigned tpo the 3rd Army. When the 3rd Army moved north towards Sedan, T√ºmpling remained as flank protection. His task was to intercept retreating French formations so that they could not get to Paris. The French 13th Corps, however, managed to escape this trap and reach Paris. During the Siege of Paris, T√ºmpling held the southwestern section. In this area he was able to fight back a French outage in the Battle of Chevilly. After the war, T√ºmpling returned to Breslau with his corps. In 1883 T√ºmpling retired from the army due to his poor health. He died in 1884 in Talstein near Jena. ==References== * Howard, Michael, The Franco-Prussian War: The German Invasion of France 1870‚Äì1871, New York: Routledge, 2001. . * Wawro, Geoffrey, The Austro-Prussian War.

De Christol was born in Montepellier and became a student of Marcel de Serres, a professor at Montpellier. In 1828 he discovered human remains and pottery in Souvignargues alongside remains of rhino, bear, and hyena bones. He then suggested the existence of humans alongside animals that were traditionally supposed to have gone extinct after the Biblical flood, a view supported by the dominant French zoologists of the time like Georges Cuvier. His idea was however supported by William Buckland who visited him during the digs in Lunel-Viel. He saw similar remains in 1829 in a cave in Pondres digging along with Dumas Emilien. In 1832 he described the fossil equid Hipparion. He received a doctorate in 1834 and became a professor of geology and mineralogy in the faculty of science in Dijon in 1837.

The idea was first unveiled in a newsletter from Ross released in April 2020. He claims the party is a centrist and anti- corruption movement designed to appeal to voters \\"in the middle\\"; however, their main policies represent the political fringe rather than centre. Ross had been a member of the centre-right New Zealand National Party until a public spat with leader Simon Bridges during which he accused Bridges of corruption. Ross has since been accused of sexual harassment and bullying, and is currently under investigation for corruption himself. In July 2020, it entered into a pact with New Zealand Public Party, a conspiracy theory party that spread misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic. This misinformation has been shared on the Advance NZ Facebook page. The party did not win any seats in the 2020 New Zealand general election. == Background == Jami-Lee Ross had been a long-time stalwart for New Zealand's centre-right National Party, having been elected to the Manukau City Council in 2004 aged just 18, and later as a Member of Parliament for Botany at 25 in 2011. Being one of the safest seats for the National Party, Ross continued to win Botany by comfortable margins. Ross became the party's Senior Whip in May 2017. After the National Party lost power at the 2017 election, Ross became a high-ranking figure in the Opposition led by new National leader Simon Bridges, serving as party spokesperson for Transport and Infrastructure. In a highly publicised falling out, Ross accused Bridges of corruption involving a $100,000 donation to the party, filing a false return and falsifying the name of a donor to hide the identity. Bridges denied all of the claims. Ross departed from the National Party in October 2018, just before the National Party voted to expel him. The party went through with the vote to expel him anyway. Ross then released the audio from conversations between him and Bridges which he said backed up his claim. In a press conference on 16 October, Ross announced his intention to resign his seat and contest the resulting by-election as an Independent candidate. In the end however Ross chose to remain in Parliament and the election never took place. Ross was subsequently accused of sexual harassment and bullying behaviour towards staff members, National Party officials, and members of Parliament. On 29 January 2020 the Serious Fraud Office announced they had charged four people in relation to the claims made by Ross in 2018 around the NZ$100,000 donation. It was said that none of the sitting National Party MPs at the time, including Simon Bridges, were among the four charged. On 19 February 2020, it was reported that Ross was one among four people charged by the SFO over a $105,000 donation made to the National Party in June 2018. The SFO alleged that Ross and the other defendants, three Chinese businessmen, had committed fraud by splitting the 2018 donation into sums of money less than $15,000, which were then transferred into the bank accounts of eight different people before being donated to the National Party. On 25 February, Ross and the other defendants appeared in court where they pleaded not guilty to the charges relating to the National Party donations. == Creation == With Ross's case still ongoing in the Auckland District Court, he announced his intention to create his own political party in an April 2020 newsletter. The party was described by Ross as a \\"new political movement\\" designed to appeal to \\"brave voices in the middle that speak truth to power\\". Little else is known about the party beyond its broadly centrist ethos and central issue of anti-corruption ‚Äì in particular, opposition to the Chinese government's alleged influence on New Zealand. Ross had previously stated he would contest his seat of Botany as the Advance NZ candidate, going up against National candidate and former Air New Zealand CEO Christopher Luxon. However, just days before the close of nominations he announced he would not contest Botany and would instead run as a list-only candidate. In July 2020, the Advance New Zealand Party applied for registration with the Electoral Commission. It achieved registration on 6 August 2020. By mid-September, Ross claimed the party had 7,000 members. == Alliances with other parties == Advance New Zealand has four component parties: the New Zealand Public Party, the New Zealand People's Party, Direct Democracy New Zealand, and Reset NZ. Jami-Lee Ross has said that his plan for the party based on the structure and make-up of the Alliance Party, and he has proposed an arrangement where smaller parties would maintain their own identity and board, but stand candidates under a shared party list as Advance. Ross also said that he had also invited the New Zealand Outdoors Party, New Conservative Party, The Opportunities Party, Social Credit, Heartland New Zealand Party and ONE Party to join Advance in the alliance. The New Conservatives, TOP, Outdoors Party, and ONE Party rejected the offer. Winston Peters stated that Advance approached his party, New Zealand First, which he rejected, saying that Advance was \\"dangerous, particularly to Maori and Polynesian people\\". === New Zealand Public Party === On 26 July 2020 Ross announced that he was merging Advance New Zealand with the New Zealand Public Party. Public Party leader Billy Te Kahika became co-leader of Advance. Te Kahika is ranked first on Advance's party's list and he will contest the electorate of Te Tai Tokerau, though on behalf of the NZ Public Party. All other party candidates are running under the Advance NZ banner. The New Zealand Public Party, which subscribes to many conspiracy theories, is known for spreading misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as opposition to 5G technology, 1080 poison and fluoridation. On 16 August 2020 the Electoral Commission announced that it recognised the Public Party as a component party of Advance New Zealand. === New Zealand People's Party === Ross appeared in a Facebook video of 29 July 2020 and stated that the New Zealand People's Party would be joining with Advance. The Electoral Commission confirmed that the People's Party was a component party of Advance on 18 August. The People's Party is a formerly-registered political party which contested the 2017 general election and two by-elections in 2016 with a particular focus on the rights of immigrants. === Direct Democracy New Zealand === On 18 August, the Electoral Commission also announced that Direct Democracy New Zealand was recorded as a component party of Advance New Zealand. According to its website, the party advocates for binding referendums, and opposes large-scale immigration, and \\"race-based\\" policies. === Reset NZ === On 18 August, the Electoral Commission also announced that Reset NZ was recorded as a component party of Advance New Zealand. According to Reset NZ's website, the party was founded by private investigator and intelligence analyst, Michael Stace, and its main policy is to dissolve Parliament and replace it with an interim governing body of three leaders and a 'brain trust' of 21 people selected by the leaders. This group would develop a new government structure, which would include a constitution and the banning of 'career politicians'. == 2020 election == The Advance Party received a broadcasting allocation of $62,186 for the 2020 election. On 24 August 2020 Advance New Zealand declared $65,633.23 from the Public Party, the second-largest donation declared by any party so far that year. In late August 2020, the party posted a video claiming that the Government had passed legislation forcing New Zealanders to be vaccinated against COVID-19. According to news outlet Agence France-Presse, the advertisement includes footage from parliament video that had been edited mid-sentence to change the meaning of MP Erica Stanford's speech. Any use of parliamentary footage in political advertising is against parliamentary rules, and the Speaker of the House ordered the removal of the footage from social media. Advance refused to comply. After co-leader Ross refused to withdraw the video, he was referred to the Parliamentary Privileges Committee by Speaker of the House Trevor Mallard, who unanimously agreed Ross had broken parliamentary rules, though with Parliament about to be dissolved, the next steps would be for the next Privileges Committee to determine. The party's leaders organised a rally on 12 September 2020, in which a crowd of a few thousand protested against lockdowns and other restrictions due to Covid-19, the 5G cellphone network, vaccines, the government in general, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. The crowd ignored social distancing requirements and most did not have masks; police recognised people‚Äôs lawful right to protest, but also said they recognise the need for people to follow the current level 2 restrictions to do their part to help prevent the spread of Covid-19\\" and said they \\"will continue to take an educative approach with attendees and organisers when necessary.‚Äù Also in September, Te Kahika was spoken to by police for incorrectly wearing a mask on a flight from Wellington to Dunedin; he wore a mask for the flight but refused to cover his nose with it. On 15 September, Ross announced that he would no longer contest the seat of Botany at the election, a seat that he had held as a National MP from 2011 to 2018, then as an independent MP until 2020. Instead Ross said he would campaign as a list- only candidate for the Advance Party. In late September, co-leaders Ross and Te Kahika filed an urgent interlocutory injunction application at the Auckland High Court against MediaWorks after their party was excluded from the Newshub Nation multi-party leaders' debate scheduled for 3 October 2020. However, the court ruled against them. On 8 October, Advance NZ was ordered by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) to remove its election advertisement that claimed COVID-19 deaths were comparable to the seasonal flu, saying it was \\"unfounded and socially irresponsible.\\" Newspapers owned by NZME said they will comply with the order and not run the ad again, but Jami-Lee Ross said that the party will not comply with the ruling, saying that the ASA should not try to interfere in election debate and free speech. On 16 October, the Advertising Standards Authority upheld most of the complaints against the Advance NZ and New Zealand Public parties. On 14 October, TVNZ alleged that the party was soliciting donations from the US anti-vaccination movement and directing them to the Public Party in order to bypass New Zealand's ban on foreign donations. On 15 October, Advance NZ's Facebook page was taken down during the middle of Te Kahika doing a live feed. Facebook justified its actions on the grounds that the party had repeatedly violated their policies by spreading misinformation about COVID-19 on their platforms. Co-Leader Te Kahika denounced the social media company's actions as \\"election interference.\\" The party had stated the day before they had been warned they would be unpublished for violating Facebook's community standards. The party won 20,878 party votes in the election, or 0.9% of the total. Following the count, co-leader Billy Te Kahika claimed the results had been \\"diddled\\" and that the election had been \\"rigged\\". The Electoral Commission denied the claim. === Polling === Advance began to register in polls in September. It received 0.8% of support in Colmar Brunton's mid-September poll, and 0.6% in its late-September poll. ==Election results== ===House of Representatives=== { class= ! rowspan=2 Election ! colspan=2 Candidates nominated ! rowspan=2 Seats won ! rowspan=2 Votes ! rowspan=2 Vote share % ! rowspan=2 Position ! rowspan=2 MPs in parliament - align=\\"center\\" !

In 1885, the trustees and the Rev William Lowe held a meeting to discuss plans for building the church. The ‚ÄúWesleyan body generally responded to the demand upon their resources‚Äù and by March 1888 most of the money had reportedly been raised.Eastern Districts Chronicle, 17 March 1888, p.7. Tenders were called and the successful tender was from Pringle and Moscrip of Perth and Adelaide for ¬£945.Eastern Districts Chronicle, 25 August 1888, p.4. The foundation stone was laid by Mrs J H Monger on 25 April 1888.York Chronicle, 4 September 1952; foundation stone. The foundation stone ‚Äúis a most beautiful specimen of Sydney free stone, and will be carved during the coming week by Mr Pringle, one of the contractors, by whom it is presented‚Äù.Eastern Districts Chronicle, 14 April 1888, p.5. \\"Every preparation was made by the obliging contractor for the ceremony on Wednesday. The scaffolding was adorned with bunting hours before the company assembled. Stones were removed and planks placed for the comfort of those taking part in the service.‚Äù A ‚Äúhermetically sealed‚Äù bottle containing a list of parishioners and some silver and copper coins common in the colony, was placed under the foundation stone by Joseph Pyke, and Mr Pringle presented Mrs Monger with a silver trowel.Eastern Districts Chronicle, 28 April 1888, p.4. On the evening of the laying of the foundation stone, there was a promenade concert in the Oddfellows‚Äô Hall. ‚ÄúThe best musical talent that the district affords has been secured‚Äù and ‚Äúwith one or two exceptions‚Äù this concert was declared a success and raised ¬£17 for the building fund.Eastern Districts Chronicle, 21 April 1888, p.4.Eastern Districts Chronicle, 21 April 1888, p.5.Eastern Districts Chronicle, 28 April 1888, p.7. The cost of the Church was reputed to be ¬£1,000 and in May 1888 there were concerns that only ¬£400 had been raised.Eastern Districts Chronicle, 26 April 1888, p.2; Eastern Districts Chronicle, 25 August 1888, p.5. In fact, only ¬£236 had been raised, all of the donors to that time being listed in an advertisement the following month, the largest of them being John Henry Monger (¬£59) who was paying in instalments. Donations continued to be published and the total crept to ¬£345.Eastern Districts Chronicle, 2 June 1888, p.6; 9 June 1888, p.5; 16 June 1888, p.6; 23 June 1888, p.5; 7 July 1888, p.5; 11 August 1888, p.5. Stone for the church was donated and carted to the site by adherents.Collins, Doris, The Establishment of Methodism in York, Barladong, No 3, 2002, The York Society, pp.11-19. By June, it was reported that construction of the Church was fast reaching completion and would be finished by the first Sunday in August 1888.Eastern Districts Chronicle, 23 June 1888, p.5. ==Opening of the Church== The last two services for the chapel were held by the Rev Thomas Bird and the Rev William Lowe on 19 August. The Rev Thomas Bird held the opening service in the new Church on Wednesday 22 August 1888 at 3:45 pm.Eastern Districts Chronicle, 18 August 1888, p.4. The local newspaper, the Eastern Districts Chronicle reported: ==Architecture== The architect of the church was Alfred McBain Bonython who had come from Adelaide and Melbourne and was living in Perth designing buildings for the Shenton family. He was only 23 at the time. He also designed the Wesleyan Methodist churches in Fremantle and Albany.Eastern Districts Chronicle, 28 April 1888, p.4; and refer to Architects of South Australia. The church is in Victorian Academic Gothic style.Richard Apperly, Robert Irving and Peter Reynolds, A Pictorial Guide to Identifying Australian Architecture: Styles and Terms from 1788 to the Present, Angus & Robertson, 1989, pp.46-49. Gothic features include: *Steeply pitched roof *Parapeted gable *Excellent stone masonry *Wall buttresses *Lancet windows *Porch with Gothic arch (a later addition)Heritage Council notes. *Label moulds ==Organ== A fund was raised by Mrs Florence Monger in 1895 for the purchase of an organ constructed by Alfred Monk of London.Minutes of Parish meeting June 1895.Collins, Doris, and Morrell, Fred, Wesley Uniting Church York, A Brief history, 1852-2018, Uniting Church York, 2018. The organ is only one of two Alfred Monk organs in Australia and is considered the best 19th century organ in Western Australia \\"in both the warmth of its tone and brilliance of sound and in capability to fill the sanctuary with sound\\".Russell, Duncan, in Wesley Uniting Church York, A Brief history, 1852-2018, Uniting Church York, 2018. Originally, the organ had to be hand-pumped. An organ pumper recollected: The names of a number of the organ pumpers are scratched in the back of the organ case. In 1925, an electric blower was installed.Collins, Doris, The Establishment of Methodism in York, Barladong, No 3, 2002, The York Society, pp.11-19. The organ was restored in 1981-2 by FJ Larner & Co and was cleaned and maintained in June 2001. The gallery in the church was originally intended to be used by the choir but the installation of the pipe organ meant that the choir assembled at the front of the church.Collins, Doris, and Morrell, Fred, Wesley Uniting Church York, A Brief history, 1852-2018, Uniting Church York, 2018. ==Bell== The bell of the church was cast at the London foundry of John Warner & Sons in 1905. The bell is 510mm in diameter and weighs approximately 91 kg. The bell was donated by Mr E R Parker.Eastern Districts Chronicle, 16 December 1905, p.2. Originally the bell was mounted on a wooden tower at the back of the chapel. When that became unsafe it was replace by a metal tower. In November 2010, the bell was erected in the present tower which was paid for by public subscription.Collins, Doris, and Morrell, Fred, Wesley Uniting Church York, A Brief history, 1852-2018, Uniting Church York, 2018. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in York, Western Australia Category:Heritage places in York, Western Australia Category:Churches in Western Australia ","title":"Uniting Church, York, Western Australia"},{"id":"63865898","text":"Map of Massachusetts House of Representatives' 23rd Middlesex district, 2013.

Princeton University Press (2011), Throughout life, this species is regularly curious about the potential of eating virtually any organism or object that they encounter. Certainly no other animal in their given ecosystems, short perhaps of other bear species and humans, can claim to feed on as broad a range of dietary opportunities. Food that is both abundant and easily obtained is preferred. Their jaw structure has evolved to fit their dietary habits. Their diet varies enormously throughout their differing areas based on opportunity.McDonald, D., & Norris, S. (2001). The new encyclopedia of mammals. Oxford University Press. In spring, winter-provided carrion, grasses, shoots, sedges and forbs are the dietary mainstays for brown bears from almost every part of their distribution. Fruits, including berries, become increasingly important during summer and early autumn. Roots and bulbs become critical in autumn for some inland bear populations if fruit crops are poor. The dietary variability is illustrated in the western United States, as meat made up 51% of the average year-around diet for grizzly bears from Yellowstone National Park, while it made up only 11% of the year-around diet for grizzlies from Glacier National Park a few hundred miles to the north. ==Plants and fungi== Despite their reputation, most brown bears are not highly carnivorous, as they derive up to 90% of their dietary food energy from vegetable matter. Brown bears often feed on a variety of plant life, including berries, grasses, flowers, acorns (Quercus ssp.) and pine cones as well as mosses and fungi such as mushrooms. In total, over 200 plant species have been identified in their foods. Arguably the most herbivorous diets have come from the warmer temperate parts of Eurasia as more than 90% of the diet may be herbivorous. These include countries and regions such as Spain, Slovakia, most of the Balkans including Greece, Turkey, the Himalayas and presumably the Middle East.Rigg, R., & Adamec, M. (2007). \\"Status, ecology and management of the brown bear (Ursus arctos) in Slovakia\\". Slovak Wildlife Society, Liptovsk√Ω Hr√°dok. In many inland portions of North America the diet of grizzly bears is between 80 and 90% plant-based, but animal meat can be much more important in some areas.Murie, A. (2012). The grizzlies of Mount McKinley. University of Washington Press. It has been found that being restricted to a largely vegetarian diet puts constraints on the growth and size of bears who live off of them, largely because their digestive systems do not process plants as well as animal fats and proteins. Among all living bears, brown bears are uniquely equipped to dig for tough foods, such as roots and shoots. They use their long, strong claws to dig out earth to reach the roots and their powerful jaws to bite through them. For the most part, the consumed plant life in spring, predominantly roots immediately post-hibernation and grasses later in spring, is not highly nutritious for bears and mainly staves off hunger and starvation until more nutritious food is available. Brown bears have difficulty digesting large quantities of tough, fibrous foods.Servheen, C. (1987). Grizzly bear compendium. Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee. Hedysarum roots are among the most commonly eaten foods from throughout the range and can become important substitutes if stable foods such as fruits become unavailable. Corms and bulbs are important when available, as they are one of the greater sources of protein in plant life, as are hard masts such as acorns. Brown bears are restricted in their access to hard masts compared to American and Asian black bears because of the limited climbing abilities of grown bears and therefore are confined largely to masts fallen to the ground, pirated from other creatures or within a reach of about that the bears can stretch to with their paws extended and standing on their hindlegs.Seryodkin, I. V. (2016). Behavior of Brown Bears During Feeding in the Sikhote-Alin. Achievements in the Life Sciences. Hard masts can become the most important food (although consumed mainly in late summer and fall) where available in large quantities such as on Hokkaido, Italy and Spain. One of the most important foods in the Rocky Mountains region of the United States is the whitebark pine nut (Pinus albicaulis), which is attained perhaps a majority of the time by raiding the once-abundant caches of American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) rather than direct foraging. The decline of whitebark pine nuts due to the inadvertent introduction by man of the invasive, virulent fungi Cronartium ribicola has in turn required grizzlies to seek alternative food sources, many of which are carnivorous. In a Greek food study, soft masts were found to outrank hard masts as a food source, with about a quarter of the year-around diet consisting of the legume Medicago. A grizzly bear sow and her two cubs foraging in a field for wild blueberries Fruits and berries are indispensable for brown bears in most areas as a high-energy food stuff for bears, which is necessary to survive the hibernation cycle. The variety of fruits consumed is high, with most of the well-known, wild fruiting plants in temperate North America and Eurasia attracting brown bears in late summer and fall.Ewer, R. F. (1973). The carnivores. Cornell University Press. Among the most prominent fruits found in their foods from through the range include many Prunus species including prunes and cherries, crowberries (Empetrum nigrum), pears (Pyrus ssp.), crabapples (Malus ssp.), brambles (Rubus fruticosus), raspberries (Rubus idaeus), bearberries (Arctostaphylos ssp.) (reportedly named for bears' fondness for them), blueberries (Vaccinium ssp.), lingonberries (Vaccinium vitis-idaea) and huckleberries (Vaccinium parvifolium). Fruit appears to become more secondary in the diet in areas where hard masts and animal protein are abundant in late summer and fall, as these more protein-rich foods appear to be more nutritious for bears than carbohydrate-rich fruits are, despite their fondness for fruit. Even where fruit are commonly eaten, other foods must be eaten to meet nutritional requirements. It is estimated that a small female brown bear may need to eat nearly 30,000 berries each day in late summer/fall in order to subsist on a purely fruit-based diet. ==Invertebrates== Brown bears will also commonly consume animal matter, which in summer and autumn may regularly be in the form of insects, larvae such as grubs and including beehives. Most insects eaten are of the highly social variety found in colonial nests, which provide a likely greater quantity of food, although they will also tear apart rotten logs on the forest floor, turn over rocks or simply dig in soft earth in attempts to consume individual invertebrates such as bugs, beetles and earthworms.Whitaker, J. O., & Elman, R. (1996). National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mammals (p. 992). New York: Knopf.Prater, S. H., & Barruel, P. (1971). The book of Indian animals (Vol. 3). Bombay: Bombay Natural History Society. Honey bees and wasps are important supplemental foods in Eurasia from the furthest west of their range, in Spain, to the furthest east, in Hokkaido. Bears in Yellowstone and Montana eat an enormous number of moths during the summer, sometimes consuming as many as 40,000 army cutworm moths (Euxoa auxiliaris) in a single day, and may derive up to half of their annual food energy from these insects. In Europe, a variety of species of ants have been found to factor heavily into the diet in some areas such as Scandinavia and eastern Europe. In Slovenia, for example, up to 25% of the dry mass consumed by brown bears was ants. Locally heavy consumption of ants has been reported in North America as well, as in west-central Alberta, 49% of scat contained ants. Brown bears mainly feed on ants with a passive response to the colony being dug out and low levels of formic acid, therefore carpenter ants (Camponotus ssp.), which are accessed through rotten logs rather than underground colonies, are preferred where available. Other important insect aggregations that brown bears feed heavily on in some regions include ladybird beetles and caddisfly. Brown bears living near coastal regions will regularly eat crabs and clams. In Alaska's Katmai National Park and Preserve, brown bears along the beaches of estuaries regularly dig through the sand for soft-shell clam (Mya arenaria) and Pacific razor clam (Siliqua patula), providing a more nutritious source of dietary energy in spring than plant life before fish become available there.Bear Anatomy and Physiology from Gary Brown's The Great Bear Almanac, Lyons & Burford, Publishers, 1993> The zarigani (Cambaroides japonicus), a type of crayfish, of Hokkaido is also an important, protein-rich dietary supplement for brown bears there. ==Fish== A freshly-caught salmon is a very nutritious meal for a young Alaska Peninsula brown bear By far the closest dietary relationship between brown bears and fish occurs between the salmon and trout of the genus Oncorhynchus, particularly in coastal areas, but also in some inland areas of North America. In the Kamchatka peninsula and several parts of coastal Alaska, including Kodiak Island, brown bears feed largely on spawning salmon, whose nutrition and abundance explain the enormous size of the bears in these areas. Sockeye salmon (O. nerka) and pink salmon (O. gorbuscha) are the two most commonly preyed upon, but many coho (O. kisutch), Chinook (O. tshawytscha), masu (O. masou) and chum salmon (O. keta) are also taken.Quinn, T. P. (2011). The behavior and ecology of Pacific salmon and trout. UBC press. Even in the coastal ranges of the Pacific, a diverse omnivorous diet is eaten, with the salmon spawning reliably providing food only in late summer and early fall. Exceptionally, salmon may come to inland rivers as early as June in the Brooks River when other coastal Alaskan bears are in their dietary \\"lean period\\" and provide food for bears sooner than normal. On Kodiak island, it appears the availability of alternative food sources is high, as berry crops are often profuse, marine organisms often wash up and ungulates both wild and domesticated are available.Troyer, W.A. & Hensel, R.J. (1969). The Brown Bear of Kodiak Island. Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge Report. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Kodiak, Alaska, USA. The fishing techniques of bears are well-documented. They often congregate around falls when the salmon are forced to breach the water, at which point the bears will try to catch the fish in mid-air (often with their mouths). They will also wade into shallow waters, hoping to pin a slippery salmon with their claws. While they may eat almost all the parts of the fish, bears at the peak of spawning, when there is usually a glut of fish to feed on, may eat only the most nutritious parts of the salmon (including the eggs (if the salmon is female) and the head) and then indifferently leave the rest of the carcass to scavengers, which can include red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), common ravens (Corvus corax) and gulls. Despite their normally solitary habits, brown bears will gather rather closely in numbers at good spawning sites. The largest and most powerful males claim the most fruitful fishing spots and bears (especially males) will sometimes fight over the rights to a prime fishing spot. Despite their aggressive defensive abilities, female brown bears usually select sub-optimal fishing spots to avoid male bears that could potentially threaten their cubs. One other key relationship between brown bears and Oncorhynchus species occurs with the grizzly bear and the cutthroat trout (O. clarki) in the Rockies such as around Yellowstone. Here this species was consumed in considerable numbers although, like the whitebark pine nut, this food source has declined due to invasive species introduced by man, i.e. invasive trout species which are outcompeting cutthroat trout.Koel, T. M., Bigelow, P. E., Doepke, P. D., Ertel, B. D., & Mahony, D. L. (2005). Nonnative lake trout result in Yellowstone cutthroat trout decline and impacts to bears and anglers. Fisheries, 30(11), 10‚Äì19. The now-extinct California grizzly bear was also a fairly specialized Onocorhynchus predator in California's mountain streams and rivers, principally of rainbow trout (O. mykiss). Outside of Pacific-based salmonids, predatory relationships between brown bears and fish are uncommon. Predation on broad whitefish (Coregonus nasus) and longnose suckers (Catostomus catostomus) has been reported in sub-Arctic Canada and northern pike (Esox lucius) and grayling (Thymallus thymallus) in Siberia, plus other older records of brown bears hunting miscellaneous freshwater fish in Eurasia. ==Mammals== Beyond the regular predation of salmon, most brown bears are not particularly active predators. Nonetheless, brown bears are capable of obtaining practically all forms of the mammals that they encounter: from mouse-like rodents to those as fearsome as a tiger or as large as a bison. Over 100 species of mammal have been recorded either in the scats of brown bears or have been observed as being killed or consumed by the species, although much of this consumption probably represents merely scavenging on carrion.Forsyth, A. (1999). Mammals of North America: temperate and arctic regions. Firefly Books. An Arctic ground squirrel burrow that has been excavated by a hunting barren-ground grizzly bear A perhaps surprisingly high balance of mammalian foods consists of rodents or similar smallish mammals, as about half of the species consumed by brown bears weigh less than on average. These may include hares (Lepus ssp.), pikas (Ochotona ssp.), marmots (Marmota ssp.), ground squirrels, chipmunks, mice, rats, lemmings and voles. Due to their propensity for digging, brown bears are able to smell out active burrows of these small mammals and either wait quietly or furiously dig away until the animals are either displaced and lunged at or are cornered in their burrows. Given that most small burrowing mammals found in cool temperate zones enter hibernation, they may be eaten most often when the brown bears exit hibernation earlier, as befits their larger size, allowing them to catch animals in torpor that may otherwise be too agile. Not only do they consume the small mammals, but they also feed on their caches, as has been recorded in grizzly bears attacking voles and northern pocket gophers (Thomomys talpoides). In some areas, caches may be the primary target when bears dig at these animal's burrows, as may be the case with Siberian chipmunks (Eutamias sibiricus), whose hoards can contain up to of food, with the chipmunks themselves only being caught occasionally. With particular regularity, tundra- dwelling grizzlies will wait at burrows of Arctic ground squirrels (Spermophilus parryii) hoping to pick off a few of the rodents. Ground squirrel hunting is most successful in September and October, when early snow may impede the rodents' rocky escape routes. In Denali National Park, Arctic ground squirrels represent about 8% of the year-round diet of grizzly bears and are the most consistent source of animal protein for grizzlies there.Pearson, A. M. (1975). The northern interior grizzly bear Ursus arctos L. Information Canada. An even more important dietary relationship with a small mammal occurs in the Tibetan blue bear, which is apparently the most completely carnivorous brown bear type, foraging most regularly for plateau pikas (Ochotona curzoniae), a species about one-sixth the weight of an Arctic ground squirrel. As many as 25 pikas have been found in a single bear's stomach and in Changtang, 60% of the diet consisted of pikas.Chapman, J. A., & Flux, J. E. (1990). Rabbits, hares and pikas: status survey and conservation action plan. IUCN. Where plateau pikas are absent, as in the Mustang region of Nepal, Himalayan marmots (Marmota himalayana) become the dietary staple of the bear, occurring in about half of nearly 1,000 scats. Large rodents such as beavers (Castor spp.) and North American porcupines (Erethizon dorsatum) are rare prey items, mostly due to differing habitat preferences, as well as the obvious defenses of the latter.Edwards, M. (2005). Ecology of Grizzly Bears (Ursus arctos) in the Mackenzie Delta oil and gas development area . University of Alberta, Department of Biological Sciences. Up to five species of cetaceans have been recorded as a food source in the coastal regions of Alaska, the Central Arctic and (formerly) California when beached. In most of their range, brown bears regularly feed on ungulates. In many cases, this important food source is obtained as carrion. Carrion is mostly eaten in spring, when winter snow and ice conditions (including snowslides) and starvation claim many ungulate lives. As carcasses are often solidly frozen when encountered, brown bears may sit on them to thaw them sufficiently for consumption. While perhaps a majority of bears of the species will charge at ungulates at some point in their lives, many predation attempts start with the bear clumsily and half-heartedly pursuing the prey and end with the prey escaping alive. On the other hand, some brown bears are quite self-assured predators who habitually pursue and catch large prey items, mainly ungulates. Such bears are usually taught how to hunt by their mothers from an early age. They are the most regular predator of ungulates among extant bear species. The extent of hunting behavior differs by region. For example, in Slovenia, ungulate meat was four times more likely to be obtained as carrion than through hunting, while on the contrary in east-central Alaska, live hunting of ungulates was four times more likely than scavenging of carrion. The extent of carnivory in brown bears has been proven to increase at northern latitudes. When brown bears attack these large animals, they usually target young or infirm ones, as they are easier to catch. Successful hunts usually occur after a short rush and ambush, but they may chase down prey in the open and will try to separate mother and young. Prey is usually killed when the bear grabs the rib cage over the back and delivers a bite to the back of the head, neck, face or nose. The bear may also pin its prey (usually young) to the ground and then immediately tear and eat it alive. Despite being characterized as unskilled predators with minimally-refined hunting skills, most individual bears who are routine ungulate predators have shown the ability to vary their hunting strategy and have hunting success rates comparable to other large, solitary carnivorans. Brown bears will on occasion bite or swipe at some prey in order to stun it enough to knock it over for consumption. To pick out young or infirm individuals, bears will charge at herds so the slower-moving and more vulnerable individuals will be made apparent. Brown bears may also ambush young animals by finding them via scent. Despite being characterized as a danger primarily to young, spring neonatal ungulates in the first couple of days of life, when they have undeveloped legs and cannot run at full speed, young ungulates may be pursued well into summer or fall after they have developed running abilities. Most attacks on adult ungulates occur when the prey has some variety of physical disadvantage. When emerging from hibernation, brown bears, whose broad paws allow them to walk over most ice and snow, may pursue large prey such as moose, whose hooves cannot support them on encrusted snow. Similarly, predatory attacks on large prey sometimes occur at riverbeds, when it is more difficult for the prey specimen to run away due to muddy or slippery soil. On rare occasions, most importantly when confronting unusually large, fully-grown and dangerous prey, bears kill them by hitting with their powerful forearms, which can break the necks and backs of large creatures such as adult moose and adult bison. A grizzly bear feasts on a bison carcass in Yellowstone The leading ungulate prey for brown bears is normally deer. Up to a dozen species have been eaten by brown bears, but the main prey species are the larger species they encounter: elk (Cervus canadensis), moose (Alces alces) and caribou (Rangifer tarandus). Larger deer are preferred because they tend to be less agile and swift than small or medium-sized deer (although a caribou can handily outpace a grizzly bear in the open), they are found in large quantities in several areas inhabited by brown bears and provide a larger meal per carcass. Moose may be preferred where found in large numbers because of their solitary habits and tendency to dwell in wooded areas, both of which makes them easier to ambush. Despite its diminished reputation as a predator, the brown bear is the most dangerous solitary predator of moose, with only packs of wolves a more regular predator; even Siberian tigers take other prey, primarily (elk and boar), in areas where they co-exist with the giant deer. Brown bears normally avoid the potential risks of hunting large deer, which can potentially fight back but usually escape bears by running, by picking out young calves or sickly adults from deer herds. In northeastern Norway, it was found that moose were the most important single food item (present in up to 45% of scats and locally comprising more than 70% of the bear's dietary energy) for local brown bears and several local bears appear to be specialized moose hunters, most often picking off sickly yearling moose and pregnant but healthy cows. In Yellowstone National Park, grizzly bears who derived much of their food energy from ungulates were studied, and 30% of the ungulates consumed were through predation, the remaining amount from scavenging of carcasses. Elk, bison and moose (the three largest native ungulates in the region) each constituted nearly a quarter of the overall ungulate diet. 13% of the total of ungulates actively hunted and killed per that study in Yellowstone were elk calves, while 8% of the actively and successfully hunted prey there were adult cow elk. Despite their lack of preference for smaller deer, other species including red deer (Cervus elaphus), sika deer (Cervus nippon ), axis deer (Axis axis), European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), Siberian roe deer (Capreolus pygargus), fallow deer (Dama dama), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) have turned up in their diet. As many as 20 species of bovids are also potential prey, including various sheep, goats, antelope, bison (Bison ssp.) and muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus). Bovids are mostly taken in random encounters when bears come across a vulnerable, usually young or sickly individual, as smaller species are extremely agile (and often live in rocky environments) and larger varieties are potentially dangerous, especially if aware of the bear's presence. In some parts of eastern Europe and Russia, wild boar (Sus scrofa) may be taken in surprisingly large quantities, considering the mostly herbivorous reputation of bears in these regions. One study from the Amur territory of Russia found that brown bears were actually more prolific killers of wild boars than both tigers and gray wolves, but these results are probably biased due to the scarcity of tigers in the region because of overhunting of the big cat. In rare cases, brown bears are capable of killing bulls of the largest ungulates in regions they inhabit, reportedly including moose, muskox, wild yak (Bos mutus) and both American and European bison (Bison bison and B. bonasus). Remarkably, such attacks are sometimes carried out by bears that were not particularly large, including interior sow grizzlies or small-bodied bears from the Central Arctic, and some exceptional ungulates taken may be up to two to three times the weight of the attacking bear.Persson, I. L. (1998). Brown bear Ursus arctos predation upon adult moose Alces alces in Scandinavia: a study at two levels of scale. Cand. scient. thesis. However, most of the bears who took adult moose in east-central Alaska and Scandinavia were large, mature males. ==Other vertebrates== This species may eat birds and their eggs, including almost entirely ground- or rock-nesting species. Although not typically able to capture a healthy grown bird, eggs, nestlings and fledglings of large bird species can be very attractive to brown bears. Species attacked have ranged can be any size available from Aleutian terns (Onychoprion aleuticus) to trumpeter and whooper swans (Cygnus buccinator and C. cygnus). Most recorded avian prey have consisted of geese and sea ducks nesting in the lower Arctic Circle, followed by coveys of galliforms, as these birds place their nests in shallow water and on the ground as well as raise their chicks in such areas, so they are relatively more vulnerable. Large birds of prey, including sea eagles, gyrfalcons (Falco rusticolus) and golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos), are sometimes exploited as prey if nesting in rock formations that are accessible on foot, and eagles and falcons may furiously dive at bears near their nests.Kochert, M.N., K. Steenhof, C.L. McIntyre, and E.H. Craig. (2002). \\"Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos)\\". In: A. Poole, [Ed.], The birds of North America online, No. 684. Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY. Due to their inhabitance of cooler temperate areas, reptiles and amphibians are rarely a food source and have been verified as prey only in a few cases: frogs in the Italian Alps, rat snakes in Hokkaido, grass lizards in the Amur territory and tortoises in Greece. ==Domestic animal food sources== When forced to live in close proximity with humans and their domesticated animals, bears may potentially prey on any type of domestic animal. Most type of livestock have been domesticated for millennia and have little to no anti- predator defenses. Therefore, brown bears are somewhat more likely to attack healthy adult domestic animals than they are healthy adult wild animals. Among domestic and farm animals, European cattle (Bos primigenius taurus) are sometimes exploited as prey. Cattle are bitten on the neck, back or head and then the abdominal cavity is opened for eating. In Norway, free-ranging domestic sheep (Ovis aries) are numerous and the local brown bears derive 65‚Äì87% of their dietary energy in late summer from sheep. Because of the aforementioned vulnerability, examination of Norwegian sheep remains suggest many of the sheep consumed there are adults that were killed by the bears rather than merely scavenged and thus some local farmers received partial compensation for their stock losses. In nearby northern Sweden, free-ranging sheep are not present and the bear derive their food predominantly from natural sources. Domestic horses (Equus ferus caballus), domestic goats (Capra aegagrus hircus), domestic pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus), domestic chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) and domestic dogs (Canis lupus familaris) may be opportunistically killed in several parts of the brown bear's range as well.Ozolins, J. (2003). Action plan for the conservation of brown bear (Ursus arctos) in Latvia. State Forest Research Institute ‚Äò‚ÄòSilava‚Äô‚Äô, Salaspils, Latvia. Plants and fruit farmed by humans are readily consumed as well, including corn (Zea mays), wheat (Triticum spp.), apples (Malus pumila), sorghum (Sorghum ssp.), melons and many species of berries. They will also feed at domestic bee farms, readily consuming both honey and the contents of the honey bee colony. Human food and trash or refuse is eaten when possible. When an open garbage dump was kept in Yellowstone, brown bears were one of the most voracious and regular scavengers. The dump was closed after both brown and American black bears came to associate humans with food and lost their natural fear of them. In other areas, such as Alaska, dumps may continue to be an attractant for brown bears. ==Enemies and competitors== Taxidermy exhibit portraying a brown bear fighting a Siberian tiger, Vladivostok Museum While feeding on carrion, brown bears use their size to intimidate other predators, such as gray wolves (Canis lupus), cougars (Puma concolor), tigers (Panthera tigris) and American black bears (Ursus americanus) from their kills. Owing to their formidable size and aggressive disposition, predation by wild animals outside of their own species is rare for brown bears of any age; even cubs are often safe due to their watchful mother. There are two records of golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) preying on brown bear cubs. Adult bears are generally immune to predatory attacks except from tigers and other bears. Siberian tigers (Panthera tigris altaica) prefer preying on young bears but smaller, fully grown adult female brown bears outside their dens may also be taken. Successful predatory attacks by tigers on adult brown bears are usually on females, with or without cubs, in their dens. In the past, exceptionally large male Siberian tigers, such as one weighing approximately , were reportedly capable of killing even adult male brown bears, but such bears are otherwise more or less safe from attack. Of 44 recorded encounters between tigers and both Asian black and brown bears, 20 resulted in confrontations; in 50% of these, the bears in general (not necessarily brown bears) were killed, in 27% the tigers were killed, and 23% of the cases ended with both animals surviving and parting ways despite injuries sustained in the conflict. Some bears emerging from hibernation seek out tigers in order to steal their kills. Despite the possibility of tiger predation, some large brown bears may actually benefit from the tiger's presence by appropriating tiger kills that the bears may not be able to successfully hunt themselves and follow tiger tracks. Geptner et al. (1972) stated that bears are generally afraid of tigers and change their path after coming across tiger trails.Geptner, V. G., Sludskii, A. A. (1972). Mlekopitaiu≈°ƒçie Sovetskogo Soiuza. Vys≈°aia ≈†kola, Moskva. (in Russian; English translation: Heptner, V. G.; Sludskii, A. A.; Bannikov, A. G.; (1992). Mammals of the Soviet Union. Volume II, Part 2: Carnivora (Hyaenas and Cats). Smithsonian Institution and the National Science Foundation, Washington DC). pp. 95‚Äì202. In the winters of 1970‚Äì1973, Yudakov and Nikolaev recorded one case of a brown bear showing no fear of the tigers and another case of a brown bear changing its path upon crossing tiger tracks. Other researchers have observed bears following tiger tracks to scavenge tigers' kills or to prey on tigers. Bears frequently track down tigers to usurp their kills, with occasional fatal outcomes for the tiger. A report from 1973 describes 12 known cases of brown bears killing tigers, including adult male tigers; in all cases the tigers were subsequently eaten by the bears. There are reports of brown bears specifically targeting Amur leopards and tigers to appropriate their kills. In the Sikhote-Alin Reserve, 35% of tiger kills were stolen by bears, with the tigers either departing entirely or leaving part of the kill for the bear. A mother grizzly bear and her cubs threatened by a pack of gray wolves, which reportedly did not or could not harm the cubs in this instance. Brown bears regularly intimidate gray wolves (Canis lupus) away from their kills, with wolves occurring in most of the brown bear's worldwide distribution. In Yellowstone National Park, brown bears pirate wolf kills so often, Yellowstone's Wolf Project director Doug Smith wrote, \\"It's not a matter of if the bears will come calling after a kill, but when.\\" Similarly, in Denali National Park, grizzly bears routinely rob wolf packs of their kills. On the contrary, in Katmai National Park and Preserve, wolves, even lone wolves, may manage to displace brown bears at carrion sites.Smith, T. S., Partridge, S. T., & Schoen, J. W. (2004). Interactions of brown bears, Ursus arctos, and gray wolves, Canis lupus, at Katmai National Park and Preserve, Alaska. The Canadian. Despite the high animosity between the two species, most confrontations at kill sites or large carcasses end without bloodshed on either side. Although conflict over carcasses is common, on rare occasions the two predators tolerate each other on the same kill. To date, there are only a few cases of fully-grown wolves being killed by brown bears and none of wolves killing healthy adult brown bears.Ballard, W. B. 1980. Brown bear kills gray wolf. Canadian Field-Naturalist 94:91. PDF. Given the opportunity, however, both species will prey on the other's cubs. Conclusively, the individual power of the bear against the collective strength of the wolf pack usually results in a long battle for kills or domination. In some areas, the grizzly bear also regularly displaces cougars (Puma concolor) from their kills, with some estimates showing cougars locally lose up to a third of their dietary energy to grizzly bears. Cougars kill small bear cubs on rare occasions, but there was one report of a bear killing a cougar of unknown age and condition between 1993 and 1996.ADW: Ursus arctos: Information . Arlis.org. Retrieved 9 August 2012.Hornocker, M., and S. Negri (eds.) (2009). Cougar: ecology and conservation. University of Chicago Press. Chicago, Illinois, . Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), the largest type of lynx and the only one to regularly take large prey, is similarly an habitual victim of kleptoparasitism to brown bears throughout Eurasia. Brown bears also co-exist with leopards (Panthera pardus) (in very small remnant wild parts of the Middle East, Jammu and Kashmir, northeastern China and the Primorsky Krai) and snow leopards (Panthera uncia) in several areas of northern central Asia and the Tibetan Plateau). Although the brown bears' interactions with these big cats are little-known, they probably have similar relationships as grizzly bears do with cougars in North America. Snow leopards and Tibetan blue bears are verified, however, to be a threat to one another's cubs.Mallon, D. (1984). The snow leopard in Ladakh. International pedigree book of snow leopards, 4, 23‚Äì37.Xu, A. (2007) Status, conservation and some ecological aspects of sympatric Tibetan brown bear and snow leopard on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China. PhD thesis, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China. Smaller carnivorous animals are dominated by brown bears and generally avoid direct interactions with them, unless attempting to steal scraps of food. Species which utilize underground or rock dens tend to be more vulnerable to predatory attacks by brown bears. Several mustelids, including badgers, are not infrequently preyed upon and seemingly even arboreal martens may be attacked (especially if unhealthy or caught in furbearer traps). In North America, both species of otter (North American river and sea) have been known to be ambushed by brown bears when on land.COSEWIC. (2012). COSEWIC assessment and status report on the Grizzly Bear Ursus arctos in Canada. Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada. Ottawa. On the contrary, wolverines (Gulo gulo) are known to have been persistent enough to fend off a grizzly bear as much as 10 times their weight from a kill. In some rare cases, wolverines have lost their lives to grizzly bears and wolverines in Denali National Park will reportedly try to avoid encounters with grizzlies. Beyond wolves, other canids may occasionally be killed around their den, most likely pups or kits, or adults if overly incautious near a carrion site, including coyotes (Canis latrans), multiple species of foxes and raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides).Sillero-Zubiri, C., Hoffmann, M., & Macdonald, D. W. (Eds.). (2004). Canids: foxes, wolves, jackals and dogs: status survey and conservation action. IUCN. Medium-sized cats may also be rarely killed by brown bears.IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group, Kristin Nowell, Peter Jackson. (1996). Wild Cats: Status survey and conservation action plan. Cambridge, UK: IUCN Publication Services Unit. Seals are on rare occasions killed by brown bears, including eyewitness accounts of Russian bears ambushing spotted (Phoca largha) and harbor seals (Phoca vitulina). Consumption of ringed (Pusa hispida) and bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus) has been reported in the Mackenzie river delta, presumably via predation or scavenging of polar bear kills, as pinnipeds are not usually encountered as carrion from land.National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (2009). Status Review of the Spotted Seal (Phoca largha). NMFS-AFSC-200. Springfield, VA: Department of Commerce. Brown bears usually dominate other bear species in areas where they coexist. Due to their smaller size, American black bears (Ursus americanus) are at a competitive disadvantage to brown bears in open, unforested areas. Although displacement of American black bears by brown bears has been documented, actual interspecific killing of American black bears by brown bears has only occasionally been reported. Confrontation is mostly avoided due to the American black bear's diurnal habits and preference for heavily forested areas, as opposed to the brown bear's largely nocturnal habits and preference for open spaces. Where they do not live in close proximity to grizzly bears, and especially where found near human habitations, American black bears may become, to a larger extent, nocturnal. Brown bears may also kill Asian black bears, though the latter species probably largely avoids conflicts with the brown bear due to similar habits and habitat preferences to the American black species. Brown bears will eat the fruit dropped from trees by the Asian black bear, as they themselves are too large and cumbersome to climb.The Intellectual observer: review of natural history, microscopic research, and recreative science, Groombridge, 1865 Improbably, in the Himalayas, brown bears are reportedly intimidated by Asian black bears in confrontations. However, the Himalayan black bears are reportedly more aggressive towards humans than the Himalayan brown bear, and the latter is one of the smaller types of brown bear, though still somewhat larger than the Asian black bear. In Siberia, the opposite is true, and Asian black bears are not known to attack people, but brown bears are. Both species of black bear seem to be most vulnerable to predatory attacks by brown bears when the latter species leaves hibernation sooner in early spring and ambushes the smaller ursids in their dens. There has been a recent increase in interactions between brown bears and polar bears (Ursus maritimus), theorized to be caused by climate change. Brown bears have been seen moving increasingly northward into territories formerly claimed by polar bears. Despite averaging somewhat smaller sizes, brown bears tend to dominate polar bears in disputes over carcasses,O'Hara, Dough (24 April 2005) Polar bears, grizzlies increasingly gather on North Slope. Anchorage Daily News. and dead polar bear cubs have been found in brown bear dens. Large herbivores, such as moose, bison and muskox may have an intolerance of brown bears due to their possible threat to vulnerable members of their herds or themselves; moose regularly charge grizzly bears in their calf's defense, but seldom are the bears killed. Bison have been known to fatally injure lone grizzly bears in battles, and even a mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) was observed to do so with its horns, although herbivores are rarely a serious danger to brown bears. ==References== Category:Brown bears Category:Ethology ","title":"Dietary biology of the brown bear"},{"id":"63866128","text":"Jil Walton (born July 5, 1966) is an American equestrian.

James Young Simpson (c. 1843 ‚Äì 10 September 1898) was a Wesleyan Methodist minister in South Australia, born in Scotland, a nephew and namesake of James Young Simpson, the celebrated pioneer of chloroform as an anaesthetic. ==History== Rev J. Young Simpson Simpson was born in Scotland, a son of David Simpson (c. 1804‚Äì1865) and grandson of David Simpson (1760-1830). The family emigrated to Victoria, Australia, aboard the Storm Queen, from the Clyde, departing 16 March 1858, and arriving Melbourne on 27 June 1858 with cargo and the Simpson family. He was raised a Presbyterian, but became a member of the Wesleyan Methodist communion and in 1866 joined the ministry in Victoria. His first appointment was to the Geelong church, then in April 1867 was sent over the border to Norwood, South Australia replacing Rev. J. D. Robin, who was off to Tasmania. The Methodist churches had a principle of moving their pastors regularly, and in December 1869 he was sent by the Stationing Committee to Port Wallaroo, stopping for a few days at Moonta, where he regaled the (mostly Cornish) miners with a humorous talk on Scotland, possibly the same one he gave at Wallaroo a week later. The following year he had charge of the Wesleyan chapel at Strathalbyn, where he and Rev. Backhouse of the Presbyterian congregation cheerfully swapped pulpits on occasion. Simpson's stay in Strathalbyn culminated in the erection of a new chapel and his marriage to the only daughter of Captain R. M. Phillips, of Clapton Park, London. Simpson's next charge was the old Wesleyan church near the gasworks, Brompton, South Australia, when a replacement was in process; the new one on the Port Road had its foundation stone laid on 22 March 1875 and Simpson preached the first sermon there a year later, on 3 March 1876. His next posting was to Gawler in 1876. He was elected President of the Wesleyan Conference of South Australia 1877. He was next called to the Mount Gambier circuit, raising the stipend to ¬£250 per annum. At the 1881 conference he was given the Norwood church and in 1883 appointed Secretary and Convener of the Probationers' Examination Committee; he returned to the Mount Gambier circuit as a deputy for the British and Foreign Bible Society. At the 1884 conference he was, by an overwhelming vote, elected Secretary and given charge of the Draper Memorial church in the city. In 1887 he was elected President and given the Glenelg church. In March 1890 he left South Australia for an appointment as chairman of the Western Australian district, which then in the South Australian conference, and superintendent of the Perth circuit. At the end of his three-year appointment he requested a return to South Australia in the hope it would benefit his wife's deteriorating health. Consequently he was given oversight of the Prospect circuit, which encompassed Port Adelaide and Semaphore in 1893. Mrs Simpson, whose health had deteriorated while in Perth, died at Prospect in September 1895 aged 52. In 1896 Simpson was appointed to the Kooringa church, Kooringa being the town attached to the Burra. This was around the time of Methodist Union which entailed rationalizing of redundant assets of the Wesleyan and Bible Christian churches, and many hard decisions had to be made and implemented. 1898 was the Jubilee year of the Burra church, and he was active in organising celebrations, which included editing a compendium of oral histories from the many ministers who had experiences of the Burra churches. Around this time his health began to suffer. He had a tendency to obesity, probably inherited, and his medical advisers were concerned for his heart. In August 1898 his case became so serious he was unable to perform his usual duties, and despite an apparent rallying, he died suddenly and unexpectedly on the evening of 10 September 1898. His doctors were called but he was dead when they arrived. ==Family== Simpson's father, David Simpson (c. 1804 ‚Äì 26 March 1865), died at his home, Lonsdale Street, Hamilton, Victoria. Simpson married Martha Jane Phillips (c. 1843 ‚Äì 2 September 1895) on 7 April 1874. Martha was only daughter of Captain R M. Phillips, Clapton Park, London. This was the first marriage solemnised in the Wesleyan Church, Strathalbyn. *David James Simpson (4 October 1875 ‚Äì 1931) *Robert Gawler Simpson (30 April 1877 ‚Äì ) *Martha Doris \\"Patty\\" Simpson (27 February 1879 ‚Äì 9 March 1953) *Ruth Norwood Simpson (5 May 1881 ‚Äì ) married Ewart E.

The court made a declaration of incompatibility based on Article 14 (prohibition on discrimination) and Article 8 (right to respect for private life) of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) on the basis that the Civil Partnership Act 2004 discriminates against heterosexual couples by precluding them from entering into civil partnerships. Before this Act, the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953 required all still-births (where a baby is still- born after 24 weeks gestation) to be registered by a registrar. Parents of babies who were still-born receive a medical certificate certifying the still- birth and, upon registration, could register the baby's name and receive a certificate of registration of still-birth. When a pregnancy ended before 24 weeks gestation, however, there was no formal process for parents to legally register the loss. == Provisions == The Act has the following effects: * to allow opposite sex couples to enter a civil partnership to reform how marriages are registered, and register the names of the mother of each party in a marriage or civil partnership * to require the Secretary of State to report on whether the law should be changed to allow the registration of pregnancy losses which cannot be registered as still-births under the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953 * to report on giving coroners powers to investigate stillborn deaths == See also == * Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 * Civil partnership in the United Kingdom == References == ==External links== * Civil Partnerships, Marriages and Deaths (Registration etc) Act 2019 at legislation.gov.uk Category:United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 2019 Category:2019 in British law Category:Civil rights and liberties in the United Kingdom Category:LGBT law in the United Kingdom Category:2019 in LGBT history Category:Marriage law in the United Kingdom Category:Stillbirth ","title":"Civil Partnerships, Marriages and Deaths (Registration etc) Act 2019"},{"id":"63866403","text":"Yogeshwar (Hindi: ‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó‡•á‡§∂‡•ç‚Äç‡§µ‡§∞) is a mountain of the Garhwal Himalaya in Uttarakhand India.The elevation of Yogeshwar is and its prominence is .

For many years, Epsom had two railway stations, one built by the LSWR in 1859, and this station, built by the LBSCR twelve years earlier. It was located on Upper High Street and is less than ten minutes' walk from the town's other station. It closed in 1929 when the former LSWR station was rebuilt and expanded to four platforms. ==History== The railway first reached the town in 1847 when an extension of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) from West Croydon was opened with a terminus in the former Station Road (now Upper High Street). The station was initially named Epsom, subsequently known as Epsom Town from c.1870 to c.1900, and again from 1923 to 1929. In 1859 a joint venture between the LBSCR and the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) extended the LSWR from Wimbledon to Epsom, where it joined with the LBSCR, and then ran on to Leatherhead. The lines were connected south of the LBSCR station and a new Epsom station was established on the present site. However competition between the companies remained and the new station was operated by the LSWR only, with the tracks configured so that LBSCR trains ran non-stop on the central tracks. In 1867 the line was extended south from Leatherhead to Dorking and Horsham, and in 1885 a branch from Leatherhead was built to Effingham Junction, where it connected to the line from Surbiton to Guildford. These extensions provided greater connections for Epsom to much of the rest of Surrey. After the First World War, the railway companies were merged into the Southern Railway, which set about removing duplication. In 1929 work was completed on building a completely new station on the site of the former LSWR station and the tracks at Epsom were rearranged so that the two island platforms provided cross-platform interchange, although as late as the 1960s there were survivals of different systems of the lines of the two former railway companies in that the semaphore signals on the up platforms to London were upper quadrant (on platform 3) for trains to Victoria and London Bridge, but were lower quadrant (on platform 4) for the Waterloo line. The station was closed in 1929, (though some of the building remains abandoned and bricked up behind modern developments on Upper High Street, visible from the line from Ewell East). ==References== ==External links== Category:Former London, Brighton and South Coast Railway stations Category:Former Southern Railway (UK) stations Category:Railway stations opened in 1847 Category:Railway stations closed in 1929 Category:Transport in Epsom and Ewell Category:Epsom Category:1847 establishments in England * Photo of the station some time in early 20th century ","title":"Epsom Town railway station"},{"id":"63866435","text":"The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached the French overseas collectivity of Wallis and Futuna on 16 October 2020. == Background == On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.

Hoare became a junior partner in the family bank in 1774, when, according to Price the other partners were Henry Hoare II (died 1785), Sir Richard Hoare, 1st Baronet (died 1787), and Richard Hoare of Boreham House (died 1778). The baronet was replaced by his son (Henry) Hugh Hoare (1762‚Äì1841), around 1788; with Hoare becoming senior partner. He remained in the position to the end of his life in 1828, when Hugh Hoare replaced him. Hoare owned mills on the River Wandle. He was also a shareholder in the Surrey Iron Railway. ==Mitcham Grove== Mitcham Grove, 1822 watercolour Hoare purchased Mitcham Grove, a country house near Mitcham, Surrey, from Alexander Wedderburn, 1st Earl of Rosslyn. The original house was Elizabethan. The grounds came to include the eastern part of what is now Ravensbury Park. Hoare bought it in 1784, and after his death it was sold to Sir John Lubbock, 2nd Baronet. At the time the area was industrial. ==Hoare & Co. brewery== Hoare bought in 1802 the Red Lion Brewery in East Smithfield, from 1802, and his third son George became a director. It later traded as Hoare and Co. The business was not a success, however, as he told his grandson and heir Henry Hoare of Staplehurst, shortly before he died: both Charles Hoare of the bank, and his son-in-law Acland, had put further capital into it. The Hoare & Co. brewery existed until 1934, and for a number of generations was passed down in the Hoare family. Following a string of acquisitions after World War I, it was taken over by Charrington Brewery in 1933, and closed down the year after. ==Family== Hoare married in 1775 Lydia Henrietta Malortie, daughter of the Hanover merchant Isaac Malortie.

She died at the age of seven from encephalitis caused by measles, before a vaccine against the disease had been developed. Roald Dahl's novels James and the Giant Peach (1961) and The BFG (1982) were dedicated to Olivia. As a result of her death, her father Roald later became a pro-vaccination advocate, soon writing the 1988 pamphlet \\"Measles, a Dangerous Illness\\". ==Life== Roald Dahl in 1954, the year before Olivia's birth Dahl was born in New York City and grew up in the Buckinghamshire village of Great Missenden. She was named for Olivia, the heroine of William Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, a favourite play of her mother. Her middle name, Twenty, originated from the date of her birth, and the fact that her father had $20 in his pocket when he saw her in hospital for the first time. Neal struggled with Olivia shortly after her birth, but found her behaviour transformed after spending a few weeks with her paternal aunt, Elsie Logsdail. Roald Dahl constructed his writing hut in the orchard of the couple's Gipsy House for peace and quiet to write after her birth. Olivia came home from her school, Godstowe Preparatory School, in November 1962 with a note informing her parents of an outbreak of measles. Neal contacted her brother-in-law, Ashley Miles, who sent them gamma globulin, then common in the United States, to boost children's immunity against measles. Miles only provided a small amount, which the Dahls used for their son, Theo. Neal recalled in her autobiography, As I Am, that Miles said that \\"Let the girls get measles...It will be good for them\\". Olivia subsequently contracted measles, and had a mild fever for a few days before suffering convulsions after growing increasingly lethargic. She quickly became unconscious and was rushed to Stoke Mandeville Hospital where she died the next day. Neal recalled that a doctor rang to abruptly tell her that Olivia was dead, and she \\"couldn't believe how cold he was\\". Neal later regretted not seeing Olivia after her death, having been persuaded not to by her sisters-in-law. According to Neal, her husband \\"really almost went crazy\\" with Neal keeping the family together for the sake of their two other children. Neal's grief was helped by talking about Olivia, whereas Roald kept silent about her until his own death. Olivia was survived by her siblings Theo (born 1955) and Tessa (born 1957). The Dahls' fourth and fifth children, Ophelia and Lucy, were born in 1964 and 1965 respectively. Roald wrote an account of Olivia's death in a notebook which he kept in a drawer of his writing hut; it was discovered after his death 28 years later. Olivia was buried in the churchyard of St John the Baptist in Little Missenden. Roald constructed a rock garden above her grave. ==Legacy== Roald Dahl became increasingly depressed and withdrawn after Olivia's death, spending hours at her grave in silence. His grief affected his relationship with his surviving children and he suffered from depression. He later became a pro-vaccination advocate, writing an account of Olivia's death in a 1988 pamphlet titled Measles, a Dangerous Illness for the Sandwell Health Authority. Dahl wrote that Dahl wrote in the pamphlet that \\"Today a good and safe vaccine is available to every family and all you have to do is to ask your doctor to administer it\\". In a 1997 interview Neal recalled the suddenness of Olivia's death, which occurred less than a week after contracting measles. Olivia's sister, Lucy, interviewed in 2015 by CBS, stated that her father did not understand why people chose not to vaccinate their children against measles. In Dahl's public letter he wrote that it is \\"'almost a crime' for some parents not to immunize their children\\". \\"I do agree with that\\", Lucy states; \\"I think that it is a crime\\". In tribute to her daughter, Neal donated a silver cup to Olivia's school for the best high jumper and insisted that the name of her character, Olivia Walton, that she played in The Waltons television film, The Homecoming: A Christmas Story, be kept as Olivia, and not changed to Mary as the producers wished. Roald Dahl donated a wooden statue of Saint Catherine to the Church of St John the Baptist in Little Missenden in memory of Olivia after the original was stolen from the church. Dahl's statue was also subsequently stolen and replaced by a replica. He also dedicated his children's novels James and the Giant Peach (1961) and The BFG (1982) to Olivia. The BFG was published on the twentieth anniversary of her death. ==References== * ==External links== *Measles: A dangerous illness - roalddahl.com Category:1955 births Category:1962 deaths Category:American children Category:British children Category:Dahl family Category:Deaths by person in the United Kingdom Category:Deaths from measles Category:People from Great Missenden Category:People from Manhattan ","title":"Death of Olivia Dahl"},{"id":"63866714","text":"Didi Kempot (born Didik Prasetyo; Javanese: Í¶ùÍ¶∂Í¶ùÍ¶∂Í¶èÍßÄÍ¶•Í¶øÍ¶±Í¶ºÍ¶†Í¶æ, Dhidhik Prasety√• 31 December 1966 ‚Äì 5 May 2020) was an Indonesian singer and songwriter in the campursari style. He wrote some 700 songs, mainly in his native Javanese language. Apart from Indonesia, Didi was also popular in Suriname and the Netherlands, both of which have significant Javanese diaspora population. == Personal life == Didi was born in Surakarta, Indonesia in 1966. Didi's father, Ranto Edi Gudel, was a comedian and singer-songwriter who often performed at the traditional ketoprak tobong theatrical stage. His brother was also a comedian.. According to his brother Eko Gudel, Didi's childhood was full of misbehaviour and often fighting. After dropped out from Junior High School in Surakarta, Didi then moved to his uncle's house in Samarinda but his school seemed not success too. He then returned to his hometown to start busking. == Early career == He started working as a street busker in his hometown between 1984 and 1986 before moving to Jakarta. According to him, when he arrived in Jakarta to pursue a career in music, he and eight of his friends slept in a narrow room for Rp15,000 per month. He said that the room is so narrow that they \\"sometimes could only sleep on their side [because of the lack of space].\\" The name \\"Kempot\\", which is an portmanteau of Kelompok Penyanyi Trotoar (Sidewalk Singer Group), was also coined in Jakarta. Didi said that at the time, they did not earn enough money to save, because every time they earn some amount, the money will be spent on drinks. However, this period was a productive time as he wrote many songs, including \\"We Cen Yu\\", \\"Cidro\\", \\"Moblong-Moblong\\", \\"Lerteler Meneh\\" and \\"Podo Pintere\\". According to Didi, these songs were popular among fellow buskers, even though he had not yet released them officially. This convinced him to continue pursuing a music career. After busking, Didi usually found time to record songs using blank tapes and tape recorders. When a song had been recorded, Didi handed it directly to various recording studios as a demo. Didi recounted that often the tape only got so far as the security desk. Some of the labels Didi applied for were MSC Plus and Musica Studios. Musica Studios eventually called Didi because they were interested in his demo tape. Didi was then assisted by Pompi Suradimansyah, a member of the band No Koes, in arranging music. Slowly but surely, the comedic song \\"We Cen Yu\\" which was lined up as a single, became popular with the public, especially in Jakarta. Didi was offered to make a music video to be aired on TVRI, the only nationwide television channel at that time. This was also his first time to appear on the screen. In 1989, he released the single \\"Cidro\\" (\\"Broken\\"), which did not immediately become popular at the time. The song's theme did not fit the mainstream comedic, funny songs along the lines of \\"Jika Bulan Bisa Ngomong\\" (\\"If Only the Moon Could Speak\\") by . Moreover, the campursari style employed by Didi was not popular in the 1980s; Musica lumped him together with other Javanese pop singers. == Concerts in the Netherlands and Suriname == Although \\"Cidro\\" had no success in Indonesia at the time of its release, it was a hit in the Netherlands and Suriname, two countries that have a significant Indonesian diaspora, including those of Javanese descent. Didi then was invited to hold a concert there. In 1993, Didi left for the Netherlands. When he arrived in the Netherlands, Didi was surprised that many memorized \\"Cidro\\". He returned to the Netherlands in 1996 and also toured Suriname. In the South American country, Didi was even more famous among the many native people and Javanese descendants there. From 1996 to 1998, he recorded 10 albums which were only released in the Netherlands and Suriname, such as Layang Kangen, Trimo Ngalah, and Suket Teki. In total Didi performed in Netherlands twice and in Suriname 11 times, the latest being the Layang Kangen Tour in 2018 when he received an award from President D√©si Bouterse. == Success in Indonesia == In the 1990s, Didi released the songs \\"Sewu Kutho\\" (\\"A Thousand Cities\\") and \\"Stasiun Balapan\\" (\\"Balapan Station\\"), which became hits in Indonesia. Didi's fame in his home country rose after his album Stasiun Balapan (1999) exploded in the market. Print and electronic media began covering Didi. He paced to various television stations for album promos. The success of the Stasiun Balapan album led Didi to record a second album titled Modal Dengkul. Other albums he released in early 2000s are Tanjung Mas Ninggal Janji, Seketan Ewu, Plong (2000), Ketaman Asmoro (2001), Poko'e Melu (2002), Cucak Rowo (2003), Jambu Alas with Nunung Alvi (2004) and Ono Opo (2005). His popularity waned with the turn of the century, but in the 2010s he regained his prominence especially among younger people. According to music researcher Irfan R. Darajat from Laras Studies of Music in Society, the rise of Didi is part of a recent effort of \\"hipster-washing\\" to raise up music that was previously considered \\"uncool\\", such as dangdut and qasidah. The rooting, site-specific, exclusivity of Didi's heartbreak songs in Javanese fits with the hipster-washing pattern. However, he added that Didi's rise to mainstream fame should not make him to be seen \\"[‚Ä¶] weird, cult-like, kitsch or whatever and make Didi‚Äôs music seem like something exotic.\\" On April 2020, he streamed a live charity concert from his house and raised a total Rp7.6 billion (~$500,000) to help Indonesians who are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. He also released a song entitled \\"Ojo Mudik\\" (\\"Don't Go Mudik\\"), pleading his fans not to go back home during the Eid al-Fitr holiday season to prevent further spread of the coronavirus. == Style == Didi worked in a campursari (a Javanese word meaning \\"mixture of essences\\") style, producing ballads with influences of pop music and the local styles kroncong and dangdut. The vast majority of his songs are themed around heartbreaks and other sad love stories. Because of this, he earned the nickname \\"The Godfather of the Broken-Hearted\\" during his later years. Aldo Sianturi of Billboard Indonesia writes that he is a \\"genius music conceptor\\" who are able to express the \\"depth and bitternes of love\\" in his lyrics, which are mostly written in Javanese, specifically the low ngoko register which is used as the daily speech by most Javanese speakers. == Death == Didi died of complications from cardiac arrest on 5 May 2020 in Surakarta. He is survived by his wife Yan Vellia and two children. == References * * * Category:1966 births Category:2020 deaths Category:20th-century Indonesian singers Category:20th-century male singers Category:21st-century Indonesian singers Category:21st-century male singers Category:Campursari Category:Indonesian male singers Category:Javanese people Category:People from Surakarta ","title":"Didi Kempot"},{"id":"63866756","text":"is a Japanese former Nippon Professional Baseball infielder. == References == Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:Baseball people from Saitama Prefecture Category:Japanese baseball players Category:Nippon Professional Baseball infielders Category:Seibu Lions players category:Yakult Swallows players category:Tokyo Yakult Swallows players Category:Baseball players at the 1990 Asian Games ","title":"Ken Suzuki"},{"id":"63866808","text":"Pavel Korda (born 17 May 1971) is a former Czech darts player and currently sports commentator for TV Nova and active promoter of darts in Czech republic. == Career == During his darts career he participated in many tournaments on national and European scene.

It was originally opened in 1991 as the Ponderosa Rural Therapeutic Centre before being granted a zoo license in 2004. ==History== In 1988, businessman Howard Cook MBE purchased a neglected dairy farm in Heckmondwike, West Yorkshire. The farmland was considered poor quality with little use to the farmer and surrounding community so, in 1989, Cook began to redevelop it and used it as a base for his building company. Cook's family, which was associated with the learning disability charity Mencap, decided to use the farmland for the disabled and established the Ponderosa Rural Therapeutic Centre. A greenhouse and other facilities were built in collaboration with the Ravensthorpe Education Centre which allowed students to experience and develop their horticultural skills. In 1991, Cook's wife, Maureen Cook (n√©e Totton), developed the site further by introducing a rare breeds farm, named the Ponderosa Rare Breeds Farm, which was built upon a landfill between two disused railway lines. By 2002, the centre had grown to house around 150 animals, including wallabies and water buffalo. Llamas, emus and deer also joined the collection after moving from a small zoo in Lancashire. During the same year, the zoo received ¬£13,000 in compensation due to a nationwide outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease which resulted in the centre closing for over two months. The money was used to build new attractions, including an enclosure for marmosets, a reptile house, an aquatic centre and two lakes. A zoo license was also applied for due to the increasing size of the zoo's animal collection, which was granted in 2004. In 2014, the zoo was put up for sale at a price of ¬£1.3 million. In 2017, the centre became a provisional member of the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums and adopted the name Ponderosa Zoo. During the same year, it closed for several months to carry out planned refurbishments amid reports of poor animal welfare and mistreatment in the local press. Following an inspection, Kirklees Council subsequently concluded that standards had been met. Zoo co-founder, Maureen Cook, died in April 2020. ==Overview== The zoo lies within a plot of land off Smithies Lane in Heckmondwike, West Yorkshire. It is laid around a small lake and comprises various animal enclosures, a ticket office, cafe, lakeside restaurant, reptile house, adventure play area and guest amenities. The zoo's animal collection has gradually expanded since its beginnings in 1991 as a \\"rare breeds farm\\" with Highland cattle, llamas, wallabies and emus. As of 5 May 2020, the zoo's collection of over 120 animals includes serval, Scottish wildcats, lemurs, reindeer, coati, otters and raccoon dogs, plus various birds, reptiles and small invertebrates. Prior to becoming a zoo, the centre's founding mission was to \\"bridge the gap\\" between disabled and able-bodied people through using animals as a form of therapy. However, today, the zoo's mission also includes educating people on conservation. ==References== Category:Zoos in England Category:1991 establishments in England Category:Tourist attractions in West Yorkshire Category:Zoos established in 1991 ","title":"Ponderosa Zoo"},{"id":"63867153","text":"Pashk Laska is the majority shareholder and president of Albanian football club KF La√ßi. ==KF La√ßi== Laska has been the president of KF La√ßi since 2002.

Parts of the mountain slope are very steep and form important nesting grounds for some species of birds; the access to these areas is restricted during the summer. The flora in parts of the nature reserve is exceptionally rich for this part of the country, partially because it is a location where northern species overlap with the habitat of more southern species. Over 400 species of vascular plants grow here. Typical plants include fragrant orchid, Lapland marsh-orchid and alpine sow-thistle. Red-listed or unusual species found in the reserve include the small white orchid, the moss Bryum blindii, and the fungus Bovista paludosa. The fauna is also diverse, and golden eagle, great snipe, Eurasian lynx and wolverine have all been observed in the nature reserve. The area has been influenced by human interaction for a long time. It contains seven grave sites from 800‚Äì1050 CE. Its traditional use as pasture may go back as far as a thousand years. Although it ceased to be used as grazing ground in 1971, the old pastures were restored in 2003‚Äì2008 within the framework of the EU-funded LIFE Programme. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Nature reserves in Sweden Category:Natura 2000 in Sweden Category:Tourist attractions in J√§mtland County Category:Geography of J√§mtland County Category:Protected areas established in 1974 Category:1974 establishments in Sweden ","title":"Hamrafj√§llet Nature Reserve"},{"id":"63867198","text":"The NHS Nightingale Hospital North East is one of the temporary NHS Nightingale Hospitals set up by NHS England to help to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.

It was released through the Brooklyn-based Sacred Bones Records on May 1, 2020. The album was recorded in Los Angeles and was mainly written by Jones while he was working on the films The Outpost and The Kindness of Strangers. It received generally positive reviews, with praise for its innovating sound, but some criticism directed at its length and lack of narrative coherence. == Background and artwork == The album was recorded in Los Angeles and Jones worked on the album while he was working on two films. He wrote the instrumental track \\"Flag Day\\" when he was in Bulgaria working on the movie The Outpost and he wrote substantial parts of the album when he was stationed in Toronto making The Kindness of Strangers. When he finished working on the movie, he wrote \\"a few more songs\\" in New York. Jones has stated that the money he made from being a part of the movie The Outpost funded the album and made it possible to record and release. Jim Jarmusch was the one that recommended Jones to Sacred Bones Records and eventually producer Nic Jodain teamed up with Jones and helped out with the album's production. Jones wrote all of the songs on the album and also played drums, keyboards and rhythm guitar on all tracks. His longtime friend Robert Hudson, who Jones had a band together with called \\"Robert Jones\\", played bass on the entirety of the record. The artwork for the record features Jones in a Marie Antoinette‚Äìera wig with a white powdered face and red lips, while holding a cigarette in his hand. There isn't any specific meaning behind the choice of the artwork, according to Vulture. Jones's girlfriend Katya Zvereva had a warehouse which the couple could use and they just \\"made some things they thought looked cool.\\" == Critical reception == The Mother Stone received generally positive reviews from music critics. On the review aggregate website Metacritic, The Mother Stone received a score of 63, based on eight reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" Album of the Year assessed the critical consensus as a 73 out of 100, based on nine reviews. AllMusic critic Timothy Monger wrote that Jones, on the album, \\"unleashed what sounds like a lifetime's worth of ideas and pent-up weirdness, constructing a wild suite of interconnected songs, replete with lurching orchestral sections and harsh fuzzy textures and sung in a variety of different voices and timbres like a character actor gone off the rails.\\" Monger also declared the album unpredictable and praised the production, while at the same time stating that the album lacks memorable songs. Caroline Edwards of Clash gave the album a positive review, writing that it's \\"unlike anything else out in music right now. It's risky and at times, clumsy, but overall, effective. The record is fun and isn't afraid to be weird - it's evident Jones was passionate about the project and that it wasn't just a second thought. While it won't be played on Radio 1 anytime soon, listening to the album is artistic at its core, and more so, a cathartic and worthwhile experience.\\" Exclaim!s reviewer Matt Yuyitung opined that \\"The Mother Stone is impressive in the size and scope of its ambition, but that size overwhelms any kind of narrative coherence.\\" He continued by stating that the album is \\"a disorienting, manic, ambitious psychedelic statement filled with constant twists and turns, and this is both its biggest strength and most notable weakness.\\" John Murphy of musicOMH acclaimed the album and called it a \\"modern classic\\", while at the same time comparing the album to The Beatles' work. Murphy wrote the following: It's hard to believe that albums like this are still being made, for it plays like a record that was hidden away from the world for 50 years, came to life in its cave, and has now emerged to take its revenge on its captors. Simply put, his [Jones'] music seems alive, and utterly modern ‚Äì despite its clear and obvious debt to The Beatles. Jones may face accusations that his album is derivative (it is), or that he's playing it safe by opting to use the tools of the greatest band of all time (he's not), but ultimately, listeners have to recognise that if it was this easy, everyone would do it. This is a staggering work, a monumental achievement ‚Äì and easily eclipses any of Jones' acting to date.\\" However, Murphy noted The Mother Stones length as a negative aspect of the album. Pitchforks reviewer Cat Zhang wrote that Jones' \\"musical debut is full of shadowy theatrics and cryptic gibberish. Rarely do you encounter music this bombastic and unreasonable.\\" Zhang further opined that \\"Caleb Landry Jones' music inspires a reaction somewhere in the middle of the album and \\"it's interesting, even fun while it lasts, but you probably won't return.\\" Liam Inscoe-Jones of The Line of Best Fit noted the song \\"Katya\\" as the album's highlight, while mentioning the following regarding the record as a whole: \\"Stylistic consistency is key to the steady enjoyability of the music; the record is filled with wilting harmonies, Wurlitzer, wry saxophone, woodwind and garage-rock guitar vamps across the board. You can tell this an artist comfortable with the spotlight because he [Jones] surrounded himself in an entire circus, and the whole record is a vibrant splash of colour.\\" == Track listing == Adapted from Apple Music. ==Personnel== Adapted from Tidal and Spotify. * Caleb Landry Jones ‚Äì producing, composing, vocals, songwriting * Nic Jodain ‚Äì producing * Robert Hudson ‚Äì bass ==Release history== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" border=\\"1\\" +Release formats for The Mother Stone ! scope=\\"col\\" Country ! scope=\\"col\\" Date ! scope=\\"col\\" Format ! scope=\\"col\\" Label ! scope=\\"col\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Various  May 1, 2020   rowspan=\\"1\\"Sacred Bones Records  align=\\"center\\" } ==References== Category:2020 debut albums Category:Sacred Bones Records albums Category:Psychedelic rock albums by American artists ","title":"The Mother Stone"},{"id":"63867271","text":"\\"The Moon is Green\\" is a science fiction short story by Fritz Leiber. It was first published in Galaxy in April 1952, and has appeared in several collections since then. It was adapted as a radio play for X Minus One in 1957, and a television episode in 2014. ==Plot summary== Effie is trapped in a house with her husband Hank, an \\"angry, stale little man\\", due to the lingering radioactive dust from a nuclear war using cobalt bombs. A limited war went on for years with both sides carefully controlling their bombing to stay below the lethal radiation threshold. When, by accident, they tripped over the point of no return, all of the forces launched their remaining weapons in \\"the Fury\\". Those that survived did so in caverns, where whole societies were built. It is only now, years later, that one can live at ground level, albeit in a heavily lead-shielded and air-filtered home. Hank berates Effie for her unwise decision to open the shutters for a moment to look at the green-colored moon. She closes the shutters and checks herself with a Geiger counter. Hank is further maddened when it \\"goes off\\" near her waist, but this turns out to be due to a radium-painted wristwatch in her pocket. It is revealed that Effie is pregnant, which Hank believes has led to a recent promotion and will continue to improve their social status over time. He is further angered when she refuses to go to a public dinner where his promotion will be made public. She persuades him to go alone. As soon as he leaves, Effie returns to the window where she is greeted by a man living outside. He enters through the window, and in return for food, he tells her his name is Patrick and talks of the new Garden of Eden that emerged due to the mutations caused by the radiation. Hank returns early, mentioning he was aware Effie was carrying on an affair and he had realized the radium watch was a ruse to disguise the radioactive fetus. Patrick denies any affair, and Hank argues with him. Effie becomes increasingly desperate to leave the house. She states that Patrick's survival proves the dust is no longer radioactive. This is disproven when the Geiger counter, the \\"ultimate arbiter of truth in the 20th century\\", goes off the scale when Hank measures Patrick. Patrick comes clean; the stories of the garden of Eden are simply a seduction technique that has worked for him in the past. The revelation drives Effie insane; she leaps out the window and runs off. Patrick chases after her, while Hank simply returns into his home and locks the window behind him. ==Publication== First published in Galaxy in 1952, it was selected for collection in 1953's \\"The Best Science- Fiction Stories\\" and again for the Fourth Series in 1955. It first appeared in an anthology of Leiber's works in 1968's \\"The Secret Songs\\", and then in a number of following Leiber collections. The story was adapted for radio by X Minus One and first broadcast on 2 January 1957. Many years later it was adapted for television's Suspense series, first broadcast on 8 July 2016. ==Reception== The Moon is Green is used as an example of a specific period in Leiber's writing. While the story is ostensibly an example of the post- apocalyptic short story that was common in the 1950s, its underlying theme is based on an examination of women's roles in storytelling. In 1949, Leiber read Robert Graves' Seven Days in New Crete, based on Graves' earlier work, The White Goddess. Leiber became uncomfortable with Graves' treatment of female stereotypes in these works, and began to publish a series of works that inverted these themes to show women not as irrational by nature, but driven so by male-dominated societies and masculine bias. Examples of similar themes are seen in \\"The Mechanical Bride\\" and \\"Poor Superman\\". After a bout with alcoholism, Leiber returned to the topic in \\"The Big Time\\". ==References== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * ==External links== * Category:1952 short stories Category:Science fiction short stories Category:Short stories by Fritz Leiber Category:Works originally published in Analog Science Fiction and Fact ","title":"The Moon is Green"},{"id":"63867292","text":"Map of Massachusetts House of Representatives' 5th Suffolk district, 2013.

He supported far- reaching economic interventionism. In the 1920s he was associated with the poet Stefan George and his circle, and George's aestheticist outlook influenced Salin throughout his career. He was a proponent of European integration, and after World War II he became a prominent critic of ordoliberalism, particularly the work of Wilhelm R√∂pke. In addition to his economic research, Salin published a series of translations of Plato. He died on 17 May 1974 in Veytaux, Switzerland.

The town hall, which is the headquarters of Havering London Borough Council, is a Grade II listed building. ==History== The old court house (on the right) In the second half of the 19th century the local board of health was based in offices in the Market Place in Romford before acquiring the old court house of the independent liberty of Havering in the Market Place in 1892. The local board was restructured as an urban district in 1894 and, after the old court house became inadequate for their needs, civic leaders decided to procure a purpose-built town hall: the site selected in Main Road had previously been open land. The council relocated to temporary offices in South Street in 1931 while it waited for the new building to become available. The new building was designed by Herbert R Collins and Antoine Englebert O Geens in the International Moderne style and was officially opened as Romford Town Hall by the Lord Mayor of London, Sir George Broadbridge, on 16 September 1937. The district was also incorporated as a municipal borough that year and Broadbridge took the opportunity to present the charter of incorporation to the charter mayor, Councillor Charles Allen, on the same day. The design for the building, which had a Scandinavian element to it, involved an asymmetrical main frontage facing onto Main Road; it featured a tower on the left with a doorway and canopy on the ground floor and a tall window on the first floor flanked by flagpoles with a further flagpole on the roof; to the right were eleven bays with windows on each of the ground and first floors. The building was extended by three bays to the left in a similar style in 1960. Internally, the main rooms were council chamber and two large committee rooms. The building remained the local seat of government, and was renamed \\"Havering Town Hall\\", when the expanded London Borough of Havering was formed in 1965. Queen Elizabeth II, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh attended a civic lunch with council officials on 6 March 2003. In January 2016, following a debate in the council chamber, Havering Council became the first council in the UK to join the campaign to leave the European Union. The town hall was extensively restored and redecorated in autumn 2017. ==References== Category:Grade II listed buildings in the London Borough of Havering Category:City and town halls in London Category:Government buildings completed in 1937 Category:Grade II listed government buildings ","title":"Havering Town Hall"},{"id":"63867677","text":"Brigadier Leonard Merlyn Wickremasooriya (26 March 1916 ‚Äì 27 June 2002) was a Sri Lankan military leader, he served as the Commandant, Army Training Centre, Diyatalawa.

She is a Stadtman principal investigator and head of the developmental genomics group at the National Cancer Institute. == Early life and education == Hatice Efsun Arda spent time with her mother, a nurse practitioner, at a hospital and in clinical laboratories. This early exposure encouraged her to study biology and medicine. Arda completed a B.S. in molecular biology and genetics at Boƒüazi√ßi University. Arda obtained a Ph.D. in systems biology from the University of Massachusetts Medical School. During her doctorate training in the laboratory of , she studied gene regulatory networks that pertain to the metabolism of the model organism, C. elegans. She uncovered a set of metabolic genes that are sensitive to the nutrient content of C. elegans bacterial diet. === Postdoctoral research === Interested in gene regulatory networks and developmental biology, Arda joined the laboratory of at Stanford University for her postdoctoral training. As a JDRF fellow, she developed cell sorting methods to purify primary pancreatic cells from children and adults, and used RNA sequencing to reveal hundreds of genes that are differentially regulated during the first 10 years of human lifespan, several of which are linked by association studies to diabetes risk. To understand how pancreatic cell type-specific gene expression programs are controlled at the genomic level, she then combined cell sorting with genomic techniques, like ATAC-Seq to delineate the regulatory chromatin landscape of human pancreatic cell types. This work revealed thousands of putative enhancer regions that explain cell type-specific gene expression in the human pancreas. In 2016, Arda's research showed that the beta cells in the human pancreas continue their maturation after birth. Arda and colleagues examined the gene expression and chromatin profiles of pancreas cells isolated from children and adults and found specific gene-expression programs that are turned on after the age of 10. The study was the first to demonstrate these differences at a global level, and the team uncovered new factors potentially mediating this process. To investigate genomic regulation, Arda continued to research the DNA elements that control pancreas-cell specification, identity, and function. Arda and co- authors and generated an atlas of genomic elements specific to the main cell types in the human pancreas. She identified unique regions in our genomes that control cell-type-specific gene expression in human pancreas cells. These regions also turned out to harbor more disease-risk variants associated with diabetes or pancreas cancer than other parts of the human genome. == Career and research == Arda joined the National Institutes of Health in 2017 as a Stadtman principal investigator in the laboratory of receptor biology and gene expression at the National Cancer Institute. She is head of the developmental genomics group. Arda's laboratory aims to delineate the gene regulatory networks that control the development, expansion and function of human pancreatic cells. Her research group combines genomic approaches with use of primary human cells, stem cell and genome-editing technologies to build maps of regulatory genomes governing the establishment and growth of human pancreatic cell lineages. Arda characterizes the cell lineages that give rise to human pancreas using single cell sequencing. == References == == External links == * Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:National Institutes of Health people Category:21st-century biologists Category:21st- century women scientists Category:Turkish medical researchers Category:Women medical researchers Category:Turkish biologists Category:Developmental biologists Category:University of Massachusetts Medical School alumni Category:Boƒüazi√ßi University alumni Category:Turkish women scientists Category:Systems biologists Category:Turkish systems scientists Category:Women systems scientists Category:Turkish expatriates in the United States Category:Expatriate academics in the United States ","title":"H.

Although the Soviet state in the 1930s censored Dzhan, and only published selected chapters, the uncensored text was finally published in full in 1999. Shortly after in 2008, New York Review Books Classics issued a collection of Platonov's works translated into English by Robert and Elizabeth Chandler, Katia Grigoruk, Angela Livingstone, Olga Meerson, and Eric Naiman that included the novella Soul (Dzhan), the short story The Return, and six other stories. Soul, or Dzhan, could be read as a ‚Äútypical socialist realist novel of the Stalinist era,‚Äù yet it contains elements that separate it from this categorization. In summary, it is the story of how Nazar Chagataev, a ‚Äúnon- Russian‚Äù economist from Central Asia, leaves Moscow and goes to bring socialism to his people called the Dzhan, a lost, nomadic nation made up of rejects and outcasts that possess nothing but their souls. Upon reaching the Dzhan, Chagataev realizes that he can do nothing to help the nation yet embarks on a perilous journey with them through the desert to the mountains before returning to Moscow at the end of the story. The majority of the story narrates the perilous migration of the Dzhan nation from the Sary-Kamysh delta through the Kara-Kum desert to the Ust-Yurt Mountains. Geography plays an important role in this novella especially given the fact that Platonov as a Russian writer was an ‚Äúoutsider‚Äù in Central Asia writing from the perspective of an ‚Äúinsider.‚Äù The story takes place during the 1930s at the end of the national delimitation process that occurred in Central Asia from 1924-1936 that resulted in the formation of the Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Tajik, Turkmen, and Uzbek SSRs. Today the novel‚Äôs references to these specific geographical landmarks exist within the nations of Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan respectively. == Plot summary == The narrative starts with Nazar Chagataev‚Äôs graduation from the Moscow Institute of Economics. In the courtyard, he meets a woman named Vera and goes home with her that night. At her home, he sees an interesting diptych on her wall and learns that Vera is pregnant, but the father of the child is dead. He immediately fosters a strange connection to Vera and to her young daughter, Ksenya. After frequent visits, he decides marry Vera, but then leaves after the summer to go to his posting to ‚Äúbring socialism‚Äù to his people and assist the Dzhan nation into a better life. He sets off on a long journey by train across the steppe, by boat down the Amu- Darya, and finally reaches the Dzhan nation living in a delta called Sary- Kamysh. He meets Sufyan, Molla Cherkezov, Aidym and Gyulchatay, but his mother, Gyulchatay, does not seem to remember him. He sees that they are a sad, destitute nation living in a miserable state with very few possessions and little strength to live. He returns briefly to Chimgay for supplies, and there he receives a letter from Ksenya stating that Vera and the baby have died. Although the news gives him sorrow, he decides that he must carry on his mission with the Dzhan. He returns to them and has a discussion with Nur- Mohammed who has been sent by the district executive committee to keep track of and assist the Dzhan. Although Nur-Mohammed has no hope in the nation, Chagataev decides they must migrate to a better location, hoping that this move with result in better living conditions for the group. During this slow migration across the Kara-Kum sands, the group struggles to find sustenance and follows a fold of wandering sheep in hopes for food and direction. Some members of the nation die in the unforgiving sands. Chagataev slowly separates from the group as he falls behind and nearly dies from exhaustion and starvation. As he approaches death, he fights off two giant birds attacking him, shooting them with a pistol, and collapses into unconsciousness. Meanwhile, Nur-Mohammed stays with the group and in an act of desperation, intentionally separates from the group with Aidym. During a strange rape scene involving Nur-Mohammed, Aidym sees the giant birds fly overhead and hears the shots of Chagataev‚Äôs gun. She goes immediately to him and sees him unconscious. Aidym quickly tries to comfort Nazar and restore his health. By this time, Nur-Mohammed comes back and once again tries to steal Aidym and take her to Afghanistan. Nazar tries to stop him and they get into a fight. The fight ends as Nazar shoots Nur-Mohammaed in the legs, and he runs off in to the sands never to be seen again. After this scene, the nation has lost a few members, their spirits are low, and they decide to eat the giant birds that Nazar killed. They rest for some days, then continue onward to the Ust- Yurt Mountains. However, once they reach the mountains, only Nazar and Aidym work to keep a small group of sheep, build a small dwelling, and restore the health the remaining members. They work together to build adobe houses and properly settle in the Ust-Yurt Mountains. However, soon after their health is restored many of the members disperse in all directions before the winter. Nazar stays the winter, then goes to Khiva and other cities to look for them. Chagataev decides that he must secure the well-being of the Dzhan nation and then return to Moscow. He meets another outcast, a young girl named Khanom, and he fosters an interesting relationship with her. They share some nights together, and he tells her to stay in the chaikhana until he returns. Nazar goes to Chardzhou where he meets Sufyan. They continue around other cities such as Ashgabat, Bairam-Ali and Merv until he decides to return to Khiva, collect Khanom and go back to the mountains. When he returns, the owners of the chaikhana tell him that Khanom left to go look for him. He takes off quickly to the Ust-Yurt Mountains to see Aidym once more. When he arrives, he sees that Khanom has made her way there along with other members of the nation. She has decided to stay and marry Molla Cherkezov. There is now a sufficient fold of sheep and other mud dwellings. Chagataev stays until the end of summer, but ultimately realizes that he is no longer needed. At the end of his stay, he advises the Dzhan to elect Khanom as the new leader. After everything seems in place, Nazar decides to take Aidym to school in Moscow and they both leave the Ust-Yurt Mountains and take the long journey. When they return to Moscow, Ksenya and Aidym become friends. Ksenya helps Aidym adjust to the city life by taking her to the bathhouse, helping her get clothes and teaching her things about the city. The story ends as Ksenya and Nazar hold hands, and Nazar realizes that help can only come from others, not from himself. == Main characters == Nazar Chagataev ‚Äì His mother is Gyulchatay and his father was Ivan Chagataev, a Russian soldier in Khiva. His name, nazar, means ‚Äúinner vision.‚Äù He is the protagonist or hero of the novella. He is a ‚Äúnon-Russian‚Äù economist from Central Asia, and he attempts to lead the Dzhan nation from the Sary-Kamysh delta to the Ust-Yurt Mountains before returning to Moscow. Vera ‚Äì She is a student in her final year at the Chemistry Institute. Nazar Chagataev meets her in Moscow and after frequent visits decides to marry her. She dies in childbirth, leaving Ksenya an only child. Ksenya ‚Äì She is the daughter of Vera. She suffers through her mother‚Äôs death and becomes an only child. She lives in Moscow and grows up to be a ‚Äúreal woman‚Äù who welcomes Nazar and Aidym at the end of the novella. Gyulchatay ‚Äì She is Nazar Chagataev‚Äôs Turkmen mother. She is an older member of the Dzhan nation. Nur-Mohammed ‚Äì He is a man sent by the district executive committee in Tashkent who does not belong to the Dzhan nation. He becomes the ‚Äúvillain‚Äù of the novel when he tries to steal Aidym and take her to Afghanistan. Sufyan ‚Äì He is one of the older, wiser members of the Dzhan nation. He gives frequent comments on the state and the status of the Dzhan. Molla Cherkezov ‚Äì He is a blind man and a member of the Dzhan. He marries Khanom at the end of the novel. Aidym ‚Äì She is the daughter of Molla Cherkezov. She is a teenage girl and one of the youngest members of the Dzhan nation. She suffers through various hardships such as rape, extreme poverty, and starvation, yet becomes a leader for which the Dzhan rely when they reach the Ust-Yurt Mountains. At the end of the novella, she returns with Nazar to Moscow to begin a new life. Khanom ‚Äì Her name, khanom, means ‚Äúyoung woman‚Äù or ‚Äúyoung lady.‚Äù She is a young woman that Nazar meets in Khiva. He spends some nights with her and convinces her to live with the Dzhan. She marries Molla Cherkezov and becomes one of the leaders of the Dzhan nation. == Main themes == Andrey Platonov attempts to follow the ‚Äúsocialist realist‚Äù master plot through key examples such as Chagataev‚Äôs mission to ‚Äúbring socialism‚Äù to the Dzhan so that they may become ‚Äúhappy, progressive, and numerous.‚Äù However, Platonov strays from the master plot in certain noticeable points such as Chagataev‚Äôs realization that he cannot help the group and decides to return to Moscow. The plot and characters of Dzhan seem to follow certain trajectories and exhibit the desire to add to socialist values of a Soviet society, yet they ultimately fall short. Thus, Platonov is unable to fit the mandated socialist realist framework, which results in the partial and delayed publication of this particular work. In Dzhan, Platonov initially exhibits orientalist similarities in his texts through his depictions of Central Asian territory as useful, vast, and transformable, and Central Asia people as miserable, poor, and backwards. During his two trips to Central Asia, Platonov kept a record of his travels through is notes as well as writes letters to his wife and son while on the trip to Central Asia. Through these notes and letters, we can also see his attempts to describe ‚Äúthe Turkmen‚Äù people as well as his efforts to make sense of his territorial surroundings in an orientalist fashion through his intentions to remake the society and transform the territory. Scholars have noted how Platonov attempts to reflect his own reality through Soviet subjectivity in other works such as ‚ÄúAmong Animals and Plants‚Äù and Happy Moscow. However, through the literary work of Dzhan, Platonov also illustrates Soviet subjectivity through his attempts to depict the ‚ÄúSoviet soul‚Äù within collective existence, his vision of ascent and enlightenment, his complicated understanding of narodnost‚Äô, his descriptions of homeless or abridged ‚ÄúSoviet people,‚Äù and his creation of ‚Äúinsider characters‚Äù in a region for which he is an ‚Äúoutsider.‚Äù == Reception == Although Platonov repeatedly mentions Stalin throughout Dzhan in a fatherly and glorified way, Platonov‚Äôs vision and textual expression did not align with the personal views of Stalin or the mandates of the Soviet state in the 1930s. Scholars such as Chandler, Deathridge, Skakov, and Seifrid comment on the tumultuous relationship between Platonov and Stalin and the ways in which his coded language allowed him to survive the Great Terror of the 1930s. However, despite narrowly escaping trial and potential exile, Platonov‚Äôs textual representation of the ‚ÄúSoviet soul‚Äù and ‚Äúsocialist reality‚Äù set him directly against Stalin and Soviet Union seeking to categorize and sort ‚Äúsouls‚Äù that fit into their idea of the Soviet project. During the 1930s, Andrey Platonov had many problems publishing his work. With the novella Dzhan, it was the same case. Platonov‚Äôs inability to fit the socialist realist model, his inclusion of graphic content, and his conflicting definitions of a ‚ÄúSoviet soul‚Äù ultimately resulted in the censorship of the novella. Although ‚Äúbrief extracts‚Äù from the first three chapters did appear in Literaturnaia Gazeta in 1938 and previous editions with ‚Äúnumerous omissions‚Äù were published from the 1960s to the 1990s, the ‚Äúuncensored text‚Äù of Dzhan was not fully published until 1999. In 2008, New York Review Books Classics issued a collection of Platonov's works translated into English that included the novella Soul (Dzhan), the short story The Return, and six other stories. Soul (Dzhan) was translated by Robert and Elizabeth Chandler and Olga Meerson with Jane Chamberlain and Eric Naiman.

Heavily damaged during the Sack of Leuven in August 1914, the building was restored 1921‚Äì1926. It has been a listed building since 26 November 1942, and protected built heritage since 14 September 2009. ==History== The university hall in 1610 Work on the oldest parts of the building began on 11 April 1317, with the aim of replacing the 12th-century cloth hall which had become too small after a rapid expansion of the city's cloth trade around 1300. The builders were Jan Stevens, Arnout Hore and Goert Raes. The University of Leuven, founded in December 1425, began to occupy the building in 1431, although initially sharing it with some of the town's guilds and with the city armoury. In the late 17th century, the university sued the city of Leuven before the Brussels Privy Council to repair the building, and a settlement was reached on 28 May 1679 by which the city relinquished ownership of the building to the university, absolving itself of further responsibility for repairs. The university in return undertook to build a new guild house for the guilds which had been established in the cloth hall. On 18 June 1680, work started on an entirely new upper floor, which after completion in 1690 housed teaching spaces and the university library. A Baroque cartouche was added above the main entrance with the inscription from the Book of Proverbs (9:1), Sapientia aedificavit sibi domum (\\"Wisdom has built herself a house\\"). Rega's 18th-century extension In 1719, Rector Henri-Joseph Rega commissioned the addition of a new wing. Work started on 22 April 1723, and the new wing was taken into use on 14 March 1725.Jan van Impe, De Leuvense universiteitsbibliotheek: historische wandelgids (Leuven, 2012), pp. 56-57. After the university was closed and its assets seized in 1797, the university hall became state property. An imperial decree of 12 December 1805 returned the former university hall to the city, which housed the city library in part of the building and rented the rest out to private businesses, including a butcher's shop, a tavern and a theatre. Under the United Kingdom of the Netherlands (1815‚Äì1830), a State University of Leuven was established, with a royal order of 25 September 1816 obliging the city to vacate all former university buildings and make them available to the new university. The State University was active from 1817 to 1835. In 1835 the Catholic University of Belgium, founded the previous year in Mechelen, relocated to Leuven and took the name Catholic University of Leuven. One of the attractions of the move was the city's offer to give the university hall in leasehold. Initially used for faculty offices and teaching, the building was gradually given over entirely to the library as new faculty buildings and lecture theatres became available. ===Library=== The medieval university had a collegiate structure, but in the early 17th century a central university library began to take shape with the bequests of the libraries of Laurentius Beyerlinck, a canon of Antwerp Cathedral, in 1627, and of Professor of Medicine Jacobus Romanus in 1637. The university library was housed in the university hall until 1797, when most of the holdings were seized and transported to Brussels and Paris, and again from 1835 until 1914. ===August 1914=== The ruins of the university library in 1915 In the night of 25‚Äì26 August 1914, invading German forces deliberately set fire to the university library, destroying approximately 230,000 books, 950 manuscripts, and 800 incunabula. Only the outer walls of the university hall remained standing. This became a symbol of the cruelty of the German invaders throughout the world. Only urgent stabilisation works could be carried out during the war, and research on the structures that the fire had laid bare was carried out by Professor of Architecture, Raymond Lemaire. ===University offices=== The university hall in the early 21st century After the war, the building was returned to the university on a 99-year lease. Between 1921 and 1926, renovation works were undertaken to return the building to its pre-war appearance. Works were completed on 20 October 1926, and the restored building was inaugurated on 28 June 1927. A new, dedicated Central Library was built elsewhere, and the university hall housed a museum and the central offices of the rector and his staff. What had been the library reading room became a hall for the conducting of public doctoral vivas. In the 1970s, the museum was rehoused and the resulting spaces refurbished for formal receptions. Further, minor restoration works were carried out in the 1980s, in part for a papal visit by John Paul II in 1985. ==Location== The building fills most of a block, with entrances on three of the surrounding streets at Krakenstraat 2, Naamsestraat 22, and Oude Markt 13. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Leuven Category:Catholic University of Leuven Category:Protected heritage sites in Belgium ","title":"University Hall (Leuven)"},{"id":"63867887","text":"The lively ctenotus (Ctenotus alacer) is a species of skink found in Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia in Australia. ==References== Category:Ctenotus Category:Reptiles described in 1970 Category:Taxa named by Glen Milton Storr ","title":"Ctenotus alacer"},{"id":"63867902","text":"Ana Trutiƒá (born 7 December 1998) is a Montenegrin footballer who plays as a defender.

During their competition career, the pair won medals at the Olympic Games, World Championships and European Championships, and reached podium several times at the World Cup Finals. Ganimedes was euthanized in 2006. ==Early life== The black Westphalian gelding was bred in 1978 by August Benning. He was named after Ganymede, a divine hero described as the most beautiful of mortals in Greek mythology. His sire was Gr√ºnhorn III and his dam was Finess, while his dam's sire was Fidalgo xx. In 1981, Ganimedes was acquired by Romanian-born dressage trainer George Theodorescu as a future prospect for his daughter Monica. ==Competitive career== Ganimedes and Monica Theodorescu competed in their first and only Olympic Games in 1988 at the Seoul Games. The pair helped the German team to a gold medal, and were also in contention for an individual honor, having placed third in the opening round. Several major mistakes in the final round, however, dropped them to the eventual 6th-place finish. The mistakes were largely attributed to a wandering shadow coming from a roof of the Grand Stand, which spooked at least six horses during the competition. Following their Olympic debut, Ganimedes and Theodorescu reappeared on the German team for the 1989 European Championships in Mondorf and the 1990 World Championships in Stockholm. Both times they helped the German team to a team gold, while in Stockholm they also managed to reach an individual podium for the first time following a bronze medal performance. Following a tendon injury, Ganimedes was kept out of the competition for the most of 1991. By the time he recovered, he was faced with a rival in Theodorescu's stables, Hanoverian chestnut Grunox. Grunox went on to be Theodorescu's pick for the Barcelona Olympics, while Ganimedes' competition career from that point on was mostly focused on the World Cup. The pair enjoyed much success in the new environment. They won their premier World Cup title in 1993, which they successfully defended a year later. In 1995, they were the reserve World Cup champions, behind Anky van Grunsven and Bonfire. In the years of competing with Theodorescu, Ganimedes was known for his copybook extensions and lateral work, exceptional walk and well-centered pirouettes. Conversely, it is believed that a timid piaffe kept them away from the very top during their entire career. Ganimedes was retired from sport in 1995. ==Legacy== Ganimedes enjoyed 11 years of retirement at Theodorescu's home. In 2006, he was euthanized after experiencing a rapid decline in health. Theodorescu described her partnership with Ganimedes with \\"I spent half my life together with Ganimedes. It is hard to say what my fondest memory is of him or our greatest success.

After his parents divorced he moved with his father to Helena, Arkansas and then Paducah, Kentucky, where he stayed for the remainder of his life. Brown Sr. went on to attend the Western Kentucky Industrial College and the Western Kentucky Vocational School, where he studied carpentry and cabinet making. == Activism == In 1940 Brown Sr. became the president of the Paducah NAACP, where he served from 1940 until his death. Curlee valued education along side equality. He launched a successful lawsuit against West Kentucky Community and Technical College, then known as Paducah Junior College, which resulted in the school's integration. Brown had attempted to enroll in the school for the 1951 fall semester, only to be rejected due to the Day Law, which had been amended in 1950 and prohibited desegregation of any type in schools. The U.S. District Court at Paducah ruled that the college must allow Brown and other black applicants to enroll and the college made an unsuccessful attempt to appeal; eventually the school was integrated. His son would go on to be the first African American to graduate from the college; his daughter would become the second black graduate of the local junior college. In 1957 he traveled to Detroit, Michigan to hear Martin Luther King Jr. speak on civil right matters, where he met Detroit NAACP head Gloster Current who encouraged him to keep fighting. == Later life and legacy == Brown Sr. was recognized by the Paducah Sun Democrat for his contributions towards non- violent desegregation. He also received awards such as a meritorious certificate for distinguished service and personal contributions of time and effort to the community. Curlee Brown, Sr., died on November 18, 1976. To honor his legacy the Kentucky NAACP created the Curlee Brown Scholarship and the Paducah branch of the NAACP created the Curlee Brown Award, which they grant to individuals who have made a visible impact in the field of human rights.

Between February and October 2015, he befriended and deceived five people into trusting him, before shooting them in the head with a silenced pistol and robbing them of their belongings. For his crimes, he was sentenced to three counts of life imprisonment, which he is now serving at the Coronda Prison in Santa Fe Province. ==Murders== Javier Pino's modus operandi was to befriend a suitable victim, and by gaining their trust, he took advantage of their lowered guards to assault and shoot them in the head execution-style with his 9mm silenced Taurus pistol. The first to be murdered was 40-year-old Chinese merchant Ni Qi Fu in Buenos Aires. He was shot a total of 8 times in the head, abdomen and left arm, dying from his injuries on February 16, 2015. In the following two months, Javier struck up a friendship with 38-year-old masseuse Claudia Sosa, whom he aided with her move to Buenos Aires. On April 8th, he was invited into her apartment on 1545 Tuc√∫man Street, where he proceeded to shoot her in the neck, killing Sosa on the spot. After killing Claudia, he stole a computer, a cell phone and 1,900 pesos before leaving the area. Pino would strike twice more before his capture: on July 13th, when he murdered 28-year-old service station employee Ariel Fernando R√≠os in El Galp√≥n, and the second time on October 16th, when he murdered siblings Agustina (28) and Javier Ponisio (25) in Rosario. ==Arrest, trial and imprisonment== A few days after murdering the Ponisio siblings, Javier was arrested in Fr√≠as, Santiago del Estero. Investigators had connected three of the murders by far (R√≠os and the Ponisios), and Pino was convicted of these three initially, receiving two life imprisonment terms. About four years later, using the Automated Ballistic Identification System (SAIB), the Buenos Aires police compared discarded shell casings for any matches around the country, which turned out to match those used in the El Galp√≥n and Rosario murders. Pino was additionally charged with killing Fu and Sosa, with additional evidence coming up in the latter case, as DNA evidence found on a cup of coffee was discovered to be Javier's. He was put on trial before the Buenos Aires courts, with four prosecutors from the three cities in which the crimes were committed present. In the media, comparisons were drawn with the infamous Argentine serial killer Robledo Puch, due to the similar circumstances of their crimes. He was found guilty of the two murders, and received a third life imprisonment term.

During the Hitler years she became a resistance activist: she focused on looking after victims of government persecution. Despite being subject to surveillance and frequent visits from the security services, she avoided arrest. After 1945 she found herself in the Soviet occupation zone where, during 1946, she was elected mayor of the district of Berlin-Prenzlauer Berg. She was removed from office in December 1947 by the military administrators. After 1948 the differences implicit in the administrative division of Berlin into four separately controlled military occupation zones began to find increasingly intrusive resonances in administrative and physical differences, especially as between the eastern part of the city, controlled by the Soviets, and the three other sectors of the city, which by this time were coming to be known collectively as West Berlin. In or before 1949 Ella Kay relocated to West Berlin where, between 1955 and 1962, she served as Senator for Youth and Sport. == Life == === Provenance and early years === Ella Johanna Hedwig Luise Kay was born in Berlin-Wedding. Her father was politically engaged, both as a trades unionist and as a member of the Social Democratic Party (Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands / SPD). Money was tight. He had no pension, and at the age of 72 was still working as a labourer for a Reinickendorf farmer. Many years later, looking back on her childhood, she would reminisce ruefully: \\"The so-called good old days never were\\". Kay attended school locally and trained for a qualification in office work. The apprenticeship remained uncompleted, however: after her father died she was obliged immediately to find factory work in order to provide financial support for the family. She worked as a cutter in a clothing factory. === German republic === As the November revolution unfolded, the proclamation of the German republic by the leading SPD politician Philipp Scheidemann on 9 November 1918,was an important moment for Ella Kay, by this time ages twenty- three. She herself had joined the textile workers' trades union in 1917, and towards the end of 1919, following her father's example, she became a member of the Social Democratic Party (Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands / SPD). She joined the newly founded \\"Workers' Welfare\\" (\\"Arbeiterwohlfahrt\\" / AWO) organisation at the same time, quickly becoming actively involved in both. For many commentators the early 1920s in Germany were dominated by political unrest driven by economic austerity and hunger, topped off by currency collapse, but there were also some positive developments. A long- standing demand from labour activists for an Eight-hour working day to be signed into law was enacted for heavy industries and munitions factories in November 1918 and was quickly implemented across industry. The benefit for Ella Kay, as a factory worker, was immediate: she now had her evenings free to pursue her own further education. After the 1923 currency reform, with the party again able to pay salaries, Ella Kay took a job at the party head office in Berlin's Lindenstra√üe. She worked in the department concerned with workers' welfare and the women's secretariat. (There was, at the time, no separate department dedicated to workers' welfare.) Although \\"cocoa was occasionally distributed\\", the AWO did not have the resources to operate as a charity on its own terms. Instead it worked with public authorities, identifying where a specific need arose and then campaigning directly with the public body (potentially) involved for the needs and entitlements of those disadvantaged. The nature of her work changed in the middle of the decade when she started work in the youth office in her own district, Berlin-Prenzlauer Berg. While working as a youth welfare officer, Kay also embarked on a traineeship in care work more broadly. She combined this, from 1924, with work as a district councillor. Later, between 1929 and 1933, she served as a member of the Berlin city council. Members were allocated fixed seats for a legislative term. Incongruously, during one term, Ella Kay found herself sitting next to Joseph Goebbels for council meetings. During this time a new approach to youth welfare work was developed in Prenzlauer Berg, in response to the intensifying impoverishment and surging unemployment that took hold in Germany as the great depression spread across from the west. Between 1927 and 1933 Ella Kay worked in Prenzlauer Berg as head of the department responsible for youth day-care centres in the district. In December 1927 she enrolled at the Socio-political seminar of the German Politics Academy (\\"Deutsche Hochschule f√ºr Politik\\"). Classes took place in the evenings, which made it possible for her to combine her studies with her paid day job. Thanks to a recent dispensation by the Prussian minister for public welfare the training courses at the academy, originally intended only for male social work students, could now also be made available to women. Applicants were selected on the basis of interviews, subject to satisfactory previous qualifications and experience. Ella Kay was the first female student to be accepted onto the course. A contemporary fellow-student and political soul-mate with whom Kay formed a what would prove a lasting friendship was Franz Neumann. === Crisis years === As the economic position deteriorated, politics in Germany were becoming increasingly polarised nationally, with the division particularly stark in Berlin. In 1931 unemployment reached more than four million, while wages were reduced. Social security benefits had been progressively reduced. For working class young people the future looked grim. Interviewed decades later, Ella Kay shared her assessment that the high levels of unemployment had been \\"manufactured\\" in order to intimidate the workers. Two general elections in 1932 left the Reichstag (German parliament) deadlocked. The populist National Socialist Party and the Soviet backed Communist Party between them had too many seats to be left out of a governing coalition, but they were both unacceptable as coalition partners to the more moderate centre-right and centre-left political parties. In January 1933 the National Socialists exploited the political deadlock to take power, and lost no time in transforming Germany into a one- party dictatorship. One egregious piece of legislation, passed by the government on 7 April 1933, was the Gesetz zur Wiederherstellung des Berufsbeamtentums, shortened to Berufsbeamtengesetz (literally, \\"Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service\\") which was designed to remove from public office people who might be considered Jewish or anti-Nazi. In Prenzlauer Berg 40 senior public officials, 210 local government employees and 31 \\"blue collar\\" workers were sent into retirement or otherwise removed from their jobs for reasons of politics or race. Ella Kay was one of the first to go. === After democracy === The first six months under the Hitler government set that pattern for the full twelve year Nazi nightmare. To their enemies, the National Socialists brought bloody terror onto the streets. It was the Communists who found themselves at the top of the security services' target list, but politically involved SPD members also found their meetings under attack from Nazi paramilitaries. The party responded with a rapid increase in the membership of Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold, an organisation originally set up in 1924 as a response to Freikorps activism and widespread civil unrest, with the stated goal of defending parliamentary democracy against \\"subversion and extremism\\". In 1933, its membership increased to 160,000, the Reichsbanner created a \\"protection formation\\" to protect SPD meeting from ad hoc Hitlerite thuggery. After she lost her job in April 1933, Ella Kay was unemployed for nearly two years. Between April and June 1933 she found herself attending party meetings and rallies \\"almost every evening, to warn [party comrades] about the Nazis\\". In retrospect, it is possible to conclude that such warnings were both unnecessary and far too late. During the first half of 1933 trades unions were outlawed and their offices taken over by the National Socialists. A series of steps taken during March 1933 amounted to the banning of the Communist Party. The ban on the SPD followed, formally, on 22 June 1933, by which time many of the party buildings and other assets had already been confiscated. The ban coincided with the so-called K√∂penick week of bloodshed (\\"K√∂penicker Blutwoche\\"), a week of arrests, torture and killings by Nazi paramilitaries in and around the Berlin suburb of K√∂penick, which seems to have been intended to persuade politically active non-Nazis to abandon political activism. High profile SPD leaders including Marie Juchacz and Ernst Reuter lived in the affected districts. Juchacz fled to France while Reuter resigned his Reichstag seat and spent two years in a concentration camp before he, too, fled abroad. Many other SPD activists felt they could not emigrate because they feared for the safety of family members left behind if they did. Ella Kay stayed on in Germany, surviving on casual work. Eventually she found cleaning work. At one stage she set up a little laundry business in Berlin- Neuk√∂lln. Later, during the later war years, she was employed as a typist. During the first couple of years under National Socialism, in Berlin, it was still possible to meet up with party comrades in a social context, for instance by attending dance events at the Neue Welt (dance hall). The music was loud, and as Kay later explained to an interviewer, \\"while you danced together, you could also talk together\\". Friends and professional/political comrades from before 1933 with whom she managed to sustain some level of contact included Minna Todenhagen, Otto Ostrowski and Erna Maraun. Nevertheless, as a known member of the outlawed SPD, Kay was kept under increasingly effective surveillance, and unannounced visits, house searches and interrogations from the security services were not infrequent. Her work as a city councillor in the years before 1933 meant that on the streets of Prenzlauer-Berg Ella Kay was often picked out, and some of those picking her out were young men living locally who had gained new status by donning the uniforms of Nazi paramilitaries and who might, after dark, be involved in the security service raids on her little apartment. Feeling threatened, she therefore relocated to a small weekend home on the shores of the M√ºggelsee, just outside Berlin on its south-eastern side (and thereby a considerable distance from Prenzlauer Berg on the north side of the city). At times the little M√ºggelsee house was used to hide people from representatives of government agencies. Some sources describe it as Ella Kay's \\"hiding place\\", and although it was not entirely spared from security service house searches, these do seem to have been less frequent and less intrusive than they had been in her apartment in the city suburb. Various sources mention her Nazi-era membership of the resistance group around Max Fechner, but without elaborating on what this involved. Interviewed during the final years of her life, Kay avoided spelling out the nature and extent of her resistance activism. It is known that some of the resistance activists among her friends and contacts were involved in hiding Jews in order to preserve them from the extermination camps, which supportse inference that Kay was similarly engaged. At one of the last visits - possibly the final visit - Kay received from the Nazi security services, an arrest warrant ordering her transfer to the women's concentration camp at Ravensbr√ºck was brought for her. However, she was not present when the responsible official arrived to deliver the document: It is not clear whether she would have faced immediate arrest if she had been there. Either way, because of the requirement that the warrant be delivered \\"in person\\", it was not executed either then nor, thanks to the gathering chaos that descended on administrative structures in Germany during the final months of the war, subsequently. Relatively few details survive as to of how Kay lived during those years, but \\"casual meetings in small groups\\" at which one of the friends could pass on information discovered by listening (illegally) to foreign radio stations meant that she was not totally unaware of the unfolding of the war and other internationally reported events. The collapse of the National Socialist r√©gime in May 1945 did not, therefore, come as a complete surprise to Kay. === Soviet occupation zone === When news came through that the war and Adolf Hitler were over, Ella Kay set out for Prenzlauer Berg. The walk from M√ºggelheim, across what was left of Berlin, took her eleven hours. Twelve years after her eviction from the town hall, she now returned and reported for duty. The entire eastern part of Berlin, which included Prenzlauer Berg, was now being administered by the Soviet military. Most of the district mayors in the Soviet occupation zone had been (and now became again) Communist Party members. Ella Kay was not, and returned to her earlier work heading up the youth welfare office. Although she never joined the Communist Party, during 1946 or 1947 the authorities installed her as mayor of Prenzlauer-Berg. Before the dictatorship, relations between the Communists and the Social Democrats had been poor and deteriorating. After 1945 a widespread belief would emerge from all parts of the political spectrum that it was only on account of divisions on the political left that the National Socialists had been able to take power. As the war drew to its close concentration camp inmates from both the Communist and Social Democratic side had sworn that after the war they would work together to build a better world. Nevertheless, in municipalities across the Soviet zone (where the Communists were far more politically powerful than in the three \\"western\\" zones) mutual mistrust very soon became the order of the day. The first thing Ella Kay did on returning to Prenzlauer Berg was to seek out former Social Democratic comrades who had held political office in the municipality before 1933. Together they set about the work of clearing away the rubble in order that rebuilding might commence. Conditions were grim. Kay later told an interviewer that if there was something to celebrate, then those participating would first need to get hold of a pan of fat in order that a banquet of fried potato peelings might be prepared. Presumably in other parts of town communist comrades would be undertaking the same back-breaking work and celebrating any high points together in much the same way. During those post war months the SPD, no longer outlawed, was rebuilt in the Soviet zone. As she later told an interviewer, Kay was also involved in \\"endless meetings with the communists about a unification between the two parties, but without a result\\". In a hastily organised poll of Berlin SPD members held on 31 March 1946 party, 82% of the party members voting in the western sectors of Berlin opposed a party merger. The ballot in the Soviet administered eastern sector of Berlin was suppressed by the military authorities. Following a subsequent ballot of SPD members on a more nuanced motion it was nevertheless reported that a majority of those voting had supported a \\"working alliance\\" (\\"Aktionsb√ºndnis\\") between the SPD and the Communist Party.Dietrich Staritz, Die Gr√ºndung der DDR. 2. Aufl. 1987, , p. 123. During April 1946 a meeting, which came to be known as the \\"Unification Congress\\", was held at the Admiralspalast (normally an entertainment venue), attended by delegates from both the SPD and the Communist Party. However SPD delegates from the western sector, who had already held their own congress on the same issue two weeks earlier, stayed away, believing that the party merger idea had already been rejected. The \\"Unification Congress\\" on 21/22 April 1946 unanimously endorsed the party merger, although in reality their decision had no effect in Germany other than in the Soviet occupation zone. Since Ella Kay lived and had her political base in Prenzlauer Berg, she was a \\"citizen\\" of the Soviet occupation zone. Following the contentious \\"Unification Congress\\" hundreds of thousands of Communist Party members, along with a large number of SPD members in the Soviet zone, lost no time in signing their party membership across to the new Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED), which over the next three or four years became the ruling party in a new kind of German one-party dictatorship. Ella Kay did not. She remained a member of the now much diminished \\"East German\\" Social Democratic Party, resisting on-going government pressure to move over to the new party. Later in 1946, as a result of a messy agreement between the occupying powers, free municipal elections were held, as one result of which Ella Kay was elected district mayor in Berlin-Prenzlauer Berg. (Hitherto she had occupied the position through nomination by the military authorities.) But she still remained loyal to the SPD, and in December 1947 she was removed from office by the military administrators. 1948 was the year of the Berlin blockade and airlift, following increasingly intractable negotiations between the former wartime allies over currency reform. In October 1949 the Soviet occupation zone was relaunched as the Soviet-sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany). The three \\"western\\" occupation zones had already come together, five months earlier and been relaunched as the US-sponsored German Federal Republic (West Germany). By this time Ella Kay no longer lived in Prenzlauer Berg. She had relocated to what was now becoming known as West Berlin. === West Berlin === In the west her political career continued. In 1949 Kay took on the leadership of the city's Central Youth Office, in an administrative post which meant that her direct boss was the mayor, at this time Ernst Reuter. It was only in 1955 that the office responsible for youth welfare became a fully-fledged department of the West Berlin city administration. On 21 January 1955 Ella Kay was appointed West Berlin's first Senator for Youth and Sport, remaining in office till her retirement on 6 December 1962. In 1958 she was also elected to membership of the Berlin state parliament, in which she continued to sit till 1968, three years after her retirement from the city senate. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Social Democratic Party of Germany politicians Category:German resistance members Category:Social Democratic Party in the GDR politicians Category:Members of the Abgeordnetenhaus of Berlin Category:Senators of Berlin Category:1895 births Category:1988 deaths Category:People from Berlin ","title":"Ella Kay"},{"id":"63868117","text":"Anne Canteaut is a French researcher in cryptography, working at the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation (INRIA) in Paris.

Ambulance workers were aggrieved that their pay had fallen behind that of firefighters, with which it had been linked in 1985. A government pay offer of 7.5% was rejected by the five ambulance workers unions who demanded a 25.8% rise. Union action started with an overtime ban but escalated to a full refusal of crews to attend non- emergency calls in November. The government used the British Army, volunteer ambulances and the police to mitigate the effects of the strike. A pay deal of 16.9% was reached on 23 February 1990 and the ambulance crews returned to work. The strike was regarded as a success for the union, who had carefully cultivated public opinion throughout. == Background == A Kent Ambulance Service vehicle pictured in 1987 Ambulance provision in the United Kingdom was organised on a local basis by separate ambulance services. The pay and conditions of employees in these services had last been agreed by the Standing Commission on Pay Comparability in 1979. The commission recognised that morale was low and recommended a pay increase of 25.8% (at a time when annual inflation was around 16%). Despite this the ambulance workers had gone on strike in 1981‚Äì2 over pay, with emergency cover being provided by the police. As a result of the strike a new salary scale was agreed in November 1985, linking pay to that of firefighters. The fire brigades union (and police) secured favourable pay settlements which broke the link and, by 1989 ambulance workers were paid 11% less than firefighters. The ambulance workers, represented by five trade unions, considered they had been forgotten and that the service was being run \\"on the cheap\\". The unions sought to restore the link established in the 1985 settlement and petitioned the government for a ¬£20 per week pay rise for their members. They also wanted funding to train their members in paramedic skills. The Conservative government, led by Margaret Thatcher, was keen not to raise inflation by awarding further pay increases. It was also carrying out reform of the National Health Service and thought a win over the unions would help cement this. In May 1989 the government offered a 7.5% pay rise; the unions recommended that their members accept this but it was rejected by a large majority. The unions seem to have underestimated the feelings of their members. == Limited service == Kenneth Clarke, pictured in 2010 Ambulance service crews voted on 7 September by a 4:1 majority to implement an overtime ban and a ban on rest-day working from 13 September. The ambulance services had relied on these additional hours to provide non-emergency services such as the transport of patients between hospitals. The services mitigated the effect of the union action by using private taxis to transport patients and asking, where possible, that patients provide their own transport. The health secretary, Kenneth Clarke, rejected an offer by the unions to enter arbitration on 22 September, causing negotiations to collapse. Later that month ambulance service officers and controllers voted to join the overtime ban from 4 October, reducing the options available to the ambulance services. From late September the negotiating committees of the ambulance officers and ambulance crew unions agreed to operate jointly; despite previous tension between the two. Roger Poole was selected as chief negotiator for the workers in the dispute and eventually came to represent members from five separate unions. Ambulance drivers in particular had been reliant upon overtime payments to supplement their basic wage and by early October were warning that they may have to soon return to work. The union responded in mid-October by escalating the action in an attempt to restart negotiations. A ban on some clerical work and non-urgent patient transfers was implemented. The latter caused issues as in previous actions doctors had responded by simply labelling all transfers as urgent, increasing the volume of work for the thinly stretched ambulance services. Other measures included lock-outs and sit-ins at depots and a public petition that eventually attracted 4 million signatures in support of the ambulance workers. There was little government response to the new measures, apart from to put the British Army on standby from 30 October to provide ambulance services if needed. The unions escalated matters further from November with emergency ambulance crews restricted to emergency 999 calls only and not providing transfer services, as they had previously. ==Strike== St John Ambulance staff and personnel, 1987 The government responded to the union escalation by threatening to dock the pay of crews who refused to carry out non-emergency work or to suspend them. The unions then advised that if any member was suspended then all members in that ambulance service should declare themselves as suspended. However the union asked that these members continue to provide an emergency service, though they would be unpaid. In London some 2,500 ambulance workers, responsible for 455 ambulances in 71 depots, were suspended by 7 November. The government thought that allowing ambulance workers to continue to respond to emergency calls on an unpaid basis would be bad publicity and the police and army were called in to provide emergency coverage. The first army ambulances were deployed on 8 November in London and, together with police and volunteer ambulance crews, ran 51 vehicles that day. This marked the first occasion that army ambulances had been used since the Winter of Discontent. Malcolm Rifkind, pictured in 1993 In Glasgow ambulance crews voted, by a narrow margin and against the advice of their union officials, for an all-out strike from 1 December, including the withdrawal of an emergency response. The strike lasted until 3 December and Scottish Secretary Malcolm Rifkind arranged for 30 army ambulances to provide emergency cover based out of Territorial Army (TA) drill halls. These, and police-manned ambulances, had responded to 200 calls by the early hours of 2 December. Rifkind alleged that the crews in Edinburgh had also refused to respond to emergency calls, though the crews disputed this. By December the British Army were providing emergency ambulance services in Lincolnshire, Hertfordshire, Derbyshire and South Yorkshire. In Surrey Royal Navy and Royal Air Force drivers were also used, alongside ambulances single- crewed by ambulance service managers, to provide a service based out of police stations and TA drill halls. The ambulance unions attempted to reopen negotiations by dropping demands for a cut to working hours, additional leave and further long service perks. The government refused to make any compromises and, with few options left the unions carried out further action in January. Crews were instructed to refuse calls put through by the ambulance service and to only respond to those made directly by the police, medical services and general public. The unions hoped this would require the deployment of more army ambulances and swing public opinion behind them. The unions asked the public to demonstrate support for the strike by lining the streets at mid-day on 30 January. At around this time some union members lost patience and crews in West Sussex, Manchester and North-West London went on wildcat strikes of all services; a London-wide strike was narrowly averted at a meeting of shop stewards. In other places ambulance crews began to drift back to work. == Resolution == A 1990 Mersey Regional Ambulance Service vehicle In February the government made an indication that it was considering a revised pay offer but this was actually a stalling tactic, as they were waiting for public opinion to turn against the unions. The unions themselves were losing large amounts of their funds in paying strike benefits to their members. The National Union of Public Employees (NUPE) alone had paid out almost ¬£1 million while both the Transport and General Workers' Union and GMB were in deficit because of the strike. The non-ambulance crew members of these unions questioned why such large amounts were being spent on action which affected only a small portion of the membership. Indeed, the costs were so high that a pay dispute for ancillary workers, some of the lowest paid in the health service, was postponed because of a lack of funds. The unions escalated the strike further on 15 February, instructing members not to follow any orders issued by senior ambulance service managers. By this point the British Army was operating in 18 ambulance service areas. The two parties were brought together for conciliation talks by the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service. A joint industrial council was formed to consider a deal but talks broke down over the issue of back-pay for suspended workers. The government eventually relented on this issue and talks resumed on 22 February. A mutually acceptable pay rise of 16.9% over two years was agreed in the early hours of 23 February. The government also granted a ¬£500 per year bonus to ambulance crew members with additional medical training and a further 2% pay rise in services that could offset the cost through efficiency savings. A vote of ambulance service workers approved the deal by 4:1; members of NUPE, the largest ambulance union, voted 85% in favour on a 74% turnout. The strike, one of the most successful of the Thatcher era, was called off. Poole claimed that the settlement he secured \\"drove a coach and horses\\" through the government's pay policy and in recognition of his success was named a runner-up in the Today programme's Man of the Year award. The strike led to greater recognition of the skill involved in the work of the ambulance crews and began their transformation into multi-skilled paramedics. ==Public opinion == A Royal Air Force Land Rover ambulance of the type used during the strike The strike has been noted for the close attention paid to public opinion during the dispute. The ambulance unions worked hard to court public approval and conducted polling throughout the strike to judge this. The recent Marchioness disaster of 20 August 1989 reminded the public of the importance of the emergency services and the ambulance crews' decision to respond to the Deal barracks bombing of 22 September 1989 was well received. The unions' efforts to ensure emergency cover was preserved was judged to be key to maintaining public approval. It was also noted that Poole's calm demeanour was well received by the public while Clarke's brusque manner and confrontational negotiation style led him to be perceived as a bully. The government attempted to mobilise public opinion against the strike by briefing the press on alleged incidents where ambulance crews had refused to respond to emergencies. These included claims, later proved false, that a crew in Becontree had refused to respond to a call about a newborn baby found in a ditch; that another crew refused to attend a call-out to a man with a severed foot and that one West Midlands ambulance station refused to provide emergency coverage for 48 hours. Clarke was questioned over these false claims in parliament after which they ceased. Another public relations move was implemented on 17 November; the government's pay offer of 6.5% over 12 months was amended to 9% over 18 months. While having little cost impact this appeared more generous. The Department of Health also took out full-page advertisements in national newspapers from 27 November, ostensibly to provide information on ambulance coverage but largely an attempt to sway public opinion. The unions judged that these were ineffective. Opinion polls conducted during the strike showed public support of around 80% in favour of strikers, including support of 75% among conservative voters. At its highest, only 10% of the public supported the government. It was judged that the unions' appointment of Poole as a single spokesman and negotiator was a good move, especially when compared with the government's fragmented response. A number of different spokesmen acted for the government and sometimes gave contradictory briefings leading to a public perception of a lack of coordination and competence. The Labour Party was steadfast in its support for the strike but there were splits in the Conservative Party, encouraged by lobbying from the unions. Some Conservative backbenchers spoke with Clarke privately to suggest that he agree a resolution to the strike. The Labour Party attempted to capitalise on this by raising a debate in parliament on the government's handling of the strike. This had the opposite effect as Conservative MPs rallied to support the government. == References == Category:1989 labor disputes and strikes Category:1990 labor disputes and strikes Category:1989 in the United Kingdom Category:1990 in the United Kingdom Category:Protests in the United Kingdom Category:Health and medical strikes Category:Labour disputes in the United Kingdom ","title":"1989‚Äì90 British ambulance strike"},{"id":"63868253","text":"George Crawford Harrison (27 June 1860 ‚Äì 16 March 1900) was an English first- class cricketer and educator.

He was the third son of Jean Steuart and John Coutts, the former Lord Provost of Edinburgh. Among his siblings were Patrick Coutts; John Coutts; Thomas Coutts and Steuart Coutts, and one sister, Margaret Coutts. His maternal grandfather was Sir John Steuart, 2nd Baronet of Allanbank (son of Sir Robert Steuart, 1st Baronet and Jean Gilmour, a daughter of Sir John Gilmour). His great-uncle was Archibald Stewart, the Lord Provost of Edinburgh. Coutts was educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh. ==Career== On his marriage, Coutts was taken into partnership by his wife's uncle, George Campbell, head of the Whig bank in the Strand who counted John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute as a customer. Upon Campbell's death in 1761, James took his brother Thomas into partnership with him. Lord Bute, as privy purse to George III, placed the royal account at Coutts' bank. In 1762, Coutts received an allotment of ¬£76,000. On 27 February 1762 by-election, as a supporter of Lord Bute (who became Prime Minister of Great Britain in May 1762), Coutts was elected to replace George Lind as the Scottish representative for Edinburgh in the Parliament of Great Britain. Coutts supported the Grenville Administration, Bute's successor, on Wilkes and general warrants. On 19 March 1764, when speaking on a motion to regulate Scottish banks, his language in the House was sometimes \\"strange and incoherent\\". In response, his friends sent him an anonymous letter, a draft of which is preserved in the papers of Caleb Whitefoord. > \\"I am going to offer you my advice on a delicate point, I mean speaking in > the House ... It was with great concern that I saw you rise up to speak > several times during the last session‚Äîthe first time you spoke it was in > some degree necessary‚ÄîWould to Heaven you had stopped there, for indeed my > dear Sir you are by no means qualified for speaking ...

The fair character you bore with everybody and > your very becoming deportment in business and in every other situation of > life made me feel the most sensible concern to see you appear so unlike > yourself.\\" \\"After the letter, Coutts continued to attend the House and its committees, but there is no record of any further speech by him.\\" In 1768, he was succeeded by the Whig member Sir Lawrence Dundas. ===Later life=== In 1774, on the expiration of their 12 years partnership agreement, his brother Thomas took steps to protect the bank's credit from James' perceived \\"irresponsible actions.\\" Lord Bute, Stuart Mackenzie, Sir John Pringle and family friends signed a declaration that James was \\"an improper person to be connected with such a business\\" and he was forced to accept a financial settlement which he bitterly protested. In June 1775, however, he was forced to cut ties with the bank. Coutts went abroad in July 1775 and, again, in November 1776. Between 1777 and 1778, he became so violent in Turin that he kept under military guard. His keepers sent home aboard a ship but he died, while in confinement, at Gibraltar on 15 February 1778. ==Personal life== In April 1755 Coutts was married to heiress Mary \\"Polly\\" Peagrum at St George's Hanover Square Church in London. Polly, a daughter of Elizabeth (n√©e Campbell) Peagrum and John Peagrum of Elmstead, was the niece and heiress of London banker George Campbell. She was also the niece of John Campbell, 1st Earl of Breadalbane and Holland, the granddaughter Sir John Campbell of Glen Orchy and the great- granddaughter of William Graham, 1st Earl of Airth. Together, they were the parents of: * Frances Coutts (d. 1809), who married Sir John Steuart of Allanbank, 4th Baronet (1754‚Äì1817). Coutts died on 15 February 1778 at Gibraltar on his forced way back to England. ===Descendants=== Through his only child Frances, he was a grandfather of Sir John James Stuart, 5th Baronet of Allanbank, who married twice, but had no children by either marriage, therefore, the baronetcy ended with his death in 1849. ==References== Category:1733 births Category:1778 deaths Category:Scottish businesspeople Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for Scottish constituencies Category:British MPs 1761‚Äì1768 ","title":"James Coutts (MP)"},{"id":"63868263","text":"Finland is scheduled to compete at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China, from 4 to 20 February 2022. == Ice hockey == Finland has qualified 25 male competitors, and 23 female competitors to the ice hockey tournaments. ===Men's tournament=== Finland men's national ice hockey team qualified by being ranked 3rd in the 2019 IIHF World Rankings.

There were civil disturbances in London, Leicester, Yeovil, Sherborne, Exeter, Bath and Worcester and riots at Nottingham, Derby and Bristol. Targets included Nottingham Castle, home of the anti-reform Duke of Newcastle, other private houses and jails. In Bristol, three days of rioting followed the arrival in the city of the anti-reform judge Charles Wetherell; a significant portion of the city centre was burnt, ¬£300,000 of damage inflicted and up to 250 casualties occurred. == Background == British Prime Minister Earl Grey The British parliament consists of two houses: the House of Lords and the House of Commons. In the early 19th-century the House of Lords was populated by hereditary peers and the House of Commons by Members of Parliament (MPs) elected to represent constituencies. The areas covered the constituencies had not been amended to reflect population change and so there were many so-called rotten boroughs, returning one or two MPs from only a small number of voters, while some new urban centres such as Manchester had no MPs. The franchise was small with only 5% of the British populace able to cast a vote at a general election. In March 1831, an attempt was made by the Whigs to introduce a Reform Bill to address the matter. This was defeated in parliament and the prime minister, Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, resigned. Grey was returned to office with a majority in the subsequent general election and introduced a second Reform Bill. This passed in the House of Commons, but was defeated in the Lords on 8 October 1831. The rejection of the bill and the second resignation of Grey resulted in a period of political upheaval which has since been characterised as \\"the closest that Britain came to revolution\\". Inhabitants of cities and towns were angry at the failure to pass the bill and there were serious disturbances in London, Leicester, Yeovil, Sherborne, Exeter, Bath and Worcester. The disturbances in Birmingham were so severe that the British Army's Scots Greys cavalry regiment was deployed to the city. Full-scale riots erupted in Bristol, Nottingham and Derby. == Nottingham and Derby == Nottingham Castle on Fire, 10 October 1831 by Henry Dawson Rioting broke out in Nottingham on 9 October upon learning of the defeat of the bill. This was initially directed against the private houses of known opponents of reform. On 10 October a public meeting turned to violence, the attendees marched on Colwick Hall, home of John Musters, which was damaged. The next day the mob burned Nottingham Castle, home of anti- reform peer Henry Pelham-Clinton, 4th Duke of Newcastle, who was away at parliament. Jails in Derby and Markeaton were also attacked and Lowe's Silk Mill in Beeston was burnt on 11 October, the same day the riots ceased. The Duke was able to gather yeomanry and his own tenants to successfully defend his residence at Clumber Park. On 4 January 1832, 26 men arrested during the riots were tried by a special commission, the local magistrates being suspected of having possible sympathies with the defendants. Eight of these men were found guilty, though none were brought to justice for the attack on the castle, and three were hanged on 25 January. The Duke accused the Nottingham magistrates and the Home Office of failing to prevent the riots and, after a lengthy dispute, was awarded ¬£21,000 in damages in August 1832. In protest at the event the Duke refused to restore the castle and the burnt shell stood on the site for some time afterwards. He also halted works on The Park Estate, a housing development described as \\"the Belgravia of Nottingham\\". == Bristol == Rioting took place in Bristol after the arrival of anti-reform judge Charles Wetherell in the city for the annual assizes on 29 October. Wetherell's carriage was attacked and civic and military authorities lost control of the situation. There followed two days of rioting and looting in which much of the city centre was burned and prisoners freed from the jails. The riots were brought to an end on 31 October by which time ¬£300,000 of damage had been caused and up to 250 casualties incurred. The Bristol Corporation, the local authority, was criticised for its handling of the riots. Its mayor, Charles Pinney was tried for neglect of duty and found not guilty. The military commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Brereton, was court- martialled for his actions in the event and committed suicide before he could be sentenced. A royal commission found the corporation incapable of controlling the city and it was subsequently reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. == Passing of the Reform Act == The first meeting of the reformed House of Commons Grey resigned after the loss of the vote and King William IV called upon the Duke of Wellington, leader of the Tory party, to form a government. Wellington was unable to secure the support necessary during a period of political uncertainty known as the Days of May and so Grey's government was recalled. The Whigs voted a Third Reform Bill through the House of Commons and it was sent to the House of Lords. The king, who had previously been opposed to reform, now agreed to use his powers to create enough new pro-reform peers to overcome the Tory majority in the upper house. This action did not need to be carried out as the Tory lords, threatened with an influx of Whigs, abstained on the vote and the bill passed. The bill, afterwards known as the Great Reform Act, received royal assent on 7 June 1832. The act removed many of the rotten boroughs and granted new seats to the industrial towns and cities. The franchise was, on the whole, extended being granted to any man who owned property worth ¬£10 or more. In some boroughs, the so-called potwallopers, this actually reduced the electorate as they had previously granted the vote to any man with a hearth big enough to boil a cauldron. Local government was investigated by the Royal Commission on Municipal Corporations in 1833 and the subsequent Municipal Corporations Act 1835 applied reforms to many, including Bristol. == References == Category:1831 riots Category:Riots and civil disorder in England Category:1831 in England Category:October 1831 events ","title":"1831 reform riots"},{"id":"63868285","text":"Anita McConnell (1936‚Äì2016) was a writer on the history of science and a curator of oceanography and geophysics at the Science Museum, London.

Its meaning has been debated through History, but it generally means the figure of a person connected to the gods, which grants him the ability to perform miracles and supernatural events. ==History== This concept originated in the Hellenistic period, where it was used in a syncretic context, though differentiated from foreign figures like the Phoenician prophets mentioned by Celsus. Famous exponents of theios aner were the famed Pythagoras, Empedocles, Apollonius of Tyana, Peregrinus Proteus and Alexander of Abonoteichus, among others. Precisely due to those illustrious connotations, the term would have been chosen by writers of Judaism as a way to make figures like that of Moses more palatable to Greek thinking. It was seemingly during the rise of Christianity when the term popularized, in no small part for its association to the figure of Jesus of Nazareth as a maker of miracles. Paul's Pagan opponents considered Jesus a mere member of this tradition instead of the Son of God as he preached, which might have influenced the writing of gospels to avoid this identification. The Gospel of Mark, which already intended to fend off the newly formed Docetic Gnosticism by emphasizing Jesus' human traits, was also object of this reaction, as it identifies other miracle-makers as false prophets. ==See also== *Thaumaturgy *Christology ==References== Category:Philosophy of religion ","title":"Theios aner"},{"id":"63868432","text":"The 1986 Akron Zips football team represented Akron University in the 1986 NCAA Division I-AA football season as members of the Ohio Valley Conference.

Actress Olympe Bradna was her niece. Ella Bradna toured with her family as a child, eventually replacing her injured older sister Beata at doing equestrian trick riding. == Career == In 1901, Bradna joined the Nouveau Cirque in Paris, and performed at London's Hippodrome in 1902. She moved to the United States in 1903, with her husband, to join the Barnum and Bailey Circus. They also brought their act to vaudeville and toured Cuba and South America. She raised and bred her own horses for the act, on a farm on Long Island. Ella Bradna developed a less physically-demanding act, \\"the Act Beautiful\\", involving a white horse, white doves, and a white dog, before she retired from performing in the 1930s. She continued working with horses in the circus, as her husband was the circus ringmaster. She and her husband survived the fatal Hartford Circus Fire in 1944, and retired the following year. == Personal life == Bradna was married to an Alsatian cavalryman, Fred Ferbere (Bradna was her surname from birth; he began using the name when they married). Fred Bradna wrote a memoir of their lives in the circus, The Big Top (1952, with Hartzell Spence). Ella Bradna was widowed in 1955, and she died in 1957, aged 78 years. (One obituary gave her age at death as 84 years.) There is a historical marker about Ella and Fred Bradna in Sarasota County, near those of other circus notables, in the \\"Circus Ring of Fame.\\" == References == == External links == * * The Fred and Ella Room, at the Ringling House Bed and Breakfast in Baraboo, Wisconsin, is named for Fred and Ella Bradna. * Trav S.
