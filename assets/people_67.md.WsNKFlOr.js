It has a straggly, but rigid habit and is armed with sharp straight thorns up to 100mm long, which are modified branches. Bark on the mature trunk is grey-brown and deeply fissured. The tree is dioecious, and clusters of white flowers are produced in profusion in spring and are borne on thicker twigs and branches. The flowers have a fetid, faecal smell and attract large numbers of pollinating insects, particularly carrion-loving flies such as members of the family Calliphoridae. The tree has a close relationship with a number of cicada species, such as Platypleura divisa, P. mijburghi and P. maytenophila.[Sanborn, A.F. and Phillips, P.K. and Villet, M.H. (2003) Thermal responses in some Eastern Cape African Cicadas (Hemiptera: Cicadidae). Journal of Thermal Biology, 28 (4). pp. 347-351. ISSN 0306-4565. ] The specific name \\"heterophylla\\" means \\"variable leaves\\" and if the list of past synonyms is examined, it affords an interesting insight into the minds of botanists since 1753 when Linnaeus decided that the leaves reminded him of boxwood and named it Celastrus buxifolius. Since then it has been named ellipticus, heterophyllus, spathephyllus, empleurifolius, rhombifolius, parvifolius and buxifolioides - it would seem that the epithet heterophylla is appropriate. It makes a very effective, fast-growing security hedge. The wood is hard and durable, suitable for carving, though large pieces are not often available. ==Pictures== File:Maytenus heterophylla00.jpg File:Maytenus heterophylla01.jpg ==References== *Reinstatement of \\"Gymnosporia\\" *https://plants.jstor.org/compilation/maytenus.heterophylla * ==Sources== *Trees and Shrubs of the Witwatersrand - Tree Society (Witwatersrand University Press, 1969) *Trees and Shrubs of Mpumalanga and Kruger National Park - Schmidt et al.

Accessed 2008-11-09. The school takes students from the Kindergarten age of 3 to 16. ==Natural Environment Academy== As a state funded Academy its specialism is the natural environment. The Academy is based on the earlier Hereford Waldorf School which existed for 25 years at the same site and comprised a Victorian school, medieval farmhouse and a more recent Kindergarten extension, and 18th century barns. Between 2008 and 2011 the school and site were redeveloped by John Renshaw Architects in a £6.5 million project that transformed the school using natural materials. This redevelopment provided a new hall, renewable energy, and buildings upgraded to reduce the environmental footprint, while organising the development of the site in sympathy with the natural environment. The school has outdoor classrooms and a significant area of productive gardens and other ecology areas dedicated to Landwork activities. ==Controversies== In December 2009 Steiner Academy Hereford was bottom of the primary school league tables for England derived from SATS scores at Key Stage 2. Parents had opposed the testing and many children were absent for the dates. In contrast with assessment tests, in July 2013 Ofsted reported SAH Ofsted report 2013 hosted at SAH website accessed 2013-11-28 that 'Pupils are well prepared for more formal learning', 'Pupils achieve well throughout the school, reaching above the expected levels', they 'Go on to successfully study and achieve wide- ranging qualifications at GCE A level and beyond.', 'Older students develop strong independent working and thinking skills', 'Pupils’ artistic and practical achievements are impressive', 'Pupils have a strong sense of personal responsibility', and 'bullying is extremely rare'. In September 2012, the school was accused by the British Humanist Association of including pseudoscience in its curriculum. Clarence Harvey, an acting principal of the Steiner Academy Hereford, responded:Times Educational Supplement article 'Homeopathy?

The air base, at an altitude of 620 m above sea level, has a single runway with a length of 3.06 km. It was one of the first military air bases in Spain and, because of that, is considered the \\"cradle\\" of Spanish aviation.Spanish Air Force Site The base was inaugurated in 1911 (20 years before Madrid Barajas International Airport) and two years later the Civil Aviation School was created. It was the first air bases in Spain where the first autogyro was flown its designer Juan de la Cierva. This air base was established permanently in 1911 (20 years before Barajas), and two years later the Civil Aviation School was created. Since then, the extensions and reforms of the same have happened to this day. == Military use == In summer 1957, two-pilot, a flight engineer, and crews flew 12 to Gatafe from Evreux, France, for the purpose of a one time flight to the SABENA facility at the Brussels airport. == Civil use == Today, apart from military use, the factory that belonged to CASA and is currently part of the European group EADS CASA is located next to the base, and next to a railway line. In another factory next to the base, the Spanish Eurofighter Typhoons are assembled. In an annexed facility, the Eurofighter Typhoon destined for Spain are assembled. CASA also carries out in the facilities attached to the base the maintenance of various aircraft of the Air Force, as well as programs for the improvement and modernization of these aircraft. Through an agreement signed with the Getafe City Council, the Infante de Orleans Foundation, which maintains a collection of old aircraft in flight, will soon move its facilities to land near the Base, from whose aeronautical facilities it will become a user for its flights and its exhibitions. monthly flights. Given the possibility of closing, increasingly remote, the Madrid-Cuatro Vientos Airport (civil), there have been several proposals for the creation of a civil aerodrome for general aviation and a terminal for low-cost airplanes, over the land of the Getafe Air Base. This proposal has always had the opposition of the City of Getafe, which does not want to increase the pollution that entails the heavy traffic of a civil airport. However, the Getafe City Council has always been a firm supporter of the maintenance of the EADS-CASA facilities and the Air Base of the Air Force, which it sees as complementary and responsible for the industrial-aeronautical fabric of the city. == Garrison == The main military unit to operate from Getafe is the \\"Ala 35\\" transport wing, which operates CASA/IPTN CN-235 (two units for VIP missions, eighteen units for transport) and EADS CASA C-295 (nine units for transport). In 2008, most CN-235s moved to other Spanish Air Force bases and a second squadron of C-295s was formed. Several other units have also been placed at Getafe including the Cartographic Center's fleet from Cuatro Vientos Air Base a few kilometers from Getafe itself. ==References External links == * Spanish Air Force home site Category:1911 establishments in Spain Category:Airports in the Community of Madrid Category:Airports established in 1911 ","title":"Getafe Air Base"},{"id":"20135244","text":"Krstić (, ) is a Serbian surname, a patronymic derived from the given name Krsta or Krsto.

He graduated from the Moscow Conservatory in 1958,Sleevenote to M. Voskresensky, Chopin Sonatas nos 1 & 2 (ВСЕСОЮЗНАЯ ФИРМА ГРАМПЛАСТИНОК, Melodiya LP C 10 - 18243-4 (Published Moscow 1983)). where he studied under Ilya Klyachko, Boris Zemliansky, Yakov Milstein, Lev Oborin (piano) and Leonid Roizman (organ). As student of the famous Lev Oborin,Sleevenote, Melodiya LP C 10 - 18243-4 (Published Moscow 1983). the winner of the First International Chopin Piano Competition in 1927, Voskresensky was influenced by his teacher's refined taste and romanticism in his deployment of pianistic sonorities. His playing shows a thorough command of contrasting musical colors, never disharmonious, and a legato technique drawing forth a singing voice from the instrument. Some early reviews convey an impression of his technique: \\"The pianist reaches down to the great depths of music. His playing is poetic... It has a filigree quality in the right places, and he plays dramatic passages with a dynamic force and courage. Recorded by Voskresensky, Chopin's Nocturnes are performed with a distinct evenness.\\" (Ruch muzyczny, Poland). \\"He is a courageous and powerful pianist. His playing is permeated with much feeling and his sound is melodious, clear and pure like a crystal.\\" (Correio Paolistano, Brazil).Reviews cited on Sleevenote to Melodiya LP C 10 - 18243-4 (Published Moscow 1983). ==Awards== In 1957, Voskresensky took part in the Prague Spring International Music Festival where he performed the European premiere of Shostakovich's second Piano Concerto in the presence of the composer. In 1966, he was honored with the Merited Artist of Russia award and, in 1989, that of the People's Artist of Russia. He is a prize-winner of the Schumann International Competition in Berlin (1956), the International Competition in Rio de Janeiro (1957), the George Enescu International Piano Competition in Bucharest (1958) and the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition in Fort Worth (1962).Sleevenote to Melodiya LP C 10 - 18243-4 (Published Moscow 1983). ==Concert geography== Mikhail Voskresensky's concert career has taken him to many parts of the world.

Design began in 2008, four years after the beginning of the LSAT program. Like the LSAT LMG, the rifle is designed to be significantly lighter than existing designs, and is designed to fire lighter ammunition. Like the rest of the program, the weapon extensively uses parallel development. It has designs for polymer-cased ammunition and caseless ammunition, and designs using spring-loading magazines and weapon-powered magazines. This parallel development reduces the risk of the program failing. Computer simulation and modelling, particularly of the LMG, is being used for all components of the program, including the rifle. This reduces both time and expenditure for prototyping and testing. The other program components use a 'spiral development' approach, whereby the product is rolled out in stages or 'spirals', each stage producing a new version that is an improvement on those from previous spirals; the rifle shall likely use the same approach. The weapon and the program are closely connected to the Future Force Warrior concept, with aims to integrate electronics and computerized optics, and aims to increase the mobility of soldiers. The weapon is also intended to improve on reliability and ease of maintenance. ==Design Requirements== Various new designs for infantry drove the requirement for the standard rifle to be lighter. New uses of information technology and future concepts (such as the Future Force Warrior) require lighter equipment. Notably, when extra weight from advanced, computerized optical sights is introduced, the weapon needs to be made lighter to compensate. New strategic concepts require greater infantry mobility to be fully realized. Making the LSAT rifle lighter is the most essential innovation of development. Other improvements are also important. The weapon is being designed with the integration of electronics and advanced optics in mind. The reliability of the current M16 and M4 compared with rifles using gas pistons has led many to call for the former weapons to be replaced. A highly reliable gas-system is important for the LSAT rifle. Improved reliability of the rifle in general is a likely requirement, similar to the improved reliability objective for the LSAT LMG. ==Design Progress== The rifle design began with seventeen concepts; however, after the concepts were investigated and trade-offs were analysed, only two remained for the cased round, and two for the caseless round. The two designs for each ammunition type revolve around two magazine approaches. One uses the standard mechanism, with springs inside the magazine feeding rounds into the weapon; the other uses a 'weapon powered' approach, presumably to reduce the extra weight and space that springs create in magazines. Both magazine designs are focused around high capacity. The rifle designs are undergoing the same simulated, structural, and kinematic analyses as the LMG. Both a working rifle and accompanying ammunition prototypes have been made, but it uncertain if or when the program will result in a new rifle for the US military. On 14 May 2014, Textron Systems was awarded a two-year $5.7 million contract for work that included development of a carbine firing cased-telescoped ammunition.Textron Systems' Light Armaments Team to Develop Lightweight, Cased-Telescoped Small Arms for U.S. Army - Marketwatch.com, 14 May 2014 ==See also== *Lightweight Small Arms Technologies *MR-C *Heckler & Koch G11 *List of assault rifles ==References *LSAT Brochure *LSAT \\"The Epilog\\" Category:5.56 mm assault rifles Category:Proposed weapons of the United States Category:Personal weapons Category:Proposed weapons Category:Upcoming products Category:Caseless firearms ","title":"LSAT rifle"},{"id":"20135526","text":"Morelos is a city and seat of the municipality of Morelos, in the north- eastern Mexican state of Coahuila.Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía.

In the late 1920s, she co- founded the Palestine Arab Women's Congress (PAWC), the first women's organization in British Mandate Palestine, and was an active organizer in its sister group, the Arab Women's Association (AWA). ==Political activism== Tarab Abdul Hadi was the wife of Awni Abd al-Hadi, who was himself active in politics and went on to become a prominent member of the Istiqlal party. Abdul Hadi and other women from notable Jerusalem families, established the Palestine Arab Women's Congress (PAWC) to make clear their opposition to the Zionist presence in Palestine and their support for the men's national struggle for independence. The first meeting of the PAWC was held at Abdul Hadi's home in Jerusalem on October 26, 1929, with the event since heralded as the \\"first time\\" that Palestinian women entered the political arena. Abdul Hadi became one of the members of PAWC's Executive Committee, which consisted of fourteen women, drawn primarily from notable Jerusalem families (such as the Husseinis, 'Alamis, Nashashibis, and Budeiris). Besides writing letters and telegrams to raise awareness of the Palestinian plight, the PAWC also engaged in prisoner advocacy. This involved the attempt to shorten harsh prison sentences by appealing to the British authorities and raising money to support families who had lost their breadwinners to imprisonment.Karmi, 2002, pp. 31-33. Abdul Hadi was also active in the Arab Women's Association (AWA), also founded in 1929, which became the most prominent feminist organization in Palestine. In her capacity as an AWA organizer, she delivered a speech at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in April 1933, during a visit by British General Allenby, stating: > \\"The Arab ladies ask Lord Allenby to remember and tell this to his > government ... The mothers, daughters, sisters of the Arab victims are > gathered here to make the world witness the betrayal of the British. We want > all the Arabs to remember that the British are the cause of our suffering > and they should learn from the lesson.\\" Abdul Hadi was also active in the campaign against the veil, an initiative launched by local women encouraging Palestinian women to remove their veils. After the 1948 Arab–Israeli war, Abdul Hadi ended up in Cairo, Egypt with her husband, Awni Abd al-Hadi. Her husband died in Cairo in 1970, and she died there in 1976. ==ReferencesBibliography== * == External links == * Arab Women Organization's website Category:1910 births Category:1976 deaths Category:People from Jenin Category:Arab people in British Palestine Category:Palestinian activists Category:Palestinian feminists Category:Palestinian women ","title":"Tarab Abdul Hadi"},{"id":"20135606","text":"thumb Adolf Rzepko (1825 – 1892) was a Polish composer, oboist, choral and orchestral conductor, and pianist.

He debuted for the Serbia national team in 2013. ==Club careerEarly career and cancer diagnosis=== Krstičić began his career at OFK Beograd and joined Sampdoria on 1 September 2008 at the insisting of Giuseppe Marotta, who believed the 17-year-old was one of the most talented players he had ever brought to the club. While playing for the youth team, he played in the 2011 Torneo di Viareggio as one of the allowed over-age players. He suffered a knee injury and had surgery performed to correct his meniscus injury, after which doctors unexpectedly diagnosed him with Burkitt's lymphoma and allegedly told Krstičić he had 48 hours to live. Luckily, Sampdoria's medical staff was able to reverse the cancer growth and Krstičić lived on to play football, although the condition was a great setback in his career. Over the course of his cancer episode, Krstičić lost 55 pounds and his blood was compromised. Krstičić finally made his debut for Sampdoria in a UEFA Europa League match against Debrecen on 16 December 2010. On 2 December 2012, he scored his first goal for Sampdoria against Fiorentina. Youtube: Fiorentina v Sampdoria (2-2) Nenad Krsticic Goal (48') Serie A Highlights - 2 December 2012 On 2 February 2015, Krstičić was signed by Bologna in a temporary deal. The club also signed Júnior Costa and Daniele Gastaldello from the Genoese club outright. However, Krstičić was injured in March. His contract with Sampdoria was terminated on 18 July 2016. ===Alavés=== On 25 July 2016, Krstičić signed for La Liga side Alavés on a free transfer. Fellow countryman Aleksandar Katai, who also suffered from a serious illness earlier in his career, joined Alavés later the same summer, and the two became midfield teammates. ===Red Star Belgrade=== On 23 August 2017, Krstičić joined Red Star Belgrade on a two-year deal. He made his debut in the eternal derby on 27 August 2017. Krstičić adapted as a central midfielder during the 2017–18 season under coach Vladan Milojević, usually pairing with defensive midfielder Mitchell Donald after Branko Jovičić's injury. After Guélor Kanga left Red Star, Krstičić began playing offensive role in early 2018. He scored his first goal for the club in 2–1 victory over Voždovac on 3 March 2018. Eight days later, Krstičić also scored in 1–1 draw to Napredak Kruševac. ===AEK Athens=== On 26 December 2018, Red Star Belgrade announced that Krstičić's transfer to AEK Athens had gone through. The Athens based club activated his release clause of €500,000, six months before the end of his contract with Red Star, which saw him move to his new club. On 23 January 2019, he scored his first goal for his new club in an emphatic 5–0 home win against AO Chania Kissamikos for the Greek Cup round of 16. His team won 6–1 on aggregate and advanced to the quarter finals of the competition. On 3 April 2019, by lashing the ball across from the right wing, Victor Klonaridis picked out the onrushing Krstičić, who prodded it past the beaten Nikos Melissas in a 2–0 Greek Cup semifinal 1st leg against Lamia.

The 100-second spot was produced by advertising agency Lowe Lintas & Partners in London. Good Doctor premiered on British television in January 2002, with later appearances in cinemas. It is the seventh piece in the Jean de Florette-inspired \\"Reassuringly Expensive\\" series that had been running since 1992. The advert was directed by Czech director Ivan Zacharias with help from the production company Stink and post- production work by The Moving Picture Company. The commercial was a popular, financial, and critical success, boosting sales during the period in which it ran, and receiving more awards than any other campaign in 2002, including a Cannes Gold Lion, an Epica Award and several prizes from the D&AD; Awards. ==Sequence== Good Doctor opens in a field in 19th century rural France, where a doctor confirms that one of the field hands is dying of cholera. The other workers flee, leaving the doctor to burn the remains. Later, he is called from his hospital to help another woman, who had collapsed in the town square. The gathered crowd backs away from him as he approaches, and refuses to help him carry the victim away. When he later enters the local public house, an elderly resident threatens him with a shotgun, declaring him \\"contaminated\\" and asking him to leave. The town's priest enters and admonishes the patrons, calling the bartender to give the doctor a Stella Artois, which sets the crowd murmuring. The priest shakes the doctor's hand and embraces him, proclaiming him uncontaminated. Nonetheless, the publican warily approaches and places the ordered drink on the floor in front of the doctor. As the doctor begins to drink, the opening strains of the theme from Jean de Florette play in the background. The crowd stares as the priest takes a swig from the same glass, and then passes it to the gun-toting man. As the patrons begin jostling for a sip of the Stella Artois, the doctor coughs. The piece ends with the tableau of the patrons freezing in horror.Fera, Rae Ann (1 April 2002). \\"Stella in the time of cholera\\" , Boards. Retrieved 8 November 2008. ==ProductionBackground=== The \\"Reassuringly Expensive\\" campaign, of which Good Doctor is part, began in 1982. Frank Lowe, head of the advertising agency behind the production of Good Doctor, worked on marketing for Stella Artois during his tenure at Collett Dickenson Pearce in the 1970s, creating print campaigns such as \\"My shout, he whispered\\".Sweney, Mark (15 August 2008). \\"Stella Artois seeks new ad agency\\", The Guardian.

In 1981, Lowe left Collett Dickenson Pearce to form his own advertising agency, taking with him the Stella Artois account.Bussey, Noel (15 August 2008). \\"Lowe resigns Stella Artois account after 26 years \\", Campaign. Retrieved 26 October 2008. Within a year, Lowe launched the \\"Reassuringly Expensive\\" campaign, which aimed to turn a substantial negative for the brand (higher prices due to greater Duty on high-alcohol content beverages in the United Kingdom) into a positive, assuring customers that by being more expensive, the premium lager was better than cheaper brands.O'Shaughnessy, Nicholas Persuasion in Advertising (Routledge, 2003), p. 48-53. . Earlier pieces were primarily print campaigns, but in 1990, a chance viewing of Jean de Florette led one of Lowe's creative directors to pen a script based on a similar concept. The resulting television and cinema advertisement, Jacques de Florette, proved immensely popular and formed the basis for a series of six award-winning adverts produced between 1991 and 2001, including Good Samaritan, Last Orders and Returning Hero.\\"Close-Up: Live Issue - How Stella defied convention with its epic-style advertising\\", Campaign (25 June 2004).

He excelled as a schoolboy sportsman. He rowed in the First VIII for three years, won the GPS Schools Shot Put Championship in the Open division two years, played in the school's First XV for two years and was selected in the Australian Schoolboy's XV (1975 and 1976).St Joseph's College Magazine (Annual 1975 & Annual 1976) ==Club rugby== He joined the Drummoyne Rugby Club from school but later moved to the Manly club and was there in 1983 when Alan Jones took over as coach. He captained this Manly team in 1983 to win the final. Jones was the new Australian coach from 1984 and he saw the value that Williams brought to the national pack in his line-out jumping, his surprising pace and fearless scrummaging. Jones also saw Williams' leadership potential.Howell p 227 ==Representative rugby career and leadership style== Williams debuted for Australia against Fiji in the 1980 three match tour. He played in all matches including Australia's 22–9 Test victory. That year he also appeared for New South Wales Waratahs against the touring All Blacks and then was selected for the Wallabies in the first and second Tests of that year's Bledisloe Cup series. He suffered a broken jaw in the 2nd Test after starting a fracas with New Zealand's Mark Shaw and was out for the 3rd Test. He made four appearances in 1981 against the touring French side – for Sydney, New South Wales and in both Tests. He was then selected for the 1981–82 tour of the British Isles but the first choice second-rowers were skipper Tony Shaw, and Peter McLean and Williams generally played in the minor matches other than the Test against England. In 1982 Williams toured to New Zealand in the squad led by Mark Ella and played in eight matches including all three Tests against the All Blacks. In 1983 he represented against the United States, Argentina and New Zealand and made the European tour squad, playing late that year in Tests against France and Italy. 1984 was a golden year for Australian rugby and Williams played a prominent role. Three Tests were played at home against New Zealand where he formed a new second-row partnership with another giant name Steven – Steve Cutler. The team gained toughness and finessed its combinations in August before heading to the British Isles under captain Andrew Slack for the 1984 Grand Slam tour. Jones valued Williams' quiet lead-by-example ethic, his work ethic and the hard edge he brought to the pack especially in his ability to protect the young line-out star Cutler. Jones made Williams the forward leader and squad vice-captain.Howell p 229 Steve Williams proudly debuted as captain of the Wallabies in the first tour match against London Division and in another later mid-week game. He led the pack in all four Tests and was instrumental in the famous push-over try against Wales at Cardiff Arms which marked the coming of age of Australian forward play, an indication that the Wallabies could finally field a world-class pack. Howell quotes Mark Ella \\"When Alan Jones made Steve the senior forward, it was the best thing that could have happened. He took the responsibility and really drove the forwards. I must say Steve's lineout ability surprised me. Some of his jumping was sensational, particularly in the Irish test. It enabled us to take pressure off Steve Cutler by being able to throw to 2,4 or 6. To Williams up front, Cutler in the middle or Steve Tuynman at the back. Our lineout was complete.\\"Howell p 227 The Grand Slam victory by the 1984 squad was the first ever for an Australian team. A number of the senior players retired at tour's end and some of the stars took a year off. Williams however played on enabling him a distinguished 1985. He captained the Wallabies in five Tests that year – victories in two match series against both Canada and Fiji before a 9–10 loss against New Zealand. He retired at the top, as his country's captain having played 56 matches for Australia, having made five Wallaby tours, with a then record for a second-rower of 28 Test appearances. ==FootnotesSources== * The Spirit of Rugby (1995) (Collection of Essays) Harper Collins, Australia * Howell, Max (2005) Born to Lead – Wallaby Test Captains, Celebrity Books, Auckland NZ Category:1958 births Category:Australian rugby union players Category:Australia international rugby union players Category:Australian rugby union captains Category:People educated at St Joseph's College, Hunters Hill Category:Living people ","title":"Steve Williams (Australian rugby player)"},{"id":"20135652","text":"Papyrus 82 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), designated by \\\\mathfrak{P}82, is an early copy of the New Testament in Greek.

Finland maintains an embassy in New Delhi, and honorary consulates in Bangalore, Chennai, Kolkata and Mumbai. India has an embassy in Helsinki, that is also jointly accredited to Estonia. ==History== Diplomatic relations between Finland and India were established on 10 September 1949. Shortly thereafter, Hugo Valvanne, Finland's first envoy to India arrived in New Delhi and presented his credentials to Governor-General C. Rajagopalachari. After India became a republic on 26 January 1950, Valvanne presented his credentials again to the first Indian President Rajendra Prasad in February 1950. Finland's diplomatic presence in India operated from the Hotel Cecil from 1949 to 1951. Valvanne and his wife resided at the Hotel Cecil, while a double room in the nearby Hotel Maiden's housed Valvanne's secretary and the chancery. The Government of India sold the Government of Finland a plot of land in Chanakyapuri (the diplomatic enclave of New Delhi) between the Swiss and the Swedish Embassies in 1954. Due to a shortage of funds, construction of the Finnish Embassy did not begin immediately. The Finland Embassy was located in a barrack at Humayun Road between 1951 and 1958. The barrack had been built in 1942 for temporary use during World War II. The Embassy moved to a location at Prithviraj Road between 1958 and 1967. ==Finnish embassy in India== The Government of Finland organized a competition to design the new embassy building in the 1960s. Reima Pietilä and Raili Paatelainen won the competition. However, due to shortage of funds, and higher priority assigned to construct embassies in other countries, construction of a new embassy in Chanakyapuri was further delayed. The Government of India sent a note to the Finland Government in 1963 informing them that construction of the embassy was long overdue, and that the plot sold to the Finland Government had begun to attract anti-social elements to the diplomatic enclave. Further, the Swiss and Swedish embassies had complained that cobras were residing on the plot allotted to Finland. The Finnish embassy would move again from Prithviraj Road to Golf Links. It was located at 42 Golf Links from 1967–1979 and 25 Golf Links from 1979–1986. Finally, in the early 1980s, construction began on the embassy in Chanakypuri based on the design by Pietilä and Paatelainen. The Embassy in Chanakyapuri was opened on 5 December 1986. ==Visits by heads of state== There have been several visits by heads of state and government, and other high-level officials between the countries. Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru visited Finland in 1957, Indira Gandhi in 1983, and Manmohan Singh in October 2006. Indian President V.V. Giri visited in 1971, and R. Venkataraman in 1988. From Finland, Prime Minister Sukselainen visited India in 1960, Kalevi Sorsa in 1984 and Matti Vanhanen in March 2006. President Kekkonen visited in 1965, Koivisto in 1987, and Martti Ahtisaari in 1996. Finnish heads of state and government have also visited India on private trips.

Fire fighters simulating boilover to demonstrate the risks. Length of the sequence 2.4 seconds. it was 1 kg cooking oil and 1 litre of water. A boilover (or boil-over) type of fire refers to an extremely hazardous situation where an attempt is made to extinguish semi-enclosed oil or petrochemical fueled fire with water. The hazard results due to the difference in density between oil and water. NFPA defines boil-over as: An event in the burning of certain oils in an open-top tank when, after a long period of quiescent burning, there is a sudden increase in fire intensity associated with expulsion of burning oil from the tank.National Fire Protection Association: \\"NFPA 30 - Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code\\" Boilover is also common in the home as a chip pan fire when cooking. As water is poured onto the fuel, it quickly sinks to the bottom of the container due to the water's higher density, and has little effect on extinguishing the flames on the surface. Under certain conditions, after some time, the water on the bottom rapidly vaporises into steam, causing it to expand more than 1700 times in volume. The rapidly expanding steam (possibly superheated) expels the oil or fuel above upward and out of the tank, resulting in the discharging of burning oil onto a large and uncontrolled area outside of the container. Mathematical modelling of the phenomenon is difficult and complicated, making boilover prediction unreliable.

Owned by the Port authority of Nantes-Saint-Nazaire its strategic importance as a major naval construction and maintenance asset since its completion in 1934 resulted in it becoming the main target of the British Army Commando raid of 1942, the St. Nazaire Raid, to stop German battleships such as Tirpitz from accessing maintenance facilities while operating in the Atlantic Ocean. ==Functions== The lock has two major functions: *To give access to the Loire River and hence the Atlantic Ocean for ships of the biggest size from the port of Saint-Nazaire. The port maintains a constant water level and the lock allows this to be maintained while also allowing access to for the largest ships; *For the maintenance and the construction of large ships the lock can be drained and hence made into a dry dock, making it possible to work on normally submerged or immersed parts of ships. ==History== As a historic major seaport on the western edge of the Atlantic, the closest for ships coming from the western Atlantic to France, Saint-Nazaire had played a major part in World War I as a disembarkation point for United States Army troops. The US Army had undertaken various development projects around Saint-Nazaire, including the construction of a refrigeration plant in the docks for storage of imported meat and dairy products. At the end of the First World War, the Port Authority of Saint-Nazaire envisaged the construction of a third basin to mitigate the port's then lack of large-scale ship facilities. However, due to the post-war recession and resultant downturn in shipping traffic, the idea was abandoned. However, scale problems encountered during the construction of the Île de France and the opportunity to build the proposed super passenger liner which would become the Normandie resulted in a reassessment of the project. Designed and engineered by Albert Caquot, work started in February 1929, and final acceptance took place in 1933. The facility, then the largest dry dock in the world, connected the Penhoet basin with the Loire River. It was named after the former president of the Saint-Nazaire Chamber of Commerce, Louis Joubert, who had died in 1930. With the fall of France in 1940, the dock took on new strategic importance for the Germans, as it was the only dry dock on the West Coast of France capable of servicing the battleships Bismarck and Tirpitz. The location gave access to the Atlantic Ocean, by-passing the Royal Navy's defensive lines organised along the GIUK gap. Bismarck broke into the Atlantic in 1941 but was damaged in the Battle of the Denmark Strait. She was heading for Saint-Nazaire for repair when she was brought to battle by the Royal Navy and sunk, leaving Tirpitz as the largest surface threat from the Kriegsmarine. ==St. Nazaire Raid== St Nazaire docks 1942 The Loire River side lock gates of the Louis Joubert Lock, the target of the St. Nazaire Raid View of the Louis Joubert Lock towards the Loire River On 27 March 1942, the Joubert Lock was the main target of Operation Chariot. The original strategic purpose of the combined Royal Navy and British Commandos raid was to make the lock – the only location on the Atlantic seabord capable of servicing the German battleships Bismarck (already sunk in May 1941) and Tirpitz – inoperative. This gave the port a strong strategic importance to the Axis Powers, and it was decided that if this drydock could be put out of action, any offensive sortie by the Tirpitz into the Atlantic could be much more dangerous for her and probably not worth the risk. After Operation Rheinübung on 18–27 May 1941 – in which the Bismarck and the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen were to have ended their operational raid at Saint-Nazaire, but which resulted in the sinking of and the sinking of the Bismarck – the need for the Allies to take the Joubert lock out of operation was increased. A force of 611 British Commandos launched the St. Nazaire Raid against the shipyards of Saint-Nazaire, codenamed \\"Operation Chariot\\". The old British destroyer HMS Campbeltown was used as a ram-ship loaded with explosives against the Loire River estuary gate of the Joubert Lock; its later explosion, combined with commando destruction of the lock's pumping facility and machinery, made it inoperative. Although the German forces tried to repair the facility, the Joubert Lock remained out of commission for the rest of the war, and it did not function again until 1948; it was not recommissioned until 1950. The first ship to be accommodated after being repaired was the former German ocean liner Europa, which on refit became the SS Liberté, given to France by the United States of America in compensation for the loss of the Normandie in New York. ==Major dimensions== *Length: *Width: *Height: *Lock gates: caisson-and-camber, each long and thick, constructed of hollow steel sections *Volume of water: approximately ==References== Category:Saint-Nazaire Category:Locks of France Category:Drydocks ","title":"Louis Joubert Lock"},{"id":"20135809","text":"Simon Henry Leeder (1865 – 14 May 1930) was a British author.

The tragic actors were certainly heavily disguised. This had a religious purpose, for the actor was supposed to give up his identity in order to let another speak and act through him. Indeed, the dramas were performed in honour of Dionysus, the God of Ecstasy, which means “standing outside oneself”. Actors therefore had to renounce their individuality. The actors thought that the mask itself contained the character and are said to have prayed before putting on their masks. The costume was probably an elaborately-decorated version of everyday clothing worn in the 5th Century BCE. The garments included: * chiton (robe or tunic) * chlaina (overgarment) * chlamys (short cloak) * kothurnus (short lace-up boots) * himation (overgarment) * peplos (cloak).Laver The chiton worn by the actors differed from that worn in everyday life because it incorporated sleeves, which were coloured and patterned. The sleeves may in fact have been part of an undergarment. Long white sleeves were worn by the (male) actors for female roles, and indeed, in vase paintings females are usually painted with lighter skin. The costumes worn for the performances of Alcestis, for example, were iconographic, and symbolised the opposition of light and dark.Wiles, 1999, p159. In the play, life is evoked as the act of seeing the sun. Death – the son of Night in Greek mythology - wears a black peplos and black wings. Apollo wears white, representing the sun. Admetus contrasts the black of the funeral procession with the white of the funeral procession. The corpse of Alcestis is dressed as a bride, in accordance with Greek tradition and Herakles wears a bearskin and carries a club. The costumes worn gave the audience an immediate sense of character-type, gender, age, social status and class.Rehm, 1994, p65 ff. Around the time of Aeschylus, the boots or buskins worn by the actors were flat. The actors had the same “status” as the chorus. In the 3rd Century BCE, the actors were raised to the status of heroes and “platform” soles began to be used, together with a head-dress called an onkos. The raised soles may have induced a stylised way of walking, suited to the rhythm of tragic verse, and the onkos made the actors taller, enhancing visibility. Their bodies were padded so that they did not look too slim.Laver. However, some authors believe that this happened later than the 3rd Century BCE. It is also thought that the “teetering gait” is a misapprehension.McLeish. The masks were the most striking feature of the costume worn by the Athenian actors. Facial expression was lost anyway due to the huge size of the Greek theatres, but the masks were also a means of blotting out expression, so visual meaning was expressed by the entire body. The actors were seen as silhouettes, or integral bodies, rather than faces. The masks themselves were made of stiffened linen, thin clay, cork or wood, and covered the whole head and had hair. Attempts have been made in modern times to investigate the use of masks in Athenian tragedy through practice research.McDonald & Walton, 2007, p. 247 ff. These explorations conclude that masks may lead to a more demonstrative style of acting, with declamatory delivery of the lines substituted for intimacy. They also found that the mask could impede the projection of sound. The Greeks are said to have overcome this in various ways. Initially, the mouth apertures were small, but later this became a “wide-open” mouth. Some authors believe that the mouth was shaped like a “mouth-trumpet” and had an amplifying effect.Simon. Certainly, the use of a mask covering the whole produces an enhanced resonating effect, which serves dramatic delivery. Performances therefore had to be more physical. Peter Arnott states that the Greeks thought good acting and a good voice were synonymous. This was achieved through athletic training, voice exercises and diet. Experiments have shown that unaccustomed actors suffer disorientation and restriction when masked. The Greeks countered this through a vocabulary of gesture known as cheironomia (gesticulation). Aristotle says that in his day excessive gestures were used – leading to overacting – compared with the older tradition. Masks can also be used as a dramatic tool, e.g. lowering the masks shows reflection, raising the mask shows a challenge or superiority. The Greeks called these physical stances schemata (forms). Silent masks were used to great effect, particularly on child actors, expressing powerlessness, bewilderment, vulnerability, etc. The use of masks enabled the three speaking actors to portray up to eight or nine characters, through multiple role-playing. The same character could therefore be played by different actors, and transitions within a character would be portrayed by the use of different masks. The wide variety of masks used is attested by Pollux, a rhetorician writing in 2nd Century CE, in his Onomastikon. He lists 30 different male masks (old age with white or grey hair, the tyrant with thick black hair, a fair, pale masks indicating sorrow or sickness, a boastful soldier, a rustic, servants, a cook, etc.) and 17 female masks (fat and thin old women, two matrons, one virgin, a bawd, a mistress, three courtesans, a lady’s maid, etc.). == References  Sources == * Taylor, David.

The church and its accompanying monastery were first built in 1397.Rijksmonument report The church is known today as the church where Beatrix of the Netherlands occasionally attends services. ==History== Origins of the original monastery and church that occupied this site may be found in the Dominican Order. Reforms undertaken by Raymond of Capua, brought a renewed growth to the order, and it is around this time in 1397 that a monastery and church was first built for the Dominicans in The Hague. ===Court of Albrecht of Bavaria=== A thriving new center of arts was established in The Hague by the Court of Albrecht of Bavaria (1336–1404) and his second wife Margaret of Cleves (ca. 1375-1412). Some known artistic products to have been produced in this period are an important illuminated manuscript, the Hours of Margaret of Cleves commissioned between 1395-1400,today in the collection of the Museu Calouste Gulbenkian, in Lisboa, Portugal, Accessed November 8, 2008 and the visually similar Biblia pauperum. From December 1399 Dirc van Delf (ca. 1365-ca. 1404)See Masters of Dirc van Delf was among the court of the Duke Albrecht of Bavaria in The Hague. There he had the function of court chaplain, but he also lectured at German universities, such as Cologne and Erfurt.John M. Jeep, Medieval Germany: An Encyclopedia, 2001 ===Early Architecture=== In 1420 a fire raged through the monastery, but serious renovations are not recorded until the church's southern transept was added in the beginning of the 16th century. The church was expanded around 1540 with an enlarged aisle and side chapels. The center barrel vaulted aisle is 20 meters high and 11.5 meters wide. The worship space became a pilgrimage church, where people could visit and pass through, while services were being held in the central aisle or nave. At this time the church was also dedicated to St. Vincent, a Valencian Dominican missionary who was canonized June 3, 1455 by Pope Calixtus III. ===Protestant Reformation=== It was stripped of Catholic decorations during the beeldenstorm (iconoclasm of 1566). A number of monks lived on for a few more years, but in 1574 the last few monks left. After being abandoned for 12 years, the church had deteriorated and some suggested to tear it down. In 1588 a cavalry company seeking shelter settled in the former church. The following year the church and choir were made into a cannon foundry for the States of Holland and West Friesland. The choir was used as a foundry and the church served as a munition store with the two walled off from each other. On November 3, 1690, the ammunition stored in the church exploded leaving only one wall of the monastery remaining.Incidentally, this wall was included in the new building of the Dutch Court of Audit. The monastery then temporarily served as a hospital. In 1583 most of the monastery was demolished, though the (now Protestant) church remained. ===Early Protestant Church=== A part of the building became a church again in 1617 after Counter-Remonstrants had successfully \\"squatted\\" it. The Protestant Church in the Netherlands had split between the Remonstrants and Counter-Remonstrants over Arminianism. The Grote Kerk in The Hague was in the hands of the Remonstrant party who had the support of statesman Johan van Oldenbarneveldt. Soon after the Counter- Remonstrants had occupied the Kloosterkerk, Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange demonstrated his support for them (and opposition to Van Oldenbarneveldt) by attending a service there. Van Oldenbarneveldt was arrested in 1618 and executed a year later. The Remonstrants were expelled from their churches but the Kloosterkerk continued in use as a second city church alongside the Grote Kerk. For the centuries to follow the church was used for Dutch Reformed worship with the pulpit standing against the north wall. In 1620 a mechanical clock was added to the tower, made by Huyck Hopcoper. Throughout the 17th century, the burial of people in the church brought money and numerous hatchments (Dutch:\\"rouwbord\\"). Most walls and columns were covered with hatchments, with the graves predominantly in the choir. A lead coffin was found in the choir with the embalmed remains of the foundress of the monastery, Margaret of Cleves. ===The 20th Century: Restoration and Renewal=== Towards the end of the 19th century, the consistory (church council) of the Dutch Reformed Church in The Hague divided the city into several wards or neighbourhoods. Each ward was allocated to one of the city ministers who was responsible for the pastoral care of the members of the Church living within the ward boundaries. The Kloosterkerk was in Ward XI which ran from the Lange Voorhout to the eastern boundary of the city. For 34 years (1894-1928) the ward minister was Willem Leonard Welter (1849-1940) who was also Court Chaplain from 1919 to 1928. The city ministers continued to preach in all the churches in turn. In 1911 the first liturgical service of the Dutch Reformed Church was held in the Kloosterkerk under the direction of Welter’s colleague Jan Hendrik Gerretsen (1867-1923), but services were suspended in 1912 due to the dilapidated and dangerous condition of the building. Proposals were made to demolish the church and sell the plot to release funds for building a new church in the Duinoord area of the city. After strong objections were received the consistory agreed to fund the restoration of the building and services resumed in 1914. The minister for Ward XI from 1929 to 1939 was Simon van Dorp (1880-1963) who belonged to the conservative Reformed Association within the Dutch Reformed Church. He founded the “Kloosterkerk-Benoordenhout” society to support church activities in his ward and opened the “Elim” church hall as a base for the society. Van Dorp took early retirement at the end of 1939. The consistory decided to split Ward IX between two adjacent wards and redeploy the vacant ministerial place to another part of the city. The Kloosterkerk ceased to be a neighbourhood church and the ward society became a city-wide society for Reformed Association members. A fresh start was made during WWII when the congregation of the Duinoordkerk was forced to look for another building; their church had been demolished by order of the occupying Germans. The Kloosterkerk was made available, initially on a temporary basis but when it appeared that building a new church would be impossible, the congregation was allowed to settle there permanently. In 1952, the minister of the Duinoordkerk, Johannes Arnoldus Kwint (1900-63), was transferred to the list of city ministers and given special responsibility for the Kloosterkerk. Between 1952 and 1957 the church was thoroughly renovated and the wall between the nave and choir was removed. Furniture and works of art which had been saved from the demolition and stored in the Peace Palace were placed in the church, including * the pulpit of oak (c. 1700) with Flemish carvings showing the Four Evangelists * a stained glass window depicting the twelve apostles by (1893–1949) * the mosaic 'The Last Supper' from 1925 by Johan Thorn Prikker (1868-1932). Rosettes in the ceiling are attributed to Gerhard Jansen (1868–1956). In 1966 an organ by Danish organ builder Marcussen was installed.

The station is located near Hin Keng Estate in Tai Wai, Sha Tin, New Territories. It is an elevated station with one entrance facing Che Kung Miu Road. ==History== The station was built on the site of the New Territories South Animal Management Centre and Shatin Plant Quarantine Station, facilities of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, which were relocated to a new facility on To Shek Street in November 2013. The station and approach structures were built under MTR contract number 1102. Worth HK$1.039 billion, the contract was awarded to Japanese construction firm Penta-Ocean on 5 July 2013. Major sub-contractors employed on the project include Hong Kong company Ngai Shun Construction & Drilling Company as well as the Chinese state-owned China Geo-Engineering Corporation. The architect was Hong Kong-based Leigh and Orange. Construction of Hin Keng Station began with a ceremony on 13 November that year. A topping-out ceremony for the station was held on 30 April 2015, making Hin Keng the first station on the Sha Tin to Central Link to be topped out. The station opened on 14 February 2020 as part of the Tuen Ma Line Phase 1. ==Design== Hin Keng station is an elevated station with an open design that allows for natural lighting and ventilation, reducing energy consumption. Both the concourse and platform levels are designed to promote cross ventilation, intended to achieve comfortable thermal conditions without the use of air conditioning. Computerised fluid dynamics analyses were carried out to inform this design. In addition, architectural fins on the station's exterior are provided to reduce solar thermal gain. The station has a green roof of approximately , which is designed to sustain vegetation growth with less irrigation and maintenance requirements than traditional green roof systems.

His act is mostly composed of hijinks, interaction with one specific audience member, and a few legitimate magic tricks. From 2001 to 2014, he was a year-round headliner in Las Vegas. Self-described as the \\"Freddy Krueger of Comedy\\", Szeles performs wearing his everpresent headband and his shows frequently use gore, such as pretending to suck on his own hanging eyeball, cutting his wrists, and skewering his own tongue. He is also good friends with fellow performer Criss Angel, and has helped Angel perform a variety of illusions, most notably during his three guest appearances on Mindfreak. ==CareerEarly career=== Szeles, who began his career performing in the streets of San Francisco, first appeared on television in The 8th Annual Young Comedians Show in 1983 and later went on to become the host of the short-lived 1991 syndicated variety/game show Ruckus. He appeared on various talk and variety shows from the mid-80s to mid 2000s. His only credited performance as an actor was The Obligatory Holiday Episode of The Weird Al Show (playing the part of Uncle Johnathan). He has made several appearances on Late Night with David Letterman, a record 24 appearances on Fox's Comic Strip Live, and has had several specials on Comedy Central including Comedy Central Presents, Lounge Lizards and more recently his own one-hour special entitled Wrong on Every Level., He dedicated the special to his Uncle Eugene, who showed him his first card trick which \\"started this whole mess\\". He appeared in the 2005 documentary The Aristocrats. Johnathan had huge success in Australia, becoming a household name due to his many well-received performances on Channel 9's \\"Hey Hey It's Saturday\\". Szeles has also authored a how-to book on practical jokes titled Every Trick in the Book, a compilation of both classic practical jokes and plain magic tricks, along with his own original material in both categories. He is currently finishing up his memoirs, entitled, \\"Drive It Like You Stole It.\\" ===Recent years=== In 2008, Szeles combined two of his passions (classic car collecting and drive-in movie theaters) to open the \\"Amazing Underground\\" a members-only indoor drive-in movie theatre located within his warehouse facilities in Las Vegas. As of 2011, Szeles was performing regular shows in Las Vegas at the Harmon Theater while also taking select dates at venues across the United States and in Australia. 2011 marks Szeles' third year of performing at the Harmon Theatre and Szeles' 11th consecutive year as a full-time Las Vegas headliner. He has won \\"Best Comedian\\" award from Las Vegas Review Journal, Comedian of the Year from Nevada Magazine, Top Ten Acts in Vegas (LVRJ) and is the longest running, most successful solo comic magician in U.S history. In 2013, Szeles hosted an online talk show called \\"Burn Unit\\". ==Personal life== In March 2007 it was reported that Szeles was diagnosed with \\"a serious heart condition\\". The performer's website identified the condition as cardiomyopathy and went on to assert that, due to a combination of weight loss and blood thinners, he was doing well. In December 2012, Szeles ended his one-year contract with Bally's and ceased performing in Las Vegas. He had been performing in the town for 13 years. Szeles toured throughout 2013, playing The Improv comedy clubs. On June 7, 2014, he married Anastasia Synn. However, his heart condition worsened, and Szeles announced that he would effectively retire, performing a final show in Toledo for the general public, and then for members of The Magic Castle on June 30 and July 1 of 2014. Szeles' final shows were sold out and he received standing ovations each night. On November 5, 2014, in front of a live audience on ENT Speaks, he stated that he had a year to live. In 2017, he played several shows across the United States. A documentary titled The Amazing Johnathan Documentary about his illness and return to the stage was released on Hulu in 2019. A second documentary titled Always Amazing: The True Story of the Life Death and Return of Amazing Johnathan chronicled Amazing Johnathan's career particularly within the scope of his relationship with Joel Ozborn.

It is bordered by the Adyar River, Kasturba Nagar, Kotturpuram, Indira Nagar and the Buckingham canal. Today Gandhi Nagar is a commercial hot spot having relatively good transport and other facilities. ==History== Gandhi Nagar has more than 150 years of history. The most oldest things in Gandhi Nagar are the Pilliar Kovil and the St. Patrick's School. It was established as 'Gandhi Gram' in January 1948, just a week before Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated. Gandhi Nagar is one of the earliest planned layouts in the erstwhile Madras with more than 322 housing plots, underground drainage systems and broad roads. The neighborhood began its transformation towards becoming a residential locality around 1949 when the first residents are believed to have moved in.https://www.dtnext.in/News/City/2018/04/22004720/1069834/Those-were-the- days-When-Madras-grew-beyond-Adyar-.vpf?TId=112131 ===Gandhi Nagar Society=First transport=== The first residential (non academic) inhabitants are people from a tiny town called Sadhuranga pattinam (சதுரங்கப்பட்டினம்) or Sadras as it is called. They came from Chengulpet to Gandhi Nagar via Buckingham canal via boats that was propelled by wind under favorable conditions or the boats were pulled by humans with rope from boat tied to their waist. At that time in 1942, Gandhi Nagar had lush paddy fields and was used for agriculture and was bordered by Guindy forest (which has almost disappeared now). ===First families=== The Mudaliar Brothers, S.K.Puniyakoti Mudaliar and S.K.Ramachandra Mudaliar in 1958 The Alwaris family is said to be the first family who resided in Gandhi Nagar. The next was the family of Mudaliar Brothers. The Mudaliar Brothers consisted of Mr. S.K. Ramachandra Mudaliar and Mr. S.K.Puniyakoti Mudaliar. They worked in Triplicane, but bought vast lands in Gandhi Nagar as their building construction flourished. In one of their lands stands the old cancer institute, which was donated by Mr. S.K. Puniyakoti Mudaliar. Mr. Puniyakoti Mudaliar built first independent flats in Gandhi Nagar. The Mudaliar brothers construction industry recruited people from Sathurangapattinam (Sadras), the first workers settled on banks of Adyar River, this settlement was later called Malligai Poo Nagar. Dr.A.Ramachandran was another personality who was one among the few who chose to purchase a house in 1954 and reside in Gandhi Nagar. He was a famous Veterinary Doctor and Surgeon who was often visited by people from all walks of life including Politicians, Film Personalities of yesteryear's and normal people alike. He was serving the Government & was assigned specific tasks to enhance care of the wild and mammals. ===Malligai Poo Nagar (மல்லிகை பூ நகர்)=== The Mudaliar Brothers (S.K.Ramachandra Mudaliar and S.K.Puniyakoti Mudaliar) were building contractors. They needed manpower to execute their projects. Hence people (primarily from Sathurangapattinam) were bought in. They settled on the banks of Adyar river. The laborer settlement attracted more people, thus a community was formed and was named Malligai Poo Nagar which means jasmine flower settlement. ===Gandhi Nagar Library=Modern Gandhi Nagar== Gandhi Nagar today is a hot spot in city having many businesses and hotels. ==Business== * Kolam Serviced Apartments, 51, 2nd Main Road, Gandhi Nagar * MAVY Physiotherapy Group, 2nd Main Road, Gandhi Nagar, Adyar * The Grand Sweets and Snacks - Located on 2nd Main Road is 'the' star attraction of Gandhi Nagar.

The club briefly managed to reach the second division of German league football, spending the 1955–56 season in the 2nd Oberliga Süd. ==History1920 to 1945=== The FC Penzberg was formed on 14 March 1920 but was actually a continuation of the local gymnastics clubs football department which had existed before the First World War.Historie: 1920–1930 – Gründung und Entwicklung des FC Penzberg FC Penzberg website, accessed: 9 November 2008 The club struggled to find a suitable playing field in its early days and eventually had to do with a local swamp. This was converted to a football field through back filling with ash. The local coalmine supplied technical support for this. The new ground was opened on 30 July 1921. The FCP had the opportunity to take part in a promotion round to the local A-Klasse in 1922 but was not strong enough to succeed. In the 1922–23 and 1923–24 seasons, the team won the local championship and earned promotion to the A-Klasse in 1924. The club found it hard to compete with the stronger clubs from Munich there and was immediately relegated. This relegation was followed by a decline in performance and interest in the club and it took until 1927 to win another local championship and return to the A-Klasse. Initially, the team struggled again in this league but a good second half of the season saw it secure its position in it. The next season, the club was better equipped to hold the league, thanks to a merger with the football department of the sports club at Kochel. The club managed to remain in the A-Klasse until 1932, when it was relegated once more. Mostly unaffected by the rise of the Nazis in 1933, the FCP remained a top-team in the local competition, commonly then called the Würmgau or Zugspitze regional league, after its geographic location.Historie: 1931–1940 FC Penzberg website, accessed: 9 November 2008 More titles in this league followed in 1935 and 1937. The later saw the team move up a league once more but again it could not maintain this level. Back in local play, it won its sixth title in 1939. After this, the outbreak of the Second World War made league football in the region very difficult. ===1945 to 1963=== Upon the end of the war, the club properly reformed on 17 February 1946, when a new chairman was elected.Historie: 1941 – 1950 FC Penzberg website, accessed: 9 November 2008 In 1949, the club celebrated another championship, winning the southern division of the Oberbayern league, and earned the right to take part in the promotion round to the Landesliga Bayern, then the second tier of the German football league system. The FCP came second, on equal points to the ASV Cham but then lost a necessary decider 0–1 aet. It did however have a second chance, playing the VfL Ingolstadt-Ringsee for one more place in the Landesliga, but lost this game, too, 0–2.Die Bayernliga 1945 – 1997, publisher: DSFS, published: 1997, accessed: 9 November 2008 In 1953, the club got another chance to earn promotion to Bavarias highest league,Historie 1951–1960 FC Penzberg website, accessed: 9 November 2008 now called the Amateurliga Bayern and only the third tier of the league system since 1950, when the 2nd Oberliga was introduced. The FCP won its group of six teams and finally earned promotion but this turned out to be an unnecessary achievement as the Bavarian FA decided on 7 July 1953 to split its highest league into a northern and a southern division and all six teams from the round were admitted.Die Bayernliga 1945 – 1997, publisher: DSFS, published: 1997, accessed: 9 November 2008 In the Amateurliga Südbayern in 1953–54, the club came seventh out of fifteen teams. The season after, the team surprised everybody and won the league by three points. After a special meeting it was decided to take part in the promotion round to the 2nd Oberliga Süd. Here, the FCP faced the SSV Ulm and FC Rastatt 04 and came out on top, earning a surprise promotion to the second division.Die Deutsche Liga Chronik publisher: DSFS, published: 2006, page: I 40, accessed: 9 November 2008 For the small- town club FC Penzberg, in a league with FC Bayern Munich, Hessen Kassel and Waldhof Mannheim, the season became a struggle, but also a unique experience, playing Bayern Munich at home in front of 7,000 and then in Munich in front of 20,000. The club came second-last, only the VfR Heilbronn ended up behind them and had to return to the Amateurliga. Not discouraged, the club won the Amateurliga for a second time but lost both Bavarian championship games against 1. FC Bamberg and missed out on the promotion round, where Bamberg failed, too.Die Deutsche Liga Chronik publisher: DSFS, published: 2006, page: I 40, accessed: 9 November 2008 The year after, 1957–58, the club was not in contention for the championship, coming only seventh. From there, the club rapidly declined, finishing fifteenth in 1959 and being relegated to the 2nd Amateurliga. In 1961, the team dropped further, back to the A-Klasse (V) but managed to break the fall and return to the 2nd Amateurliga for 1962–63.Historie 1961–1970 FC Penzberg website, accessed: 9 November 2008 ===1963–present=== The introduction of the Bundesliga was only one change of many in the German league system in 1963. In Bavaria, the 2. Amateurliga was replaced by the Landesligas and for southern Bavaria, the Landesliga Bayern- Süd was put in place. However, the FCP could not qualify for it and would from now on remain within the leagues of the Bezirk Oberbayern. Instead, Penzberg dropped all the way to the A-Klasse, now the sixth tier but won the championship there straight away and earned promotion to the Bezirksliga Oberbayern-Süd. From 1964 to 1973, the club belonged to this league before dropping back down to the A-Klasse. This time, it could not rebound straight away but did return to the Bezirksliga eventually The club became one of the founding members of the Bezirksoberliga Oberbayern (V) in 1988 and belonged to this league until 1992, when a thirteenth place meant relegation. The team was handed straight through the Bezirksliga in 1992–93 and had to return to the A-Klasse (now Kreisliga) once more. It was to be the club's last stint in the Bezirksliga as of 2008. In 2004, the club even dropped down to the Kreisklasse for a season but recovered and returned to the Kreisliga. This league is the equivalent of the old A-Klasse it once started in the 1920s. The club eventually suffered another relegation, back to the Kreisklasse Zugspitze for 2011–12. From there, in 2013, it dropped to the A-Klasse after coming last in its league. In this league it took out the championship without a loss all season and was promoted back up to the Kreisklasse in 2014. a league championship the following year took the club back to the Kreisliga, followed by promotion to the Bezirksliga in 2016. ==Honours== The club's honours: ===League=== * Amateurliga Südbayern (III) ** Champions: (2) 1955, 1957 * Southern Oberbayern championship (III) ** Champions: 1949 * 2.

Bishop Athanasius had, just as Pope Shenouda III, his roots in the Sunday School movement, a reform movement in the Coptic Orthodox Church of Egypt. The bishop started his own Sunday School branch in Faggala, Cairo, then became a monk and became the first reform monk to be consecrated as a diocesan bishop (Beni Suef) in 1962.Cornelis Hulsman, “Renewal in the Coptic Orthodox Church; notes of the Ph.D. thesis of Revd. Dr. Wolfram Reiss,” in: AWR, 2002, week 46, art. 23 In the 1960s, Bishop Athanasius founded The Daughters of Saint Mary in Beni Suef, an order of serving nuns who played a role in various social projects in the community. Bishop Athanasius actively sought dialogue with Muslims in the 1970s and 80s and alongside Bishop Samuel, represented the Coptic Orthodox Church outside of Egypt.AWR, 2002, week 46, art. 23 Dr. Maurice Assad, former Secretary-General of the Middle-East Council of Churches, wrote “Bishop Athanasius was known for his weekly Bible study meetings in Beni Suef which were always attended by hundreds of people. Whenever he went on a pastoral visit in his diocese, he did not confine himself to the rich but also visited the poorest of the poor. In fact he made it a point to visit every family at least once a year in his diocese, the poor before the rich. Only in the last few years could he no longer do this because of health reasons, and he had to limit himself to visits of each church in the towns and villages of his diocese.\\"Dr. Maurice Assad in AWR, 2000 week 46, art. 6 When President Sadat placed Coptic leader Pope Shenouda under monastic arrest in 1981, a papal committee of five bishops was formed to take over the duties of the pope, and one of the appointed bishops was Bishop Athanasius. The papal committee left only the spiritual authority to Pope Shenouda III, but not the rule of the church. Pope Shenouda's rule of the church was restored with his return to Cairo with Coptic Christmas, January 1985. Pope Shenouda had difficulties in reconciling with former members of the papal committee. The decisions that they had taken in this interim period (1981–1985) were annulled. From this moment on Pope Shenouda made sure he was representing the church on an international level. In 1994 Pope Shenouda III became one of the presidents of the World Council of Churches (WCC). It took years for Pope Shenouda to reconcile with Bishop Athanasius. In 1992 and 1994 the bishop was absent from patriarchal anniversaries, but during the Christmas celebration in January 1999 he was welcomed by Pope Shenouda in the Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in Cairo and received from the church goers a standing ovation.Dr. John Watson, “In Memoriam Bishop Athanasius,” in: AWR, 2000 week 47, art. 19 == Man of dialogue == Bishop Athanasius advocated Christian unity, ecumenical relations and active dialogue between churches.Dr. John Watson in: AWR, 2000 week 47, art. 19 and Dr. Christiaan van Nispen s.j. in: AWR, 2000 week 46, art. 6 Bishop Athanasius did not agree with Pope Shenouda's policy of asking Christians from other churches who want to join the Coptic Orthodox Church to be re-baptized. The bishop however, also stated he would abide by the rulings of his church.Cornelis Hulsman, “Metropolitan Athanasius passed away; personal memories,” in: AWR, 2000, week 46, art. 5 Bishop Athanasius was also a man of Muslim-Christian dialogue. He made it explicitly clear he didn't believe in a theological dialogue with Islam, but that for him dialogue meant finding ways of living together in peace. He argued that having a Christian house of worship is more important than a church tower which at times was more a symbol of pride than a symbol of Christian humility. He was willing to sacrifice the tower, or to shorten it, if this would help him to obtain a permit for the building. His attitude may have been an important factor in the tremendous increase in number of churches in his diocese: from about 60 in 1962 to about 130 in the year 2000.AWR, 2000, week 46, art. 5 Bishop Athanasius was able to handle difficult cases of conversions of Christians to Islam, seeking to protect his Christian community while at the same time making great efforts to avoid relations with Muslims turning sour. One way of doing so was to avoid foreign publicity in order to expose problems. He would ask Muslims seeking the conversion of Christian minors to abide by the law that prohibits conversions of minors and would seek the support of higher authorities if lower government authorities were not implementing the law. == See also == *The Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Church *Coptic Orthodox Church *The Daughters of St. Mary *List of Copts ==References== Category:Coptic Orthodox Christians from Egypt Category:Coptic Orthodox bishops Category:Beni Suef Category:1923 births Category:2000 deaths Category:People from El Mahalla El Kubra Category:20th-century Oriental Orthodox bishops ","title":"Athanasius, Metropolitan of Beni Suef"},{"id":"20136237","text":"Ayot was a railway station serving Ayot St Peter near Welwyn Garden City in Hertfordshire, England.

So he enters into an inflation swap agreement where for the next 5 years he is paying a fixed rate on his loan's principal while receiving year-on-year inflation on the same amount. ==See also== *Year-on-Year Inflation-Indexed Swap *Zero-Coupon Inflation-Indexed Swap ==References== Category:Inflation Category:Derivatives (finance) Category:Swaps (finance) ","title":"Inflation swap"},{"id":"20136471","text":"The Regent String Quartet are a British string quartet, The Regent String Quartet was formed in the mid-1990s.

Lü Bu is the foster son of the tyrannical warlord Dong Zhuo, who orders him to take Zhang Wen away from the assembly, cut off his head, and bring it back on a silver platter to show the other guests. Dong Zhuo then announces to the other officials that a letter has been discovered from Zhang Wen to Yuan Shu, one of Dong Zhuo's rival warlords, in which Zhang Wen had been collaborating against him. Dong Zhuo tells the rest of the assembly not to worry as none of them are implicated in the letter. ==See also== * Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms ==References== * Fan, Ye (5th century).

It was held from the July 30 to August 9 and was the second time (first being 1924) to be held in Hobart with North Hobart Oval once again being the host stadium throughout the carnival. The carnival was expanded to seven teams from the three that played in the previous edition which meant for the first time since 1908, the competition saw two sections. Section A being South Australia, VFL and Western Australia while Tasmania, New South Wales, Queensland and Canberra took part in Section B. Western Australia caused an upset with a 4-point win over the VFL, the first time the Victorians had lost at a carnival since 1921. The VFL however claimed the Championship on percentage after easily accounting for South Australia by 76 points. Tasmania topped the Section B ladder to gain promotion to the top flight in the 1950 Brisbane Carnival. ==Summary== The 1947 carnival began with the opening ceremony which 14,082 people attended in what The Mercury described as a holiday with few people out on the Hobart streets after the luncheon hour. The opening ceremony featured each captain carrying the state pennant around North Hobart with the governor of Tasmania, Hugh Binney, formally announcing the carnival beginning. The opening match of the 1947 carnival was between New South Wales and Canberra with New South Wales cruising to an 80 point victory over the team from Canberra after scoring eight goals in the first quarter to the Canberrans two goals with the final score being 18.12 (130) to 7.8 (50). The second match of the double- header was much the same with the Tasmanian team giving systematic football to the home ground as Lance Collins scored nine goals in the team's 114 points thrashing over Queensland with an eight goal term in the second quarter sealing a comfortable victory. After a one day break, the second round of Section B started on the 1 August with Tasmania taking on New South Wales. A crowd of 5,785 people attended the match which saw Tasmania defeat New South Wales by 10 points. This was after scores were level with the swing of the match in favor of New South Wales. But Tasmania found an extra gear with a goal to Terry Cashion from a dazzling run through the half-forward. Dave Challender later scored the last goal of the match to seal the victory. The following day saw inaccurate kicking from Canberra with poor position play and lack of cohesion but stayed in the match with Queensland giving opportunities away. It wouldn't be until the final quarter where Queensland, 15 points down at three quarter time would play their best football with four goals giving Queensland an 11 point lead but was then wiped away with two goals from H. Madigan gave Canberra hope but it wasn't too be with Queensland getting a 10 point victory. The second match of the day saw the first match of Section A between South Australia and Western Australia. With an almost record crowd of 14,867, the South Australians dominated Western Australia across the centre with the only period of play being in the third quarter where the Western Australians attacked vigorously. South Australia won the match by 36 points with the final scores being 20.18 (138) to 15.12 (102). The following day, Victoria played their first game of the Hobart Carnival, with Lindsay White kicking 11 goals in the Victorian demolition of Queensland with the final margin being 214 points with Queensland not scoring a single goal in the second half. The following match saw Tasmania take on Western Australia with the winner of the match staying in the A-division and be able to take on Victoria on Wednesday. For almost three quarters of the match, the Tasmanian's stayed close to Western Australia with them only being behind by 13 points at one stage of the final quarter. Western Australia though had the superior team which with the steadiness in attack lead them to a 44 point victory and staying in Division A. Two more matches were played on the Wednesday, after South Australia defeated New South Wales by 71 points in the last inter- section game of the carnival, Western Australia and Victoria played in the second match of Section A. In what The Mercury described as worthy of the highest traditions of the game, the two teams battled throughout the match with Western Australia holding a five point lead after the bell. Fred Fanning has the chance to win the game for Victoria but his shot went wide as WA won by four points. The Friday matches saw convincing wins from New South Wales and Tasmania who defeated Queensland and Canberra by 58 and 78 points respectively. This also meant Tasmania won the Division B title and would compete in Division A in the following carnival. Before the final match of the carnival between Victoria and South Australia was played, a closing parade was arranged with the Tasmanians leading the teams out with Victoria and South Australia being the last one's out. A record crowd of 18,354 people who paid £2860 saw Victoria dominate the game with most of the interest being evapulated after half time as the South Australians had no answer to the Victorians who went on to win by 76 points. ==ResultsSection B=Section A=Inter-Section Matches=Tassie Medal== {  - !

The hungry mice summon Speedy Gonzales to help them get food. Speedy steals some cheese, but when he goes back, Sylvester starts chasing him. They end up on a conveyor belt, where Sylvester gets shaved by some chopping blades. Speedy spreads some grease on a platform, and Sylvester skids into a vat of Tabasco Sauce. He melts a block of ice to recover. On another conveyor belt, Sylvester gets a bottle cap pressed onto his head. He pries it off with a bottle opener, but Speedy \\"yee-ha's\\" him into the ceiling where it gets stuck again, and Speedy hides his bottle opener. Sylvester wanders off, trying to club Speedy but unable to because of his lack of sight, and his aimless wandering lands him in a dehydrator. He emerges from the dehydrator in a miniature size (finally able to remove the bottle cap), but then Speedy, who is now larger than the cat, greets him prompting the tiny Sylvester to run away in fright. ==Crew== *Story: John Dunn *Animation: Gerry Chiniquy, Virgil Ross, Bob Matz, Lee Halpern, Art Leonardi *Layout: Hawley Pratt *Backgrounds: Tom O'Loughlin *Film Editor: Lee Gunther *Voice Characterizations: Mel Blanc *Music: Bill Lava *Produced by: David H.

They were first broadcast on BBC1 in 1974 and 1975. It was produced to mark the centenary of Churchill's birth. The series was widely regarded as misconceived for variety of reasons, such as the studio-bound production which offered little in the way of realism and the lack of available funding. Each episode dealt with a particular period in British history, and the quality was consequently variable. Much of the acting was criticised, despite the involvement of Richard Johnson, Robert Hardy, Alan Howard, Colin Blakely, Anna Massey, Gemma Jones and Edward Fox. The programme was reviewed at some length in the programme TV Hell, which revealed that viewing figures had plummeted from 2 million at the series' launch to less than half a million by the fifth episode. The programme was swiftly buried in a later time-slot for the remainder of its run. Nancy Banks-Smith in The Guardian described it as having \\"little to offer us but blood, horsehair and history. Though a hell of a lot of each.\\" ==ReferencesTV Cream on Churchill's People Category:Winston Churchill Category:BBC television dramas Category:1970s British drama television series Category:1974 British television series debuts Category:1975 British television series endings Category:English-language television shows ","title":"Churchill's People"},{"id":"20136687","text":"The 1999 Dutch TT was the seventh round of the 1999 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season.

A pagan and close friend of Quintus Aurelius Symmachus, he was Praetorian prefect of Italy in 390–392 and, under usurper Eugenius (392–394), again praetorian prefect (393–394) and consul (394, recognized only within Eugenius' territory). After the death of Eugenius in the battle of the Frigidus, Flavianus committed suicide. == Biography == Nicomachus Flavianus was born in 334, and belonged to the Nicomachi, an influential family of senatorial rank. His father was Volusius Venustus, and from his wife, a pagan herself, he had a son also called Nicomachus Flavianus and maybe another son called Venustus; he was also grandfather of Appius Nicomachus Dexter and of Galla.Macrobius, Saturnalia, 5.13; CIL, VI, 1783; Quintus Aurelius Symmachus, Epistulae, vi.32. His career can be reconstructed from two inscriptions: one (CIL, VI, 1782) put up by his granddaughter's husband Quintus Fabius Memmius Symmachus and probably inscribed in 394, the other (CIL, VI, 1783) coming from the basis of a statue erected in 431 in Trajan's Forum by his nephew Appius Nicomachus Dexter, to celebrate his grandfather's memory after its restoration by the ruling emperors. Flavianus' cursus honorum included the following offices:O'Donnell; Jones. * quaestor, * praetor, * pontifex maior, * consular of Sicilia (364/365),During this office he received two letters from Symmachus, Epistulae ii.4 and ii.27 (the last one on his leaving). * vicarius of Africa (376/377),During this office he received the law Codex Theodosianus xvi.6.2. * quaestor sacri palatii,The years of this office are 381/382-383 according to O'Donnel and 389/390 according to Jones; during this office he received a letter from Symmachus, Epistulae ii.8. * praetorian prefect of Illyricum and Italia (390–392), * praetorian prefect of Illyricum and Italia for the second time (393–394), * consul without a colleague (394). During his office as vicarius Africae he received a law against Donatism;This law (Codex Theodosianus xvi.6.2, issued on 17 October 377) is actually addressed to \\"Florianus vicarius of Asia\\", but its content clearly connects it with Africa, where Donastists had a great influence (O'Donnell; Jones). however it seems he somehow sided with the Donatists, if in 405 Augustine of Hippo misbelieved him a Donatist.Augustine of Hippo, Epistulae 87.8. In this office he, together with Decimius Hilarianus Hesperius, was in charge of the investigations around a scandal involving the city of Leptis Magna, but his conclusions, included in a report, had the citizens cleared of the charges;Ammianus Marcellinus, xxviii.6.28. afterwards the citizens of Leptis Magna erected him a statue.Inscriptions of Roman Tripolitania, 475 (erected in 377/378). In 392 Flavianus had been praetorian prefect of Illyricum and Africa for two years, when the emperor of the western part of the Roman Empire, Valentinian II, died, either killed or committing suicide (15 May); his general Arbogast, with whom he had had a long conflict, was suspected of being involved in his death. As soon as he heard of Valentinian's death, eastern emperor Theodosius I nominated another praetorian prefect for Illyricum, Apodemius, who received also the praetorian prefecture of Africa in late 392/early 393. Arbogast, foreseeing an attack from Theodosius, put up a usurper, Eugenius, as emperor of the western part. As soon as Eugenius entered Italy (his crowning had been in Lyon on 22 August 393), Flavianus went to him and was appointed praetorian prefect for the second time; his key role within Eugenius' administration was confirmed with Flavianus' election to the consulate of 394 without a colleague (this office was recognized only within Eugenius' territory). There is another important aspect of Flavianus' activity under Eugenius, the one often referred to as the \\"pagan revival\\". Eugenius was a Christian, but chose several pagans within the aristocracy as his allies. Flavianus took the opportunity and renewed the public ceremonies of the Roman religion, without the opposition of Eugenius, who was, for this reason, scolded by Ambrose, bishop of Milan. Theodosian propaganda first and Christian sources later presented the fight between Theodosius and Eugenius as a struggle of Christian faith against a last- standing Paganism: for this reason the religious acts of Flavianus have been interpreted as a pagan revival supported, or at least allowed, by Eugenius; a typical example is the episode of the Vita Ambrosii by Paulinus the Deacon,Paulinus the Deacon, Vita Ambrosii, 31.2. in which Flavianus and Arbogast, leaving Milan to clash into Theodosius' army, promise to destroy the city basilica and to enlist the Christian clergy into the army after their victorious return. Modern historians believe that there was not such a \\"pagan revival\\", but that Flavianus took the chance of a power vacuum (both in politics and in religion, as there was not, at the time, a powerful Christian figure) to support Roman religion, but without any plan by Eugenius.Neil B. McLynn, Ambrose of Milan: Church and Court in a Christian Capital, University of California Press, 1994, , pp. 350-354. Flavianus encouraged Eugenius in his struggle against Theodosius claiming that sacrifices had indicated victory in the forthcoming war. However, Eugenius and Arbogast were killed in the decisive battle of the Frigidus against the army of Theodosius (5 September 394); a few days later, Flavianus committed suicide, at the age of sixty.Sozomen, vii.22. == Pagan circle of Flavianus == Symmachi–Nicomachi diptych; the left leaf is at the Musée National du Moyen Âge, Paris, the right leaf is at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Flavianus belonged to the pagan circle which included also Vettius Agorius Praetextatus and Quintus Aurelius Symmachus. This circle was at the centre of the pagan movement of the late 4th century and, in particular through the work of the Nicomachi and Symmachi families, has been credited with preserving into modern times the works of several pagan authors, such as Livy, Martial and Apuleius.Oliver Taplin, Literature in the Greek and Roman Worlds: A New Perspective, Oxford University Press, 2000, , p. 537. The relationship between the Nicomachi and the Symmachi was strengthened through weddings: in 393/394 the son of Flavianus, Nicomachus Flavianus, married Galla, the daughter of Quintus Aurelius Symmachus, whose son, Quintus Fabius Memmius Symmachus, married in 401 a daughter or a nephew of Flavianus. The bond between the two families was celebrated, either in occasion of one of the two weddings or at the time of a joint endorsement of religious offices, with the issue of a diptych, the valves of which are entitled Nicomachorum and Symmachorum.Serena Ensoli, Eugenio La Rocca, Aurea Roma. Dalla città pagana alla città cristiana, L'ERMA di BRETSCHNEIDER, 2000, , p. 467. Praetextatus, Symmachus and Flavianus are the main characters of Macrobius Ambrosius Theodosius' Saturnalia, written in the 5th century but set in the summer holidays of 384; the author describes the leaders of the pagan movement who host in turn different pagan intellectuals to discuss philosophical and religious matters. Flavianus also has a connection with Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius via Quintus Aurelius Memmius Symmachus, adoptive father of Boethius. Symmachus named one of his daughters after the daughter of Flavianus. This is used to demonstrate the strong pagan influence on the household to which Boethius owed his loyalty. == Flavianus' role in literature == In the inscription on the base of the statue he dedicated to his father-in-law, Quintus Fabius Memmius Symmachus calls Flavianus historicus disertissimus.CIL, VI, 1782 In fact, Flavianus wrote a history of Rome entitled Annales (\\"Annals\\"), now lost; it was dedicated to Theodosius (probably when Flavianus was quaestor sacri palatii in the 380s)Dennis Trout, Paulinus of Nola: Life, Letters, and Poems, University of California Press, 1999, , p. 40. and written in annalist form. As the title suggests, it might have been a continuation of the Annals by Tacitus: in fact, the often unreliable Historia Augusta, in the book devoted to the life of the Emperor Aurelian (270–275), includes a letter from Aurelian to Queen Zenobia that the author claims to have been reported by a Nicomachus; it is therefore possible that Nicomachus' work was a continuation of Tacitus' until at least Aurelian. Flavianus' Annals was maybe used by Ammianus Marcellinus as a source.Wendell Vernon Clausen, E. J. Kenney, The Cambridge History of Classical Literature, Cambridge University Press, 1983, , pp. 59-60; Samuel Lieu and Dominic Montserrat, From Constantine to Julian. Pagan and Byzantine Views: a Source History, Routledge, 1996, , p. 6. Flavianus translated also from the Greek Philostratus' Life of Apollonius of Tyana, about a man whose life was seen as very close to that of Jesus and whose biography therefore was considered akin to a pagan Gospel in the 4th century. Flavianus has been identified with the object of the Christian work known as Carmen adversus Flavianum. He is one of the main characters, together with other members of his pagan club, of Macrobius' Saturnalia, a work written in the 430s, where he is depicted as a man of huge erudition. In his Ecclesiastical History, Tyrannius Rufinus depicts the pagan Flavianus, rather than the Christian Eugenius, as the true opponent defeated by the Christian Theodosius at the battle of the Frigidus; according to Rufinus, Flavianus committed suicide because he realized his own religion was false.David Rohrbacher, The Historians of Late Antiquity, Routledge, 2002, , pp. 106-107. Scholars are unanimous in the belief that Rufinus invented this claim to advance the cause of the religion for which he so zealously apologised. == Notes  References == * Herbert Bloch: The Pagan Revival in the West at the End of the Fourth Century.

The game was held on July 9, 1963 in Cleveland, Ohio, at Cleveland Municipal Stadium, home of the American League's Cleveland Indians. The game was won by the National League 5–3. From 1959 to 1962, baseball experimented with a pair of All-Star Games per year. That ended with this 1963 game, which also marked the 30th anniversary of the inaugural All-Star Game played in Chicago in 1933. ==Scoring summary== The teams traded runs in the second inning. Willie Mays drew a walk off Ken McBride, stole second and scored on a Dick Groat single. The AL tied the score when Jim O'Toole gave up a Leon Wagner single, hit Zoilo Versalles with a pitch and surrendered an RBI hit to his pitching counterpart, McBride. In the third, both sides scored twice. Behind 3-1, the AL struck back on a double by Albie Pearson and singles by Frank Malzone and Earl Battey to tie it at 3-all. The NL scratched out a run off Jim Bunning in the fifth to regain the lead, then made it 5-3 in the eighth when Bill White singled off Dick Radatz, stole second and scored on a Ron Santo single. Don Drysdale closed it out in the eighth and ninth, retiring Bobby Richardson on a game- ending double play. ==Rosters== Players in italics have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. ===National League=== {  style=\\"font-size: 100%;

He is also known as Malatesta da Cesena, a city he had inherited in 1385 from his father, Galeotto, together with Cervia and Bertinoro. In 1388 he was also recognized lord of Fossombrone. In 1397 he fought for the Bolognesi, who sent him with 200 knights to support the Florentines against Gian Galeazzo Visconti, Duke of Milan. He pushed back Alberico da Barbiano's troops, and then moved to the defence of Mantua; he was however defeated by Jacopo dal Verme, who captured the city. The following year he sided with Braccio da Montone, who was leading a party of exiles from Perugia, in the attempt to retake Mantua, which was now under Biordo dei Michelotti; Biordo hired him for some operations in the Val Nocera. In 1398 Malatesta was made Senator of Rome by Pope Boniface IX, a position he held for some one year driving some attacks on the Colonna family's lands. In 1399, as the Ghibelline party in the city had organized a plot against him, he confiscated their lands, including Verucchio. In 1402, together with his brother Pandolfo, he went into the service of Galeazzo Maria Visconti, fighting in the expedition against Bologna and in the victorious battle of Casalecchio. After the duke's death, he was hired again by the pope, and in 1403 he was able to expel the Visconti from Bologna, capturing a large booty in the following campaigns in the neighborhood. In 1404 he fought against Alberico da Barbiano, and in 1406 he seized Forlì. In 1408 Malatesta was hired by Giovanni Maria Visconti of Milan, with the task of countering Facino Cane in the territory of Pavia. Back in Cesena, he allied with Niccolò III d'Este of Ferrara against the lord of Parma, Ottobono Terzi, taking part in the latter's defeat at Modena by Muzio Attendolo. Returned to Cesena, in 1413 he warred against Antipope John XXIII, who was backed by the aggressive new King of Naples, Ladislaus. After a failed attempt to conquer Bologna, he sided with Ladislaus in his capture of Rome. He shortly took part in the siege of Spoleto, which he quit to help Sforza against Paolo Orsini. After other minor operations, Malatesta was hired by Perugia, which named him capitano generale, against Braccio da Montone. However, he fell ill and was replaced by his brother Carlo Malatesta; he died in September 1416. His daughter Parisina was the second wife of Niccolò III d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara. ==Sources== ;Notes ;Bibliography * ==External links== *Page at condottieridiventura.it Category:1373 births Category:1416 deaths Andrea Category:Condottieri Category:Lords of Italy ","title":"Andrea Malatesta"},{"id":"20136937","text":"Team chasing is a British equestrian sport, contested between teams of four riders over a cross-country course of about two miles, with about 25 fences to be jumped. It is a dangerous sport, and a number of injuries have occurred. The teams set off at intervals and race against the clock, the time of the third member of each team being taken as the time of the team. ==History== Team chasing was invented by Douglas Bunn (the Master of Hickstead) in 1974 as a spectator sport for television, and has had a small but enthusiastic following ever since. Teams, many of whom have been in existence for some time, have been creative in finding names, such as the Boring Gorings (one of the first teams to compete, in 1974, and the oldest team still chasing), the Cunning Stunts, the Ankle Biting Butt Munchers, the Marston Misfits (founded in 1980), and many others. The sport has enjoyed a revival in the 21st Century, and has recently come to public attention by featuring in the BBC Radio series The Archers. ==External links== *Team Chasing site *BBC Inside Out Category:Hunt racing Category:Sports originating in the United Kingdom ","title":"Team chasing"},{"id":"20136939","text":"This Other Eden may refer to: *This Other Eden (film), a 1959 Irish comedy drama film directed by Muriel Box *This Other Eden (novel), a 1993 satirical novel written by Ben Elton *This Other Eden: Seven Great Gardens and 300 Years of English History, a 2005 reference book by Andrea Wulf and Emma Gieben-Gamal ","title":"This Other Eden"},{"id":"20136944","text":"The Really Big Family is a 1966 American documentary film directed by Alexander Grasshoff about the Dukes family of Seattle, who had 18 children.

First established in 1861 in Missouri, where secession talk was strong, the party fully supported the preservation of the Union at all costs. Unlike the similarly named Unionist Party, which operated throughout the North, the Unconditional Unionist Party only operated in the border states. Members included Southern Democrats who were loyal to the Union as well as elements of the old Whig Party and other factions opposed to the separate Southern Confederacy. The party was dissolved in 1866. ==Missouri's Unconditional Union Party== \\"Unconditional Union Ticket,\\" St. Louis, 1860 Another St. Louis Unconditional Union leaflet Following the splintered presidential election of 1860, it became apparent that much of the South would not abide by the election of Abraham Lincoln. In Missouri, Francis P. Blair Jr. began consolidating that state's adherents of Lincoln, John Bell, and Stephen A. Douglas into a new political party, the Unconditional Union Party, which would lay aside antebellum partisan interests in favor of a single cause, the preservation of the Union. Blair and his supporters' primary goal was \\"to resist the intrigues of the Secessionists, by political action preferably, by force if need were.\\"Harding, pp. 308-10. Another faction in Missouri also supported restoration of the Union, but with conditions and reservations, including granting the extension of slavery westward. Others believed that once the Southern states should be allowed to leave the Union peaceably, as they would soon realize their mistake and petition for restoration to the Union. Blair worked to form an alliance with these so-called \\"Conditional Unionists\\" to bolster his numbers. The first formal convention of the Missouri Unconditional Union Party was held February 28, 1861, in St. Louis. No avowed secessionists were invited; only those political leaders who had openly supported Bell, Lincoln, or Douglas were allowed to participate. The delegates passed a series of resolutions including formally declaring \\"at present there is no adequate cause to impel Missouri to dissolve her connection with the Federal Union,\\" As a compromise to the Conditional Unionists, the convention also entreated \\"the Federal government as the seceding States to withhold and stay the arm of military power, and on no pretense whatever bring upon the nation the horrors of civil war.\\" Missouri's secessionists failed to garner enough statewide support to dissolve the Union, so they, under the leadership of Governor Claiborne F. Jackson, broke away and formed a separatist government and eventually took up arms against the Union Army. Pro-Union politicians consolidated their control over Missouri politics as the war progressed and Jackson and his pro-Confederacy Missouri State Guard were forced out of the state. Unconditional Unionist Benjamin Franklin Loan was elected to the 38th United States Congress. ==The Unconditional Union Party in other border states== Similar efforts to Blair's sprang up in other states south of the Mason–Dixon line where the populations and political leaders were split in their loyalty to the Union. In Kentucky, the Unconditional Union Party emerged as a counter to the pro-secession views of several of the state's more outspoken leaders. A similar movement was underway in Maryland, where its leaders also advocated the immediate emancipation of all slaves in the state without compensation to the slave owners. With the help of the Federal government and its troops, Maryland's secessionist voices were stilled. The party was not formalized until the summer of 1863 when adherents worked to elect pro-Union candidates at the state and local level, particularly in Western Maryland. Because Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation only applied to slaves in those states in rebellion, and did not include border states such as Maryland, the party shifted its emphasis to the question of freeing slaves locally. The Conservative Union State Central Committee, led by Thomas Swann and John P. Kennedy, met in Baltimore on December 16, 1863. It passed a resolution supporting immediate emancipation \\"in the manner easiest for master and slave.\\" Supporters included the local military commander, Robert C. Schenck. When the Federal government failed to respond, the Unconditional Union policy held a second similar meeting on April 6, 1864, and again overwhelmingly supported immediate emancipation. General Schenk's replacement, Lew Wallace, supported the resolution.Willoughby, pp. 360-63. Henry Winter Davis was elected to represent in the 38th Congress (1863–65) on the Unconditional Unionist ticket. He was among Lincoln's harshest critics, believing that the president's stated policy for Southern reconstruction was too lenient. In 1864, after Lincoln vetoed reconstruction legislation sponsored by Davis and Senator Benjamin Wade, he and Wade published the \\"Wade- Davis Manifesto\\" openly attacking the president. As a result, Davis was not renominated for another term.Nevins, pp.84–88. ==References== * Harding, Samuel B. (1904). Life of George R. Smith, Founder of Sedalia, Mo..

It is made up of three waterways: the first is the Canal de Jonction from the Canal du Midi to the Aude, the second section is of the Aude itself and the third is the Canal de la Robine which enters the Mediterranean at Port-la-Nouvelle. The La Nouvelle branch is designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of the Canal du Midi and is managed by the French navigation authority, Voies navigables de France. ==Canal de Jonction== The Canal de Jonction runs in a dead straight line and was built in 1776 to provide access to Narbonne from the Canal du Midi via the Canal de la Robine. The Canal de Jonction enters the Aude some 800 m upstream from where the Canal de la Robine leaves it. Prior to 1776 the Canal du Midi port for Narbonne was Le Somail, by road from the city centre. ===Locks on the Canal de Jonction=== {class= ! PK !! Lock !! Location !! Coördinates !!

The northern end of the canal is at the Aude at Moussoulens just south of Sallèles-d'Aude from where goods were transported by land to the Canal du Midi at Le Somail — a journey of approximately . A century later, when the Canal de Jonction was constructed, the Canal de la Robine was straightened and six single locks were built to deal with the more severe gradients, Narbonne finally had direct waterway access to the Canal du Midi. From the Aude the canal passes through the centre of Narbonne and under the Merchants' Bridge (fr: le pont des Marchands) which is one of the few bridges in France which is still lined with houses. From there it runs through Bages and the Ile Sainte Lucie nature reserve before meeting the Mediterranean at Port-la-Nouvelle. ===Locks on the Canal de la Robine=== {class= ! PK !! Lock !!

Europe's analogous project is sometimes referred to as the SuperSmart Grid, a term that also appears in the literature describing the Unified Smart Grid. President Barack Obama asked the United States Congress \\"to act without delay\\" to pass legislation that included doubling renewable energy production in the next three years and building a new electricity \\"smart grid\\".http://planetark.org/wen/51189 ==Technical features== High capacity transmission such as current technology 800 kV high voltage direct current lines would span the country providing linkages to local electric utilities and distantly located bulk power generation facilities. The national backbone would be intelligent in a manner similar to local smart grid clusters. As local electricity networks are upgraded to smart grids, interactions with the national backbone can become more coordinated. Examples given of the kinds of coordination are that hydropower from the northwest can be dispatched if wind is expected to temporarily subside in the Dakotas. Discretionary air conditioning in California can be turned on if there are strong winds blowing in Delaware. Long distance interconnections are not new. The 1400 km Pacific DC Intertie between Los Angeles and the Pacific northwest was proposed in the 1930s and initiated by President John F. Kennedy in the 60s. The Pacific Intertie carries up to 3.1 GW on two 500 kV overhead lines. The 1200 km Quebec to New England HVDC line with 2 GW of capacity was constructed in the 1980s. A 5 GW 800 kV system is being constructed along the southern provinces of China at a cost of €300 million and is scheduled for completion in 2010. The Unified Smart Grid proposal is not simply a collection of point to point interconnections between regional systems with some communications intelligence. The topology conceptually has many access points with each node being a smart grid that could be a virtual power generation cluster, could be a local electric utility system, or could be a Grid energy storage facility. ==Advocacy== According to advocates, the idea of a national system would do for the US energy economy what Dwight Eisenhower's Interstate Highway System did for efficient distribution of products. Solar power from Arizona would be able to supply manufacturing in Ohio, or evening wind power from the Northeast could be used to supply power peak demand during the day in Nevada. According to leading scientists such as James E. Hansen, construction of such a national grid is essential to any strategy to combat global warming. According to energy independence advocates such as T. Boone Pickens, it is essential for the U.S. economy and its strategic energy interests. Some advocate the system as a candidate for a massive public works project that would stimulate the US economy after the Global financial crisis of 2008. The \\"Unified Smart Grid\\" is promoted by Alliance for Climate Protection (Repower America program) and Al Gore. The cost estimate by Al Gore is $400 billion and would be recovered by tariffs on transmission. The need for a national bulk transmission grid is detailed in T. Boone Pickens's energy independence plan. ==See also== * List of energy storage projects * Pickens plan * Smart grid * SuperSmart Grid * Super grid * V2G * Wide area synchronous grid ==References== Category:Electric power transmission systems in the United States Category:Proposed electric power transmission systems ","title":"Unified Smart Grid"},{"id":"20137042","text":"WXIZ (100.9 FM) is a radio station broadcasting a country music format.

The story is based upon the true story of the discovery of 40 Royal Mummies in 1881 in Thebes, the capital of the Pharaonic Empire. For over three thousand years, the mummies had lain undisturbed, until some archaeologists from the Antiquities Department in Cairo noticed that several objects bearing royal names from the 21st dynasty were constantly appearing on the antique black market. They surmise that somewhere in Thebes, someone knows the location of the missing tombs. It happens that this secret has been kept from generation to generation by the chief's descendants among the Horabat mountain tribe. These people have always considered the Royal Cache to be a private source of income on which to draw at times of need. The money had then been divided among the members of the tribe. When the archaeologists arrive to find the tombs, the two sons of the dead tribal chief are thrown into moral chaos, not knowing whether to reveal the secret or preserve what the tribesmen consider to be their natural heritage. The younger son, Waniss, becomes the central figure in the story film. ===The Eloquent Peasant=== Produced in 1969, the short film is based upon the ancient tale of the same name, and stars Ahmed Marei. ===Afaq=== Produced in 1973.

From here, the track was extended north in phases, reaching Yokogawa (now ) on 15 January 1903 and on 5 September 1903. By 1909, the track had linked up with the Hitoyoshi line reaching south from . Through traffic was achieved between in the north of Kyushu to in the south. The entire stretch of track from Mojikō through Yatsushiro, Kokubu to Kagoshima was redesignated as the Kagoshima Main Line on 21 November 1909. By 1927, another track from Yatsushiro through to Kagoshima had been built and this was now designated as part of the Kagoshima Main Line. The track from Yatsushiro through Kokubu to Kagoshima was thus redesignated as the Hisatsu Line on 17 October 1927. On 1 September 1929, the station was renamed Nishi-Kokubu. On 24 November 1929, a new track, the was opened to another station further to the east which took on the previous name of . On 15 September 1930, Nishi-Kokubu was renamed to Hayato. The Kokuto-West Line was expanded to the east and north, linking up with the Kokuto-East Line and other networks so that by the end of 1932, through-traffic had been established between and Kagoshima. On 6 December 1932, the entire stretch of track from Kokura through Hayato to Kagoshima was redesignated as the Nippō Main Line. At the same time, Hayato became the southern terminus of the Hisatsu Line. With the privatization of Japanese National Railways (JNR), the successor of JGR, on 1 April 1987, the station came under the control of JR Kyushu. ==Passenger statistics== In fiscal 2016, the station was used by an average of 1,641 passengers daily (boarding passengers only), and it ranked 109th among the busiest stations of JR Kyushu. ==Surrounding area== * Hayato Post office * Kirishima City Hall Hayato Branch * Kagoshima Shrine ==See also== * List of railway stations in Japan ==References *Hayato (JR Kyushu) Category:Stations of Kyushu Railway Company Category:Railway stations in Kagoshima Prefecture Category:Railway stations in Japan opened in 1901 ","title":"Hayato Station (Kagoshima)"},{"id":"20137189","text":"Adnkronos is an Italian news agency. ==History and profile== Adnkronos was established in 1963 by a merger of two agencies, Kronos (founded in 1951) and Agenzia Di Notizie (founded in 1959).

Walesonline.co.uk, Retrieved 14 May 2015 ==Life and career== Burtch was born in Ystrad Mynach, Wales. Except for his two years of National Service in the RAF, he lived his entire life in the Rhymney Valley. He attended Lewis' School in Pengam, and was inspired to become a composer when he watched his teacher, David Wynne, copying out parts, and decided that was the kind of work he would like to do. He studied at Cardiff University, and subsequently became Head of Music at Bargoed Grammar Technical School, and then Head of Music at Lewis Girls' School in Ystrad Mynach. In 1979 he joined the staff of the then Welsh College of Music and Drama (WCMD) and was Head of the Performance course at the College until 1989. After that he devoted himself to composition. His extensive output of instrumental and vocal works included 17 string quartets, 14 concertos, 13 operas for children and numerous choral and brass band pieces. Drawing on his experience as a teacher, he was especially successful in composing for young musicians. In 1984 the WCMD began its Schools' Opera Program under his direction, and he wrote some dozen short children's operas that were performed by more than 80,000 schoolchildren. Then in 1996, together with the Welsh-Canadian author and educator Mark Morris, he founded the international KidsOp project. This won a prestigious Cable and Wireless Childnet Award in 1998. In 2003 Mervyn Burtch was awarded the MBE for his services to music and education in Wales, and for his work as President of KidsOp. In collaboration with Mark Morris he wrote six operas combining the resources of young performers and professional musicians, and he developed close ties with Canada. He coached and took part in productions at The Banff Centre and other venues in Alberta, as well as assisting in the exchange of both child and adult musicians and singers between Canada and Wales. Their first collaboration, Coyote and the Winter that Never Ends was produced in Wetaskiwin, Alberta, in 1997. The second opera, Wizard Things, was produced the following year in Cardiff, Wetaskiwin, Edmonton and London (UK). Their most successful work, The Raven King was first produced in Blackwood, Wales in 1999, with subsequent productions in Canada (Banff Arts Festival), South Africa, Cardiff, Germany, Ireland (Wexford Festival Opera), and Mexico (XIII International Music Festival, Morelia). These were developed as a collaborative project via the internet; children in the different countries exchanged their ideas through chat-rooms on the KidsOp web-site and contributed stories and drawings. The following year, 500 Welsh schoolchildren took part in a performance at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The opera's subject, inspired by Shakespeare's The Tempest, is the complex relationships between humans and animals, and how they can learn to communicate and live together in harmony. Scoring is for Orff percussion orchestra, piano duet and solo percussionist. The project's fifth opera, Jason and Hanna, was premiered in Caerphilly in 2003, and in 2008 Manitoba Opera gave its second performance at the CanWest Performing Arts Centre in Winnipeg. Its libretto, inspired by the tragedy of the war in the Balkans during the 1990s, tells a story of young lovers doomed by the enmity of their families. A seventh opera, Twm Siôn Cati (based on the adventures of the 16th century 'Welsh Robin Hood'), was written in 2005 in collaboration with Simon Rees. It was premiered in Wales by the Caerphilly Borough KidsOp group. The Competition of the Birds and the Beasts is a semi-staged work, 40 minutes long, for choir, mezzo-soprano and baritone soloists and orchestra, with libretto by Simon Rees; it concerns a song contest for the birds and beasts. It was commissioned by WNOMAX which is the education arm of the Welsh National Opera, and was performed in Cardiff (St David's Hall) in July 2010 with a choir of 200 junior school children, two soloists drawn from the chorus of Welsh National Opera and the WNO orchestra. A significant portion of Burtch's output was choral, and his works in this genre included his popular arrangements of Welsh folk songs which the National Youth Choir of Wales recorded in 1999. He was influenced early in his career by the music of Leoš Janáček, and a characteristic of his vocal writing was the frequent use of irregular metres, which add vitality and preserve the fluency of the native speech rhythms of the text. The Cardiff Polyphonic Choir under Simon Lovell-Jones recorded eight selections for Black Mountain Records. The texts set in these works cover a wide range from the Anglican Liturgy to Welsh and Chinese poets, including Robert Hillyer's translation of the Egyptian Book of the Dead in Egyptian Litany, composed in 1994. Burtch once said he regretted not having learned the viola so he could play in a string quartet, a medium he loved: he composed string quartets throughout his career, and in particular in the final years of his life. To celebrate his 80th birthday year in 2009, he composed a new Piano Trio that was premiered on 13 June at the Gregynog Festival in mid-Wales. In 1991 Burtch received the John Edwards Memorial Award, one of Wales's most prestigious music honours, for the promotion of Welsh Music. In 2014 The Mervyn Burtch Trust was set up to preserve his music, and is collaborating with the National Library of Wales to create a digital archive of all his manuscripts. He died on 12 May 2015 at the age of 85. ==ReferencesOther sources== *Welsh Music/Cerddoriaeth Cymru : Spring/Summer 1989, Vol 8 No.10, pp. 14–28 *Composers of Wales – Mervyn Burtch : Ninnau Vol 36 No. 2, March–April 2011 p. 12 ==External links== * The Mervyn Burtch Trust * Welsh Music Information Centre * KidsOp Category:1929 births Category:2015 deaths Category:20th-century classical composers Category:21st- century classical composers Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire Category:Welsh classical composers Category:British male classical composers Category:British classical composers Category:People from Caerphilly County Borough Category:20th-century British composers Category:20th-century British male musicians Category:21st-century British male musicians ","title":"Mervyn Burtch"},{"id":"20137285","text":"Vincenzo Manno with his dogs.

It was founded by Otto Bernz (May 21, 1856 - February 17, 1932) in 1876 in Newark, New Jersey as Otto Bernz Co.. The company manufactures handheld torches and accessories, especially gas burner torches using fuel cylinders containing butane, propane, MAPP gas, and oxygen for soldering, brazing, and welding. Its trademark torch packs include Basic Use, Multi- Application, and Specialty. Its products include torches, fuel cylinders, kits, solders and accessories, and utility lighters. In the 1940s Otto Bernz Co. relocated to Rochester, New York and changed its name to Bernzomatic. In 1982, Bernzomatic became a division of Newell (now Newell Rubbermaid). On July 1, 2011, Worthington Cylinders division of Worthington Industries purchased Bernzomatic for $51million. In 2014, Bernzomatic's manufacturing facility in Medina, New York was consolidated with a location in Chilton, Wisconsin.

On February 14, 2019 a study was released identifying several alleged defects with all of the cylinders, regardless of fuel content. The report alleges design and manufacturing defects at the neck of the cylinders and with certain torch attachments, leading to breach of certain cylinders and severe burn injuries.

Saib Tabrizi's “Indian style” verses reveal an elegant wit, a gift for the aphorism and the proverb, and a keen appreciation of philosophical and intellectual exercise. Saib was especially well known for his Persian panegyric poetry during the reigns of Persian Emperors Safi, Abbas II and Suleiman.Safavid Iran, p 91. A line from Saib's poem on Kabul provided the title for Khaled Hosseini's 2007 novel, A Thousand Splendid Suns. ==BiographyEarly life=== Growing up Tabrizi was a privileged child. His father, Mirzā ʿAbd-al-Raḥim, was a successful merchant, and his uncle, Šams- al-Din, was known for his calligraphic talents. Tabrizi's family was among those evacuated by Abbas I in response to Ottoman incursions. Tabrizi settled in Isfahan with his family. He was educated in Isfahan and began his literary career. During this time Tabrizi also made pilgrimages to Mecca, Najaf and Karbala. ===Travels abroad=== Tabrizi felt the Mughal courts of India was the best choice to enhance his literary career. Sometime in the middle of the 1620s, he arrived in Kabul and met with the governor of the city, Mirzā Aḥsan- Allāh Ẓafar Khan. He formed a close friendship with Zafar Khan who was his primary patron over the next few years. Tabrizi accompanied Zafar Khan and his father on military campaigns in the Deccan Plateau, before returning to Isfahan in 1632. ===Return to Iran=== Tabrizi returned to Iran in 1632 and spent the rest of his life there. He maintained a relationship with the Safavid courts and dedicated poems Abbas II and Shah Soleyman III. Abbas II appointed Tabrizi to the post of poet laureate.http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/saeb-tabrizi Tabrizi died in 1676 and was buried in Isfahan. ==Saib method in poetry== He developed a method which called Indian method. پاکان ستم ز جور فلک بیشتر کشند گندم چو پاک گشت خورَد زخم آسیا همچو کاغذباد گردون هر سبک‌مغزی که یافت در تماشاگاه دوران می‌پراند بیشتر اظهار عجز نزد ستم پیشه ابلهیست اشک کباب موجب طغیان آتش است به فکر معنی نازک چو مو شدم باریک چه غم ز موی‌شکافان خرده‌بین دارم پر در مقام تجربت دوستان مباش صائب غریب و بی‌کس و بی‌یار می‌شوی ==PoemPersian poems=== آب خضر و می شبانه یکی‌ست مستی و عمر جاودانه یکی‌ست بر دل ماست چشم، خوبان را صد کمان‌دار را نشانه یکی‌ست پیش آن چشم‌های خواب‌آلود نالهٔ عاشق و فسانه یکی‌ست پلهٔ دین و کفر چون میزان دو نماید، ولی زبانه یکی‌ست گر هزار است بلبل این باغ همه را نغمه و ترانه یکی‌ست پیش مرغ شکسته‌پر صائب قفس و باغ و آشیانه یکی‌ست ===Azeri poems=== مین دل محزونیله بیر تازه قربانیز هله زخم تیر غمزه مستینله بیجانیز هله اولمادان غم چکمه ریز دور زمانیندان سنین ناله و آه ایتمه ده دل ایندی حیرانیز هله لطف ایدرسن، گر چه سن اغیاره هر دم دوستیم روز و شب بیز فرقتینله زار و نالانیز هله عید وصلینه مشرف اولمادان اغیار دون دستینی بوس ایله دیک بیزاونلا شادانیز هله دام دوزخ ایچره اغیار اولماسین اصلاً خلاص صائبا بیز جنت دلداره مهمانیز هله == See also == * Saeb Mausoleum *Saadi Shirazi == References  *A poem by Saeb, after his visit from the Kabul city ==Sources== *J.

They are part of the Lebanese Special Operations Command. http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2742/is_1998_March/ai_n25025475 Lebanon's Finest Present A United Front Established with assistance from the United States Navy SEALs and the British Royal Marines, they are tasked with conducting a variety of missions, particularly in a maritime environment, which include: sabotage, raids, beach landings and maritime counter-terrorism. The Marine Commandos were established in 1997, then got their administrative independence in July 2001. ==History== Until 1997, the only Special Operations Force in Lebanon was the Commando Regiment. However, in 1997, as part of the reconstruction and the modernization of the Lebanese Army, the army command decided to establish a designated regiment for maritime special operations. Contacts to establish and train this new, multi-purpose special unit started by approaching the U.S.A and by contacting the British Ministry of Defence. Eventually a number of officer candidates were sent to train with the Royal Marines in the UK. Lower ranks were put through their paces in Lebanon by Royal Marines commandos specially brought in for the task. On the other hand, it is confirmed that U.S. Navy SEALs contributed to the training in both the U.S. and Lebanon. ==Main tasks== The tasks of the Lebanese Marine Commandos in general are to counter enemy watercraft, conduct under-water raids, deploy and dispose of naval mines, underwater demolition, conducting joint operations with the navy, land, and air forces, and maritime counter-terrorism. In addition, the regiment is tasked with sustaining internal security and performing search and rescue missions. ==Uniform and insignia== The regiment's uniform consists of black or U.S.-style Woodland Camouflage fatigues, desert combat boots and a bordeaux beret with the regiment's insignia. In 2008, the unit also adopted the U.S. Digital Desert Camouflage to become a part of their uniforms. The regiment's trident insignia, which is nearly identical to the U.S. Navy SEAL trident with the addition of a Cedar tree, is usually worn high on the left shoulder. The black uniform has an additional insignia on the right shoulder consisting of a red sword and the word \\"commando\\" in red above the sword - this is nearly identical to the former insignia worn on the shoulders of the British Royal Marines and Army Commandos. == Weapons, equipment and vehicles == Lebanese Navy SEALs HMMWV with digital camouflage The units weapons mainly consist of U.S. weapons. Various weapons are used such as the M4 Carbine with M203 grenade launcher, Heckler & Koch MP5N submachine gun, AKS-74U and M16 assault rifles, FN Minimi, M60E4, M240 and M249 light machine guns, Barrett M107 .50 Cal. sniper rifle, M24 sniper rifle, Franchi LAW-12 shotgun, M72 LAW, At-4, Mk 19 grenade launcher. Their vehicles are the only ones among the other Lebanese Army units to be in a desert camouflage, which comes in different patterns, including a digital pattern. Nevertheless, some vehicles are in green camouflage. The list of their vehicles includes M113, M113 Nagman, HMMWV, CUCV, Toyota Land Cruiser, M151 jeep, M35. == Selection and training == Reference for all this section ===Special Forces School=== The first step for any commando in Lebanon is at the Special Forces School, where those looking to join any of the Special Forces units receive their first training. The school is responsible for preparing those members through special fundamental courses. At the end the graduates join their units, where they will perform, in addition to their usual tasks, what they have learned during the courses. Twenty hours of training daily Commander of the school Commando Lieutenant Colonel Marwan Issa explains that the students undergo during the fundamental course, which spans three months, heavy military training, sometimes reaching 20 hours per day, and it is divided into three stages: * Preparatory stage, spanning over three weeks, intended to prepare the students physically and mentally to continue the special forces course. At the end of this stage, the students undergo sports tests that include running for two miles, fixed bar, 45 sit-ups, and 45 push-ups. Those who pass these tests are qualified for the next stage. * Technical stage, intended to teach the students the techniques of self- defense, and prepares them to endure the different physical and psychological stresses. This stage includes lessons for close combat (fighting and bayonets), unarmed combat, explosives, reading maps, climbing and landing, radio, patrolling techniques, urban warfare, crossing water barriers, in addition to dealing with the navy and the helicopters which is done by what is called \\"Rope of Confidence\\" that is jumping from a helicopter or a wooden bar fixed at 6 meters high. In addition, this stage includes various calisthenics, and walking. During it, the member is exposed to severe psychological pressure like difficulties, hardships, sleep-deprevation, and not getting any chance to rest. Only those who pass this stage can move on to the next. * Tactical stage, which involves the practical phase of the patrolling techniques, where the students apply ambushes and raids against supposed enemy targets during bad weather and living conditions, in addition to lessons on survival and being imprisoned by the enemy. From the school to the patrolling base This phase starts by moving from the school to a patrolling base in deserted land. It begins from the sea, where the members are isolated in the landing boat for 24 hours, followed by three hours of rowing from 3:30 AM until 6:30 AM. After this, the members land on the shore and move towards the patrolling base. Reaching the base takes around 12 to 14 hours of walking with full gear (around 25 kg). This walk starts at altitude zero and ends at around 1400 meters above sea level. In the base, the practical application of the various technical lessons, including the combat patrolling (ambushing and raiding), and surveillance patrolling takes place. The first three weeks of this training involve combat within enemy territory that's why it is performed at night, which forces the members to work for 20 hours per day. Who makes it till the end At the end of the third week, the members perform the imprisonment and retrieve prisoners' patrol, which is considered one of the toughest because members play the role of the prisoners and they undergo real torture similar to what they might face if they get captured by the enemy. On the fourth week (after the enemy is defeated), work is performed day and night to chase the enemy, where they begin tracing the enemy and perform different hits ranging from ambushes to raids, in addition to the \\"hammer and anvil patrol\\" in which they surround and finish-off the enemy. At the end, the members walk back to the school, a walk between 80 and 100 km, again with full gear. Fifteen percent of the initial number of students makes it to the graduation where they are given a commando certificate. Additional courses * Commando trainer course * Storming course, storming with both the pistol and the rifle. * Engineering support course * Rope-expert course ===Navy SEALs selection and training=== Graduates from the Special Forces School, in addition other candidates, can join the Marine Commandos. The selection of those who are not graduates from the Special Forces School follows a strict guideline: a candidate, preferably below 21, must be fit, have physical strength, and have mental clarity in order to pass the early stages which include calisthenics in addition to physiological pressure assessments. Passing those tests allow the candidate to continue and follow the \\"naval commando\\" training. Once the candidate passes this training, he can join the Marine Commandos. The selection and training process for the Marine Commandos is extremely demanding and rigorous and lasts around six to seven months. Candidates, other than graduates of the Special Forces School, are eligible to join from all of Lebanon’s armed forces. Barely 15 per cent make the grade. The course of the Marine Commandos is split into phases similar to that of the U.S. Navy SEALs 'BUD/S': * Fundamental * Complementary * Specialized ; Fundamental training The fundamental training is the basic course that a Marine Commando undergoes directly after graduating from the school of Special Forces and joining the regiment. This training lasts for eight weeks and includes lessons on swimming, abseiling, handling of small boats, orienting, landing on the beach using RHIBs, in addition to lessons and maneuvers with the Navy. This stage includes \\"Week of Hell\\" course, which is a whole week of arduous and strenuous training that includes a lot of physical pain and oppression. The soldiers push themselves to the limits to apply what is requested during a training that lasts more than 20 hours per day duringwhich they only sleep for two hours. The goal behind this week is to fortify the capabilities and strengths of the soldiers to endure more and to sustain in front of the severe conditions which they might face during their future operations. It emphasizes on the candidates' physical aptitude and abilities. ; Complementary training At the end of the fundamental training, the members are distributed to the different platoons of the regiment in which they follow complementary training according to their specialization. Among the training: * Basic diving course, followed at the Navy School. * Landing and dealing with helicopters course, through which the soldiers learn how to deal with the helicopters and board them to reach their mission location, in addition to landing from the helicopters using ropes and firing from inside them. * Sniping course, spans over six weeks, prepares capable snipers to snipe over various distances. * Urban Warfare course or Close Quarter Battle, performed in an urban set training area specialized for such training and a constructed beach side tire house. At the beginning blank bullets are used, then they start training with real ammunition. The goal of this course is to train the soldiers for storming buildings and houses in populated areas without putting the civilians at danger. In addition to those courses, the complementary training includes different technical courses such as explosives expert course, which is followed at the Engineering Regiment, driving and mechanical maintenance course, followed at the Logistics Brigade, that's in addition to map-reading, orienting, and radio courses. ; Specialized training UH-1H An advanced stage of the training in each member specializes in a specific military field, such as: * Diving * Combat * Storming * Airborne operations * Explosives and ammunition * Hostage-rescue in the sea ; Combat diving The peak of the training courses at the Marine Commandos is the combat diving course, which is only followed by a small number of highly capable and efficient members. An entrance examination is required. This examination involves 9 km of swimming, 52 meters of underwater crossing, in addition to running, push ups, and sit ups. This course lasts for 18 months, and it is intended to prepare professional fighters capable of using the sea as a way to infiltrate onto the shores and conduct naval special operations and special operations behind enemy lines. The course includes a number of cruel and cumbersome exercises such as, quick walking, running on the sand, long distance swimming, crossing tens of meters under water, swimming with tied hands and legs, dealing with ropes underwater, etc... All this in order to enhance the combat capabilities and the efficiency of the soldier, in addition to enhance his confidence in his capabilities. The divers also follow lessons in dealing with explosives either on land or underwater, scanning and searching the shores, weaponology, dealing with boats and helicopters, radio, reading maps, survival, unarmed combat, sailing and rowing, diving accidents, special diving and environmental instructions, defensive diving (open circuit, compresses air) that reaches 60 meters deep, attack diving (closed circuit, 100% oxygen) which reaches 200 meters underwater during day and night, and helocasting boat recovery whereby the swimmer is pulled from the water by a moving boat. Zodiac RHIB Scenarios for this training includes combat patrolling that begin in the sea then attack a beach either to occupy it or clean it from obstacles and mines, which is a preparation for the following friendly units. Another scenario includes moving from the beach to raid an enemy base or radar, or to conduct an ambush against a moving enemy. Graduates of this course are 25% of the original number, and they are considered the elite of the Navy SEALs. With a week-long break between each segment, selection and training is extremely demanding both physically and mentally which is why there is such as high attrition rate. Major Melad-Helali stated when asked about the training course: \\"If a man wants out, we don't stop him. I don't want him here just for the job, as a statistic. While he is in the unit I demand nothing less than his every thinking moment of the day\\". ; Daily training A 12-hour daily training program is followed by all accepted soldiers of this regiment. It includes running for 7 to 8 km daily, journeys of the warrior, and aerial journeys. In addition to this, training on firing is done at least twice per month. ; Facts It is allowed to lose five men during the course. The command will consider that something acceptable and will not move against the person in charge. ==Operational deployments== This regiment was always among the first to be called upon when major trouble took place. In addition, it is notable that this is the only unit in the Lebanese Army to perform an operation outside Lebanon, however, it was only a search and rescue mission. {  + Marine Commandos Operations History -  Name  Date  Place  KIA  Details/Comment -  Operation Dinnieh  December 30, 1999 – January 6, 2000  Dinnieh, North Lebanon  Yes  This was the regiment's first official military operation.

The squad found the traces of the helicopter on the sand nothing more. It is notable that none of the Lebanese Army or the UNIFIL radars were able to spot the helicopter, but it was rather discovered by nearby fisherman. } In addition to those operations, the Marine Commandos were used to restore and maintain order in some Lebanese cities at different occasions whenever major clashes or turbulences took place. == Special Operations Command == In 2008, the Lebanese Army started establishing the Special Operations command in order to group the Army's elite units.

Arbovirus released their second album Montobbo Nishproyojon on 5 July 2013 at the Russian Cultural Center. The album consists of 8 tracks. In order to bridge the 7 years gap with their audience – the band decided to give it away as a free Digital Download, and never released any physical version of it until the release of Bishesh Droshtobbo. ===Bishesh Droshtobbo (2017)=== Their third album, Bishesh Droshtobbo, was initially planned as a B-side album of the 2nd album with the left over tracks from their second album. But later on the band decided to add more songs to it and release it as a full-length album which now consists of 9 tracks. Band organized their first ever solo concert since their foundation to commemorate the 15 years of the journey and the launching of their third album. The concert was held on January 13, 2017 in Russian Cultural Center. The album was released on their YouTube channel, and double CD of both Montobyo Nishproyojon and Bishesh Droshtobbo was made available through pre- order home-delivery. Since the band didn't sign up wit any record label, they took over the CD production and packaging among the teammates. All the packaging were personally done by the band members and associated teammates. ==Lyrics== Almost all of the lyrics are in Bangla, mostly written by Ranjan, except for 'Artonad' by Shobhon, 'Ja Ichhe Tai' by Sufi and 'Shopnadishto' by Rumman. The band's lyrics broadly covers various elements from self- recognition to the political disarray of Bangladesh, from the 9–6 corporate life to middle-east peace politics, from the inner struggle to strong optimism, from the incoherent feeling of letting a loved one go to, although they portray a broader humane and optimistic view. Their later releases are more vocal about the moral bankruptcy and political hypocrisy that all the members experienced over time. Several of their songs contain elements of Suicide, War Crimes in Bangladesh, Religion, Atheism, Middle East, Identity Crisis, Exobiology and many other issues. ==Associated acts== Guitarist Ranjan has been contributing to different bands as a lyricist for quite a long time, even long before he formed the band. He has contributed lyrics to many prominent musicians including Miles, Artcell, and Aurthohin. Besides – he has an experimental project named Purple Haze, and Lare Lappa.

On 11 Feb 1914, Miyakonojō became a through-station when the track was extended towards the northeast to . By 21 September 1917, the track had reached and line was renamed the Miyazaki Main Line. By 1923, the track had reached north to link up with the track of the Nippō Main Line at . The entire stretch through Miyazaki, Miyakonojō to Yoshimatsu was then redesignated as part of the Nippō Main Line on 15 December 1923. By this time, the extension of the track south and west towards from Miyakonojō had also begun. On 14 January 1923, Japanese Government Railways opened the Shibushi Line from Miyakonojō through to Sueyoshi (now closed). By 1932, various lines stretching to Kagoshima had been linked up and through-traffic had been achieved. The lines serving Miyakonojō were redesignated. The stretch to Yoshimatsu (running generally northeast) was designated as the Kitto Line with Miyakonojō as the eastern terminus. The other tracks, with lines of various names now linked up to Kagoshima were designated as part of the Nippō Main Line. With the privatization of Japanese National Railways, the successor to Japanese Government Railways, on 1 April 1987, the station came under the control of Kyushu Railway Company. ==Passenger statistics== In fiscal 2016, the station was used by an average of 1,111 passengers daily (boarding passengers only), and it ranked 152nd among the busiest stations of JR Kyushu. ==See also== * List of railway stations in Japan ==References * Category:Railway stations in Miyazaki Prefecture Category:Stations of Kyushu Railway Company Category:Railway stations in Japan opened in 1913 ","title":"Miyakonojō Station"},{"id":"20137712","text":"Brahim Kerrit (2 October 1940 - 22 April 2012) was a Tunisian football player.

It educated pupils from age 6 to 13. The links between Aberlour House and Gordonstoun were very close. They shared the same school song and school flag (purple and white). Furthermore, they shared the same school motto – \\"plus est en vous\\", a contraction of \\"plus est en vous que vous pensez\\" meaning, \\"there is more in you than you think\\". They were both founded by the German educationalist Dr Kurt Hahn. His bust was prominently displayed in Aberlour House's front hall for many years. The prep school was founded at Wester Elchies in 1936 – three years after Gordonstoun. Wester Elchies expanded such that in 1947 a modest stately home – Aberlour House – was bought. Charles Brereton was appointed headmaster by Kurt Hahn. Aberlour House had been occupied by the Army during the Second World War and is three miles from Wester Elchies. The younger boys attended Wester Elchies until the age of about 10. Then they proceeded on to Aberlour House. They moved on to Gordonstoun at the age of 13. Wester Elchies got dry rot and had to be pulled down in the early 1960s. A dormitory at Aberlour House was named Wester Elchies in memory of the old school building. Other dormitories took their names from local castles such as Cawdor, Spynie, Darnaway, Gaudwell, Balvenie, Duffus, Lochindorb, Auchindoun, Towie Barclay, Kilvarock, Findlater, Brodie and Glamis. Because of Wester Elchies' foundation date Aberlour House celebrated its Golden Jubilee in 1986. The school went mixed in 1974 – the same year as Gordonstoun took girls although sisters of boys at Wester Elchies had been admitted during and shortly after World War II. Sir Toby Coghill, Bt (1930–2000), was headmaster of Aberlour House 1964–89. He was an old boy of Gordonstoun and a graduate of Pembroke College, Cambridge where he read Architecture and attained 'blues' in rowing and ice hockey. Previously he had been a housemaster at Aiglon College, a Round Square affiliated school in Switzerland and became chairman of the board of governors upon retirement. His ancestor was Nevill Coghill (VC) who died attempting to save the colours at Isandhlwana. Coghill was an Irishman from Castletownshend, County Cork. He died in 2000 at the age of 70. Headmasters after him included Brian Head (1989–90), a Yorkshireman named David Edward Hanson (1990), a Scotsman, John Caithness (1990–2000) and then an Englishman by the name of Neil Wainwright Gardner. Aberlour House enjoyed a short-lived fillip in 1993 when a local rival Blairmore School shut down. Aberlour took in many Blairmore pupils, appropriated Blairmore's scholarship boards and adopted Blairmore's Highland games event. Aberlour House never appended the word 'school' to its name even when it was separate from Gordonstoun. Although the Preparatory School still keeps its name (Aberlour House) it is now located within the grounds of Gordonstoun School. ==Wester Elchies== The first preparatory school was founded in 1936 at Wester Elchies and unlike Gordonstoun, was not made to move during the war. At the start of the war there were 40 boys and girls attending and these numbers increased to the point that a second school was opened at Aberlour House in 1947 by which time nearly 100 pupils were attending.Brereton 1950. p. 33 Wester Elchies was pulled down in the early 1960s because of dilapidation. The prep school continued with just Aberlour but even so there were always problems with the that separated the main Gordonstoun campus and the school. In 2004 this was amended with the construction of a purpose-built prep school on the main campus. In January 2007 the disused Aberlour House became the head offices of Walkers Shortbread, whose main factory complex at Fisherton is adjacent to the house. ==Present day== Presently Aberlour House has approximately 115 pupils between the ages of 6 and 13 attending. Although they form part of the same institution, going to Aberlour is not a prerequisite of going to Gordonstoun and neither is it enforced that pupils at Aberlour House continue on into Gordonstoun. ==References== Category:Independent schools in Moray Category:Boarding schools in Moray Category:Defunct boarding schools in Scotland Category:Defunct independent schools in Scotland Category:Defunct preparatory schools in Scotland ","title":"Aberlour House (school)"},{"id":"20137733","text":"Leo Goldberger (2007) Leo Goldberger (born June 28, 1930) is a psychologist, author, and editor known for his work in sensory deprivation,Experimental Isolation: An Overview.

In 1947 he emigrated to Canada, worked as a freelancer for the Danish section of CBC's International Service in Montreal, while attending McGill University, where he studied psychology, receiving his BA in 1951. He remained there for another year of graduate work in the department of Donald O. Hebb and thus became part of the emergent research field of sensory deprivation. In 1952 he moved to the US and worked as a member of an interdisciplinary team in the Human Ecology Program (at NY Hospital-Cornell-Medical Center) studying the stress experienced by Chinese nationals stranded in the USA after the communist revolution in China. He subsequently joined the Research Center for Mental Health (RCMH) at New York University in 1956 as a research fellow, conducting experiments on personality, sensory deprivation, LSD, cognitive style and subliminal perception in collaboration with Robert R. Holt, George S. Klein and others,Psychoanalytic Theory: Explorations of Essentials, (eds. Merton M. Gill and Leo Goldberger, New York: IUP, 1976) of the RCMH, with funding from his 5-year NIMH-Research Career Development Award among other grants. On receiving his Ph.D. in 1958, Goldberger became an assistant professor and a member of the staff of the Research Center for Mental Health, then in 1967 its associate director, and assumed the position of director in 1971 until the Center's demise a few years later. On the NYU faculty he rose to associate professor, professor, and now professor emeritus.

Produced by Go Go Luckey Entertainment, the program presents fictional found footage depicting traumatic encounters with creatures cryptozoological, supernatural, mythological or extraterrestrial.http://animal.discovery.com/tv/lost-tapes/ Creatures featured include Bigfoot, the chupacabra, vampires, werewolves, and reptilians. The pilot (\\"Chupacabra\\") aired on Animal Planet on October 30, 2008, for Halloween, but the series officially premiered on January 6, 2009.http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/tv/lost-tapes/episode-guide/EP01086200 Animal Planet commissioned a second season, which premiered on September 29, 2009. Season 3 premiered on September 28, 2010, with episodes featuring creatures such as zombies and the Kraken. The show also used to air on Planet Green. ==Overview== Lost Tapes depicts traumatic scenarios where people are attacked and/or killed by mysterious, dangerous, deadly, wild, and ferocious paranormal cryptids. The series is shot in a mockumentary style. Most episodes begin with a quick introduction of facts, which include interviews with experts explaining scientific theories or facts and folklore behind the episode's titular creature. In the second season, some episodes began with footage of a person being attacked and often killed by the episode's creature, an introduction meant to set up the events of each episode. In the third season, every episode had such an introduction, though the events of every episode in all three seasons are accompanied by videos of scientists, cryptozoologists, and folklorists giving their very thoughts and opinions of the creatures, which are called Lost Tapes: Revelations. A common formula in Lost Tapes involves the human characters, usually either a single person or a small group, ending up in a remote part of the world or otherwise in a place with few options of escape, such as enclosed areas like buildings or tunnels. They soon encounter the episode's creature in a series of stressful events, which sometimes result in the deaths of some or all of the featured characters. Many episodes end in cliffhangers which state that the creature which appeared in the episode was never found, and may \\"live among us\\". With the exception of a brief injury in \\"Thunderbird\\", no children have been physically harmed on-screen, though sometimes they become traumatized after the events of the episode, as in \\"Chupacabra\\" and \\"Death Raptor\\". In most episodes, the creatures are often only partially revealed to the audience, and in brief glimpses or otherwise only as silhouettes, shadows, or are obscured by darkness; sometimes they are never seen at all (such as in \\"Thunderbird\\" and \\"Chupacabra\\"), but their presence is made obvious by sounds and the characters' reactions to them. To give the show a mysterious atmosphere, techniques such as those used in Jaws are employed, and the creatures are almost never fully seen. \\"Hellhound\\", the last episode of the first season, marked the first time that a creature was fully shown on camera, and the second season revealed more creatures than the first: in \\"Jersey Devil\\", for instance, the creature's legs, hooves, and face are briefly shown; in \\"Vampire\\", the creature's entire body can be seen on several occasions, such as when the creature watches the boy sleep, though only briefly; and in the season's last episode, \\"Dover Demon\\", the entire creature can be seen in the background when a night vision camera is turned on. The third season showed even more creatures, and many of them in full view of the camera. However, realism was better-maintained with human-like creatures, such as in \\"Zombies\\" and \\"Reptilian\\". Even non-human-like animals were shown more frequently, though this led to some negative criticism among fans as many of the creatures in the third season were less convincing with low budget animatronics and computer-generated imagery, such as in \\"Kraken\\" and \\"Q: The Serpent God\\", or even simply people in costumes, as in \\"Devil Monkey\\" and \\"Yeti\\". While most episodes feature the titular cryptid as the antagonist, in some episodes they benefit the people that the story follows. For example, in \\"Bigfoot\\", the creature seems to be watching over and protecting the main character, even killing a poacher that was trying to attack her; \\"Mothman\\" implies that the featured cryptid was trying to warn people about the imminent collapse of a bridge. While there is normally no connection between episodes, the third season introduced the recurring Enigma Corporation, \\"a private security firm that specializes in the unexplained,\\" though it is not exactly clear what order each of the episodes featuring them is supposed to be in chronologically or if the characters Noel Connor and Elise Mooney remember their experiences in each episode, as no connection between each time besides the third (and in \\"Strigoi Vampire\\", fourth) agent being killed. The Enigma Corporation first appeared in the third season's premiere, \\"Zombies\\", and reappeared in \\"Strigoi Vampire\\" and again in \\"Q: The Serpent God\\". ==Episodes== {   - ! style=\\"padding: 0px 8px\\" colspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Season ! style=\\"padding: 0px 8px\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Episodes ! style=\\"padding: 0px 80px\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Original airdates - !

In a review of the season one DVD, TV Squad writer John Scott Lewinski gave the series a mostly unfavorable review, stating that in the case of this series, \\"Animal Planet could be accused of repacking a horror/sci-fi show as an animal documentary\\" and that much of the program is \\"outright bollocks.\\" He did, however, state that the show holds some appeal for audiences looking for a scare, or \\"incredibly gullible people.\\" Emily Ashby of Common Sense Media gave the series three out of five stars, noting that while the acting was \\"subpar\\", the show overall was \\"simultaneously scintillating and bone- chilling.\\"http://www.commonsensemedia.org/tv-reviews/lost-tapes ==See also== *Found footage *Cryptozoology *Cryptid *Monsters and Mysteries in America ==ReferencesCategory:Animal Planet original programming Category:Cryptozoological television series Category:2000s American satirical television series Category:2010s American satirical television series Category:2008 American television series debuts Category:2010 American television series endings Category:American mockumentary television series ","title":"Lost Tapes"},{"id":"20137765","text":"Geriatric anesthesia (or geriatric anaesthesia) is the branch of medicine that studies anesthesia approach in elderly. == Origin == The perioperative care of elderly patients differs from that of younger patients for a number of reasons. Some of these can be attributed to the changes that occur in the process of aging, but many are also caused by diseases that accompany seniority. The distinction between so-called normal aging and pathological changes is critical to the care of elderly people. Anesthesia and surgery has become more common as the population survives longer. Perioperative management of the geriatric patients requires knowledges about changes associated with aging physiology and its relation to surgery and anesthesia. Only experienced anesthetists can evaluate patients effectively and plan for their perioperative care to minimize complications. Comprehensive preoperative evaluation of an elderly individual's health status can be a very challenging aspect, especially for the young anesthetist. Sir William Osler's aphorism \\"Listen to the patient, he'll give you the diagnosis\\" is as true in the elderly patient as it is in the young. But in the elderly several factors makes taking history more difficult and time-consuming. Many differences can be seen in geriatric anesthesia. First, the preoperative evaluation of the geriatric patient is typically more complex than that of the younger patient because of the heterogeneity of this patient group and the greater number and complexity of comorbid conditions that usually accumulate with age. Perioperative functional status can be difficult to predict because many elderly patients have reduced preoperative function as a consequence of deconditioning, age-related disease, or cognitive impairment. This makes it difficult to adequately assess the patient’s ability to respond to the specific stresses associated with surgery. A common example is trying to determine cardiopulmonary reserve in a patient very limited by osteoarthritis. Physiologic heterogeneity and decreased functional reserve are also manifested perioperatively. Normal aging results in changes in cardiac, respiratory, and renal physiology, and the response of the elderly patient to surgical stress is often unpredictable. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of elderly and younger patients also differ; moreover, the elderly patient’s use of multiple medications may alter homeostatic mechanisms. == Training and education programs == A Syllabus on Geriatric Anesthesiology is available from the American Society of Anesthesiologists. Online resourcesUseful Geriatric Anesthesiology Resources are also available as the Geriatric Anesthesiology Curriculum. Graduate medical education in the United States is regulated by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and the American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists (AOABOS). Each program must provide “appropriate didactic instruction and sufficient clinical experience in managing problems of the geriatric population.” The published joint ASA/American Board of Anesthesiology content outline for in- training examinations also includes a section on “Geriatric Anesthesia/Aging: The Pharmacological Implications, MAC Changes and the Physiological Implications on Major Organ Systems.” These mandates make geriatric education a requirement for any program in anesthesiology. This is not the rule in all graduate medical education programs. A recent survey by the Association of Directors of Geriatric Academic Programs reviewed ACGME policies required by 100 nonpediatric programs. They found that only 27 of these programs had specific requirements for geriatric training; anesthesiology and pain management were two of these. == Organization and societies == The Society for the Advancement of Geriatric Anesthesia (SAGA) is dedicated to improving the care of the older patient coming to surgery. It offers educational programs at its annual meeting as well as at meetings of other anesthesia societies. It also offer educational support for anesthesia training programs.The Society for the Advancement of Geriatric Anesthesia (SAGA) The Age Anaesthesia Society is the UK equivalent of SAGA.Age Anaesthesia Society in the UK == References External links == * Geriatric Anesthesia book by Frederick Sieber * GERIATRIC ANESTHESIA by David J Cook * The Society for the Advancement of Geriatric Anesthesia (SAGA) * Age Anaesthesia Society in the UK * Geriatric Anesthesiology Curriculum * Useful Geriatric Anesthesiology Resources * Syllabus on Geriatric Anesthesiology, American Society of Anesthesiologists * Geriatric Education: ‘Start Low, Go Slow’, ASA NEWSLETTER Category:Anesthesia Category:Geriatrics ","title":"Geriatric anesthesia"},{"id":"20137770","text":"The John Hancock Tower has visible X-bracing on its exterior X-bracing is a structural engineering practice where the lateral load on a building is reduced by transferring the load into the exterior columns.

He was born around 1574 in Scotland. He entered Swedish service in 1598 where he participated in the Swedish civil war between Sigismund Vasa and Duke Karl Karl IX. He is listed as one of the Scottish officers who, under the direction of General James Spens, the General of Scottish and English forces in Swedish service, was sent to King James VI and I in 1608/9 seeking levies for Sweden, although one source notes a travel pass for this purpose issued by the Swedes was dated 17 December 1609. A group of officers went with him including Hugh Cochran, Daniel Rogers, Robert Kinnaird, Patrick Ruthven, John Wauchop, George Douglas and William Horne. He served as colonel of a regiment in 1609-10 and took part in Karl IX's and Gustav II Adolf's war in Russia and in the Baltic states. Cockburn played a leading role in the battle of Novgorod on 16 July 1611, in particular, his regiment blew open the town gates. In July 1612 he was sent by Jacob de la Gardie at Novogorod to Gustav II Adolf to seek payment for Cockburn's troops - some of his regiment had already been sent back to Finland for lack of finances. That year 1612 he obtained 301 homesteads in Ostrobothnia as compensation for a claim of 8,000 dalers. On 1 August 1613 Cockburn's troops landed at Narva. Cockburn was appointed Governor of Dunaw in Livonia, which was called \\"Fortress Cobron\\" after him. His regiment also formed part of the Swedish forces lent to Muscovy during the hostilities with Poland-Lithuania from 1614-16. He was at the siege of Augdow and Pskov, and relieved Ladoga. Cockburn's regiment is listed in military payrolls every year from 1611-1615, and in 1614 and a register was made of all the sick soldiers under his command. In 1615 there is a note of decommissioning payment for Cockburn and his regiment, and by May 1616 the Swedes were keen to allow the soldiers to rest and recoup in case they were needed again. According to one source his troops mutinied at Narva in 1616 (?) and he then took command of the Karelia troops. Cockburn tried in vain to get reimbursement for his loans to the Crown in June 1616, although Axel Oxenstierna did intervene on Cockburn's behalf with the bailiff of Porvoo who was preventing the Scotsman from earning his keep from his land. Indeed, when the Swedish-Russian peace looked imminent, Cockburn requested a transfer into Russian service, and in December 1617 this was granted by the Swedes. Cockburn was to ensure that he was only used against Poland and that he was to convince the Tsar that the Poles were weak, being engaged in war with the Turks and facing domestic opposition. Although it is intriguing that a Scotsman was considered for such intricate use in Swedish foreign policy, it appears that Cockburn and his fellow officers never did enter Russian service however. Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna intervened on his behalf in October 1616 with the local baillies of Porvoo and Rassborg to leave Cockburn unmolested. There is a letter regarding Cockburn and his regiment dated 5 November 1621. At that point he was in active service on Gustav II Adolf's Livonian campaign in the renewed hostilities against Poland. Cockburn served as the commandant at Duna, near Riga in Livonia. One of the rare times Cockburn's troops were negatively described was when they were quartered in three separate villages. Axel Oxenstierna noted that Cockburn was one of the officers killed by illness by 12 February 1622. Jacob de la Gardie records that colonel Cockburn had died by March 1622, (another source erroneously notes that he died in 1631 in Turku) but he appears to have been buried in 1621 in the Turku Cathedral after a military campaign in Latvia. His brother Johan Cockburn erected a marble monument to his memory. He had been married to Barbara Kinnaird. ==Bibliography== *H. Almquist, Sverige och Ryssland 1595-1611 (Uppsala, 1907), p. 271 *G.

The Club fields women's teams in QFAW Division 1 & QFAW Division 2 (North) and men's teams in QFA Division 2 (North) Seniors & Reserves. == History  Kedron Football Club === The Kedron Football Club was formed in 1937 by past pupils of Kedron and Wooloowin State Schools and debuted in the QANFL that year. Although nicknamed the Redlegs, their official emblem was the Lion and the club wore sky blue and red as their colours, however in 1982 they adopted the royal blue and red guernsey as worn by Melbourne Football Club. In both 1939 and 1940 they reached the Grand Final, losing to Windsor on each occasion. They made the Grand Final for the third successive year in 1941 and this time claimed their maiden premiership with a win over Mayne. Kedron, who won back to back premierships in 1943/44 and appeared in every Grand Final from 1946 to 1950, established themselves as Queensland's strongest club in the 1940s. In each of those premiership deciders, Kedron took on Windsor and came out on top in 1946 and 1948. After claiming another premiership in 1959, Kedron suffered a drought until 1980 when they beat Coorparoo by 48 points to win the Grand Final. ===Merger=== In 1990 the Kedron Football Club and the Wilston-Grange Football Club formed a team known as the \\"Kedron Grange Football Team\\" to compete in the Queensland Australian Football League. The amalgamated team was known as the \\"Demons\\" and wore the Wilston-Grange striped jersey with Kedron red socks. The club played for seven seasons in this form, losing the 1994 Grand Final to Morningside by two points. At the end of 1996 the merged team disbanded with both parties to the merger relying on their junior clubs to continue in the underage competitions. ===Senior Football Returns=== Women's Football - In 2003 under the Kedron Junior Club's umbrella, Kedron fielded a team \\"The Lady Lions\\" in the newly formed senior women's competition. Kedron did not field a women's team in 2014/15 but in 2016, after a two year hiatus, senior women's football returned to E. K. Anderson Oval and in 2017 the team was runner up in the grand final. On 25 August 2019 the Lady Lions met top of the ladder and flag favourites Burleigh Heads at Leyshon Park, Yeronga, for the QFAW Division 1 premiership. On that day they made club history by winning the Kedron Football Club's inaugural Women's premiership. The historical win was made more remarkable in that before round 15 the Lady Lions were outside the final four and won six games straight on their way to Grand Final glory. Final Score: Kedron 6.6 - 42 Burleigh Heads 5.8 - 38 Men's Football - Then by 2006 once again with the Junior Club's support after a 2 year merger between Strathpine, Mayne and Kedron to form 'Central Districts Cougars' Under 18s - based out of Kedron FC, a senior men's team returned to open age football via the Queensland State Association division. The men won the flag that year with captain Travis McMain winning League Best & Fairest and Denny 'Willo' Willoughby winning Leading Goalkicker for the season including a competition record of 18 goals in one game.

It merged with Boston University to become the Boston University School of Medicine in 1874. ==History== Prior to 1847 when Elizabeth Blackwell became the first woman to enroll in a United States medical school by entering the Geneva Medical College, many women such as Harriot Kezia Hunt had served as family physicians, but women were denied attendance at medical lectures and examinations. Blackwell set a new standard for women everywhere, helping them gain entrance into the medical world by claiming that women had something unique to offer medicine that men could not.Tuchman, Arleen M. \\"Situating Gender: Marie E. Zakrzewska and the Place of Science in Women's Medical Education.\\" Isis 95.1 (2004): 34-57. The American Medical Education Society, formed in Boston in 1848, was created exclusively to promote the medical education of women. After the name was changed to the Female Medical Education Society to more accurately reflect the fact that the focus was specifically on the education of women, the Society was incorporated and officially recognized by the Massachusetts Legislature on April 30, 1850.Eleventh Annual Report of the New England Female Medical College. (1860)\\"The Medical Education of Women.\\" The British Medical Journal 2.624 (1872): 659. Print. The Society's first classes, offered under the name Boston Female Medical School, were held in the home of Boylston Medical School President Dr. Winslow Lewis.Report of the Female Medical Education Society, From November, 1848, to December, 1850; Containing The Charter, Constitution, By-Laws, Names of Officers and Members, Together with Information Respecting the Boston Female Medical School and the Proposed Clinical Hospital, Which Is to Form a Part of the Institution. Boston: Wright & Husty Printers, 1851. pp. 3-16. The goal of the Female Medical Education Society was to establish a medical school in Boston, complete with its own teaching hospital, to teach women midwifery and nursing with the expectation that they would treat women and children. By 1852, this school was called the New England Female Medical College. Even in a time of gender prejudice, the foundation of the College was accepted by many as it \\"provided women with a socially sanctioned position in a feminized occupation.\\"Gardner, Martha N. Midwife, Doctor, or Doctress?: The New England Female Medical College and Women's Place in Nineteenth-Century Medicine and Society. Diss. Brandeis U, 2002. Ann Arbor, MI: UMI Microform, 2002. Print. In 1851, the Female Medical Education Society discussed a merger with the Female Medical College of Pennsylvania (later the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania), and briefly shared faculty with the other school. The two schools also shared a debate over which could rightfully claim to be \\"the first\\" women's medical school: the WMCP received its formal charter a month before the NEFMC, but did not begin instruction until 1850, while the NEFMC was offering regular classes beginning in late 1848. Dated from the beginning of instruction, the NEFMC is widely recognized today as the first institution in the United States to offer medical education exclusively to women.Waite, Frederick Clayton. History of the New England Female Medical College, 1848-1874. Boston: Boston U School of Medicine, 1950. p.132. On May 27, 1857, by an act of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the Female Medical Education Society was formally reorganized as the New England Female Medical College, with the board members of the Society now serving as Trustees of the College. In 1870 the New England Female Medical College building was dedicated on a lot between East Concord and Stoughton Streets, giving the school its own home after 22 years of existence. However, the school faced growing financial constraints, and after 26 years, having granted medical degrees to 98 women, the New England Female Medical College merged with Boston University to become the co-educational Boston University School of Medicine in 1874. == Foundation == The main motivation for the school’s foundation was the belief that male physicians should not generally assist in childbirth. Founder Samuel Gregory saw what he called \\"man-midwifery\\" as unnatural and improper and believed that women should be given formal medical education in order to become certified midwives and attend to their own sex. Gregory argued that the U.S. was the only country in the world where women were dependent on men for aid in childbirth and that male midwives caused unnecessary embarrassment to women.Gregory, Samuel. Letter to Ladies in Favor of Female Physicians for Their Own Sex. 3rd ed. Boston: The College, 1856. pp. 4–50. He advocated for midwifery to become a feminine occupation exclusively in the hands of women. At the time, there was increasing support for the idea that, by dividing medical labors between the sexes (particularly giving women the role in childbirth), different departments could be more efficient and effective. Gregory argued that midwifery was a simple, mechanical routine that was acceptable for women, but beneath male physicians, and that men should be happy to hand it off to women and dedicate their time to other medical fields where they would be able to employ their full mental capacity. Additionally, Gregory believed that females would be more likely to avoid using drugs and medical instruments during childbirth, and instead allow for nature to run its course while comforting patients, which he thought would lead to fewer fatalities during childbirth. Although it was seen as controversial, Gregory drew support for the establishment of the first female medical college with the help of Lemuel Shattuck and Harriet Beecher Stowe, the Female Medical Education Society, which wanted to provide education for women to become midwives, nurses and physicians, and the public belief that women were well adapted for being midwives as a result of their feminine nature. == Students == The first term of classes began on November 1, 1848 with a class of twelve students from across New England, New York and Ohio enrolled at Boston Female Medical College. By 1852, the college had changed its name to the New England Female Medical College in the annual reports published by the Female Medical Education Society. On November 9, 1859 the Ladies' Medical Academy with a free clinic was established in connection with the school on Summer Street in Boston. The institution's goals were the education of interested women in medical subjects, nursing practices, midwifery, and the training of female physicians. The Ladies' Medical Academy awarded the Doctor of Medicine degree to four women in 1860, and two Diplomas in Midwifery were granted. There were some forty students in all by 1861. The Ladies Medical Academy appears to have been absorbed by New England Female Medical College shortly after its founding. Throughout its 27 years, over 300 women attended classes and 98 women received doctoral degrees, with fewer than five students graduating each year, on average. Basic graduation requirements consisted of previous medical study, two years of attendance at NEFMC, a final thesis, and passing a final exam. The majority of the school’s budget was provided by charitable contributions allowing for many students to be given the opportunity to study there through the Massachusetts State Scholarship Fund. All women applicants with proper preliminary educations were able to apply for scholarships to the college. Without a scholarship, starting tuition was $25 per term with room and board costs of $2 per week. A list of 98 graduates of the school was published in 1905 by Harvey King.William Harvey King, M. D., LL. D. (1905) History of Homeopathy and its Institutions in America === Notable Alumni === * Dr. Rebecca Davis Lee Crumpler graduated from the New England Female Medical College in 1864 and was the first African American woman to earn a medical degree. * Dr. Mary Harris Thompson graduated in 1863 and went on to establish the Chicago Hospital for Women and Children. * Dr Esther Jane Hawks graduated in 1857.Esther Hill Hawks == Faculty == From its start in 1848 until the mid-1850s, there were two faculty members whose lesson plans focused mainly on midwifery. In later years, both the curriculum and teaching staff grew, with five to seven faculty members providing a full medical education to students comparable to that of other medical schools of the time. One of the most notable faculty members was Dr. Maria Zakrzewska who believed that young women should pursue a medical degree because of “an innate interest and talent for practicing medicine as well as the love for the science of it,” not just because of their empathy towards women and children. == Failure == Many, including some faculty members, saw NEFMC as inadequate and inferior to medical schools for male students.Walsh, Mary R. \\"Sympathy and Science: Women Physicians in American Medicine.\\" The American Historical Review 91.3 (1986): 748. The most prominent example of this was Gregory’s opinion that scientific instruments offered little to doctors whose job is to treat a sick individual, while others, including Zakrzewska, saw these instruments as a way to study diseases and view medicine in a scientific context. Zakrzewska left the college because she disagreed with Gregory’s beliefs and called him and the rest of the faculty “quacks” for being too focused on curing diseases and instead teaching students the scientific foundations of medicine. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Frederick C.

It is based in inner- northern Brisbane and fields senior men's and women's, masters, youth and junior teams. The club's home at Hickey Park, Stafford, also hosts the largest AFL9s league in Queensland. ==History== Wilston Grange was formed in 1945 as \\"Wilston Football Club\\", renamed Wilston Grange in 1947 and entered the QANFL in 1950. Their original home ground was Emerson Park, Grange, and the club relocated to Hickey Park for the 1964 season. That year, VFL superstar Ron Barassi was the guest of honour at the opening of the oval, which was broadcast live on Brisbane radio. An earlier Wilston Football Club had operated from the early 1930s to 1939 but ceased operation over the war years. The Wilston Grange club colours are royal blue, red and white. The Gorillas, as they are known, made five Grand Finals in the league for premierships in 1955, 1969 and 1972. The Gorillas' 1969 premiership was remarkable in that they had finished next to last the previous season. The 1972 team was coached by the legendary Alan Killigrew and won the Grand Final by a record 84 points, defeating Sandgate. Champion players over the years have included Fred Coulthurst, Allan Ahlberg, Ken Grimley, Jim Conlon, Keith Leach, Syd Guildford, Barry Clarke and Scott McIvor. High flying full forward Steve Taylor notched a century of goals in four consecutive seasons from 1969 to 1972. At the end of the 1989 season, Wilston Grange and Kedron merged to form the Kedron Grange Football Club. The club played for seven seasons in this form, losing the 1994 Grand Final to Morningside by two points. At the end of 1996 the merged club collapsed. Both parties to the merger relied on their junior clubs to continue in junior competitions. Wilston Grange had recommenced senior football operations in 1995 with full links to the Kedron Grange operation. The new lower based level club won the AFL Queensland State League Division 2 Grand Final in 1997. In the following years they competed in several restructured AFL Queensland competitions being promoted through success on field and strong facility development at Hickey Park. The club was re-admitted to the QAFL State League in 2014, returning top-flight football to Hickey Park and reigniting many old rivalries, complemented by strong Supers, Masters and Junior operations which have been boosted by the foundation of a women's team in 2014 that competes in the QWAFL State League. ==HonoursClub=== * Queensland Australian Football League (3): 1955, 1969, 1972 ===Individual=== Grogan Medalists (5) * Jim Conlon - 1960 * Keith Leach - 1961, 1962 * Merv Appleyard - 1968 * Ken Garcia - 1969 * Barry Clarke - 1972, 1976 * Dean Warren - 1993 AFLQ Team of Century Members (4) * Keith Leach * Ken Grimley * Barry Clarke * Scott McIvor AFLQ Hall of Fame Members (11) * Keith Leach * Ken Grimley * Barry Clarke * Scott McIvor * Merv Appleyard * Syd Guildford * Graham Jewell * Clint Bizzell * Dean Warren (Administration) * Ralph Geschke (Coaching) * Ron Lockens (Photographic Library) Ray Hughson Medalist - Leading Goal Kicker (11) * Ken Grimley 1956 * Les Periera 1961 * Steve Taylor 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972 * Barry Clarke 1978 * Brett Grimley 1987 ==External links== *Official website *Wilston Grange Football Club's Full Points Footy page Wilston Grange Category:Australian rules football clubs in Brisbane Category:1945 establishments in Australia Category:Australian rules football clubs established in 1945 ","title":"Wilston Grange Football Club"},{"id":"20137988","text":"The 1986 France rugby union tour of Argentina, Australia and New Zealand was a series of eight matches played by French national rugby union team touring those countries between may and June 1986.

The reservoir of Rihand Dam is called Govind Ballabh Pant Sagar and is India's largest artificial lake. Rihand Dam is a concrete gravity dam located at Pipri in Sonbhadra District in Uttar Pradesh, India. Its reservoir area is on the border of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. It is located on the Rihand River, a tributary of the Son River. The catchment area of this dam extends over Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh & Chhattisgarh whereas it supplies irrigation water in Bihar located downstream of the river. ==Specifications== Govind Ballabh Pant Sagar is the largest man made lake in India. Rihand dam is a concrete gravity dam with a length of 934.45 m. The maximum height of the dam is 91.46 m and was constructed during period from 1954–62. The dam consists of 61 independent blocks and ground joints. The powerhouse is situated at the toe of the dam, with installed capacity of 300 MW (6 units of 50 MW each). The Intake Structure is situated between blocks no. 28 and 33. The Dam is in distress condition. It is proposed to carry out the rehabilitation works in the dam and the powerhouse. The F.R.L. of the dam is 268.22 ft and it impounds 8.6 Million Acre feet of water. The construction of the dam resulted in forced relocation of nearly 100,000 people B. Terminski, Development-Induced Displacement: Theoretical Frameworks and Current Challenges, Geneva, 2013 Rihand Dam front view Many super thermal power stations are located in the catchment area of the dam. These are Singrauli, Vindyachal, Rihand, Anpara & Sasan super thermal power stations and Renukoot thermal station. The high alkalinity run off water from the ash dumps (some are located in the reservoir area) of these coal-fired power stations ultimately collects in this reservoir enhancing its water alkalinity and pH range. Using high alkalinity water for irrigation converts the agriculture fields in to fallow Alkali soils. == Dams and Development == Jawaharlal Nehru at inauguration of Rihand Dam As the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru was determined to make India economically self-reliant and self- sufficient in its food production. Nehru waged an aggressive dam building campaign, drastically expanding infrastructure left by the British Raj, who \\"had put down 75,000 miles of irrigation canals to water the subcontinent’s most valuable farmland.\\" Nehru believed dams held the key for growth and the achievement of his economic goals for India. At the opening of the Bhakra Dam in 1963, he referred to the dam as \\"the temple of a free India, at which I worship.\\" The taming of rivers throughout India marked the dawn of a new, independent and most importantly free India that would finally be able to make use of its resources on its terms, enriching its people in the process. To this day, India continues to build dams throughout to achieve these ambitious economic goals. == Background == Before the dam was built, Singrauli, the town in which it was built, was a primarily agrarian locale. The region lacked basic modern features such as adequate transportation and roads, and electricity, but the prospect of arable land provided a boon for local villages to farm and sustain themselves. Authorities recognized the potential for growth in the region, as Singrauli was home to vast natural resources including coal, forests with various types of trees such as sal, bamboo, khair, and salal. Building a dam to harness the power of the Rihand would represent a first step in developing the region and bringing industry to it. British colonial authorities were interested in building a dam on the Rihand River as early as 1940. The construction of a dam had the potential to improve irrigation in the region, as well, and held the promise of generating hydro- electric power. In 1952, the Independent Indian government sanctioned survey work; construction began in 1954 and was completed in 1962.Jawaharlal Nehru at Rihand Dam == Societal Impact == The construction of the Rihand Dam has catalyzed the transformation of the Singrauli region from an agrarian society into an industrial one. Greenpeace found “the social and demographic profile of the area has undergone a significant transformation with the massive industrial changes to the landscape.” This influx of industry, primarily energy and manufacturing interests, has allowed the region to grow and power the growing Indian economy. Despite this growth, serious questions over the nature of these development projects remain, as tens of thousands of locals were forced to relocate for the construction of the Rihand Dam, and tens of millions throughout India as a consequence of the construction of dams throughout the country. Critics allege that growth takes priority over human welfare, with safety precautions in work environments severely lacking and little care taken to protect the environment. Despite being built 60 years ago, these impacts are longstanding. === Economic Impact === In terms of achieving economic growth and development for Indian authorities and business interests, the Rihand Dam has been an unmitigated success. The construction of the dam allowed for the Singrauli region to expand rapidly in the ensuing years, with various industries emerging in the region. Local industries produce a wide range of goods, such as commercial vehicles, mining equipment, locomotives, telecommunication cables, and power generation equipment. To facilitate this growth, the Indian government subsequently purchased thousands of acres of land in neighboring villages and throughout the district of Madhya Pradesh to sell to industrialists. These plants required tens of thousands of workers to operate them, creating opportunities for Indians to earn better wages. Singh points out firms did not hire the locals displaced by the dam. Instead, the government and companies chose to hire laborers from other regions within India. As these other industries arose, coal remained the driving force behind the expansion of the Singrauli economy. With nine billion tons of coal reserves, Singrauli has long been viewed as “India’s energy capital;” its vast coal reserves, discovered in 1840, have long attracted mining companies and state planners sought to harvest this resource to power the industry that eventually came to dominate the area. Coal mining increased precipitously in the decades after the construction of Rihand; By 1980, production totaled around six million tons and at the time Singh wrote his article, was expected to reach 30 million tons by 1995 and eventually eclipse 75 million tons amounting to more than half of India’s entire production of coal in 1983. === Environmental Impact === As the Indian government’s primary concern has been to foster growth, it has often chosen the most expedient route to achieve its goals, at the expense of the environment. The construction of the Rihand Dam was only the beginning of industrialization in the Singrauli region. As state and private entities have continued to develop the region, pollution has increased, threatening the environment and wellbeing of residents, while taking valuable farmland. Pollution from industry has harmed the health of local residents, as well. Fluoride contamination in the dam’s reservoir water pollutes groundwater, consequently affecting drinking water and agriculture. Researchers estimate that more than 60 million people from 17 states deal with the effects of dental, skeletal, or non-skeletal fluorosis, a chronic condition caused by excessive intake of fluorine compounds, marked by mottling of the teeth and, if severe, calcification of the ligaments. While some fluoride contamination may be caused by natural processes, human activities such as coal and mineral mining and the operation of thermal power plants have led to increased pollution. Coupled with increased demands for water, more residents are consequently forced to drink this contaminated water. Despite the ramifications of this industry, the Indian government has often willfully ignored the consequences. On January 13, 2010, the Ministry of Environment and Forests halted all mining in the region until environmental concerns were addressed. Indian officials from the Central Pollution Control Board and researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology found the area to be “critically polluted,” but mining was allowed to continue in July 2011. This tension between immediate growth and environmental safeguards continues, as Indian authorities continue to push for more energy production and economic growth, ignoring the concerns of local governments and peoples. === Forced Relocation === The most significant consequence of the construction of the Rihand Dam has been the internal displacement of local tribes. Development projects throughout India have led to the forced migration of tens of millions with India, creating a phenomenon that Indian environmental activist Parshuram Ray dubs “Development Induced Displacement.” After British colonial rule, the Indian government ambitiously sought to develop their newly independent country. The state facilitated the construction of dams, mega dams, mines, factories, and irrigation projects. Despite governments making promises to these groups, little action has been taken to alleviate their suffering. Researchers estimate the number of displaced persons for dam projects across India to top 50 million and believe official statistics often understate the true level of destruction that these projects bring to mask their true cost. Despite this forced relocation across India being rather commonplace, the government is most likely violating its own constitution, which guarantees its citizens a right to life. But there is little political will to address or contest this, and authorities have no impetus to change their practices. By 1960, the dam was nearing completion and almost ready to be put into use. 108 villages containing 50,000 people were immediately put at risk, but the government provided no assistance to assist their relocation. Instead, in May-June 1961, 20,000 locals went to protest the lack of government action to protect their welfare. Instead of acknowledging the protestors' concerns, the local Deputy Commissioner instead sent two thousand policemen to force the protestors home and ordered the dam gates to be closed, forcing people from their homes with only 24 hours of notice. The same villagers were then forced to relocate in 1965 when coal mines opened, again in 1980 when the National Thermal Power Corporation broke ground on a thermal power project, and once more in 2009, when the Essar Power MP broke ground on a new plant. Despite being displaced as many as five times, families forced out by the construction of Rihand never found a new permanent home. Enduring such upheavals caused psychic harm in addition to the precipitous drop in living standards. Parshuram Ray goes into further detail when discussing the traumas caused by displacement: > The long drawn out, dehumanising [sic], disempowering and painful process of > displacement has led to widespread traumatic psychological and socio- > cultural consequences. It causes dismantling of production systems, > desecration of ancestral sacred zones or graves and temples, scattering of > kinship groups and family systems, disorganization of informal social > networks that provide mutual support, weakening of self-management and > social control and disruption of trade and market links etc… Essentially, > the very cultural identity of the displaced community and individual is > subjected to massive onslaught leading to very severe physiological stress > and psychological trauma. Despite these very real traumas, the national government has failed to alleviate suffering in any meaningful way. Planners are not pressured by governments to plan for these consequences. The disruption in communities that these projects cause also quash potential political unrest or protest, as people can no longer rely on their destroyed networks. Within these forced displacements, gender and economic issues bring more hardship. Indian law provides no relief to displaced women and women do not enjoy the same economic protections and freedoms that men do. Women are consequently forced to rely on male members of the household, as they are not entitled to any benefits the government offers. For tribes that have only lived off the land, shifting to a market economy is also a massive shock because they have never engaged in such a system. The constant and forced resettlement, in addition to being cruel and callous, threatens gains from these projects such as the Rihand Dam. The intergenerational traumas wound those forced to leave, but also disrupt stable villages and economies, ultimately dooming millions of future Indians to poverty. == The Push for Sustainable Growth == The construction of the Rihand Dam falls into a larger paradigm, as its construction has arguably propagated more problems than it has benefits. Writing in 2003, reporter Diane Raines Ward found: > A 1995 Indian Environment Ministry report revealed that 87 percent of > India’s river-valley projects did not meet required safeguards. Recent > reports show that larger dam reservoirs are silting up at rates far higher > than assumed when the projects were built, that the life span of major > Indian dams is likely to be only two-thirds of their projected life, and > that every dam built in India during the last 15 years has violated various > environmental regulations — from siltation and soil erosion, to the neglect > of health, seismological, forest, wildlife, human, and clean water issues. As the world's largest democracy and second most populous country, Indian leaders must balance the goals of economic development with democratic ideals and the overall welfare of its people. While economic growth is attractive, it alone cannot increase the welfare of Indian people and growth pursued in this matter will not only not bring about long term growth, but it will kill people in the process and make India uninhabitable. Amartya Sen and Jean Drèze discuss these tensions, acknowledging \\"issues of economic development in India have to be seen in the larger context of the demands of democracy and social justice.\\" They push back against India's preoccupation with simply increasing its GDP per capita, as such a metric is limited in scope and fails to capture what is being done with that increase in wealth, who is benefitting from it, and whether people's lives are materially improving. They write: > Those who dream about India becoming an economic superpower, even with its > huge proportion of undernourished children, lack of systematic health care, > extremely deficient school education, and half the homes without toilets > (forcing half of all Indians to practise open defecation), have to > reconsider not only the reach of their understanding of the mutual > relationship between growth and development, but also their appreciation of > the demands of social justice, which is integrally linked with the expansion > of human freedoms. Sen and Drèze push for sustainable growth; growth that is environmentally sustainable but socially sustainable so that the gains are not zero sum. Instead, sustainable growth maximizes the number of individuals who benefit, while minimizing the hardship and complications that arise from economic expansion. The construction of the Rihand Dam and the destruction it caused in the lives of hundreds of thousands exemplify the need for such an approach. This is achievable, but requires patience and a commitment to working within this framework. NGOs working with villages and small towns to bring back water collection methods speak to the efficacy of such an approach, showing mega- projects are not the only solution. Local level provisions like these can often solve the problem more effectively, as locals are more privy to their own needs and how their immediate area operates. By 2019, various Indian companies such as the Shapoorji Pallonji Group and ReNew Power had won the rights to invest ₹7.5 billion ($106 million) to build solar panels with a capacity of 150MW on the Rihand Dam. A project like this shows not only how sustainable policies and projects are possible, but existing infrastructure can be used in new and different ways to yield more benefit. ==See also== * Algal bloom * Soil pH * Cation-exchange capacity * Sodium adsorption ratio * RSC Index * Soda lake * Soil salinity *Narmada Bachao Andolan ==References== Category:Artificial lakes of India Category:Reservoirs in India Category:Hydroelectric power stations in Uttar Pradesh Category:Dams in Uttar Pradesh Category:Dams completed in 1962 Category:Buildings and structures in Sonbhadra district Category:Son River basin ","title":"Rihand Dam"},{"id":"20138076","text":"Fairplay is an unincorporated community in Adair County, Kentucky, United States.

It consisted of Operation Coat, Operation Crack, Convoy MW 3, Convoy ME 3, Convoy AN 6 and the main element, Battle of Taranto (Operation Judgement).Stephen, p. 38. ==Operation Coat== Operation Coat was a reinforcement convoy from Britain to Malta, carrying troops and anti-aircraft guns. The convoy was made up of the battleship , heavy cruisers and and three escorting destroyers. It was covered by the aircraft carrier , light cruiser and three more destroyers, all from Force H, out to mid-Mediterranean; three Force H destroyers would remain, the rest turning back from Sicily. ==Convoy MW 3== Convoy MW 3 was made up of three empty merchantmen bound for Malta from Alexandria, plus an Australian destroyer and the monitor bound for the base at Suda Bay in Crete.Greene & Massignani, p. 101 The convoy was escorted by the anti-aircraft cruiser , accompanied by three destroyers. The convoy left Alexandria on 4 November and reached Malta on 10 November.Hague, p. 192 ==Convoy ME 3== Convoy ME 3 comprised four merchantmen sailing in ballast from Malta to Alexandria, under escort of the battleship , Coventry, and two destroyers. The convoy sailed from Malta on 10 November and arrived in Alexandria on 13 November. ==Convoy AN 6== Convoy AN 6 consisted of four slow tankers bound for Greece from Egypt, in support of the British expedition there, escorted by a slow trawler. Shaping a similar course were reinforcements for Crete, embarked in the light cruisers and as Force B, while Force C, the light cruiser (Vice Admiral Henry Pridham-Wippell) transported RAF supplies to Greece and inspected Suda Bay. All three would rejoin to form Force X for an 11/12 November raid on the Otranto Strait. ==Operation Crack== Operation Crack was an attack on Cagliari by aircraft from Ark Royal, en route to Malta, branching off from Operation Coat. ==Operation Judgement== Operation Judgement, under the command of Admiral Andrew Cunningham, was executed by aircraft from the carrier , escorted by battleships Ramilies, , and . They met the heavy cruisers and and three destroyers, then escorting Convoy MW 3, and provided cover. A rendezvous with the Barham group from Operation Coat was to be met, with Illustrious, Gloucester, York and Berwick detaching to attack Taranto, coincident with the Force X raid. The Italians were aware of sorties from Alexandria and Gibraltar by 7 November and sent nine submarines to attack a Malta convoy (MW 3) detected on 8 November. Bombers (unsurprisingly) failed even to pinpoint the Judgement force and when Force H was detected headed back toward Gibraltar on 9 November, the Italians presumed MW 3 had turned around, too.Stephen, p. 36. Italian confusion arose when Barham, Berwick, Glasgow and their destroyers were detected 10 November off Lemnos. The correct deduction, they had detached from the Gibraltar-bound force, was not accompanied by a correct guess they would join with Cunningham.Stephen, p. 39. The same day, Ramillies, Coventry and two destroyers protecting ME 3 were detected and again, bombers failed even to locate them. The complexity of Operation MB8, with its various forces and convoys, deceived the Italians into thinking only normal convoying was underway. While Italian reconnaissance was characteristically bad, in the end, the Italians had only failed to keep track of Illustrious. That the Italians expected the British to behave in what was, at the time, their usual way was the root of the mistake. ==See also== * Battle of the Mediterranean * Malta Convoys * Force H ==NotesReferences== * * * Category:Naval battles and operations of the European theatre of World War II MB8 MB8 Category:Naval aviation operations and battles Category:Conflicts in 1940 Category:1940 in Italy Category:November 1940 events ","title":"Operation MB8"},{"id":"20138090","text":"Thanasis Kaproulias is an audio artist who creates noise music under the name of Novi_sad. ==Life and work== Thanasis Kaproulias was born in Greece in 1980. He graduated from the Economic University of Piraues and lives and works in Athens, Greece. Thanasis Kaproulias (as \\"Novi_sad\\") has worked and collaborated with: Helge Sten (Deathprod, Supersilent), Francisco López, Mika Vainio (Pan Sonic), B. J. Nilsen, Daniel Menche, Zbigniew Karkowski, Richard Chartier, Carl Michael von Hausswolff, Jacob Kirkegaard, Beckie Foon and Scott Konzelmann. Influenced by the pioneers of audio assault, he began generating sounds in 2005. In his works, amplified environmental recordings, drone manipulations, structured ambient soundscapes, microtones vs overtones, all come together in a hyperstructure of iconoclastic form. Novi_sad’s artistic output displays a high level of technical ability, as well as a sensitivity to the nuances of location. Every sound that occurs is treated with a sculptural integrity and his sonic power operates on a level in which the audience participates as transcendental listeners. His approach is similar to the 'cinema pour l'oreille' (cinema for the ear) and in turn would like to ‘donner à voir’ (lead to seeing) by means of sound. Being immersed in his sonic environment offers an absolutely visceral and cerebral experience at once. Novi_sad explores sound as sensation pulling apart its physical properties to reveal its relationship with human perception. Some of his projects are primarily focused in architectural acoustics and the relationship between architecture and sound, when other projects are based on various methods of audio analysis in extremely unusual recordings and the use of quantitative and numerical data from different sources.

Parish records show that he was baptised in Vechigen near Bern, Switzerland on 13 April 1766, the son of Johann Pauli and Veronika Christine (née Pulfer).Family Search, Switzerland Church Records, 1277-1992 Encyclopedia of Firearms by Harold Leslie Peterson, p. 225. Baptism of Samuel Johannes Pauli, 13 Apr 1766, in Vechigen, Berne, Switzerland. ==CareerSwitzerland=== Pauly started working as a carriage builder and mechanic in his father's workshop; he was constantly looking for technical improvements (such as a self-lubricating axle) and also ways to increase the comfort of passengers. He later moved away to settle in nearby Bern in order to sell his inventions to the rich patricians there; a written testimony advertising his own carriages and promoting his technical successes may be seen in the city's trade handbook of 1796.Alex Capus, Himmelststurmer - Zwolf Portraits (btb, Munich, Germany, July 2010)Hans Rudolf Degen, Schweitzer Flugtechniker und Ballonpioniere - vol. 63 of the series 'Schweizer Pioniere der Wirtschaft und Technik (Verein fur wirtschaftshistorische Studien, Meilen, 1996) However, all this ended when, in March 1798, more than 30,000 French soldiers marched on the Zähringerstadt in the medieval area of the city to secure free access to the Alpine passes for Napoleon Bonaparte, and also to rob the legendary Bernese treasury to finance the campaign in Egypt. Pauly was an artillery sergeant Firearms by Roger Pauly, p. 94 in the Swiss Army, and, seeing the superiority of the light and easily mobile guns of the French over the heavy Bernese ones (which required a team of oxen), he went on to design artillery for the new Helvetian army that required just a horse or a few strong men. Whilst fighting in Massena's campaign against the Russians in 1799, he wrote a manual about the usage of firearms. Many bridges in the new Helvetic Republic had been destroyed during the invasion, and in 1801 Pauly submitted plans to the central government for an elegant arched bridge with great carrying capacity. Those plans were checked and approved, and he even received two hundred francs from the Helvetian State Treasury, but, as the new state was constantly on the brink of bankruptcy, further money never materialised, and, with little demand for new carriages either, Pauly had to look around for a new way of earning his living. Pauli's first airship (1802) For many years, he had set himself the ambitious goal of creating the world's first human-powered aircraft. The plan of an airship which Pauli drew in the spring of 1802 was in the form of a fish, with an elongated black hull, a vertical red tail fin, and two lateral fins to the left and right of the head to control it; two round, golden-rimmed eyes and a golden mouth gave the vehicle a dream-like and friendly look. Although the dignitaries of Bern became very enthusiastic about this project, there was still no money to be had from them, so after learning that General Michael Ney in France had donated fifty thousand francs from the French treasury for a similar experiment there, Pauly packed his things and moved to Paris in 1802, never to return. ===France=== Under the devout sponsorship and patronage of General Ney, he moved into a beautiful apartment in Paris; under the gallicised name of Jean Pauly, he commissioned Aime Bolle, the city's most famous balloon designer, to build an airship for him in accordance with his plans drawn up in Bern. Its maiden voyage on 22 August 1804 in the castle park of Sceaux was, from a technical point of view at least, quite successful, and a year later, on 4 November 1805, at half past three in the afternoon, the Flying Fish rose again. As Pauly told the readers of the Journal de Paris the next day, it sailed from the Tivoli Park in a moderate easterly wind at the speed of a galloping horse to the Champs-Élysées and the Place de la Concorde, where the aeronaut operated his aerial rudder and managed, according to his own words, five or six minutes against the wind to stay in place and to enjoy the thunderous applause of the onlookers. (For the planned return to Tivoli Park, he wrote that, regrettably, he had needed the muscular strength of an additional man, so the Flying Fish drifted west for another eighty kilometers, landing four and a half hours later at dusk, near the Cathedral of Chartres.) Breech-loading shotgun using self-contained cartridges, from Pauli’s 1812 French patent Whilst in Paris, Pauly had maintained contact with the weapon manufacturer of Saint-Étienne; using the title \\"Colonel Jean Samuel Pauly\\", he established a gunsmith workshop where he designed an automatic bridge and developed mercury fulminate platina. In 1808, in association with French gunsmith François Prélat, Pauly created the first fully self-contained cartridgesChemical Analysis of Firearms, Ammunition, and Gunshot Residue by James Smyth Wallace, p. 24 ; these incorporated a copper base with integrated potassium chloratePistols: an illustrated history of their impact by Jeff Kinard, p. 106 primer powder (the major innovation of Pauly), a round bullet and either brass or paper casing.https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/2410/SSHT-0011_Lo_res.pdf Unlike later cartridges, the case walls didn't provide obturation though there was one at the base, similar to the 1855 Pottet cartridge, as the cartridge was loaded through the breech and fired with a needle or a pin; this needle- activated central-fire breech-loading gun would become a major feature of firearms thereafter,A History of Firearms by W. Y. Carman, p. 121 and in 1809 Pauly employed the German Johann Nikolaus von Dreyse who would later become the inventor of the famous Dreyse rifle. The corresponding firearm was also developed by Pauly, who made an improved version which was protected by a patent on 29 September 1812, and the cartridge was further improved by the French gunsmith Casimir Lefaucheux in 1836. It is reported that Napoleon himself said of Pauly's weapons: \\"Inventions that precede their time remain untapped until general knowledge has reached the same level.\\" Simon Wälti, \\"Samuel Johann Pauli ... a misunderstood genius\\" When Paris fell to the hands of Coalition forces on 5 April 1814, von Dreyse left for Prussia, but Pauly left for London with the blueprints of his piscine airship in his luggage. ===England=== He settled in Charlotte Street in the heart of London under the anglicised name of Samuel John Pauly, and planned to continue with his flying project under the sponsorship of Durs Egg (an established businessman, personally known to King George III and the Prince of Wales); on 25 April 1815, the King granted the two Swiss men a licence to build an \\"aerostatic machine in the shape of a fish or bird\\" with the aim to have it flying within six months. Dolphin airship by Jean Samuel Pauly and Durs Egg c.1817 (from a c.1835 print) A large building (30 metres in length) with the gates opening from the floor to the roof was built near Hyde Park; this was probably the first hangar in the history of aviation. Seamstresses were hired to sew the outer fish-shaped shell of the hydrogen-filled airship in sevenfold layers from the dried intestines of 70,000 oxen; a second, spherical balloon would provide pressure equalization inside the fish. The 10 metre tailfin serving as the helm was made of silk and whalebone, as were the rudders on the left and right. As for the drive, Pauly had learned from his Paris flights that muscle power alone was not enough, so new to his plans was the lightest possible steam engineJ E Hodgson, The History Of Aeronautics In Great Britain . On 16 August 1816, the London Observer reported that the \\"Flying Dolphin\\" was almost complete and would soon begin regular air traffic to Paris, with fifteen to twenty passengers a time. The aircraft was the talk of the town and attracted crowds of onlookers who paid a guinea for the right to take a look inside the hangar and to be a spectator on the maiden flight. When Madame Tussaud's wax museum was touring Manchester, a scale model of the Flying Dolphin hung above the entrance. Egg and Pauly announced that, if the weather was calm on maiden flights, they would steer the fish-shaped balloon \\"in circles around London\\", but in strong winds they would take a different course but still return to the starting position. The ticket inviting people to take part in the demonstration of flying in London in 1817. Unfortunately, the maiden flight never took place, but the nature of the difficulties with which the aeronauts struggled is unknown. Over the defeat, these two Swiss airship pioneers came into conflictEgg v Pauly court case and their working relationship fell apart. During this time of working with Egg, Pauly had not forgotten about his revolutionary firearm design, and, while in England, Pauly took out two more patents for modifications to his gun. The first patent was granted on 4 August 1814 and covered a new design of using compressed air to move a needle into the priming compound really quickly so the heat from this would then ignite the priming compound or powder; it also covered a cannon that used a similar ignition design. The second patent was granted on 14 May 1816 and was an improvement on the first, covering the pistol and more variations of the gun; it also went into much more detail on the cannon. Pauly sank into poverty and in 1821 (or soon after), when still in his fifties, he died somewhere in the big city, and his achievements were forgotten for many years.Hans R Degen, Wege nach Utopia - Visionare der Mobilitat Schweizer Auswanderer schreiben Technikgeschichte (Verein fur wirtschaftshistoriche Studien, Zurich, 2015) Signature on two documents - court case (1817) and marriage record (1816) ==Marriage and family== Samuel John Pauly married Louisa Eliza Eleanor Atkins in St Mary's Church, Lambeth on 4 July 1816Family Search, England Marriages, 1538-1973 , and their daughter, Mary Louisa Veronica Pauly, was baptised there on 7 December 1817.Family Search, England Births and Christenings, 1538-1975 His descendants include the British Olympic cycling champion Joanna Rowsell Shand. ==Notes== Category:1766 births Category:1821 deaths Category:People from Bern-Mittelland District Category:Gunsmiths Category:Ammunition designers Category:Swiss inventors ","title":"Jean Samuel Pauly"},{"id":"20138168","text":"Swoon's Son (February 13, 1953 – 1977) is an American Hall of Fame Thoroughbred racehorse.

Its elevation is 810 feet (247 m). Glens Fork is located in a region of limestone, so the land is perforated by many sinkholes and small caves. Most of the area is a karst landscape, where there is no direct drainage into any streams, but instead the rainfall goes directly into sinkholes. There are several undeveloped caves in the area, including the Helms Caves which contained American Indian artifacts. ==History== This community has been variously known as Glens Fork, Glennsville or Glenville (not to be confused with Glenville in McLean County) and Hardscratch and was named for its location on Glens Fork of Russell Creek, which was in turn named after David Glenn, whose hunting party camped in the vicinity while securing supplies for George Rogers Clark's Illinois Campaigns. Glenn and another hunter, William Stewart, had a cabin here used to store meat for the Harrodstown settlers as early as the fall of 1777. David Glenn was one of Harrod's company of Kentucky Pioneers who founded Harrodsburg in 1774. The first deed at the Adair County courthouse dates from June 29, 1802 with the post office established on September 2, 1857 and discontinued on July 31, 1863 because of the American Civil War. The post office was re-established on October 10, 1865, and has been in continuous operation since then. The name \\"Hardscratch\\" may refer to a Civil War campsite where living was hard. On March 25, 1872, the town of Glenville was established by an act of the Kentucky General Assembly. The town boundaries were established as one-quarter of a mile in every direction from the northeast corner of the Masonic Hall, which was established as the center of town. At some point, the town government was discontinued, and Glens Fork became an unincorporated place again. ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Adair County, Kentucky Category:Unincorporated communities in Kentucky ","title":"Glens Fork, Kentucky"},{"id":"20138210","text":"Cold Norton railway station served the village of Cold Norton, Essex.

He started riding as a young farm boy and began his professional riding career in 1938, competing at tracks in his native Nebraska. He got his first win at Oaklawn Park Race Track in Hot Springs, Arkansas. In the June 18, 1955 Californian Stakes at Hollywood Park Racetrack, Dave Erb was the substitute rider for the suspended Bill Shoemaker aboard Swaps. Erb piloted the three-year-old colt to a world record time of 1:40 2/5 for a mile and a sixteenth on dirt.http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1129825/index.htm That same year, Dave Erb became the regular jockey for future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee, Swoon's Son. Ridden by Erb in all but one of his twenty-two career stakes race wins, they competed primarily at tracks in Chicago and Kentucky In 1956 Erb won the most important races of his career aboard the future Hall of Fame colt, Needles. After winning the Flamingo Stakes and the Florida Derby, Erb and Needles narrowly missed winning the American Triple Crown. They won the Kentucky Derby, finished second to Fabius in the Preakness Stakes, then won the Belmont Stakes. After retiring as a jockey in 1960, Dave Erb trained horses. In 1963, he enjoyed great success with the colt Hurry to Market who was voted American Co-Champion Two-Year-Old Colt. David Erb retired from the industry in 1988. He and wife, Lenni, settled on a small farm near Greenfield Center, New York. In 2008, Dave Erb became the 29th jockey to add his handprint and signature in cement to the \\"Gallup to Glory\\" display at the Galt House hotel in Louisville, Kentucky. Dave has a son, David. Erb was a contest on the TV game show To Tell the Truth on February 26, 1957. In September 2019, Erb, then aged 95 and suffering from dementia went missing and an alert was sent out to the general public.

Reaching peak winds of 165 mph (270 km/h), Ivan attained Category 5 strength on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, the strongest possible category, on three times in the Caribbean. It first lashed the southern coasts of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola with high waves, killing five people in the Dominican Republic and Haiti; in the latter country, two others drowned due to storm flooding. The effects in Jamaica were among the worst from a tropical cyclone in the island's recorded history. The storm caused severe damage which left 18,000 people homeless. An estimated 17 people on the island were killed by Ivan. ==Preparations== On September 8, Hurricane Ivan crossed Grenada into the eastern Caribbean Sea. It vacillated in intensity, ultimately reaching peak winds of 165 mph (270 km/h), which is a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. That day, a tropical storm watch was issued for the southern Dominican Republic from Santo Domingo to the country's border with Haiti. A hurricane watch also issued for the southern Haiti coastline, as well as for Jamaica. On September 9, a hurricane warning was issued for Jamaica and the Cayman Islands, a tropical storm warning was issued for western Haiti, and a hurricane watch was issued for southwestern Dominican Republic. Hurricane Ivan passed just south of Jamaica on September 11 and just south of the Cayman Islands on the next day. By September 11, all of western Cuba, including Isla de la Juventud, was under a hurricane warning, and Ivan passed just southwest of the western tip of Cuba on September 14. The World Health Organization and the Pan American Health Organization distributed four emergency kits to southern Haiti due to Ivan's threat, capable of covering basic needs for 10,000 people each. One flight from Port-au-Prince to Miami was canceled because of the storm, and shelters were opened in Nippes, housing 4,000 people. About 500,000 Jamaicans were told to evacuate from coastal areas. Jamaican Prime Minister P.J. Patterson declared a public emergency, saying that the nation had to \\"prepare for the worst-case scenario\\". Schools and churches were converted into shelters, and the national blood bank requested residents to donate blood, in anticipation of potential injuries. By September 10, over 1,000 individual shelters were set up throughout the country. The Jamaican Government urged off-duty corrections officers to report to work. Air Jamaica canceled all flights to and from the island, as well as inter-island flights; aircraft were transported to the United States until the storm passed. The Mennonite Central Committee designated the equivalence of US$20,000 for assisting with potential damage. Businesses in Kingston were closed, and fishermen secured their boats to trees. Workers boarded up windows, and grocery stores remained open later than normal to allow for residents to purchase supplies. Officials in the Cayman Islands coordinated the distribution of information about Ivan with the media, the Meteorological Service, and the National Hurricane Committee of the Cayman. As a result, people evacuated the territory or sought refuge in emergency shelters. Cuban media broadcast weather bulletins directly from the Cuban National Forecasting Centre. President Fidel Castro appeared in TV programming about the storm. Nationwide, 2,266,068 people evacuated due to the threat from Hurricane Ivan, about 60% of whom to the houses of relatives. The extensive preparations was credited for the zero death toll during the hurricane. ==Puerto Rico and Hispaniola== On September 8, Hurricane Ivan bypassed Puerto Rico about 300 mi (485 km) to the south. It generated high waves that washed rocks and debris ashore southern Puerto Rico near Salinas. A portion of Highway 109 was closed for 12 hours at Las Ochenta due to debris. Along the southern coast of the Dominican Republic, high waves killed four people. Strong surf also affected the southern coast of Haiti, causing damage to the port and wrecking three houses at Jacmel. High waves killed one person, while two people drowned in floodwaters after refusing to evacuate their house. Heavy storm rainfall, which reached at Les Cayes, flooded irrigation channels along the Artibonite River in Haiti. Throughout Haiti, Ivan damaged or destroyed the houses of 2,500 people, mostly on the Tiburon Peninsula. ==Jamaica== On September 11 and into the following day, the center of Ivan passed just 23 mi (37 km) south of Portland Point – the southernmost point in Jamaica. The storm turned westward before affecting the island, and an eyewall replacement cycle weakened the intensity slightly, keeping the strongest Category 4 winds offshore. On Pedro Bank, located southwest of Jamaica, an anemometer recorded winds of 133 mph (215 km/h) averaged over ten minutes, before the instrument stopped reporting. Doppler weather radar suggested winds of 112 mph (179 km/h) in Jamaica's mountainous peaks. Ivan dropped torrential rainfall across the island that damaged rain gauges in southern Jamaica. The highest total was in Ritchies, located in northwestern Clarendon Parish. Throughout Jamaica, Hurricane Ivan killed 17 people and left $575 million in damage. Hurricane-force winds affected the entire island, while heavy rainfall triggered mudslides and flooding. The storm destroyed 5,600 houses and damaged another 41,400, and most of the island's utilities were damaged. The storm was described as one of the most intense hurricanes in Jamaica's recorded history. Ivan caused severe damage, damaging and destroying houses, and triggering mudslides that washed out roads. In Kingston, the winds downed trees and poles and caused flooding. In Montego Bay, the Barnett River overflowed its banks; businesses were flooded with up to of water. Roads suffered flooding, and part of the A1 Road, the primary northern coastal highway, was washed away. Along the coast, were reported, and in Kingston, several large trees were brought down. Tiles on the Jamaica Pegasus Hotel were blown off and broken, and waves flooded a causeway to an airport near Kingston that was closed and evacuated. Due to a shift Ivan's track, the capital city of Kingston was spared from extreme damage. However, flooding in the city was deemed a \\"major catastrophe\\". Some roads throughout the region were left impassible due to downed trees and utility poles. The majority of tourism and resort areas suffered \\"mainly cosmetic damage and all structures remained primarily intact\\". In the aftermath of the storm, looters were reported roaming the streets of Jamaica's capital city, Kingston, robbing emergency workers at gunpoint.United States Department of State. U.S. Gives Jamaica $450,000 for School Equipment and Supplies. Retrieved on 2005-02-16. Overall, Ivan left 18,000 people homeless as a result of the flood waters and high winds. ==Cayman Islands== As a Category 4 hurricane, Ivan passed just 25 mi (41 km) southwest of George Town, the capital of the Cayman Islands, on September 12\\\\. Sustained winds there reached 150 mph (241 km/h), with gusts to 171 mph (276 km/h). The storm surge, in addition to waves waves, submerged nearly all of Grand Cayman, except for the extreme northeastern portion of the island. Owen Roberts International Airport and several homes were inundated by the floodwaters from the surge. Rainfall also reached on Grand Cayman. On Cayman Brac to the northeast of Grand Cayman, Ivan produced wind gusts of 67 mph (107 km/h) and of rainfall. During the storm, meteorologists from Jamaica used satellite telephones to take over issuing warnings for the Cayman Islands, after the archipelago was severely damaged. The extensive storm preparations was credited with a low death toll of two people, despite the intense winds and flooding. Damage in the territory was estimated at $3.5 billion. Despite building codes similar to southern Florida, the strong winds damaged or destroyed 95% of buildings. ==Cuba== Satellite image of Hurricane Ivan passing through the Yucatán Channel between Cuba and the Yucatán Peninsula Although the center of Ivan passed through the Yucatán Channel as a Category 5 hurricane, its core approached within 17 mi (28 km) of Cape San Antonio, the westernmost point of Cuba, which briefly experienced the edge of the eyewall. A station there recorded sustained winds of 110 mph (178 km/h), with gusts to 119 mph (192 km/h), before the instrument failed; peak gusts at the location were estimated at 168 mph (270 km/h). Winds of major hurricane-force, reaching over 115 mph (185 km/h), occurred about 10 mi (16 km) from the westernmost point in Cuba, which is where the heaviest damage occurred. Hurricane-force spread 56 mi (90 km) east of Cape San Antonio across western Pinar del Río Province, affecting the municipalities of Sandino and Mantua. Tropical storm-force winds extended 140 mi (225 km) from Cape San Antonio into Artemisa Province and Isla de la Juventud, lasting 47 hours at the latter location while the hurricane passed 110 mi (180 km) to the southwest. A storm surge washed ashore the southern coast, causing flooding along the coast and in low-lying areas. The surge first affected Granma and Santiago de Cuba provinces while Ivan was south of Jamaica. The offshore island of Cayo Largo del Sur recorded during the storm. During Ivan, rainfall reached 13.33 in (338.6 mm) in Isabel Rubio, and several areas recorded over 4 in (100 mm). Throughout Cuba, Hurricane Ivan left $1.223 billion in damage, but no deaths. The storm caused widespread damage to crops, power systems, and homes. In Santiago de Cuba in the eastern portion of the country, heavy rainfall caused landslides. In western Pinar del Río Province, Ivan's strong winds shredded the roofs of several homes. The heavy rainfall flooded houses and farms, causing mudslides that cut off two houses. ==See also== *Hurricane Allen – powerful storm that traversed the Caribbean Sea *Effects of Hurricane Dean in the Greater Antilles – effects from a similarly powerful hurricane in 2007 ==References== Lesser Antilles Ivan Ivan Ivan Ivan Ivan Ivan Category:2004 in Jamaica Ivan Ivan Greater Antilles ","title":"Effects of Hurricane Ivan in the Greater Antilles"},{"id":"20138292","text":"The structure of the Pakistan Army is based on two distinct themes: operational and administrative.

The name \\"Klahowya\\" is the standard greeting in the Chinook Jargon. ==Design and construction== Klahowya departing Golden, BC, ca 1911 Klahowya was built at Golden, BC.Klahowya 's engines came from Isabella McCormack which had been converted into a houseboat. Klahowya was built by Capt. Frank P. Armstrong (another source gives George Rury as the builder), with the capacity to carry 100 passengers. Armstrong built Klahowya in an unusual way. When the Columbia River was frozen, Armstrong built the vessel on a set of shipways constructed directly on the ice. When the boat was finished, Armstrong cut around the outline of the vessel in the ice, and the boat settled into the water. Two sources state Klahowya was built for the Columbia River Lumber Company, while another source states Klahowya was intended for the increasing tourist trade in the Golden region.Downs, Art, Paddlewheels on the Frontier -- The Story of British Columbia and Yukon Sternwheel Steamers, at 112, Superior Publishing, Seattle WA 1972 Multiple use steamboats were common, and use for lumbering would not have been necessarily inconsistent with tourist applications. ==Operations== Klahowya on Columbia River Klahowya operated on the Columbia River from Golden to Columbia Lake. The period of reported operations was brief, from 1910 to 1915. It is possible that Canada's participation in World War I starting in 1914 helped shorten Klahowya's career. A number of steamboats in other areas of inland British Columbia had been built to cater to tourism, which was badly affected by war.Turner, Robert D., Sternwheelers and Steam Tugs -- An Illustrated History of the Canadian Pacific Railway's British Columbia Lake and River Service, at 173, Sono Nis Press, Victoria, BC 1984 Mobilization of men also depressed local businesses such as lumbering, which depended upon their labor.

There is a social enterprise coffee shop where profits go to the community, and which provides a meeting place for local communities and work experience and training. The animals farmed include Dexter cattle, sheep (Whitefaced Woodland Ryeland), alpacas, goats, several breeds of pig, chickens and ducks. There are also guinea pigs and rabbits in the small animals area and two donkeys. Honey is produced from beehives kept on the farm and the moors. A Recycled Bike Project takes cycles from Meanwood Household Waste Site and donated by West Yorkshire Police, which are rebuilt by young people, teaching them mechanical skills. The final bicycles are then donates to trainees or unemployed people to aid commuting. Ten have been sent to Romania for Medicare Nurses to visit their patients. ==History== It was established in 1980 as a charity run by volunteers with £5,000 from Leeds City Council, initially with one caravan (later two) as the only accommodation, and was formally opened in July 1981 by the Lord Mayor of Leeds. By 1986 there was a hut, and in 1999, having raised half a million pounds, a timber frame building called the Epicentre was opened as a resource for the farm and the local community, with offices, education and meeting rooms. Further fundraising produced donations of a similar sum to enable expansion, with new animal buildings in 2004. ==Epicentre== The Epicentre The main building provides administrative rooms for the farm, and meeting rooms for local groups. It is an example of Walter Segal system of self-build construction which is environmentally-friendly in its use of materials and energy. It is a low-energy building using the principle of solar gain; it has a turf roof and uses a reed bed drainage treatment system. It was officially opened by the Environment Secretary, Michael Meacher and was also visited by Prince Charles in 2002. ==Recognition== It was commended by Prince Charles. Its Director, Sue Reddington, received an MBE for her work with the farm in the 2000 New Year Honours and one of its first volunteers, Robert Collins, received the same in the 2013 New Year Honours.

It is a Grade II listed building. Whilst the history of the property can be traced to the early 16th century, the house as it currently stands appears to have been developed in the early 18th century, when owned by a series of three absentee landlords all sharing the name Jeremiah Cray. The construction and design appear to show a melange of influences of the architectural styles favoured during the reigns of Charles II (1660–1685); William III and Mary II (1689–1702); and Queen Anne (1702–1714). ==Chronology16th century=== In the early 16th century, Littlecote farm was bought from John Littlecote by Sir Richard Elyot, serjeant-at-law and Attorney-General to the Queen consort, Elizabeth of York. After his death in 1522 it passed to his only son, Thomas Elyot a diplomat and author. The 50 acre farm was taken by the crown at the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and it is surmised that this was because Sir Thomas Elyot had included it in an endowment to Salisbury Cathedral. In 1560 Queen Elizabeth I granted it to William Reddiche who already owned several properties in the village as a 'Free tenant' of the Earl of Pembroke in Wilton. William Reddiche of Maiden Bradley was married to Alice Dyer, daughter of Sir James Dyer, a judge and Speaker of the House of Commons.Notes & Queries For Somerset and Dorset, Edited by Frederic William Sheafer, M.A., F.S.A., Vicar of Milton Clivdon During the Dissolution period (circa 1530s) the farm appears to have been leased by John Penny. He died in 1555 bequeathing to his son the 80 sheep, grazing rights, sown crops and farm equipment. ===17th century=== The Reddish/Reddiche family owned the estate from 1560 until 1696 but as they lived in Maiden Bradley it was inhabited by a series of lessees. These appear to include the descendants of John Penny because in 1630 a new lease was granted to a John Penny. The absentee Reddish family who owned the house and farm included Christopher Reddish (circa 1599); Edward Reddish (circa 1628); his sons William Reddish (circa 1662) and James Reddish who sold it in 1696 to Jeremiah Cray. Of Ibsley, Hampshire, Cray was another absentee landlord who owned several estates including Cray's Farm at Verwood.History of Verwood ===18th century=== Jeremiah Cray died in 1709 (or 1710) bequeathing most of his estates to either his brother Alexander or his nephew John Cray. In 1725 John Cray passed it to his own son Jeremiah who died in 1731 and whose own son, another Jeremiah Cray (the third Jeremiah) died in 1786. During the Cray ownership Reddish had been inhabited and farmed by a series of lessees including a mercer John Coombs from 1702–1706, and George Northover for over 50 years and James Lawes. In 1786 Jeremiah Cray's estates were shared by his two daughters, Sarah and Margaret, wives of Sir Alexander Grant, 7th Baronet and Percival Lewis respectively. ===19th century=== Records indicate that a large service wing extended from the east side of the Baroque wing in the early 1800s but no physical evidence exists. In 1806 the house was sold to George Young from Horton in Dorset who became the first resident owner for 246 years. It was probably during his ownership that the service wing was removed and a Drawing Room added as part of the alterations completed at his behest. Young bequeathed the property to his son George Bland Young in 1828; the coach house was probably constructed during his ownership, before 1886. It was then bequeathed to George Edgar Young in 1893. ===20th century=== The house was inhabited by Norah Young until 1918, and by Major C.A. Wells until 1929 when it was purchased by R.W. Williamson to amalgamate the 100 acres into the neighbouring Knowle farm. In 1935 Claude Williamson sold the house and its 2.5 acre gardens to Dr. Lucius Wood and his wife Clara who lived there from 1935 until 1947, running his General Practice and dentistry. Their son, the artist Christopher Wood is buried with them in the village churchyard; his headstone was carved by Eric Gill.Broad Chalke, A History of a South Wiltshire Village, its Land & People Over 2,000 years. By 'The People of the Village', 1999 Society photographer and artist Sir Cecil Beaton bought Reddish House in 1947 and transformed the interior. Beaton added rooms on the eastern side, extended the parlour southwards, and introduced many new fittings. Greta Garbo was a visitor. The upper floor had been equipped for illegal cock-fighting at the beginning of the 20th century; Beaton used the cages as wardrobes to store the costumes for his play \\"The Gainsborough Girls\\". In 1971 he added a water garden in the meadow at the front of the house with a walkway and playground, the Elysian field which still exists.An exquisite Queen Anne country house with a long and distinguished artistic heritage. Beaton also added the indoor \\"Winter Garden\\" with a glass dome roof and a small pool in the marble floor. A historic research report by Adam Architecture is less complimentary about some other changes made during his tenure: \\"Beaton removed some important historic features within the house such as original partitioning and several fireplaces, and hid elements such as timber framing\\". He remained at the house until his death in 1980 and is buried in the churchyard. The house was Grade II listed in March 1960, originally as Reddish Manor and stables; the listing was updated in December 1986. The list entry does not discuss the modifications made by Beaton and simply states that \\"it is probable that some of the interior was remodelled by Cecil Beaton\\". In 1980, Ursula Henderson bought the house from the estate of Cecil Beaton and lived there until 1987, when she moved to the neighbouring village of Bishopstone. She was born Ursula von Pannwitz and was once styled Countess of Chichester from her first marriage to John Pelham, 8th Earl of Chichester who died on active service in 1944. The house was owned and extensively renovated by musician Robert Fripp and his wife Toyah Willcox from December 1987 until July 1999. ===21st century=== Reports since that time do not specify the owners of the property, but a June 2017 architects' document states that \\"further additions and alterations were made ... most recently, in 2006.

The project explored aspects of democracy, as members of the court were to be \\"citizens\\" owning property in the model city. Elections were held, a constitution written, and two newspapers regularly published for the fictional country. Although critics have dismissed the project as nothing more than the king playing with dollhouses, others regard it as the first trial of a constitutional government in Thailand. == Creation == In the nineteenth century, miniature objects became a fad, especially in England where King Rama VI was educated. Dusit Thani was an example of the miniature object at that period. The intention of the city was to show equality of all citizens in a democratic society. Craftsmen were hired by noble families in Bangkok in order to reconstruct their houses in the miniature city. They had to register and buy land to become citizens in the city. They could freely express and participate in debating public affairs in the city. Two political groups were founded in Dusit Thani, the Blue Party and the Red Party. King Rama VI adopted the name \\"MR. Rama\\" to participate in the city. The reign of King Rama VI is considered one of the golden ages of Thai literature. He was hoping to educate his citizens about democracy and set up Dusit Thani, a democratic model city. It was difficult for Thais at that time to understand the king, who was Westernized, and his concept of democracy because it was unfamiliar and hard to comprehend. Dusit Thani was a Thai miniature city that was designed as a model city, established by King Vajiravudh or King Rama VI of Thailand. It was reported that Dusit Park was originally sited as the location of the city, which later was moved to Phraya Thai at the end of 1919. \\"Dusit Thani\\" means 'town in heaven'. \\"Dusit\\" is the name of the fourth of the six levels of Buddhist heaven and \\"Thani\\" means 'town'. King Rama VI was interested in democracy as he was the first Thai king to go to study abroad in England and to pursue the intention of his father (King Rama V) and grandfather (King Rama IV) of bringing modernization to the nation. The city was an experiment in democratic constitution which the king, himself, chose to initiate. == Construction == Dusit Park was a rice field before modernizing. The miniature model city was planned on one acre of the Dusit Park or the Royal Amporn Gardens near the present Congress building. Buildings inside Dusit Thani were scaled to one-fifteenth life size. Palaces, hotels, hospitals, a clock tower, 12-story buildings, a fire brigade, a bank, flying bridges, trade centers, canal locks, and newspapers, were represented in the city. Later, Dusit Thani was relocated to Phraya Thai where it was redeveloped. == Reception == The project was a failure. It was rejected because the country was not ready for democracy and if the city was actually built, the constitution would be used only in the city but not nationwide. The constitution of Dusit Thani was written by King Rama VI and it was administered by the Blue and the Red political groups with representatives selected by elections. In 1925, the king died, which caused a halt to the miniature city project and the city was never actually built. There were some attempts by Thai students, who were educated in Europe and had been interested in democracy and modernization, to carry on the ideal of democracy. Seven years after the king's death a revolution occurred. A new government, a constitutional monarchy, replaced 700 years of absolute monarchy. However, Dusit Thani had a different path. The model city was poorly preserved after the king's death and had never been repaired. Only a few surviving buildings were moved to the gardens of the Monk's Hospital. They were either covered by dust or ended up in trash cans. No remains are left to be seen today except for a tiny bandstand. == References == Category:Rama VI period Category:Miniature parks Category:Micronations ","title":"Dusit Thani"},{"id":"20138528","text":"Nikoly (Nikolay) Nikolaevich Rudnev (Rudniev) (1895–1944) was a Ukrainian–Uzbekistani chess master.

The cartoon was produced in Technicolor by Walt Disney Productions and released to theaters on December 21, 1945 by RKO Radio Pictures. ==Synopsis== An old sequoia tree labeled \\"Old Sequoia\\" sits in a National Park (its plaque labeled \\"Born: ????\\") and is surrounded by a fence. However, two beavers are chewing down one tree after another and getting closer to Old Sequoia. Up in a nearby ranger lookout post, Donald Duck, as Agent 13, is sleeping precariously in a chair leaning back on a loose side board that overlooks a deep lake a thousand feet below when the telephone rings. After Donald avoids falling, gets smacked by the loose board, and answers the telephone, the chief ranger (possibly Pete) scolds Donald for ignoring the phone after the first ring and warns him that his carelessness has resulted in a lot of trees getting lost in his sector, adding that \\"if Old Sequoia goes, YOU GO!\\". Just as Donald gets mad at being threatened of being fired, the chief ranger rings back and orders Donald to get to work protecting Old Sequoia. Donald manages to sight the beavers chewing on a tree nearby to Old Sequoia, grabs his double barreled shotgun, and runs down the steps of the lookout post, only to trip and fall down the steps and get hit through his hat by his gun which was dropped on the way. The beavers (sounding like Chip and Dale) are just getting to work on chewing down another tree when Donald appears and threatens them at gunpoint to get lost. One beaver tries to get away, but Donald is standing on his tail. When the beaver orders Donald to get off, Donald flatly refuses, so the beaver uses his tail to throw Donald against the tree, which makes it fall over. As the tree crashes down and Donald lands, his gun goes off, blasting out part of the trunk of another tree, making it fall over and hit Donald on the head, making a lump break through it. Meanwhile, the beavers come across Old Sequoia and, thinking they've hit the jackpot of all tree chomping, get ready to chew it down, but Donald pokes the gun in their faces. The beavers try to sneak away, but Donald uses both the barrels of the shotgun to bring them back. Just as Donald is beginning to pull the trigger to kill the beavers, the telephone in the lookout post rings. After a brief moment of panic and deadlocked decisions (if Donald doesn't answer the phone, he will lose his job, but if he does answer it, it will give the beavers a chance to get away), Donald rushes away to answer the phone. It's the chief ranger calling to make sure Donald is guarding Old Sequoia, but scolds him for answering the phone and orders him to go back to work. Later, as Donald is patrolling around Old Sequoia when he hears the beavers and chewing noises coming from inside one of the giant roots, leading Donald to conclude that the beavers are trying to chew down Old Sequoia (and avoid him at the same time) by doing it from the inside. After teasing Donald with knocks on the root, the beavers make it to the main trunk and begin chewing. Every time Donald spies sawdust coming out of a hole and plugs it, the beavers chew somewhere else, until there are holes in the trunk spitting out sawdust. Donald tries scooping the sawdust back into Old Sequoia, but one beaver catches it on his tail and flings it back on to Donald, turning him in to a giant sand duck. Having just about had it with the beavers, Donald leaves and comes back with a tractor fitted with a vacuum pipe, which sucks in the sawdust through one end and ejects the sawdust into the trunk through another end. This move, however, only ends up over-stuffing the now hollowed out part of the trunk and blows off the outside parts, exposing the beavers (coughing from the explosion) who've chewed the trunk so that now the whole tree is supported on a thin little spindle of wood. Seeing the damage he and the beavers have done, Donald races over and tries to hold up Old Sequoia, but the beavers get the idea to \\"help\\" Donald make Old Sequoia fall over. One beaver slaps his tail on the ground so hard that it shakes the leaves off a bush and shakes Donald and Old Sequoia to the point where there's no stopping it from meeting its fate. One beaver makes his tail into the shape of a megaphone and the other beaver shouts \\"Timber!\\" through it, after which, both beavers run away until they're out of sight. Knowing that Old Sequoia will surely fall over as his strength and the thin spindle are giving out, Donald quickly races away, props up Old Sequoia with long poles of wood, and covers up the handiwork with the two outside halves of the trunk (quickly noticing that the half with the plaque is upside down and turns it back right side up). Donald tells Old Sequoia that it's safe now, but the poles of wood show signs of giving out, forcing Donald to try again at keeping Old Sequoia stable. At that moment, the telephone in the lookout post rings (its sound waves pushing against one side of Old Sequoia), forcing Donald to rush back to the lookout post to answer it. It's the chief ranger calling again and asks Donald \\"How's Old Sequoia comin'?\\" Donald looks out, sees the poles of wood and outside parts of the hollowed out trunk finally give way, and Old Sequoia fall in the direction of the lookout post, which makes him reply \\"Just coming fine!\\" in an embarrassed tone of voice. As Old Sequoia falls past the lookout post, it reaches out a branch like a hand and grabs the lookout post, pulling it off its legs. After that, Old Sequoia crashes down on to a cliff, falls off over the side, and splashes down deep into the lake below. Underwater, in the ruins of the lookout post, Donald is angrily thinking about getting even with the beavers when the telephone rings. Donald swims over and answers it. It's the chief ranger ringing again, but since Donald has let Old Sequoia get lost to nature, the chief ranger angrily FIRES him. This makes Donald throw a fit and start ranting and raving, stirring up a lot of bubbles in the process, of which some them of escape through the iris out. ==Technical details== * Title:Old Sequoia * Other titles: ** :Skovens beskytter ** :Kalle Anka som skogvaktare * Voices:Clarence Nash (Donald), Billy Bletcher (Donald's boss) * Sound : Mono (RCA Photophone) * Country : * IMDb page : ==Home video== The short can be found on the \\"Walt Disney Treasures: The Chronological Donald, Volume Two\\" disc 2 and on the \\"Walt Disney's Classic Cartoon Favorites Extreme Adventure Fun\\" Volume 7. ==References== Category:Donald Duck short films Category:1945 films Category:1945 comedy films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Disney animated short films, 1940s Category:1945 animated films Category:Films directed by Jack King Category:Films produced by Walt Disney Category:Films scored by Oliver Wallace Category:American comedy films ","title":"Old Sequoia"},{"id":"20138633","text":"Kahayan River The Kahayan river, or Great Dyak, is the largest river in Central Kalimantan, a province of Indonesia in Kalimantan – the Indonesian part of the island of Borneo. The provincial capital Palangkaraya lies on the river. The main inhabitants are Dyaks, who practice slash-and-burn rice cultivation and pan for gold on the upper reaches. The lower Kayahan flows through a rich and unusual environment of peat swamp forests, which has been severely degraded by an unsuccessful program to convert a large part of the area into rice paddies, compounded by legal and illegal forestry. ==Geography== Kahayan river to the north of Palangkaraya. The river meanders through most of its length, and often shifts its bed Central Kalimantan covers 153,800 km2, with 82% tropical rain forest and no more than 3% agricultural land. The northern part of the province is mountainous, the central area has flat and fertile tropical forests and the southern area is swampy. The forests provide rattan, resin and high-quality woods. The climate is hot and humid, typically around 30° most of the year. Annual rainfall is between 2800 and 3400 mm. The Kahayan River originates in the northern mountains, then meanders for 600 km southward through the plains to the Java Sea. Tidal effects are felt 50 km – 80 km inland from the sea. A recent study found 28 species of fish throughout the river, 44 species in the Danau Sabuah lake and 12 species in the traditional fish ponds. The riparian wetlands were the main spawning areas. Fishermen are reporting declining yields due to problems with water quality.Fish Distribution and Abundance in Kahayan River, Central Kalimantan by: Andria Yosephandi Andel ==People== Orangutan attacked by Dayaks. Victorian illustration. The Dayak tribes are the dominant people in the Kahayan river region. An Austronesian people, they have preserved some of their original culture and Kaharingan religion. They speak languages of the Barito family, related to the Malagasy language spoken in Madagascar. The Kaharingan religion combines ancestor worship, animism and dynamism. It is now considered a form of Hinduism. The main Dayak tribes are the Ngaju, Ot Danum and Ma'anyan. The Ot Danum remain in the upstream regions of the Kahayan, Barito, Kapuas and Rungan rivers and preserve a traditional way of life. Many still live in longhouses and subsist through hunting, fishing and basic agriculture. Village elders practice traditional medicine and mark their status with intricate body tattoos and heavy ear adornments. The Ngaju have moved downstream, and to some extent assimilated with the mixed population of the towns further down the river, which includes Javanese, Maduranese, Batak, Toraja, Ambonese, Bugis, Palembang, Minang, Banjarese, Makassar, Papuan, Balinese, Acehnese and Chinese.Central Kalimantan – An Overview ==Peat Swamp Forest and the Mega Rice Project== Smoke from agricultural and forest fires burning on Sumatra (left) and Borneo (right) in late September and early October 2006 The lower reaches of the Kahayan river used to flow through a huge area of peat swamp forest, an unusual ecosystem that is home to many unique or rare species such as orangutans, as well as to slow-growing but valuable trees. The peat swamp forest is a dual ecosystem, with diverse tropical trees standing on a 10m – 12m deep layer of partly decayed and waterlogged plant material, which in turn covers relatively infertile soil. The peat swamp forests were being slowly cleared for small scale farming and plantations before 1997, but most of the original cover remained. In 1996 the government initiated the Mega Rice Project (MRP), which aimed to convert one million hectares of peat swamp forest to rice paddies. Between 1996 and 1998, more than 4,000 km of drainage and irrigation channels were dug, and deforestation started in part through legal and illegal forestry and in part through burning. It turned out that the channels drained the peat forests rather than irrigating them. Where the forests had often flooded up to 2m deep in the rainy season, now their surface is dry at all times of the year. The government has therefore abandoned the MRP, but the drying peat is vulnerable to fires which continue to break out on a massive scale. Peat forest destruction is causing sulphuric acid pollution of the rivers. In the rainy seasons, the canals are discharging acidic water with a high ratio of pyritic sulphate into the Kahayan river up to 150 km upstream from the river mouth. This may be a factor contributing to lower fish catches. ==Mining== People have panned for gold in the Kahayan river for centuries. Following test drilling, a consortium of Canadian and Indonesian companies announced in 1997 that in-situ gold resources were at least 3.4 million ounces. In 2002 a Canadian company with a background in community development programs proposed to develop artisanal mining in the headwaters of the Barito and Kahayan Rivers in Kalimantan, providing income for some 13,000 Dayak people at project maturity. A large number of informal prospectors are undertaking alluvial operations within the river system, and mining hard rock gold veins. Even those doing hard rock mining transport the ore to the rivers for processing. More than 2,000 illegal miners may converge on a site when there is a reported gold find. In Indonesia as a whole, nearly 180 tonnes of mercury are released to the environment annually. ==Kelompok Hutan Kahayan or Sabangau Forest== Orangutan in Bukit Lawang (Indonesia) Hutan Kahaylan () is a peat swamp forest of about 150,000 hectares between the Kastingen and Kahayan rivers that so far has suffered least from the Mega Rice Project, although it has been badly damaged. Because it is close to the regional capital Palangkaraya it is still at risk. Vulnerable bird species include the large green pigeon (Treron capellei) and possibly Storm's stork (Ciconia stormi) and lesser adjutant (Leptoptilus javanicus). The Sabangau Forest is centered on the blackwater Sabangau River. There is no longer any continuous forest cover where orangutans may cross this river. The forest has been badly damaged by legal and illegal forestry, but the western part is now protected as either National Park or National Laboratory Research Area. With a relatively small human population, there is some hope that this area of the forest may recover. The more badly damaged eastern part, between the Sabangau and the Kayahan, is still officially designated for agriculture, although no further efforts are being made to make it suitable for this purpose.Orangutantrop.com , Sabangau Forest ==References== Category:Rivers of Central Kalimantan Category:Rivers of Indonesia ","title":"Kahayan River"},{"id":"20138635","text":"Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron 115 (VAW-115), also known as the \\"Liberty Bells\\", is a United States Navy airborne early warning and control squadron that flies the E-2C Hawkeye. ==Squadron history== The squadron was originally established on 20 April 1967, flying the E-2A Hawkeye.

It is found on wave-swept intertidal shores in the Indo-West Pacific, particularly on the shores of Hawaii. ==Description== This urchin is a deep maroon colour and shaped like a domed limpet. It can grow to the size of a softball, but is usually much smaller. The upper surface is a mosaic of tiny polygonal plates formed from modified spines to form a smooth mosaic. This is fringed by a ring of large, flattened modified spines. On the underside there is another ring of smaller flattened spines and a large number of tube feet.Cook Islands Biodiversity ==Biology== This urchin is usually found on substrates fully exposed to waves and their associated abrasive effect, often in groups. It feeds on periwinkles, other urchins and coralline algae. In a test comparing shingle urchins to other species of urchin, it was found that their ability to withstand being washed away by moving water excelled. A combination of their shape, their flattened spines and particularly the strong adhesion of their tube feet made them three times as resistant as other species such as Echinometra. This enables them to live on inhospitable wave-battered shorelines.The Echinoblog ==References*Photographs of a variety of shingle urchines on MarinelifePhotography.com Category:Echinometridae Category:Animals described in 1758 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Colobocentrotus atratus"},{"id":"20138649","text":"What's Bootsy Doin'? is a 1988 album by Parliament-Funkadelic bassist Bootsy Collins.

Orbit was the team's official mascot from the 1990 through the 1999 seasons until the 2000 season, where Junction Jack was introduced as the team's mascot with the move from the Astrodome to then Enron Field. Orbit returned on November 2, 2012 at the unveiling of the Astros new look for their 2013 debut in the American League. The name Orbit pays homage to Houston's association with NASA and nickname Space City. ==History== In April 1977, the Astros introduced their first mascot, Chester Charge. At that time there was only one other mascot in major league baseball, which was the San Diego Chicken. Chester Charge was a 45-pound costume of a cartoon Texas cavalry soldier on a horse. Chester appeared on the field at the beginning of each home game, during the seventh inning stretch and then ran around the bases at the conclusion of each win. At the blast of a bugle, the scoreboard would light up and the audience would yell, “Charge!” The first Chester Charge was played by Steve Ross who was then an 18-year-old Senior High School student. Tal Smith, President and Ed Wade, General Manager Following a visit to then the AAA-Astros affiliate, the Tucson Toros in 1989, former team marketing Vice President Ted Haracz sought to bring the Toros' mascot, Tuffy to Houston to serve as the team's mascot. Although Tuffy was not promoted from Tucson, Hal Katzman, who performed as Tuffy was invited by the team to serve as Orbit for the 1990 season. The development of a team mascot for the 1990 season was viewed by the team as an important piece in its community outreach programs, specifically with children.John Sorrentino was the newly appointed Director of Community Relations. Sorrentino became instrumental in the design phase of the mascot costume as well as the design of the community outreach program. Sorrentino was able to form a partnership with the FBI and its Director, William Sessions to create a \\"Stay in School, Stay Drug Free\\" to elementary schools in the Houston area. Sorrentino archives Both the naming and design of the mascot were established from suggestion from Houston-area schoolchildren. The design for Orbit was derived from more than 10,000 children's drawings submitted to the Astros, with the final design being a composite of the various drawings submitted. The first public appearance of Orbit occurred in January 1990 at Heflin Elementary School. One of the more notable incidents involving Orbit occurred when umpire Gary Darling ejected the mascot from the game for arguing balls and strikes. In addition to his role as the Astros' mascot, Orbit made a one-time appearance as \\"Marty the Mariner Martian\\" during a \\"Turn Ahead the Clock\\" promotion at a 1998 Seattle Mariners game.http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas/080718 Orbit was replaced with Junction Jack beginning in the 2000 season, with the team's move from the Astrodome to then Enron Field. On April 13, 2010 a Facebook group called \\"Bring Back Orbit\\" was created with the hopes of having the Houston Astros organization to reinstate the mascot.https://www.facebook.com/#!/group.php?gid=114244855260867 On November 2, 2012, the Astros revealed that after a 12-year absence, Orbit returned as the mascot for the 2013 season in the American League. Orbit was an active character during the celebrations in Houston, the afternoon of November 3, 2017, after the Astros had won the World Series. He can be seen in various events within Houston and visits schools as part of a team-promoted program against bullying, as well as to promote the importance of baseball. He can be seen wearing the team's main or alternate home uniforms with the team cap or the classic 1970s home uniforms, in 2019 he wore once more the uniforms worn by him and the team in the 1990s. Beginning 2015 the Astros Twitter account has a system to determine team wins using GIFs, both of which involve Orbit. If for one to two wins a GIF of Orbit holding a variant of the Flag of Texas will be shown, for three wins or more a short GIF of his 2015 birthday streaking moment on Minute Maid Park is used in its place. In April 2019 the singular win GIF was replaced with one of Orbit waving the flag in the center of the field. ==References== Category:Major League Baseball team mascots Category:Houston Astros ","title":"Orbit (mascot)"},{"id":"20138841","text":"Loredana Boboc (born May 12, 1984, in Bucharest, Romania)Sports Reference Loredana Boboc is a retired Romanian artistic gymnast.

Farrell was a sternwheel steamer that operated on the Kootenay River in western Montana and southeastern British Columbia from 1898 to 1902. ==Design and Construction== J.D. Farrell was designed and built by Captain M.L. McCormack, who had commanded steamboats on the Mississippi, St. Croix and Red rivers. He formed the Kootenay River Navigation Company to build and operate the vessel, which he named after J.D. Farrell, a wealthy mining backer from Spokane, Washington. Farrell was equipped with electric lights and bathrooms, then considered innovations in river transport in the region. In contrast to some of the other vessels built in the region, Farrell was competently designed and constructed by skilled shipbuilders brought out from Stillwater, Minnesota.Newell, Gordon R., ed., H.W. McCurdy Marine History of the Pacific Northwest, at 22, 39, 42, 67, Superior Publishing, Seattle, WA 1966 ==Operations== J.D. Farrell was launched in November 1897 at Jennings, Montana. At that time the only competitor on this route was the Upper Columbia Navigation & Tramway Company, under Capt. Frank P. Armstrong. Construction of Farrell prompted Armstrong to hire veteran shipwright Louis Pacquet from Portland, Oregon to build a comparable vessel, the sternwheeler North Star. Captain M.L. McCormack commanded Farrell on the vessel's first trip up the Kootenay River to Fort Steele, BC. Farrell worked on the route from Jennings to Fort Steele during 1898. During 1898, Captain Armstrong and Captain McCormack combined their efforts on the upper Kootenay, with the Armstrong boats North Star and Gwendoline receiving 60% of the freight receipts, with the balance to McCormack's single boat Farrell. James D. Miller (1830–1914), one of the Northwest's most experienced steamboat captains, commanded Farrell during this time. On June 4, 1898, with Captain McCormack in command on the seventh trip, Farrell was wrecked in Jennings Canyon when hurricane-force winds blew the vessel off course into a rock.Marshall, Don, Oregon Shipwrecks, at 297, Binford and Mort, Portland, OR 1984 Farrell sank with only her bow and capstan showing above the water.Downs, Art, Paddlewheels on the Frontier – The Story of British Columbia and Yukon Sternwheel Steamers, at 108-09, Superior Publishing, Seattle WA 1972 While Farrell was later raised and repaired, and repaired, business declined sharply on the route as traffic shifted over to newly completed railways, causing Farrell to be laid up at Jennings from 1899 to 1901. In 1901 A. Guthrie & Co. bought Farrell for $6,000 to use in construction of the Great Northern Railway to Fernie, BC. In the fall of 1901, the railway construction was complete, and Farrell was laid up again. ==Fate== In 1903 Farrell was dismantled. The machinery, fittings and much of the upper works were taken by train to Newport, Washington to become part of the sternwheeler Spokane. ==NotesFurther reading== * Faber, Jim, Steamer's Wake—Voyaging down the old marine highways of Puget Sound, British Columbia, and the Columbia River, Enetai Press, Seattle, WA 1985 * Timmen, Fritz, Blow for the Landing, 75-78, 134, Caxton Printers, Caldwell, ID 1972 ==External links== * Columbia Basin Institute of Regional History * Fort Steele Heritage Town Category:Steamboats of the Kootenay River Category:Paddle steamers of British Columbia Category:Regional District of East Kootenay Category:1897 ships Category:Lincoln County, Montana ","title":"J.D.

He is the lead vocalist, guitar player and songwriter for the band MGMT, praised for (according to Interview Magazine) \\"an uncanny knack for producing pop music that sounds as if it were filtered through a kaleidoscope.\\" One of his (and MGMT cofounder Benjamin Goldwasser's) songs \\"Kids\\" (from the Oracular Spectacular album) received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals, while the duo was nominated in the Best New Artist category. ==Biography== Andrew VanWyngarden was born in Columbia, Missouri, and grew up in Memphis, Tennessee, where he attended Lausanne Collegiate School and White Station High School. His father, Bruce VanWyngarden, is the editor of the alternative newspaper Memphis Flyer. Andrew fondly remembers his childhood years in Memphis, especially fishing and camping with his dad. \\"I've always really liked nature and the ocean. My friends and I would go out with nets and make little aquariums with the creatures we'd find,\\" he said. He was active in YMCA outdoors programs, and the family frequently went canoeing, camping, and fishing. One of his first experiences with music was listening to his dad play The Who song \\"Pinball Wizard\\" on his electric guitar with a Fender Twin Reverb amp. In seventh grade, he received a Les Paul guitar and immediately started playing. That same year, he won a contest at Lausanne, playing \\"Under the Bridge\\" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. He was influenced by the music he listened to with his sister, Nirvana and Ween in particular, and often went through his parents' record collection in the attic where he found Neil Young, Bob Dylan, The Rolling Stones, etc. \\"From then on, all he ever wanted for Christmas was musical instruments; future seasons saw a drum set, a banjo, and a mandolin.\\" While in high school, he formed a band with Dan Treharne called Glitter Penis, where it was the two of them playing around on the computer \\"just making songs,\\" VanWyngarden says. They created and recorded parody songs but did not perform live. Later on, VanWyngarden was in a band called Accidental Mersh with future MGMT guitarist Hank Sullivant who would later introduce him to James Richardson, MGMT's future live guitarist. The band achieved local success and fame in and around the Memphis area, and released two albums: The self-titled Accidental Mersh and Mirror Israeli. The first album reached the #2 spot on Napster's \\"Unsigned Bands\\" chart. The band went on hiatus when most of its members went to college. Andrew invited Ben Goldwasser to play the keyboard for Mersh during the summer of 2002. The band had a weekly gig at Newby's, but the shows were sparsely attended and the band dissolved. In college, he wrote and performed a song called \\"Super Volcano\\" for a class. VanWyngarden attended and graduated in music from Wesleyan University, where he met fellow band member Ben Goldwasser in his freshman year. He said he planned to study the natural sciences of astronomy, but meeting Goldwasser changed his whole life course. He also mentioned studying entomology while in college. It was Andrew who initiated the formation of the group: \\"[Ben] wasn't really into it. I remember him saying he wanted to do some sort of social work, something noble for a good cause. I was like: 'C'mon, man! Where's your selfish ambition?'\\" Andrew (according to Q) remembered his University years as something \\"almost sickeningly idyllic: lots of doing mushrooms in the woods, not a hard graft in the library.\\"Dorian Linskey. - Q Magazine, June 2010. Coming Up. pp. 58-62 He has said in interviews that \\"Kids\\" was one of the first songs they produced together, the song is included in the band's early EP We (Don't) Care (released under the name The Management). VanWyngarden was on NMEs Cool List in 2008 at number 3, just below Jay-Z and Alice Glass. Andrew came up with the title of MGMT's 2010 album Congratulations while making Oracular Spectacular. He writes a lot of the lyrics for MGMT, he has described the process, \\"I'd sit down for a few hours and try to do them. Usually, the ideas for the lyrics have been in my head for a while, and that's how I go over them again and again.\\" His favorite song from the album is \\"Siberian Breaks.\\" In a 2010 interview, speaking of fame and its effects on him, Andrew conceded that to some extent he's turned into a kind of character he was poking fun at in the debut album. \\"I didn't realize it until now, but it's kind of funny, because the first song on our first album was 'Time to Pretend', which was about the imagined rock star scenario. So, [the song] 'It's Working' is like, \\"Yeah, we went out there and we did a lot of drugs, and it's not that great\\". Upon the release of Congratulations, he has cited his literary influences as being Leaves of Grass by Walt Whitman, The Ice Storm, The Anthology of French Poetry and authors such as Robert Anton Wilson and John Ashbery. His favorite pastime is surfing and says that in the future he would like to produce. ===Side projects=== Andrew VanWyngarden is in a project with Kevin Barnes from Of Montreal called Blikk Fang. In October 2014, it was announced that two songs would be released by Blikk Fang in Polyvinyl Records' 4 Track Singles Series for 2015. He appeared in The Heart is a Drum Machine, a documentary film about the nature of contemporary music. In 2014, he released a solo track entitled \\"I Just Knew\\" for the surfing film Spirit of Akasha. He also released a cover of \\"I'm Alive\\", a song originally by Peter Howe. VanWyngarden mentions Werner Herzog, David Lynch, and Federico Fellini as his favorite directors. ==Personal life== VanWyngarden said that he is of Dutch descent. He previously dated two models: Camille Rowe and Andreea Diaconu. He currently lives in Rockaway Beach, Queens, New York. In March 2020, VanWyngarden endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders's second presidential bid. ==References * Official MGMT band Category:Living people Category:Wesleyan University alumni Category:1983 births Category:Musicians from Columbia, Missouri Category:Guitarists from Columbia, Missouri Category:American rock musicians Category:Lausanne Collegiate School alumni Category:Musicians from Memphis, Tennessee Category:People from Queens, New York Category:American people of Dutch descent ","title":"Andrew VanWyngarden"},{"id":"20139000","text":"Al Hall may refer to: *Albert Hall (athlete) (1934–2008), American hammer thrower *Al Hall (musician) (1915–1988), American jazz bassist *Al Hall (baseball) (died 1885), 19th-century baseball player ","title":"Al Hall"},{"id":"20139008","text":"Maximilian Johannes Haas (born 7 December 1985) is a German retired professional footballer who played as a central defender or a defensive midfielder. ==Football careerEarly years / Bayern=== Born in Freising, Bavaria, Haas played four years in the Landesliga with hometown's SE Freising, before joining FC Bayern Munich II in July 2007. He did not make his debut until 29 October of the following year, when he came on as a 59th-minute substitute for Mehmet Ekici in a 3–3 away draw against SV Sandhausen, but soon became a regular in the team, initially in midfield but subsequently in defence; he scored his first goal for the reserves on 14 February 2009, in a 2–3 loss at Dynamo Dresden. In 2010, Haas was picked by FC Bayern Munich manager Louis van Gaal for the main squad, but continued to play mainly for the B-side. He appeared in pre-season friendlies with the former, most notably the Franz Beckenbauer farewell match against Real Madrid, but, not being involved in any competitive games, moved to England on 31 January 2011 and signed for Football League Championship club Middlesbrough for an undisclosed fee. ===Middlesbrough=== Haas made his debut for Boro against Queens Park Rangers, playing the last eight minutes in a 0–3 home defeat.

Leiria, signing until 30 June 2014. On 12 February 2012, Haas made his official debut for his new team, playing the full 90 minutes in a 0–4 away loss to FC Porto. He was used regularly until the end of the campaign, but eventually terminated his contract alongside several other players due to lack of payments, as the side ranked 16th and last in the Primeira Liga. On 26 June 2012, Haas signed with S.C. Braga for three years. He played his first league match the following 6 January, playing the entire 1–0 home win against Moreirense FC; his competitive debut had taken place on 16 November, in the 3–1 success at F.C.

He relocated to the United States in the mid-1980s, but returned to Jamaica in 1998, and began performing on sound systems once again.Barrow, Steve & Dalton, Peter (1999) \\"Reggae: 100 Essential CDs\\", Rough Guides, ==Albums== * On The Other Side Of Dub (1977) Studio One (reissued (1991 & 2007) Heartbeat * Barnabas In Collins Wood (aka Barnabas Collins) (1979) GG's * Rosemarie (1981) Black Joy (UK indie #29)Lazell, Barry (1997) Indie Hits 1980-1989, Cherry Red Books, * Badda Dan Dem (1982) Studio One * Hi-Yo, Silver, Away!

The headquarters is in Irvine, California. ==History== FGBMFI was founded in 1952 in Los Angeles by Demos Shakarian, a California rancher. Following a difficult start (for a year nothing happened to the original group that met weekly), then a donation of $1000 was given to start a small publication titled Full Gospel Business Men's VOICE, it grew steadily, the second chapter was in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and after a few years chapters were set up throughout the world.The Happiest People on Earth, the story of Demos Shakarian as told to John and Elizabeth Sherrill, Steward Press, Chuppaqua, New York, 10514, 1975 In 1972, the membership was 300,000.

Electronica Allah (born Timothy Elpadaro Thedford; September 19, 1976), known professionally as Jay Electronica, is an American rapper and record producer who first received widespread attention after the release of his debut mixtape, Act I: Eternal Sunshine (The Pledge), in 2007, and was signed to Jay-Z's record label Roc Nation in 2010. His debut studio album, A Written Testimony was released in 2020 and followed up by \\"Act II: The Patents of Nobility (The Turn)\\" after years of speculation and delay. ==Early life== Inspired by LL Cool J, Jay Electronica began rapping at the age of 10. He grew up in the Magnolia Projects in New Orleans and attended the all-boys parochial high school St. Augustine High School. He was a part of the famed Marching 100 band where he played multiple instruments. Electronica left New Orleans as a young adult in the late 1990s with the intention of moving to New York City but took a stop in Atlanta. Electronica was struck by \\"all the now hiring signs because of the Olympics\\", there he accepted the teachings of Elijah Muhammad via the Five-Percent Nation before moving on to becoming a registered member of the Nation of Islam at its headquarters in Chicago. ==Career== In 2007, Jay Electronica released his first mixtape, Act I: Eternal Sunshine (The Pledge), via MySpace. It was downloaded over 50,000 times. That success and his catalog led to Electronica joining the Rock the Bells Tour in 2008. Later that year, producer Just Blaze and Jay Electronica selected songs for Guitar Center's GAIN project, Fresh Cuts Vol. 3 and included a (previously unnamed) song which Just Blaze named “Exhibit A (Transformations).” Just Blaze would later (October 27, 2009) debut Exhibit C on Tony Touch's Sirius Radio program, where it quickly caught on, making its way to terrestrial radio stations like New York's Hot 97 and spawning artist remixes from MCs AZ, N.O.R.E, Saigon, Joell Ortiz and others. A bidding war ensued with Jay finally signing (November 12, 2010) with Roc Nation. Though fans and critics anticipated a full-length debut, Electronica's output in the subsequent decade consisted of several collaborations and non-album solo songs. On February 7, 2020, Jay Electronica announced via Twitter the completion of his album, A Written Testimony, which was recorded over a 40-day period. It was released on March 13, 2020. On October 5, 2020, Jay Electronica announced via Twitter that his previously unreleased album, Act II: The Patents of Nobility (The Turn), was available for streaming on Tidal after the album had surfaced online two days prior. ==Personal life== Jay Electronica and Erykah Badu were in a relationship for 5 years and have a daughter together, Mars Mekeba, born in 2009. Jay Electronica had an extramarital affair with Kate Emma Rothschild, the wife of Benjamin Goldsmith, resulting in the breakdown of Goldsmith's marriage. ==Discography== * A Written Testimony (2020) * Act II: The Patents of Nobility (The Turn) (2020) ==References * - Old official web site (2004–2005) *Jay Electronica video interview on redbullmusicacademy.com *Just Blaze, Jay Electronica, & Mike \\"Chav\\" Chavarria - An Interview with Jay, Chav, & Just Blaze *Exclaim! magazine interview with Jay Electronica-Exclaim!

Born at New Brighton and brought up also in Cheshire, where his father Charles Henry Hylton Stewart was a minor canon of Chester Cathedral. Hylton-Stewart was educated at Bath College, then went up to Peterhouse, Cambridge, with an organ scholarship. He was a right- handed lower or middle order batsman and a right-arm fast-medium bowler. He first appeared in first-class cricket in the Somerset match against the South Africans in 1912, when he replaced the injured Harry Chidgey after the game had started. Two weeks later, he made his only appearance of the 1912 season for Cambridge University, and then from mid-July appeared fairly regularly for Somerset for the rest of the season. His batting was not successful, but he had one sensational day as a bowler, taking five wickets for three runs in 14 balls against Worcestershire at Stourbridge: these remained the best bowling figures of his first-class cricket career. In 1913, Hylton-Stewart played 11 first-class matches, most of them in the second half of the season and all of them for Somerset. He took five wickets in an innings for a second time, this time five for 72 against Yorkshire at Park Avenue, Bradford. His batting improved as well, and he made his first score of more than 50, an unbeaten 72 against Sussex at Bath. The 1914 season was Hylton-Stewart's most successful as a batsman – he made 520 runs at an average of 20.80 per innings. After two matches for Cambridge in mid-season, he again played most of Somerset's matches in the second half of the year. Batting now in the middle order, he made his only first-class century, 110, made in 105 minutes out of an innings of 220, against Essex at Leyton. And late in the season, he made 91 against Worcestershire at Taunton. During the First World War Hylton-Stewart was commissioned in the British Army and served with school Officers' Training Corps (OTC), first at The Leys School and then at Haileybury. He remained with the Haileybury OTC until 1929 when he resigned his commission. Hylton-Stewart did not return to first-class cricket after the First World War but played Minor Counties cricket for Hertfordshire up to 1927. Hylton-Stewart taught at Marlborough College 1934–54 and then was Director of Music and organist at St James's Church, Piccadilly, 1954–70. He died at Marlborough. ==Note on spelling== Hylton-Stewart's surname is written without a hyphen in some non- cricketing references, regularly with a hyphen in cricketing references. Both his father and his older brother, Charles Hylton Stewart (1884–1932), who achieved fame as a composer of church music including settings for Psalms and as the organist at Rochester and Chester Cathedrals and at St George's Chapel, Windsor, are generally written without a hyphen.

At the time of sale the structure was virtually unchanged from its initial build. Dey subsequently performed renovations and minor alterations to the first floor plan to enable continued use as a private residence. Under subsequent ownership the house was placed on the National Register of Historic Placeson October 26, 1979.

The town, eager to reassert manifest destiny and rid itself of an albatross of history, quickly approved demolition.

As 'J. Jones', architect, 7 Amiens Street, North Strand, Dublin, he exhibited several watercolors at the Royal Hibernian Academy in 1828 and 1829, including his View of the Town of Youghall, showing the proposed Chain Bridge (1828) and Design for a Viaduct (1829). He studied engineering under Alexander Nimmo, and for him worked on major engineering projects in Ireland including the building of the bridge at Waterford from 1829-1832 (which he directed). He was listed as a civil engineer in Wilson's Dublin Directory for the years 1833-35 with an office address at the Commercial Buildings, Dame Street. In 1839 he was awarded a Telford Medal in silver and 20 guineas for his paper and drawings on the sewage in Westminster. In 1840 Jones ceased his engineering practice to become a sculptor in London, with considerable success, particularly in portrait busts of notables including Queen Victoria and Albert, Prince Consort. He exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1854-1862. Jones died while visiting Finglas, near Dublin, and is buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery. == References == * Irish Architectural Archive * W.G.

It was conceived in the 1860s to provide a link between the towns in its title and the London and North Western Railway port at Greenore, from where a ferry service operated to Holyhead. It was opened between Greenore and Dundalk in 1873 and extended to Newry in 1876. The company operated a hotel at Greenore. ==Ownership== The L&NWR; owned the railway and at first provided its locomotives and rolling stock, with the locomotives coming from its Crewe Works. The railway passed to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923 but an agreement was reached in 1933 for the line to be worked by the Great Northern Railway. Because the partition of Ireland placed an international frontier across the DN&G;'s Greenore – Newry line, it was not absorbed into either the Great Southern Railways in 1925 or the Ulster Transport Authority in 1948. ==Closure== The line was closed on 31 December 1951 and was dissolved in 1957 by act of consent. == Preservation == DNGR No. 1 One six-wheeled coach, DNGR No. 1 built in 1909, a composite with a coupé compartment, has been preserved at the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum, Cultra. Consideration was given to the preservation of locomotive No.1 Macrory but, in the end, no locomotives were preserved. It is believed that this was because of an ill- informed belief among those in charge of its fate that the locomotive was of a different track gauge to the rest of Ireland, due to the fact that it was built and owned by a British company, although this was not the case. All of the locomotive nameplates have been preserved. However, a GNR 2-4-2T JT class locomotive, No. 93, which worked on the DNGR line under GNR operation, has also been preserved and is displayed with the DNGR coach in Cultra. ==See also== *Locomotives of the Dundalk, Newry and Greenore Railway ==ReferencesFurther reading== * ==External links== * Dundalk, Newry and Greenore Railway history - irishrailwayana.com Category:Early British railway companies Category:Railway lines in Ireland Category:Railway lines opened in 1873 Category:Railway lines closed in 1951 Category:Irish gauge railways Category:London and North Western Railway ","title":"Dundalk, Newry and Greenore Railway"},{"id":"20139232","text":"Guy Clark is the eponymous third studio album by the Texas singer-songwriter Guy Clark, released in 1978.

It was on the single track branch line of the Wivenhoe and Brightlingsea Railway which opened in 1866 and closed in 1964. ==History== The station building was located on the southern side of Lower Park Road where the town's community centre now sits. The station and line was built by The Wivenhoe & Brightlingsea Railway company. This was incorporated in 1861 to build a line from Wivenhoe to Brightlingsea which opened on 17 April 1866. The company was a separate, but associated, company to the Tendring Hundred Railway which had built the line from Colchester to Wivenhoe. The GER soon negotiated to buy both the Tendring Hundred Railway and the Clacton-on-Sea Railway, and both became part of the GER on 1 July 1883. The Wivenhoe & Brightlingsea was absorbed by the GER on 9 June 1893.\\"Railway Magazine\\", September 1959 The station was host to a camping coach from 1936 to 1939. The line was temporarily closed on 1 February 1953 following severe flood damage but was not reopened until 7 December that year. ==Closure== The service was identified for closure the Beeching Report of 1963 and was eventually axed in 1964. This was supposedly prompted by the high costs of maintaining the railway swing bridge over Alresford Creek, which was necessary to allow boat traffic to the many sand and gravel pits in the area. The station building stayed in place for four years after the railway's closure until it was damaged by fire in 1968. The building was finally demolished in November 1969. ==Remains of railway== The former railway embankment looking towards Brightlingsea The visible relics of the railway's presence today are the Railway public house and micro-brewery, and the old embankment which is now a footpath. It is possible to walk along virtually the whole length of the former route from very near the site of the old station in Brightlingsea along the old embankment to the site of the former swing bridge. This makes for a pleasant, scenic walk alongside the River Colne with its ecologically interesting salt marsh environment. The nearest railway station is now at Alresford. ==References * Brightlingsea station on navigable 1948 O.

The cathedral seat (home of the diocese) was originally in Quincy but was moved to St. Paul's Cathedral in Peoria in 1963. In order to avoid confusion with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Peoria, the diocese retained the name of the location of its original \\"home\\" city, Quincy, where its cathedral seat was St. John's. In November 2008, a majority of the diocesan synod (or diocesan convention) voted to leave the Episcopal Church and associate with Anglican Province of the Southern Cone, a member province of the worldwide Anglican Communion, as part of the conservative Anglican realignment movement. Those parishes and parishioners who did not vote to leave the Episcopal Church remained and continued as the Diocese of Quincy. ==Anglican realignment== The diocese did not ordain women to the presbyterate, but does have two female deacons. As of 2006 it was one of three dioceses in the Episcopal Church that did not ordain women; the other two were the Diocese of San Joaquin, whose convention voted to secede from the Episcopal Church in December 2007, and the Diocese of Fort Worth, whose convention voted in November 2008 to secede. In 2006, the diocese issued a news release saying that it was \\"unwilling to accept the leadership\\" of the Presiding Bishop, Katharine Jefferts Schori, and passed resolutions asking for \\"alternative pastoral oversight\\" and withdrawing consent to be included in Province 5 of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America. On November 7, 2008, the 131st Synod of the Diocese of Quincy voted to leave the Episcopal Church and instead join the Anglican Province of the Southern Cone. As Keith Ackerman's resignation as bishop took effect on November 1, Edward den Blaauwen of Moline, Illinois was appointed to preside over the synod. The major resolutions, which both passed, were to annul the diocese's accession to the constitution and canons of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America and to join the Anglican Province of the Southern Cone. After the vote to realign passed, it was announced that Archbishop Gregory Venables of the Southern Cone diocese appointed den Blaauwen as vicar general in the absence of a sitting bishop. Also passed by the synod were: a resolution that parishes may withdraw from \\"the Synod of this Diocese\\" by a two-thirds vote within the following nine months, and clergy may transfer to other dioceses; a resolution seeking an amicable settlement regarding diocesan assets with the Episcopal Church and any congregations that might seek to remain in the Episcopal Church; a resolution that other parishes outside the geographic boundaries may join the synod of the diocese; funding for the Province of the Southern Cone and the Anglican Communion Network; support for the Common Cause Partnership; and a new diocesan canon to govern marriage, defined as being between \\"one man and one woman\\". The Episcopal Church's Presiding Bishop, Katharine Jefferts Schori, stated that \\"The Episcopal Diocese of Quincy remains, albeit with fewer members.\\" The legitimacy of other secession actions has been actively challenged by the Episcopal Church, which takes the position that dioceses and parishes may not leave without the Episcopal Church's governing bodies. As a consequence, the long-term effect of these votes is unclear, as with similar cases in the Episcopal Diocese of San Joaquin and the Episcopal Diocese of Pittsburgh; those two dioceses have each split into two factions, with each faction claiming to be the legitimate succession of the traditional diocese. Neither secession nor annulment of accession is either prohibited or provided for by the Constitution and Canons of the Episcopal Church. The Constitution and Canons of the Province of the Southern Cone allow only dioceses in the six southern nations of South America, (Quote from Section 2.) Document on Episcopal Diocese of Fort Worth (Southern Cone) website. but the Province of the Southern Cone has agreed to accept realigning dioceses \\"on an emergency and pastoral basis\\". An executive committee was elected at the cathedral on December 13, 2008, to carry out the business of the Committee to Reorganize the Diocese of Quincy, in communion with the Episcopal Church, particularly to organize a special synod of the Diocese of Quincy to elect a standing committee and other officials of the diocese.http://episcopaldioceseofquincy.ning.com/forum/topics/steering- committee-2 Keith Whitmore, assistant bishop of the Diocese of Atlanta, retired bishop of the Diocese of Eau Claire, Wisconsin, served the Diocese of Quincy, as consulting bishop, until a special synod, held at the cathedral on April 4, 2009. The synod elected John Clark Buchanan, retired Bishop of West Missouri, as provisional bishop. ==Reunification== In February 2012 representatives of the Diocese of Quincy and the Diocese of Chicago met in Peoria to discuss reunification of the two dioceses. The meetings in Peoria ended with a decision to continue talks. On April 28, 2012, leaders from both dioceses met to further discuss reunification. Participants from both dioceses agreed to meet again in August, as well as to allocate time to discuss the issue at the annual diocesan wide conventions held by both dioceses. The participants also agreed to form a joint working group to discuss some of the legal issues involved with the process. In November the Chicago diocese's convention agreed that reunification with the Quincy diocese should be pursued. On June 8, 2013, both diocesan conventions voted unanimously to reunify. The reunification was ratified by a majority of bishops and the standing committees of the Episcopal Church, and on September 1, 2013, the Diocese of Quincy merged into the Diocese of Chicago as the Peoria Deanery. ==Bishops== * 1.

Photogravure published in Camera Notes, Vol 4 No 4, 1901 Rose Clark (1852–1942) was an early 20th-century American painter and pictorial photographer. She is best known for the photographs she exhibited with Elizabeth Flint Wade under their joint names, either as \\"Rose Clark and Elizabeth Flint Wade\\" or as \\"Misses Clark and Wade\\". ==Life== Harriet Candace \\"Rose\\" Clark was born in 1852 in La Port, Indiana. She was trained as a painter and taught painting and drawing in the 1880s at Saint Margaret’s School in Buffalo, New York. One of her students was Mabel Dodge Luhan, and Clark later designed and restored Luhan’s villa in Florence, Italy. Beginning in 1890 she became active as a photographer and worked independently until 1898. Sometime in the late 1890s she met Wade, and the two began their twelve-year collaboration. About 1900 she began corresponding with Alfred Stieglitz, who encouraged and counseled her in her art. Stieglitz cited her, along with Gertrude Käsebier, Eva Watson-Schütze, and Mary Devens, as one of the ten most prominent American pictorial photographers currently working in an article in Century Magazine in 1902. Clark apparently learned some of her photographic artistry from Käsebier; later in her life she said she owed Käsebier for \\"any success she had with a camera\\". About 1920 she moved from Buffalo to New York City, where she advertised her portraits and other paintings for substantial amounts (up to $2,000 for full-length portraits). She returned to Buffalo in 1926. Clark never married and little is known about her private life. She died in Buffalo on 28 November 1942 and was buried in La Porte. Her obituary focused on her work as a painter and did not mention anything about her photography. ==Misses Clark and Wade== \\"Annetje\\", an 1898 platinum print by Clark and Wade, with both of their initials in the bottom corner. For reasons that have never been explained, Clark and Wade began exhibiting and publishing photos under their joint names beginning in 1899. For many years it was assumed that Clark was the artist who took all of the photographs and Wade was the technician who developed and printed them. Clark herself alluded to this type of arrangement in a letter to Stieglitz in 1900: “Mrs. Wade is very dilatory – and in order to get the photographs you ask for… I will have to prod her daily.” However, in a letter to Frances Benjamin Johnston that same year, Clark said “Both Miss Wade and myself have used cameras for perhaps ten years or more, but it is only two years ago that we took up portrait work as a business.” The concept of the artist/technician split in their partnership also might have come from the fact that Clark also had several solo exhibitions while Wade exhibited very little under her own name. There are, however, indications that Wade made aesthetic decisions as well as technical ones. She clearly had interest in and knowledge of aesthetics, and in several of her articles she gives advice on artistic direction. In addition, at least one article featured work under her name alone along with others under their joint names. Clark and Wade first exhibited under their joint names at shows at the Buffalo Society of Artists and the New York Camera Club in 1899. Over the next decade their photos were featured in major exhibitions around the world, including the Art Institute of Chicago, Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Photo Club de Paris, Pan-American Exposition, Corcoran Gallery of Art and the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. In 1902 Stieglitz included a print by Clark and Wade in Series 2 of the landmark portfolio American Pictorial Photography. Printed in a limited edition of 150 copies, the portfolio was intended to show only the best photography according to Stieglitz’s discerning eye. Their collaboration apparently ended around 1910. The reason for the dissolution of their joint effort is not known, although it might have been due to a change in the health of Wade, who died five years later. ==References== Category:American photographers Category:American women photographers Category:1852 births Category:1942 deaths Category:American women painters Category:19th-century American painters Category:20th-century American painters Category:19th-century American women artists Category:20th-century American women artists Category:20th-century women photographers Category:19th-century women photographers ","title":"Rose Clark"},{"id":"20139311","text":"Evanne \\"Evie\\" R Hudak (born June 10, 1951 in New York City) is a former state legislator in the Colorado State Senate, and a member of the Democratic Party.

She went to New York State University at Stony Brook and graduated with a B.A. in the Arts. Hudak was a high school and college teacher for around 20 years. She served for several years as the state director of the School Readiness Quality Improvement Program in the Colorado Department of Human Services. ==Political career== In 2000, Hudak was elected to the State Board of Education, representing the 2nd Congressional District, where she served for 8 years. ===2008 election=== Hudak had no opposition in the August Democratic primary, but faced Republican Libby Szabo in the November 2008 general election. Hudak's candidacy was endorsed by the Arvada Press, the Wheat Ridge Transcript, and the Westminster Window, while her Republican challenger was endorsed by the Denver Post. Hudak won the legislative race with 51 percent of the popular vote. ===2009 legislative session=== For the 2009 session of the Colorado General Assembly, Hudak was named to seats on the Senate Education Committee, the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the Senate Finance Committee, where she served as vice-chair. In the 2009 session, Senator Hudak sponsored an education bill that aligned the state’s three different education accountability systems, based on student longitudinal growth. She also sponsored a major bill on parent involvement in education. Another of her bills was one that clarified the governance of library districts by refining some of the language in the law and requiring the creation of maps of all library districts. For this bill, she received the Friend of Libraries Award from the Colorado Library Association. ===2010 legislative session=== Hudak served as the Vice Chair of the Senate Education Committee and a member of the Senate Finance Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee during the 2010 session. ===2012 election=== Hudak won a second term in November 2012 by a margin of 584 votes, by less than one percent (0.76%).

Hudak responded: \\"I just want to say, statistics are not on your side, even if you had had a gun. You said that you were a martial arts student, I mean person, experience in taekwondo, and yet because this individual was so large and was able to overcome you even with your skills, and chances are that if you had had a gun, then he would have been able to get than from you and possibly use it against you...\\"Parker, Ryan.

On October 4, 2013, a second effort to recall State Senator Hudak as a result of her support for gun control began. Two members of the Colorado State Legislature were recalled from office earlier in 2013. ===Resignation=== On November 27, 2013, the Denver Post announced that Hudak intended to resign her seat in the face of the recall. Hudak later held a press conference where she announced her resignation. Because she is resigning, the Democrats will be able to appoint a replacement; if she had been recalled, the Republicans could have gained a majority in the state senate. Her resignation was a recognition that the recall effort might have been successful. ==Personal life== She has been married to Edward Hudak since 1972; they have one child, daughter Genevieve, a computer scientist who graduated from the University of Colorado Boulder. Hudak is an active participant in the Business and Professional Women, the local Chamber of Commerce, and the League of Women Voters.

Koslen left the Michael Stanley Band in 1977 and formed the band Breathless the following year. Breathless consisted of Koslen, bassist Bob Benjamin, drummer Kevin Valentine, percussionist Rodney Psyka, guitarist Alan Greene and keyboardist Mark Avsec, formerly with Wild Cherry. Signed to EMI America Records, the group released their debut album Breathless, produced by Don Gehman, in July 1979. Following the album's release, Breathless toured as an opening act, including a dozen shows opening for Kiss. The single, \\"Takin' It Back\\", scratched the Billboard Hot 100 at No. 92, but the album did not chart. With support from Cleveland radio station WMMS, Breathless became a popular act locally, headlining Blossom Music Center in June 1980. The band released its second album, Nobody Leaves This Song Alive in October 1980. Again, the album received airplay in Northeast Ohio but failed to catch on nationally. Breathless disbanded in 1981, with Avsec and Valentine joining Donnie Iris' band \\"The Cruisers\\". Koslen formed another band, Jonah Koslen and the Heroes, that released the album Aces, in 1983 also the albums Orange and Agora Live but they soon broke up. After that Koslen moved to California and worked on various music projects. He briefly reunited with Michael Stanley in 1993 for the album The Ghost Poets. ==DiscographyAlbums=== ; Michael Stanley Band *1975: You Break It...You Bought It! *1976: Ladies' Choice *1977: Stagepass *1992: Right Back at Ya (1971–1983) *1997: Misery Loves Company: More of the Best 1975–1983 ; Solo *1978: Back Tracks *2008: Telling on Myself ; Breathless *1979: Breathless *1980: Nobody Leaves This Song Alive *1993: Picture This...The Best of Breathless ; Jonah Koslen and the Heroes *1983: Aces *1984: Orange * Agora Live ; The Ghost Poets *1993: The Ghost Poets ==References== * Adams, Deanna.

The Burmese hip hop scene started in the late 1980s with the rapper Myo Kyawt Myaing although songs were plain rapping music rather than typical hip hop. In late 1990s, a Yangon-based four-member crew named Acid started introducing old school hip hop in night clubs of Yangon, and became popular among Yangon's youth. Acid, widely considered to be the pioneers of Burmese hip-hop, made their debut in 2000 with Sa-Tin-Gyin (Beginning). Their success attracted other hip-hop artists and groups, now known as the \\"first generation\\" of Burmese hip-hop, like Theory (Barbu and Thxa Soe), NS (Kyaw Thu Soe and Lin Lin) and Too Big. Most of the first generation artists used old school hip-hop. Still, hip hop was new to the Burmese and not widely accepted yet by the public at large. To find wider acceptance, some first-generation artists such as Sai Sai Kham Hlaing mixed hip-hop with pop, and found commercial success. ==Second generation== After Acid's breakthrough, a group named \\"9mm\\" moved the style of Burmese hip hop to a new level. Although the group's underground music was well known to the youth, most of their songs did not pass the Burmese censor board, and the group never released an own album under 9mm. Later, because of the group's political activism, even the name 9mm was banned by the censor board. Other notable groups were Project-1,Byauk-Oh (Firecracker), Examplz,G -Family, On- track, and Cyclone. M.H.A. (Myanmar HipHop Association) was formed unofficially. Many youths joined M.H.A. and inspired to becoming hip hop artists someday. J-Me, Bigg-Y, G-Tone, Kyak Pha, YaTha,Thuta aye and others Rappers In Myanmar ==Third generation== Since late 2006, new artists like Jouk Jack, Kyaw Htut Swe claimed themselves as \\"Third generation\\". They formed a group called VIP (Rock$tar) with Ah Boy, Htein Win P Crew and Hlwan Paing.In late 2008 and early 2009, many other third generation groups released their sample albums. ==Politics== Many of the rappers had been detained or called for question by the government, especially by the military regime. Zayar Thaw served 6 years prison term until 17 May 2011 because he is the member of Generation Wave (youth anti-gov group). His group-mate, also member of GW, Yan Yan Chan released from a temporary detainment center not long ago.http://www.mizzima.com/news/inside-burma/1512-detained-hip-hop-singer-yan- yan-chan-released.html The name 9mm is banned from use in public because they distributed sample CDs of underground group MFG in one of their performance.

Elected to the Colorado State Senate as a Democrat in 2008, Newell represented Senate District 26, which encompasses southern suburbs of Denver, including Littleton, Colorado. She did not seek re-election in 2016, and her term ended in January, 2017.Ballotpedia. Retiring incumbents. Viewed: 2016-01-13. ==Biography== Born in Oregon, Newell earned a bachelor's degree from the University of California at Irvine. She holds a certification as a Senior Professional in Human Resources is a Registered Organization Development Professional, and has worked as a business consultant in the fields of human resources, corporate education and workforce development. Most recently, she served as Senior Director of Learning and Development at StarTek. She is now a contract senior consultant with EPI, a human performance consulting firm. Newell has also served on the Denver Metro Regional Workforce Development Council and the Governor's Taskforce on Workforce Development and has been a member of the National Business Executives, the Women's Professional Network, the American Society of Training and Development, the Society for Human Resource Management, and The Organizational Development Institute. Newell has also volunteered with a number of non-profit organizations, including the American Red Cross, the Special Olympics, the March of Dimes, Season for Non- Violence, Stalking Rescue, AXIS Intervention and Training Institute, and The Conflict Center, in addition to having served as an Education Foundation Chairperson for a chapter of the American Association of University Women and the Performing Arts Chair for the Lakewood Arts Council. Newell is also a single mother of two daughters, Kate and Brittany, and currently resides in Littleton, Colorado. As a single mother, Newell struggled in the past to pay down personal debt stemming from the Savings and Loan Crisis and to provide health insurance coverage for her family. Since being elected Newell has maintained an active role in her daughters' educations: Brittany is studying music performance at Arapahoe Community College and Kate is working towards her undergraduate degree in Diversity/Divinity at Regis University with plans to be an interfaith minister. ==Legislative career2008 election=== The retirement of Sen. Steve Ward, upon his campaign for Congress, left an open seat in the historically Republican district. Newell began her campaign in July 2008, and had no opposition in the August Democratic primary. Newell focused on grassroots campaigning, with supporters knocking on over 30,000 doors and making over 10,000 phone calls to prospective voters, focusing on the city of Centennial. During her campaign, Newell focused on economic and education issues and called for increased resources for victims of domestic violence. She faced Republican Rep. Lauri Clapp in the November 2008 general election. Clapp, who had been term-limited out of the state house in 2006, was criticized by Newell for missing multiple candidate forums; in mid-October, Newell called for her opponent to make a public appearance. Clapp's candidacy was endorsed by the Denver Post, but as of mid-October, Newell had also out- raised her opponent, taking in $33,000 to Clapp's $30,000. Newell's race was the closest of Colorado's legislative races. Two days after the election, Newell led Clapp by 69 votes out of 59,000 cast. With the race undecided as provisional ballots were counted, Newell attended member orientation at the state capitol, and both candidates caucused with their respective parties before the race was settled. A final count, completed two weeks after the election, gave Newell a margin of 195 votes, a margin of victory large enough to avoid an automatic recount. Newell's victory increased the Democrats' Senate majority by one seat over the previous legislative session. Looking towards representing a \\"swing\\" district, Newell began her Senate term by scheduling town hall meetings and a \\"listening tour\\" within her district. ===2009 legislative session=== For the 2009 session of the Colorado General Assembly, Newell was named to seats on the Senate Health and Human Services Committee, the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the Senate Local Government and Energy Committee. She was also appointed to the Colorado Workforce Development Council. During the 2009 session, Newell sponsored legislation recommended by the Child Welfare Action Group to require that social services case workers be trained in child welfare. ==References * Colorado State Senate Democratic Majority * Campaign website Category:Colorado state senators Category:University of California, Irvine alumni Category:Living people Category:1957 births Category:Women state legislators in Colorado Category:21st-century American politicians Category:21st-century American women politicians ","title":"Linda Newell"},{"id":"20139377","text":"The Auctioneers Act 1845 (citation 8 & 9 Vict., c.15) was an Act to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, passed during the reign of Queen Victoria on 8 August 1845, with the long title \\"An Act to impose a new duty on the licence to be taken out by all auctioneers in the United Kingdom\\".

Under the Belfast Agreement, all paramilitary groups fighting in the Troubles would decommission. Decommissioning was a defining issue in the effort to negotiate peace in Northern Ireland. ==Belfast Agreement/Good Friday Agreement== The Belfast Agreement, or Good Friday Agreement, was signed in Belfast on 10 April 1998 (Good Friday) by the British and Irish governments and endorsed by most Northern Ireland political parties. It contained provisions for a government involving both Catholics and Protestants, whose traditional aspirations, expressed as nationalism on one side and unionism on the other, had often clashed over the years. The Agreement recognised the legitimacy of both aspirations. One of the provisions of the Agreement was that the parties agree to collectively use their influence to achieve decommissioning within two years, by May 2000. ==Independent International Commission on Decommissioning== The Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD) was established to oversee the decommissioning. Its objective was to facilitate the decommissioning of firearms, ammunition and explosives. ==Decommissioning problems== Into late 2001, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) was reluctant to disarm. The IRA refused to disarm because they said that the British government had reneged on its side of the bargain, by watering down the reforms of the Royal Ulster Constabulary proposed by the Patten Commission, and by failing to pull troops out of Northern Ireland. After the original deadline for decommissioning – May 2000 – passed, the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning set 30 June 2001. That date passed as well without full disarmament.Hoge, Warren. STANDOFF ON ARMS POSES NEW THREAT TO ULSTER ACCORD The crisis hit its climax in July 2001 as David Trimble, the Ulster Unionist Party leader, resigned as first minister of the power-sharing Northern Ireland Executive in protest against the IRA failure to redeem its pledge to put its weapons \\"completely and verifiably beyond use\\" (he was later re-elected). The peace process was on the brink of collapse again after the Provisional IRA failed to convince the UK Government or the Ulster Unionists that they had made \\"sufficient progress towards decommissioning\\". ==Breakthrough== On 7 August 2001, the IRA agreed on a method of destroying its arsenal. Tony Blair, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom at the time, described the breakthrough as \\"significant\\" and \\"historic\\". General John de Chastelain of Canada, chairman of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning, said the proposals had been accepted by the panel as ones that would \\"put I.R.A. arms completely and verifiably beyond use.\\" The Ulster Unionists had said they would no longer take part in the Northern Ireland Assembly if the IRA did not begin disarming. The announcement came after meetings between the commission and a representative of the IRA.

According to the CBS Corporation, the iCast was the world's first daily network news podcast. It was available at CBSnews.com and aggregated to hundreds of other websites. == Description == The CBS News iCast launched on July 26, 2006. It was created and developed by CBS News correspondent and anchor Chris Mavridis and was intended as a daily downloadable network newscast for 18- to 34-year- olds. New York Times Arts reporter Steven McElroy wrote that the iCast \\"is the first network newscast developed specifically as a podcast\\". Access.com described the iCast as a \\"non-traditional, actuality-heavy five-minute newscast.\\" The runtime was fluid, ranging from 5–7 minutes in length. Under the direction of Mavridis, a correspondent with CBS News since 2002, the iCast was initially presented in a \\"theatre-of-the-mind\\" radio format, employing dramatic elements mixed with natural-sound audio, news interviews and current music.http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/04/29/broadcasts/main/mavridis166362.shtml?tag=mncol;lst;3 Mavridis developed the style that mimicked talking to pre-recorded interviews and newsmakers. Billboard magazine's Radio and Records described Mavridis's original iCast format as transforming \\"the traditional role of a reporter into more of an audio guide with an edge who leads the listener through a news story's chain of interrelated actualities.\\" Each show opened with the big story of the day, usually in a mock-conversation format, inserting pre-taped interviews and field reports to create the illusion of a conversation. The second segment is usually another major story of the day told in a slightly more sobering method. It is followed by \\"The World\\", which details three typically odd international news pieces, followed by the closing item, which was often an odd \\"kicker\\" story which usually involved heavy music production. == Distribution == According to the July 26, 2006 edition of Billboard magazine, the podcast was \\"made available to more than 500 CBS Radio News affiliates, as well as via the CBS Radio network and the group's own website. One day after its debut on July 26, 2008, CBS News Vice President of Radio Harvey Nagler told the New York Times that he believed Mavridis's iCast would \\"most definitely change the way (people) think of CBS Radio News.\\" == Impact on journalism == Beginning in the fall of 2006, several top journalism schools across the United States and Canada adopted the \\"iCast\\" as part of their respective curricula. Columbia School of Journalism taught an \\"iCast\\" class. Professors at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill and Jacksonville University used several editions of the \\"iCast\\" to teach classes in \\"the Future of Media\\" and \\"the Future of News Writing.\\" Toronto's Ryerson University school of Journalism, Humber College School of Journalism and Seneca College Broadcasting School also use the \\"iCast\\" as a teaching tool. According to a 2007 radio interview on Montreal station CJAD, Mavridis regularly tours some of these schools \\"lecturing on new media, grading writing projects and later imploring broadcast journalism students to drop out and enroll in dental college.\\" == End of the iCast == After Mavridis's departure from CBS News in September 2006, the iCast was hosted by various correspondents from CBS News Radio. Anchor Jim Chenevey hosted the show for several weeks, infusing music and humor into the show. Correspondent Dave Barett hosted occasionally and continued the tradition of innovative story telling through strong writing, music and use of sound. Eventually, CBS anchor and WCBS News reporter Jim Taylor assumed full-time iCast duties. The show, while still creative, began to veer towards a more traditional-sounding newscast. By the spring of 2007, the iCast was cancelled and replaced by a recording of CBS Radio's World News Roundup, anchored by Nick Young. == References == Category:Audio podcasts Category:CBS Radio Category:2006 podcast debuts ","title":"ICast"},{"id":"20139436","text":"Valkaria Airport is a public-use airport located west of the central business district of the city of Grant-Valkaria in Brevard County, Florida, United States. The airport is publicly owned. The airport was originally constructed by the U.S. Navy during World War II as Outlying Field Valkaria (OLF Valkaria), an auxiliary airfield to Naval Air Station Melbourne, now Melbourne International Airport. OLF Valkaria was closed in late 1945 and did not reopen for flight operations until 1959. During the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, the site was used as a Missile Trajectory Measurement (MISTRAM) station by the U.S. Air Force and NASA in support of launch operations at Cape Canaveral AFS and Kennedy Space Center.

She matriculated at Mariasdal High School in Tweespruit in 1979. Thereafter she obtained a BProc degree at the University of Zululand in 1983, an LLB from the North-West University in 1986, and a Diploma in Industrial Relations at Damelin College in 1988. She worked as a legal adviser to the Bophutatswana government for four years, before becoming an advocate in 1988. She worked at the North West Bar for ten years before her first appointment as an acting judge in 1999. == Judicial career == In November 1999, Nkabinde was appointed to the Bophuthatswana division of the High Court of South Africa. She served acting stints on the Labour Court, Labour Appeal Court, and, in 2005, the Supreme Court of Appeal. She also chaired the Rules Board. In 2006, Nkabinde was appointed to the Constitutional Court of South Africa by then President Thabo Mbeki to replace Arthur Chaskalson. Her appointment proved controversial, since, despite being \\"relatively obscure\\" and lacking experience in constitutional law, she was preferred to Wits law professor Cora Hoexter, who seemed the much stronger candidate. Nkabinde is known for her controversial judgments in S v Masiya, Lee v Minister of Correctional Services, and Botha v Rich, each of which has attracted severe criticism. === Hlophe controversy === In 2008, High Court judge John Hlophe allegedly approached Nkabinde and Chris Jafta to persuade them to find for President Jacob Zuma in pending litigation. The Constitutional Court laid a public complaint against Hlophe which Jafta and Nkabinde supported. Six years later, however, when the misconduct enquiry against Hlophe was pending, Jafta and Nkabinde brought a court challenge to the tribunal's jurisdiction, saying their own complaint was not legally valid. Commentators slammed Jafta and Nkabinde's \\"cowardice\\", which had brought the Constitutional Court into disrepute. The judges claimed, in response, that they were simply upholding the Constitution. The High Court dismissed the judges' application on 26 September 2014,Nkabinde and Another v Judicial Service Commission and Others [2014] ZAGPJHC 217; 2015 (1) SA 279 (GJ). but they appealed. The Supreme Court of Appeal dismissed that appeal in March 2016, criticising Jafta and Nkabinde's damaging court application and implying that the case raised questions about their \\"integrity\\". On 6 April 2016, Jafta and Nkabinde filed an appeal to the Constitutional Court – their own court – asking it to overturn the Supreme Court of Appeal's judgment. They did so partly on the basis that the SCA made \\"hurtful\\" imputations about them. All this was despite the fact, as one commentator noted, that the Constitutional Court already held in 2012 that it cannot hear appeals in the Hlophe matter and that any SCA judgment is final. == Personal life == Nkabinde is married and has four children. ==References== Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:South African women judges Category:Judges of the Constitutional Court of South Africa Category:South African women in politics Category:Constitutional court women judges ","title":"Bess Nkabinde"},{"id":"20139468","text":"Sreekumar Rajagopalan Nair (born 2 November 1978) is an Indian first class cricketer.

From 2013 to 2014 she was a commissioner of the Khayelitsha Commission and is now the inaugural director of the Bonavero Institute of Human Rights at the University of Oxford. ==Early life== O'Regan was born in Liverpool, England, into a large Catholic family of Irish immigrants. She moved to Cape Town when she was seven. Her mother was a dentist from a \\"very political household\\"; her father was a doctor who became active in poor Catholic communities and those subjected to forced removals. The upper campus of the University of Cape Town, where O'Regan studied for five years, worked as a lecturer at the start of her career, and is now an honorary professor. O'Regan studied at the University of Cape Town from 1975 to 1980, earning a BA and LLB. She was taught briefly by Arthur Chaskalson, who had recently founded the Legal Resources Centre, and ran UCT's legal aid project, working with Mahomed Navsa of the University of the Western Cape. After earning an LLM from the University of Sydney, she returned to South Africa and began her articles of clerkship at Bowman Gilfillan. She stayed on at Bowman for two years under John Brand, specialising in labour law and land rights and representing COSATU, NUM, NUMSA and the Black Sash. In 1985, O'Regan went to London to do a PhD at the London School of Economics on interdicts restraining strikes. On her return to South Africa in 1988, she worked at the Labour Law Unit and then became an associate professor at the University of Cape Town. She was a founder member of the Law, Race and Gender Research project and the Institute for Development Law at UCT; advised the African National Congress (of which she was a non-active member from 1991)JSC interview: Catherine O'Regan (3 October 1994), concourt.org.za. on land claims legislation, working with Geoff Budlender, Aninka Claassens and Derek Hanekom; and served as a trustee of the Legal Resources Centre Trust. She co-edited No Place to Rest: Forced Removals and the Law in South Africa and contributed to A Charter for Social Justice: A Contribution to the South African Bill of Rights Debate. ==Judicial career== In 1994, O'Regan was appointed to the newly formed Constitutional Court of South Africa by Nelson Mandela. Aged only 37, O'Regan's appointment was surprising even to her. She and Yvonne Mokgoro were the only female judges on the Court for its first 13 years. O'Regan's first majority judgment was S v Bulwana; S v Gwadiso, where the Court for the first time suspended an order of constitutional invalidity.S v Bhulwana, S v Gwadiso (1995) ZACC 11; 1996 (1) SA 388 (CC). In 1998, she co-authored Fedsure Life Assurance Ltd v Greater Johannesburg Transitional Metropolitan Council, the Court's founding judgment on the rule of law and legality review. The first major judgment of which she was the sole author was Premier, Mpumalanga,Premier, Province of Mpumalanga and Another v Executive Committee of the Association of Governing Bodies of State Aided Schools: Eastern Transvaal (1998) ZACC 20; 1999 (2) SA 91 (CC). still the leading authority on the doctrine of legitimate expectations (on which O'Regan also wrote in Ed-U- College, again in the context of the government's withdrawal of school subsidies).Permanent Secretary of the Department of Education of the Government of the Eastern Cape Province and Another v Ed-U-College (PE) (Section21) (2000) ZACC 23; 2001 (2) SA 1 (CC). O'Regan's judgment in Dawood v Minister of Home Affairs, delivered in 2000, established for the first time that the right to family life is constitutionally protected and that the conferral of broad discretionary powers on government officials can be unconstitutional.Dawood and Another v Minister of Home Affairs and Others; Shalabi and Another v Minister of Home Affairs and Others; Thomas and Another v Minister of Home Affairs and Others (2000) ZACC 8; 2000 (3) SA 936 (CC). But by far her most-cited contribution to administrative law is her 2004 judgment in Bato Star v Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, which sets out South African law's approach to reasonableness review and judicial deference.Bato Star Fishing (Pty) Ltd v Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism and Others (2004) ZACC 15; 2004 (4) SA 490 (CC). The courtroom of the Constitutional Court of South Africa O'Regan's judgment in ACDP v Electoral Commission, dealing with the African Christian Democratic Party's application to contest the 2006 local government elections, introduced the doctrine of substantial compliance into South African law.African Christian Democratic Party v Electoral Commission and Others (2006) ZACC 1; 2006 (3) SA 305 (CC). Her judgment in Richter v Minister of Home Affairs, also on political rights, extended the right to vote to South African citizens living abroad.Richter v The Minister for Home Affairs and Others (with the Democratic Alliance and Others Intervening, and with Afriforum and Another as Amici Curiae) (2009) ZACC 3; 2009 (3) SA 615 (CC). O'Regan wrote several judgments on labour law, in which she had specialised as an attorney and academic. She wrote two judgments - one in 1999 and one in 2007 - in the ongoing litigation between the South African National Defence Union and the South African National Defence Force, as well as NUMSA v Bader Bop,National Union of Metal Workers of South Africa and Others v Bader Bop (Pty) Ltd and Another (2002) ZACC 30; 2003 (3) SA 513 (CC). a judgment dealing with the subject of her PhD thesis: the right to strike. Her 2001 judgment on the relationship between administrative law and labour law, Fredericks v MEC for Education and Training, Eastern Cape,Fredericks and Others v MEC for Education and Training, Eastern Cape and Others (2001) ZACC 6; 2002 (2) SA 693 (CC). has effectively been overturnedChirwa v Transnet Limited and Others (2007) ZACC 23; 2008 (4) SA 367 (CC).Gcaba v Minister for Safety and Security and Others (2009) ZACC 26; 2010 (1) SA 238 (CC). \\\\- to almost unanimous disapproval by commentators. In Sidumo v Rustenburg Platinum Mines Ltd, O'Regan wrote separately to emphasise, in agreement with the majority judgment of Navsa AJ, her law-clinic colleague of thirty years earlier, that administrative law applies to labour law disputes.Sidumo and Another v Rustenburg Platinum Mines Ltd and Others (2007) ZACC 22; 2008 (2) SA 24 (CC). In the law of delict, O'Regan's contribution has been significant. In 2002, she wrote Khumalo v Holomisa,Khumalo and Others v Holomisa (2002) ZACC 12; 2002 (5) SA 401 (CC). one of the Court's first judgments on defamation law and arguably its only judgment applying the Bill of Rights directly to private parties. In 2004, she delivered the Metrorail judgment,Rail Commuters Action Group v Transnet Ltd t/a Metrorail (2004) ZACC 20; 2005 (2) SA 359 (CC). which holds that Metrorail has a duty to ensure the safety of commuters on its trains and is regarded as an \\"exemplar\\" by international commentators for its protection of the right to personal security. And in 2005, most famously, O'Regan gave judgment in K v Minister of Safety and Security, finding the state liable to compensate a plaintiff who was raped by a police officer.K v Minister of Safety and Security (2005) ZACC 8; 2005 (6) SA 419 (CC). The judgment's radical expansion of the test for vicarious liability, following Bazley v Curry and Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd, was celebrated by women's rights groups but criticised by some academics. It has been approved and applied by the Court subsequently.F v Minister of Safety and Security and Another (2011) ZACC 37; 2012 (1) SA 536 (CC). The judgment is also still cited for its approach to the development of the common law and the use of comparative law.H v Fetal Assessment Centre (2014) ZACC 34; 2015 (2) SA 193 (CC). Finally, in Steenkamp NO v Provincial Tender Board, another case on the delictual liability of public authorities, O'Regan co-wrote a dissent (with Langa CJ) that would have held the state liable for pure economic loss caused to the winner of an unlawfully awarded tender.Steenkamp NO v Provincial Tender Board of the Eastern Cape (2006) ZACC 16; 2007 (3) SA 121 (CC). In discrimination law, O'Regan co-authored Prinsloo v Van der Linde,Prinsloo v Van der Linde and Another (1997) ZACC 5; 1997 (3) SA 1012 (CC). which established the connection between the right to equality and dignity, and penned a unanimous judgment in the 2003 follow-up to Satchwell v President of the Republic of South Africa.Satchwell v President of the Republic of South Africa and Another (2003) ZACC 2; 2003 (4) SA 266 (CC). Better known are her two dissents. In Minister of Home Affairs v Fourie, she strongly criticised the majority for referring the regulation of same-sex marriage to Parliament rather than providing immediate relief.Minister of Home Affairs and Another v Fourie and Another (2005) ZACC 19; 2006 (1) SA 524 (CC). And her dissent in the earlier S v Jordan (co-authored with Sachs J) held that the criminalisation of sex work (and not its solicitation) unfairly discriminates on the basis of gender and is therefore unconstitutional.S v Jordan and Others (Sex Workers Education and Advocacy Task Force and Others as Amici Curiae) (2002) ZACC 22; 2002 (6) SA 642 (CC). O'Regan's fifteen-year term ended in October 2009. Her last judgment for the Court, Mazibuko v City of Johannesburg,Mazibuko and Others v City of Johannesburg and Others (2009) ZACC 28; 2010 (4) SA 1 (CC). on the right to water, proved highly controversial. For some, it was a perceptively restrained summation of the Court's socio- economic rights jurisprudence; for others, it was a \\"disappointing\\" and \\"profoundly conservative\\" failure by the Court to come to the aid of South Africa's poorest communities. Nevertheless, O'Regan was hailed on her retirement as a \\"stalwart\\" of the Court, \\"among its most industrious, as well as progressive, members\\". In the view of Johann Kriegler, her long-standing colleague, she was \\"the most outstanding success of the Constitutional Court\\". Edwin Cameron has said she is \\"one of the finest minds ever appointed as a judge in South Africa\\". After O'Regan retired, along with Pius Langa, Yvonne Mokgoro and Albie Sachs, these four founding members of the Court were replaced by President Jacob Zuma's first raft of senior judicial appointees. This significant change in the Court's composition was seen by some as marking the start of its decline. ===Acting DCJ=== From February to May 2008, O'Regan acted as Deputy Chief Justice in the absence of Dikgang Moseneke. It was during this period that John Hlophe allegedly approached judges Chris Jafta and Bess Nkabinde to influence their decision in litigation involving Jacob Zuma. ===Dalai Lama controversy=== In March 2009 the South African government refused a visa to the Dalai Lama to attend a peace conference. This perceived capitulation by the ruling African National Congress to pressure from China was widely condemned, including by then Minister of Health Barbara Hogan. O'Regan also spoke out, publicly agreeing with Hogan and expressing her \\"dismay\\" that \\"human rights does not seem to enter into the picture of some foreign affairs decisions that are made\\". O'Regan was heavily criticised by the government and the Black Lawyers Association, which threatened to lay a misconduct complaint against her for \\"concern[ing] herself with politics\\". ==Other positions and awards== O'Regan (centre) officially hands the Khayelitsha Commission's report to Premier Helen Zille. O'Regan is an honorary professor at the University of Cape Town and a visiting professor at the University of Oxford, and was a Hauser Global Visiting Professor at New York University. She has four honorary doctorates (from the University of KwaZulu- Natal, University of Cape Town, London School of Economics and University of South Africa), is an honorary bencher of Lincoln’s Inn and was elected an honorary foreign member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. O'Regan is an ad hoc judge of the Namibian Supreme Court. In addition, she is the president of the International Monetary Fund Administrative Tribunal and a member of the World Bank Sanctions Board. She was the inaugural chairperson, from 2008 to 2012, of the United Nations Internal Justice Council. She is on the board of several human rights NGOs, including Corruption Watch, the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution, the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law, the Equal Rights Trust and the Southern African branch of the Open Society Foundation. Since 2005, she has been closely involved with the establishment of the Southern African Legal Information Institute, a web-based law reporting system that is part of the Free Access to Law Movement. In 2013, O'Regan was appointed by Premier Helen Zille as a commissioner, with Vusi Pikoli, of the Khayelitsha Commission, tasked with investigating the alleged breakdown of policing in Khayelitsha township. The Commission released its report in August 2014. O'Regan has consistently criticised the slow pace of gender transformation in the South African judiciary. ==Personal life== O'Regan is married to advocate Alec Freund SC.

A plate from Joseph Hunter's Hallamshire, The History and Topography of the Parish of Sheffield (1819) Holland was born in a cottage in the grounds of the ancient Sheffield Manor in Yorkshire and initially trained by his father to follow him as a maker of optical instruments. However, he was a bookish young man, who taught himself Latin and soon began publishing his own poems. These eventually brought him to the notice of a local poet, James Montgomery, editor of the Sheffield Iris, who published both articles and poems of his in the paper, although commenting on the latter's \\"inaccuracies and imperfections\\" and remarking that \\"they would be twice as good if they were as short again.\\" By 1813 Holland had become a Sunday School teacher and turned his hand to composing religious poetry and hymns. Some five years later he was appointed as a secretary of the Sheffield Sunday School Union. In 1825, Holland was appointed as editor of the Sheffield Iris by a new owner, John Blackwell. In 1832, he moved to Northumberland to edit the Newcastle Courant, which Blackwell had bought, but returned to Sheffield in the new year and was elected curator of the Sheffield Literary and Philosophical Society, a position he held until his death. In 1835 he became co-editor of the Sheffield Mercury, serving until the paper was closed down by its new owner in 1848. Throughout his journalistic life, he wrote numerous works on botany, geology, local history and topography, in addition to biographies and sermons.The material here is based on The Life of John Holland of Sheffield Park: from numerous letters and other documents furnished by his nephew and executor John Holland Brammall, published in 1874. online.) ==Works== In 1819 Holland wrote a long topographical poem on Sheffield Park and sent it to Montgomery for corrections and suggestions. Previously his output had largely been anonymous or appeared under his initials; the poem now became the first book published under his name and was followed by another in 1821 on the \\"plague village\\" of Eyam. That year he also published a narrative poem, \\"The Cottage of Pella\\", in imitation of Montgomery's \\"The Wanderer of Switzerland\\". Another strong influence on him was the poet Thomas Campbell. Holland's poem \\"The Rainbow\\" (1820), published at the same time as one on the same subject by Campbell, was as frequently anthologised as the latter's.William Hudson, The Life of John Holland, London 1874, see pp.47–50 Holland then took Campbell's The Pleasures of Hope as a model for his own The Hopes of Matrimony (1822). As well as later productions, a good deal of poetry was included in some prose works, such as the serialised The Old Arm Chair (1823),Google Books his botanical work Memoirs of the Rose (1824),Available online. and his consideration of the Crucifixion, Cruciana (1836). Since he continued to write at length on all occasions, much of his work is derivative and diffuse. In 1827, Holland published a book with an unusually long title (Crispin anecdotes: comprising interesting notices of shoemakers....http://copac.jisc.ac.uk/search?title=crispin%20anecdotes&rn;=2. Retrieved 28 Apr 16 This was a compendium of many elements, including the history of shoes, the writings of shoemakers, and a survey of the manufacture, etc of shoes. In 1835 came The History and Description of Fossil Fuel, The Collieries and Coal Trade of Great Britain. Its title page further identifies him as the author of the Treatise on Manufactures in Metal, which is said to be in three volumes, as part of Dionysius Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopaedia (1830–1844). The coal trade book is an erudite, but readable, comprehensive survey of many aspects of the coal industry up to 1835, running to 478 pages. In the preface he confesses he is \\"neither a Geologist, a Collier, nor a Coal Merchant...\\", and prays for the reader's indulgence, until a more qualified author can undertake a similar survey. Despite this self-deprecation, the work is an extraordinary compendium of knowledge and information. ===Poetical works=== The Methodist (anonymously), Liverpool, 1819; Sheffield Park: a descriptive poem, Sheffield, 1820; annotated 2nd ed. 1859;Google Books The Cottage of Pella: a tale of Palestine, Sheffield, 1821; The Village of Eyam: a poem, Macclesfield, 1821; The Hopes of Matrimony, London and Sheffield, 1822; 2nd ed. 1836; Flowers from Sheffield Park: a selection of poetical pieces originally published in the Sheffield Iris, London and Sheffield, 1827; The Pleasures of Sight: a poem, Sheffield, 1829; Tyne Banks: a poetical sketch by a visitor in Newcastle, Newcastle, 1832; A Poet’s Gratulation, Sheffield, 1851; Diurnal Sonnets: 366 poetical meditations on various subjects, personal, abstract and local, comprising several founded on the more striking festivals and observances of the Christian year, Sheffield, 1852. ::::From Sheffield Park, stanzas LVII–LVIX ::::When winter evening's cheerful tales conspire ::::With the warm influence of a social fire, ::::How seldom thinks the happy midnight guest ::::Of the poor collier's brief and broken rest. ::::Where chemic nature, from sulphureous ores, ::::Her deadliest essence sublimates and stores – ::::Combines these dire arcana to prepare ::::Her noxious treasures of mephitic air, ::::Each moment hovering round the miner's lamp ::::To scorch or suffocate – the explosive damp; ::::Above his head, while threatening rocks impend, ::::Imprisoned spirits in their wombs contend: ::::He delves his dungeon vault of living coal ::::And hears the cataracts through the caverns roll, ::::Careless with every stroke, or every breath, ::::To rouse a danger or inhale a death. ::::'Tis his to know, 'midst all that pity craves, ::::The felon's task, the heritage of slaves, ::::'Doomed to the mines', to dig for others' wealth, ::::To earn subsistence, and to bury health – ::::Bear from earth's noisesome depths, with perils rife, ::::The curse, the comforts, or the bread of life. ::::This a sad proof how vainly man hath built ::::Pride's superstructure on a base of guilt; ::::Of penal judgment this the unvarying mark, ::::From far Potosi's mines to Sheffield Park. ==References== Category:1794 births Category:1872 deaths Category:Christian hymnwriters Category:English newspaper editors Category:English male journalists Category:English male poets Category:Writers from Sheffield Category:English male non-fiction writers ","title":"John Holland (poet)"},{"id":"20139526","text":"Johann van der Westhuizen (born 26 May 1952 in Windhoek, South West Africa (now Namibia) is a former judge of the Constitutional Court of South Africa.

It was originally intended to replace Fanum House as the AA's HQ, but ultimately the building was not large enough to accommodate all Basingstoke-based employees and both buildings operated concurrently. The building was purpose-built, and located at the Aldermaston Road roundabout, at the junction of the Basingstoke ring road and the A340 - it replaced The AA's main warehouse built on that site which was also known as Norfolk House. It consisted of three permanent structures, the main office block and car park, a technology centre (the Durie Centre), and the AA sports and social club (the Fanum Club)/ museum which featured squash courts and other sports facilities, with a bar on part of the first floor. There was also a security gatehouse and a petrol pump, used by AA employees to fill company vehicles. The main building was above three levels of undercover car park. There were three floors, including the entrance (ground) floor. The ground floor featured a large reception area with marble floors, an employee cafeteria, and office wings on either side accessible to employees by swiping their ID card. The offices were constructed around internal garden areas. The upper floors were accessed by a curved, floating staircase, or by lift. Each floor had a circular balcony overlooking the reception area. One side of the 2nd (top) floor was a plush executive suite, with very large glass offices for the AA Director-General and the other directors, executive washrooms, and meeting rooms. The AA boardroom with an anteroom was within this suite. The executive suite was not accessible to the majority of employees, as it required a special ID card access. There was also a dedicated executive catering facility, with its own dining rooms. These were used both by the directors on a day-to-day basis, and for entertaining guests from other motoring associations worldwide and commercial partners. After the purchase of the AA by Centrica in 1999, various Centrica functions moved into the building, and it was used jointly by Centrica, British Gas and AA employees until its closure. The executive facilities were dispensed with. After it closed, the building stood empty for some time, until it was occupied by the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly and Company and renamed Lilly House. ==AA Museum== The AA Museum featured exhibits of AA memorabilia from over the years, everything from badges and signs to petrol pumps, many photographs, and vehicles including an AA-liveried Minivan, a Land Rover and various motorcycles.

In the musical, the song is performed after Mame has lost her fortune in the Wall Street Crash of 1929, and decides she, her young nephew Patrick, and her two household servants \\"need a little Christmas now\\" to cheer them up. The original lyrics include the line, \\"But, Auntie Mame, it's one week past Thanksgiving Day now!\\" Since the time the song was written the phenomenon of Christmas creep has resulted in the normal holiday season beginning much earlier than it once did. ==Notable recordings== * Percy Faith with His Orchestra and Chorus (1966) (Christmas Is...

Applied Ludology - Art games and game art. Alibi. Volume 16, Number 28. 12–18 July 2007. The goal of the game is to cover the bullseye at the center of the screen with \\"moonjuice.\\" To do this, the player controls spaceman Jose Scriabin (named in honor of synaesthetic composer Alexander Scriabin)Blakeman, Mary Claire. \\"The Art Side of Video Games - Moondust: Music Of Your Own Making.\\" Video Games.

As Jose travels, flight patterns of he and the bullet-shaped spaceships he must avoid are created and as they pass through the trails that are created, and as the moonjuice spreads and smears, the musical score is modified according to a generative algorithm.Brownstein, Mark. \\"Computer Corner - The Year in Review: Shockwaves in the Computer Industry - Moondust.\\" Video Games.

Players start with three seeds but may acquire more if they have scored highly enough. The game has been compared to the works of Jeff Minter.Moondust . MayhemUK Commodore 64 Archive review. Retrieved 9 November 2008. The game features 4 modes: Beginner, Evasive, Freestyle, and Spinsanity. In Beginner mode, the seeds that Jose must smear remain in one position wherever they had been dropped. In Evasive mode, however, the seeds seek to evade Jose by rushing to the edge of the screen. Freestyle mode greatly increases the player’s control over Jose, removing the physical element of momentum to connect Jose's motions directly to the joystick controller's. In Spinsanity mode, the spaceships travel in a spiral pattern making smearing of the seed more difficult for the player. ==Reception== Ahoy!s review began \\"And now for something completely different. You have never seen anything like Moondust ... No mazes, no nuke the alien aggressors, no 'find ring, sit on ring'\\". The magazine, which gave the game a grade of B for graphics and A for gameplay, stated that it was \\"not for everybody\\", warning that \\"the instructions are confusing. Even the people at Creative Software didn't know what Lanier was up to\\".

It is similar to duress.

The abolition does not apply in relation to offences committed before that date.Section 177(3). ==Legislation== What had remained of the original common law defence of marital coercion at the date of abolition was contained in section 47 of the Criminal Justice Act 1925:c. 86 15 & 16 Geo. V Section 37 of the Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1945 (c.15) (N.I.) is identical to the section cited above and applies to Northern Ireland. ==Differences from duress== While the defence of marital coercion has similarities to that of duress, it has significant differences: *It must be proved that the defendant is the legal wife of the man who coerced her. A mistaken though reasonable belief that she was married will not suffice.R v Ditta, Hussain and Kara [1988] Crim. L. R. 42, CA Civil partnership does not suffice and a husband cannot claim marital coercion. *Until 2013 it was thought that the burden of proof lay on the defence to prove marital coercion on the balance of probabilities. (For duress, the burden is on the prosecution to disprove duress beyond reasonable doubt.) However, in the trial of Vicky Pryce the trial judge, Mr Justice Sweeney, ruled that the defence had only to show some evidence that the defence applied in order to require the prosecution to disprove the defence beyond reasonable doubt, as in duress cases.The GuardianThe ruling on Crimeline *Duress requires a threat to kill or cause serious harm to a person. The Court of Appeal held in R v Shortland[1996] 1 Cr. App. R. 116 that marital coercion need not involve physical force or the threat of force. (However mere loyalty to her husband does not suffice.) *Section 47 requires the husband to be present when the offence is committed. The defence of duress does not require the presence of the person who issued the threat, provided that the threat is still effective. *Duress is not a defence to attempted murder, but attempted murder is not excluded by the text of section 47 from the scope of marital coercion. *Duress is a defence to some forms of treason,Archbold 17-119 but marital coercion is not. ==Abolition== In 1977, the Law Commission recommended that the defence of marital coercion should be abolished altogether. They said that they did not consider it to be appropriate to modern conditions.The Law Commission (1977) Defences of General Application (Law Com No.83). However no action was taken until after Vicky Pryce advanced the defence of marital coercion at her 2013 trial for perverting the course of justice. She argued that she falsely accepted penalty points under the coercion of her former husband and Liberal Democrat Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Chris Huhne MP. Her use of the defence was unsuccessful, and she was unanimously convicted on 7 March 2013. In 2014, the government announced the defence would be abolished. ==Example from the 18th century== Mary Day was acquitted of theft committed in obedience to her husband at the Old Bailey on 14 January 1732. ==Outside the United Kingdom== In the United States, the defense formerly existed in most jurisdictions. It has since been abolished in several states, including those adopting or influenced by the Model Penal Code, section 2.09(3) of which expressly ends the presumption and abolishes the defense. In Ireland the case of State (DPP) v Walsh and Conneely in 1981 found that presumption of marital coercion had not survived the enactment of the 1937 Constitution and so the defence is no longer available there. By the Crimes (Amendment) Act 1924, paragraph 4 of Schedule 3 to the Crimes Act 1900 abolished the defence in New South Wales, Australia. ==Further reading== *Pace [1979] Crim LR 82 contains a discussion of the defence and arguments in favour of its retention. ==References== *Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice (2012) 17-133 Criminal Category:English criminal law Category:Coercion ","title":"Marital coercion"},{"id":"20139803","text":"Leonard Fairclough & Son Ltd was a construction firm based in Adlington, Lancashire, England.

Leonard's son, Leonard Miller Fairclough, joined the company and continued to run it during the First World War. From 1917, the company traded as Leonard Fairclough Limited. In 1927, Leonard Miller Fairclough became chairman of the company, and retained this position until he retired in 1965. Sir Leonard was succeeded by Oswald Davies, who took Fairclough from being a regional contractor to one of the most successful national contractors. Davies bought a number of well known construction businesses, including CV Buchan, Fram Group and Sir Lindsay Parkinson.Wellings, Fred: Dictionary of British Housebuilders (2006) Troubador. , Also in the 1960s, Fairclough entered the private housebuilding market (Fairclough Homes) with the acquisition of the Lancashire firm of RJ Barton and Tarrant Builders (noted for its ownership of Wentworth Golf Club).

During the 1960s the company built parts of the M6 and M62 in consortium with Alfred McAlpine. Fairclough built the bridges, and McAlpine the roads. The company, again working with Alfred McAlpine, also built the M53 Motorway from Manchester to the Wirral, also called the mid-Wirral motorway, completed in 1972. During 1972 to 1978, Fairclough built the Liverpool Link Line, partly underground and now called Merseyrail Northern Line, connecting Liverpool City Centre with Hunt's Cross and Southport to Kirkby, and the low level Central Station in Liverpool City Centre.

The company has over 2,000 employees and its headquarters are in Darlington, County Durham. Magnet was listed on the London Stock Exchange, and was once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index, but is now part of Nobia UK, a division of the Nobia group which is listed on the Swedish Stock Exchange.' The Nobia division also includes brands such as Gower and Norema. ==History Formation and early years === Magnet was established in Bingley, West Yorkshire in 1918 by Tom Duxbury. Legend has it that Duxbury traded his horse for a firelighting company and named his new company Magnet after the horse. During the 1920s Magnet pioneered the mass production of joinery, door and window products and soon began supplying joinery components for major construction projects. New operations were opened in Keighley, Grays and Knaresborough to satisfy demand for the growing business. ===1960s=== In 1960, the company opened its first branch in Bingley. This concept of the company having their own outlets quickly develops in other towns in the United Kingdom. ===1970s=== Kitchen products were introduced in 1970, and soon after, a new factory in Darlington was established to manufacture joinery and kitchen furniture. In 1975, Magnet became Britain's largest manufacturer of joinery products with 115 branches. In 1975, Magnet merges with timber group Southern- Evans to form Magnet & Southerns. The combined business, following the merger, exceeded two hundred branches. ===1980s=== Magnet logo from the 1980s In 1984, Magnet & Southerns became a founder member of the FTSE-100 share index. The company continued to expand during the 1980s, with new manufacturing sites in Rotherham, Thornton, Penrith, Burnley and Deeside opened together with the acquisition of the Thomas Easthams kitchen business. Seeing the growth of the burgeoning DIY sector, the company decided to move into the retail kitchen market, and opened its first retail kitchen showrooms in 1985.\\"Tempus: Magnet & Southerns\\". The Times. 16 January 1986 In March 1989, Magnet sold the Southern-Evans timber business in preparation for a £629m management buy out which took place the following year. Soon after, difficulties in the economy in the United Kingdom led to a severe downturn in the housing market and a significant downturn in sales. Magnet, unable to pay its bankers, fought to remain cash positive to survive. In 1989, Tom Duxbury led a management buyout of the business. The buyout failed quite quickly and the banks took control of the business. ===1990s=== Magnet logo from the 1990s In 1990, separate Retail and Trade divisions were established to maximise customer service for these very different market sectors. Factories in Easthams, Thornton, Burnley, Deeside, Gillingham and Lincoln were closed, with work transferred to Darlington and Keighley. In March 1994, Berisford acquired the companyBerisford International PLC acquires Magnet Ltd(Water Meadow Hldg) from Magnet Group PLC Alacrastore, 3 March 1994 and planned to re establish Magnet as the Number One Kitchen and Joinery company in the United Kingdom. The company's financial performance stabilised, but a lack of investment and a long running industrial dispute meant that the company did not see any significant growth. ===2000s=== In April 2001, Magnet was acquired by Nobia, a Swedish-based kitchen company for £134m. Significant investments were made in the company, with a multimillion-pound showroom refurbishment programme and the introduction of the Trade Concept, an initiative to grow the company's market share in the trade channel. To support the increased demand for Magnet products, further investment was made in the Darlington site converting the manufacturing operation into a modern assemble to order facility. ==OperationsMagnet=== Current Magnet Retail logo Magnet supplies kitchens to retail consumers via 170 showrooms. The company primarily targets the middle market, and offers a wide variety of kitchen designs together with a comprehensive range of worktops, sinks and taps, electrical appliances and kitchen accessories. Other services offered include a home survey, free CAD planning, expert installation and a post installation visit. The company's Full Circle Service process guides customers throughout the kitchen buying process from design through to installation. In 2003, Magnet's retail showroom concept won Best UK Retail Interior by Retail Interiors Magazine, and has subsequently refurbished the majority of its estate in line with this footprint. Magnet was the first national kitchen retailer to achieve Trustmark accreditation, a scheme designed to drive out the cowboys in the home improvement sector. Trustmark provides customers with a two-year guarantee on installation and payment protection. ===Magnet Trade=== Current Magnet Trade logo Magnet Trade sells only to registered trade customers through its network of 159 branches. The majority of customers are local tradesmen such as joiners, builders and kitchen fitters. Magnet Trade also supplies organisations in the RSL sector such as Local Authorities and Housing associations. Alongside a comprehensive kitchen offering (cabinets, appliances, worktops, sinks & taps), the company supplies a wide variety of joinery (Doors, Windows, Timber, Wood flooring, Hardware). Products are supplied from stock held on site in the branch warehouse. Free kitchen planning, made to measure timber window ordering and local delivery services are also offered. Magnet Trade has a separate in store environment and brand identity, to clearly differentiate it from the retail business. === Mixed sites === The majority of Magnet branches have both a trade and retail presence in the same building. There are separate entrances for each different customer group, which are clearly designated.

In addition, he served on the Legislative Council due to his role as Assistant Minority Leader in the Republican Caucus. An important piece of legislation Scheffel sponsored this year was SB12-157 which focused on the regulation of telecommunication services while also enacting the \\"Telecommunications Modernization Act of 2012\\". The bill, sponsored by a bipartisan group of legislators, sought to reduce service fees and increase broadband service to rural areas.

Senate Bill 85 successfully passed through both the House and Senate before being signed by Governor Bill Ritter (politician); however, House Bill 1068 failed to pass through the House Finance committee before being postponed indefinitely. ===2008 Election=== After incumbent Senator Tom Wiens announced in April 2008 that he would not run for a second term, Scheffel announced his candidacy for the seat; he had briefly sought the seat in 2004 before Wiens declared his candidacy.

It was named after the area in China, Nanchang, where it was found. It was about 3 ft (1 m) in length, and probably fed on fish or used its long jaws to probe for aquatic invertebrates. It resembled the ichthyosaurs in build, and may be related to them. == Anatomy == Nanchangosaurus resembled a cross between an ichthyosaur and a crocodilian. It had a fusiform body, similar to a dolphin or an ichthyosaur, paddle-like limbs, with forelimbs being larger than hindlimbs, and a crocodilian-like tail for swimming through the water. It had bony scutes on its back, like an alligator, but had a long snout filled with teeth, like an ichthyosaur or a river dolphin. == Classification == Referred specimen Nanchangosaurus is a member of the Hupehsuchia, a group that includes the very similar Hupehsuchus. In fact, the two may be congeneric. A few differences between the two species are seen. Hupehsuchus had heavier armor and more divided ridge spines than the two. Other than Hupehsuchus, little else is known about Nanchangosaurus relatives. They have sometimes been referred to as ancestors of the ichthyosaurs, because of their streamlined shape, long jaws, and paddle-like hands, as well as the discovery of polydactyly in the fins of Hupehsuchus, just like the ichthyosaurs.

Mileposts along WYO 110 increase from east to west. The entrance road is a long, two- lane, asphalt paved road that spans the distance between the Entrance Station and the visitor parking area located just west of Devil's Tower. The road provides access to the monument's primary developed areas, such as headquarters and visitor center. ==History== The road was originally constructed in 1917 with an eight percent grade and a ford at the Belle Fourche River. A bridge was built in 1928, and the road was extensively altered in the 1930s with labor from the Civilian Conservation Corps, improving grades and alignments. CCC camp NM-1 remained at Devil's Tower from 1935 to 1938. A complete loop was planned by the National Park Service Engineering Division in 1927, but was never carried out. The entrance road at Devils Tower is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as an example of close integration with the natural surroundings.

In 2018, Levitsky published How Democracies Die with fellow Harvard professor Daniel Ziblatt. The book examines the conditions that can lead democracies to break down from within, rather than due to external events such as military coups or foreign invasions. How Democracies Die received widespread praise. It spent a number of weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list and six weeks on the non- fiction bestseller list of the German weekly Der Spiegel. The book was recognized as one of the best nonfiction books of 2018 by the Washington Post, Time, and Foreign Affairs. Levitsky and Ziblatt have also co-authored numerous opinion articles on American democracy in the New York Times. Levitsky is also an expert on the Nicaraguan revolution. ==Personal life== He is married to Liz Mineo, a Peruvian journalist graduated from National University of San Marcos and Columbia University, who currently works at The Harvard Gazette.

In a society that valued women’s silence, their predominance in the most public of Athenian art-forms constitutes a paradox. Only one of the surviving 32 plays has no female characters: Sophocles' Philoctetes. Female tragic choruses also outnumber the male choruses by twenty-one to ten.Easterling, P. E. (Ed.). (1997). Cambridge companion to Greek tragedy. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. ==Cultural stereotype== Macaria, in the Heracleidae states that \\"for a woman, silence and self control are best.\\" The philosopher Xenophon thought females possessed the positive traits of 'vigilance' and 'love for infants'. However Xenophon reflects the Greek fear of these 'others', highlighting their irrationality, religious fervour and sexual passion.Bushnell, R. W. (Ed.). (2005). A companion to tragedy. Wiley-Blackwell. Aristotle went further, stating that women were deformed, incomplete males, designed to be subservient to men.http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0009%3Achapter%3D15%3Asection%3D14 As a result, women had their freedom restricted and were believed to have lived in separate areas to men. In a speech recorded in the Lysias Orations 3.6, a speaker seeks to convey his opponent’s licentiousness by telling how he trespassed into \\"the women’s rooms where my sister and my nieces were – women who have always lived so decently that they are ashamed to be seen even by relatives.\\" Sheila Murnaghan argues that \\"it is no accident that what little evidence we do have for actual Athenian women comes largely from courtroom speeches or medical treatises, genres brought into being by conflict and disease.\\" In Ancient Greece, a woman was viewed as a passive conduit of male fertility, on long term loan by her father.Blondell, R., et al. (Ed.). (1999). Women on the edge: four plays by Euripides. New York, NY: Routledge. Marriage was an unequal relationship, whereby the husband owned the children and didn’t have the same obligation toward sexual fidelity that the wife had. The playwright Euripides presents two very different reactions to this cultural norm. Firstly, his female protagonist Alcestis, represents the \\"perfect wife\\" sacrificing her own life, so her husband, Admetos, can live. Yet as Blondell points out this \\"female fame is hard won, even oxymoronic\\" as her own marriage kills her. The most important relationships within this play are between the men. Heracles goes to the underworld not for Alcestis, but to honour his male friend’s hospitality. Admetos goes against the promise he made to his wife, so as to obey his male friendship. \\"Alcestis drops out,\\" Easterling argues, \\"to facilitate the interaction between the men.\\" In contrast, however, Euripides Medea breaks the marital conventions, choosing her husband herself and reacting against his infidelity by breaking the female oath and killing her children. \\"In a sense,\\" Blondell argues, \\"every bride was a stranger in a strange land. And every married woman was dependent on her husband.\\" ==Theatrical themesThe problem of male absence=== In the surviving plays, women become tragic figures by men’s absence or mismanagement. Sophocles' Antigone takes action after her uncle Creon refuses to bury her brother Polynices. In Aeschylus' Oresteia, Clytemnestra takes power in Argos because her husband Agamemnon has been away fighting at Troy for ten years. Clytemnestra's later murder of him is motivated by a range of male abuses. Medea becomes the aggressor when her husband Jason plans a new more advantageous marriage. ===The public versus the private=== There is also a theme running through the plays based on the setting. Performed in open-air theatres, Classical Athenian tragedy was set outside the private sphere of the home. Indeed, Euripides was notorious for \\"taking the streets, the bedroom, into tragedy\\" and thereby reducing its remoteness.McLeish, K., et al. (Trans.). (2005). Greek tragedy. London: Nick Hern. In Hippolytus, Phaedra first appears, carried out of the house by her servants, demanding open air, in order to declare her love for her stepson and thus the spiral of tragedy to unwind. In Aeschylus' Oresteia, Clytemnestra in the first play of the trilogy orders her husband's death outside, while in the second play, her son Orestes forces her into the house to be killed. It is only in the third play, which is in an entirely public space of the court of Areopagus, that order is restored. \\"This three play sequence,\\" Bushnell argues, \\"which begins when a self-willed woman takes matters into her own hands, finally achieves closure as figures representing women are removed from view.' ===The female warrior=== A woman displaying traits of the heroic Grecian male was not portrayed in a positive light. Euripides' Medea is the prime example. Her name in Greek means \\"cunning\\" and is also the word for the Persians (the Greek’s greatest foreign enemy). Most of the time, a woman is full of fear Too weak to defend herself or to bear the sight of steel But if she happens to be wronged in love, Hers is the bloodthirstiest heart of all. Ruby Blondell argues that Medea displays stereotypically male attributes that the Greeks held as positive. Possessing courage, intelligence, decisiveness, resourcefulness, power, independence, the ability to conceive and carry out a plan effectively, as well as the art of rhetoric. The nurse even likens her to a rock of the sea, as Patroclus famously does to Homer’s Achilles in the epic poem The Iliad. Yet Medea, similarly to Aeschylus’ Clytemnestra, another \\"woman with a heart of manly counsel\\" were not admired but portrayed as \\"Cruella de Vil\\" type characters; Medea having murdered the King of the Corinthians, his daughter (Jason's new bride) and her two sons for the purpose of taking revenge on Jason. So the declaration \\"that a noble man ought either to live with honour, or die with honour\\" does not apply to women. ==Public reaction== In Plato’s Republic, Socrates thought the impersonation of inferiors, such as women and slaves, that drama utilised was morally harmful. Socrates was also worried \\"about the ethical damage caused by the representation of 'womanish' emotions in tragedy.\\" Plato unsurprisingly excludes poetry, embodied by the figure of a woman, from his ideal city-state. The Athenians however thought it important to place on \\"display those feature[s] of human experience that inspire terror, sorrow and rejection, and they accomplished their mission by giving women visibility and a powerful voice.\\" ==See also== *Women in Classical Athens ==References== Women Athenian ","title":"Representation of women in Athenian tragedy"},{"id":"20140102","text":"Hiran Spagnol, commonly known simply as Hiran (born October 29, 1971), is a retired Brazilian professional football goalkeeper, who played for several Campeonato Brasileiro Série A clubs. ==Career== Born on October 29, 1971 in Linhares, Espírito Santo, Hiran started playing professionally in 1993, defending Linhares, winning that season's Campeonato Capixaba.

In 2007, they released an interactive board game based upon the album. 2008 saw Lee leave to play violin with The Hylozoists. The now four-piece rejoined Contreras to record and release their second album, Oh No, It's Love. Featuring songwriting and lead vocals by all four members, the album spent six weeks at No. 1 on the Canadian campus radio chart. Spin magazine noted the band in their February 2008 issue in their City Guide to Toronto, claiming \\"If Wes Anderson ever cottoned on to (The Bicycles) swooning chamber pop, which draws from the Kinks and the Beach Boys, he'd soak his scarf with tears of joy.\\" In March 2009, the band announced an indefinite hiatus. After playing a few unannounced shows in early 2012, the band reformed with the full original line-up and played a selection of new material to critical acclaim. The band released their latest album, Stop Thinking So Much in April 2013. ==Discography== *2000: As Is (EP) *2006: The Good The Bad and The Cuddly *2008: Oh No, It's Love *2013: Stop Thinking So Much ==Videography== *2007: The Good The Bad and The Cuddly: The Interactive DVD Board Game ==See also== *Canadian rock *List of bands from Canada ==References *Official website *The Bicycles' Facebook Page Category:Musical groups established in 2001 Category:Musical groups from Toronto Category:Canadian indie pop groups Category:Bubblegum pop Category:2001 establishments in Ontario ","title":"The Bicycles"},{"id":"20140117","text":"HDDerase is a freeware utility that securely erases data on hard drives using the Secure Erase unit command built into the firmware of Parallel ATA and Serial ATA drives manufactured after 2001.http://www.zdnet.com/blog/storage/how-to-really-erase-a-hard-drive- update/148 HDDerase was developed by the Center for Magnetic Recording Research at the University of California, San Diego.

At first, ARAS's main purpose was to suppress organized crime and the bandit groups that were freely operating in Lithuania. In addition, they handled riot suppression, peace keeping, and escort. In December 2004 the unit was admitted into the ATLAS Network of special counter-terrorist police units of the European Union countries. ==Structure== ARAS consists of a: * Command, * Special Team, * Explosive Search and Neutralization Division, * Information, analysis and negotiation Division, * 3 companies, one of them located in Klaipėda. The unit also has specialized reconnaissance, negotiation, sniper, climber and diver groups that are necessary to carry out the main functions ascribed to the unit. ==Functions== The main functions of ARAS are to: * organize, manage and implement special antiterrorist operations inside Lithuania; * rescue hostages and detain dangerous armed criminals under extreme or high danger circumstances; * search for and neutralize improvised explosive devices and military explosives, used for terrorist or criminal purposes; * under their competence participate while performing various operative actions, detaining persons, suspected to have performed or planning to commit a crime; * collect and analyze information related to terrorist threats, cooperate with professional institutions of other countries in this sphere; * participate in organizing and implementing plans and programs for antiterrorist measures, and other legal acts establishing terrorism prevention. ==Equipment and training== ARAS is provided with modern arms and equipment for successful work. There are modern weapons with special sights, night vision equipment, thermo visors, equipment for explosives search, modern equipment for divers, special armour- plated vests, shields and helmets among them. Nevertheless, all weapons are worthless without competent people. Currently the nucleus of the unit is made up of highly qualified combatants, who have acquired physical and psychological training and are prepared for working under extreme circumstances. Much experience was gained when the officers participated in several courses for special unit response to critical situations organized by the US State Department, which were included in the international program for the war against terrorism. During these exercises they showed good preparation, and received a high evaluation from the organizers of the courses. Officers from the unit participated in many other courses organized not only in the US, but also by law enforcement institutions of other countries. ==Equipment== ARAS operators use modern western oriented equipment from countries such as Germany, Switzerland, Austria, France, Italy, UK and the USA. Most of their weapons and equipment is German. ==Training== Candidates are selected on the basis of \\"Delta Force\\" program criteria. Candidates have their biography's thoroughly checked, the age requirement is not younger than 18 and no older than 30 years, priority is given to non- smokers, 5 years of work experience in any other police branch would be advantage. Those who make it through this barrier have to grapple with the psychological and intelligence tests and have to pass the physical preparation check, especially endurance and emotional stability. Only 2-3 men a year make the cut into this elite group. ==References== * Official website * Lithuanian police website Category:1991 establishments in Lithuania Category:Specialist law enforcement agencies of Lithuania Category:Non-military counter-terrorist organizations Category:ATLAS Network ","title":"ARAS (Lithuania)"},{"id":"20140125","text":"Red - Sulkovian speaking villages The Sulkovian dialect (Silesian: sulkowski djalekt; ) is one of the Silesian dialects, extracted by Feliks Steuer in his work Dialekt sułkowski (1934).http://slunskoeka.pyrsk.com/gysichta.html#33.http://zso1.eu/?p=historia/dyrektorzy#fs It is a part of the Silesian-Lach border dialects; its name derives from Steuer's native village Sulków.

Patellar subluxation is more common than patellar dislocation and is just as disabling.Dr. Ellison, A. E., M.D. et al. 1985. Athletic Training and Sports Medicine. New York: American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons. First edition; second printing. . In this condition, the patella repetitively subluxates and places strain on the medial restraints and excessive stress/tension on the patellofemoral joint. Patellar subluxation can be caused by osseous abnormalities, such as incorrect articulation of the femoral groove with the patella, trochlear dysplasia, or patella alta, which is a distance of greater than 20 mm between the tibial tubercle and the trochlear groove. It can also result from soft-tissue abnormalities, such as a torn medial patellofemoral ligament, or a weakened vastus medialis obliquus. Symptoms are regulated by the amount of activity. Such pain is commonly caused by running and jumping sports and activities that place large forces on the patellofemoral joint. ==Signs and symptoms== Symptoms usually include: * Knee buckles and can no longer support your weight * Kneecap slips off to the side * Knee catches during movement * Pain in the front of the knee that increases with activity * Pain when sitting * Stiffness * Creaking or cracking sounds during movement * Swelling Patellar subluxation was once thought to occur mainly in women, due to the frequency of genu valgum and lax ligaments. However, now the frequency of this condition in any athletic person, man or woman, is apparent. ==DiagnosisTreatmentConservative Treatment=== Conservative treatment in primary acute LPD (lateral patellar dislocation) is the therapy of choice. It includes a multimodal approach with behavioural education of the patient, physical therapy, braces, weight reduction and pain medication. Physical therapy especially focuses on muscle strengthening and proprioceptive exercises. The vastus medialis oblique muscle is described to have an important role in functional stabilization of the patella against lateral vector force. Proprioceptive exercises and strengthening of the hip abductors and positioning of the foot are crucial, especially indicated in patient with miserable malalignment syndrome or medial collapse. Several patellar braces or taping methods exist to improve return to sport. They may however not alter medial or lateral displacement, but can be helpful as a diagnostic tool for occult patellofemoral instability. ===Surgical Treatment Options=== Increasing age is associated with decreased physical activity after surgical stabilization, and therefore in growing and very active athletes early surgical treatment intervention needs to be considered. Reconstruction of the MPFL (medial patellofemoral ligament) in patients with minor trochlear dysplasia is technically possible without interfering with distal growth plate of the femur, however, large studies are missing. Osseous articular correction before epiphyseal closure is contraindicated. In adult patients with recurrent LPD and without trochlear dysplasia or type A or C according to Dejour classification, MPFL reconstruction alone might be beneficial, in which unchanged osseous or dynamic instability will be compensated. Patients with an important supra-trochlear spur as in type B and D trochlear dysplasia and chronic instability are more reluctant to conservative and softtissue surgical treatment options. In such cases sulcus-deepening trochleoplasty should be performed. Typically, post-surgical results are more favourable when instability was the main symptom. Hence, in such patients low-pivoting physical activity may be re-achieved. ==References== Category:Sports medicine Category:Syndromes Category:Orthopedic problems ","title":"Patellar subluxation syndrome"},{"id":"20140153","text":"The Pingangnaktok (\\"it blows a land wind\\") are a geographically defined Copper Inuit band in the northern Canadian territory of Nunavut, on the mainland, in Kitikmeot Region.

It is named after Colombian physician Alex Jadad who in 1996 described a system for allocating such trials a score of between zero (very poor) and five (rigorous). It is the most widely used such assessment in the world, and as of 2019, its seminal paper has been cited in over 15,000 scientific works. ==Description== The Jadad scale independently assesses the methodological quality of a clinical trial judging the effectiveness of blinding. Alejandro \\"Alex\\" Jadad Bechara, a Colombian physician who worked as a Research Fellow at the Oxford Pain Relief Unit, Nuffield Department of Anaesthetics, at the University of Oxford described the allocating trials a score of between zero (very poor) and five (rigorous) in an appendix to a 1996 paper. In a 2007 book Jadad described the randomised controlled trial as \\"one of the simplest, most powerful and revolutionary forms of research\\". ==Background== Clinical trials are conducted for the purpose of collecting data on the efficacy of medical treatments. The treatment might be, for example, a new drug, a medical device, a surgical procedure, or a preventative regime. Clinical trial protocols vary considerably depending on the nature of the treatment under investigation, but typically in a controlled trial researchers gather a group of volunteers and subject some to the test treatment, while giving the others either no treatment (known as a placebo), or an established treatment for comparison. After a defined time period, the patients in the test group are assessed for health improvements in comparison with the control group. However, trials can vary greatly in quality. Methodological errors such as poor blinding or poor randomisation allow factors such as the placebo effect or selection bias to adversely affect the results of a trial. ===Randomisation=== Randomisation is a process to remove potential distortion of statistical results arising from the manner in which the trial is conducted, in particular in the selection of subjects. Studies have indicated, for example, that nonrandomised trials are more likely to show a positive result for a new treatment than for an established conventional one. ===Blinding=== The importance of scientific controls to limit factors under test is well established. However, it is also important that none of those involved in a clinical trial, whether the researcher, the subject patient or any other involved parties, should allow their own prior expectations to affect reporting of results. The placebo effect is known to be a confounding factor in trials; affecting the ability of both patients and doctors to report accurately on the clinical outcome. Experimental blinding is a process to prevent bias, both conscious and subconscious, skewing results. Blinding frequently takes the form of a placebo, an inactive dummy that is indistinguishable from the real treatment. Blinding can however be difficult to achieve in some trials, for example, surgery or physical therapy. Poor blinding can exaggerate the perceived effects of treatment, particularly if any such effects are small. Blinding should be appropriate to the study, and is ideally double blind, wherein neither the patient nor doctor is aware of whether they are in the control or test group, eliminating any such psychological effects from the study. ===Withdrawals and dropouts=== Withdrawals and dropouts are those patients who fail to complete a course of treatment, or fail to report back on its outcome to the researchers. The reasons for doing so might be varied: the individuals may have moved away, abandoned the course of treatment, or died. Whatever the reason, the attrition rate can skew results of a study, particularly for those subjects who ceased treatment due to perceived inefficacy. In smoking cessation studies, for example, it is routine to consider all dropouts as failures. ==Jadad questionnaire== A three-point questionnaire forms the basis for a Jadad score. Each question was to be answered with either a yes or a no. Each yes would score a single point, each no zero points; there were to be no fractional points. The Jadad team stated that they expected it should take no longer than ten minutes to score any individual paper. The questions were as follows: Was the study described as randomized?, Was the study described as double blind? and Was there a description of withdrawals and dropouts? To receive the corresponding point, an article should describe the number of withdrawals and dropouts, in each of the study groups, and the underlying reasons. Additional points were given if: The method of randomisation was described in the paper, and that method was appropriate. or The method of blinding was described, and it was appropriate. Points would be deducted if: The method of randomisation was described, but was inappropriate, or The method of blinding was described, but was inappropriate. A clinical trial could therefore receive a Jadad score of between zero and five. The Jadad scale is sometimes described as a five-point scale, though there are only three questions. ==Uses== The Jadad score may be used in a number of ways: # To evaluate the general quality of medical research in a particular field. # To set a minimum standard for the paper's results to be included in a meta analysis. A researcher conducting a systematic review for example might elect to exclude all papers on the topic with a Jadad score of 3 or less. # For critical analysis of an individual paper. , the Jadad score was the most widely used such assessment in the world, and its seminal paper has been cited in over 3000 scientific works. ==Criticism== Critics have charged that the Jadad scale is flawed, being over-simplistic and placing too much emphasis on blinding, and can show low consistency between different raters. Furthermore, it does not take into account allocation concealment, viewed by The Cochrane Collaboration as paramount to avoid bias.Higgins JPT, Altman DG, Sterne JAC (editors).

ACL were interested in diversifying into the new area of naval aviation, combining its knowledge of metal work and naval construction to produce seaplanes for the French mail service. The company started as a joint venture between ACL and Gourdou-Leseurre, contracting to build 257 GL 32’s under licence at a new factory at St Nazaire. In 1928 they disassociated and in 1930 the company became Loire Aviation, working on own designs by designers Asselot, Jarrion, and Guegand Kerguistel. During this period Loire built some 232 units of the Loire 11 seaplane and aircraft for other companies, as well as a range of other aircraft under the Loire marque. In 1933 the company united with Nieuport (by then known as Nieuport-Astra), though both companies maintained their own factories and test sites; Loire at St Nazaire and La Baule, Nieuport at Issy-les-Moulineaux and Villacoublay. This led to some complications; the two companies found themselves competing over a contract for a fighter for the French Air Force, later won by Morane Saulnier with the MS 406. The two companies underwent a full merger in 1935 to form the Société Anonyme Loire-Nieuport(SALN), or Loire-Nieuport.

Majdala was discovered by producer Romeo Lahoud. He presented her to the Baalbeck Festival Jury in 1970, which directly agreed on his choice. She played many first roles such as Safra in Al Faraman, at the 1970 Baalbeck Festival, and also four times at the Beiteddine Festival between 1971 and 1975, with Madinit el Farah, Bahr El Loulou, Mawsim El Tarrabich, and Wadi el Ghazar. She sang with such performers as Wadih El Safi, Nasri Chams El Din, Philimon Wehbe, Joseph Azar, Samir Yazbeck, Issam Rajji, Antoine Kerbaj, Rida Khoury, Chouchou, Melhim Barakat, Marwan Mahfouz, Fehmen, Samir Rahal, Nadim Berberi, Georgette Sayyigh, and Nabih Abou El Hessen. The composers of her songs were Zaki Nassif, Romeo Lahoud, Issam Rajji, Elie Choueiry, Melhim Barakat, Elias El Rahbani, Ziad Rahbani, Azar Habib, Philimon Wehbe and Hassan Abd El Nabi. In 1976 the Lebanese Civil War began, and Majdala decided to retire from singing. She married Nabil Khater and gave birth in 1977 to her daughter Majdala Khater.

He is thought to have invented the first fully contained cartridge in 1808, as well as the percussion cap in 1818. In association with the Swiss gunsmith Jean Samuel Pauly, François Prélat invented from 1808 to 1812 the first totally contained cartridge, incorporating in one package a fulminate primer, black powder and a round bullet. A percussion pin would provoke ignition.An Encyclopaedia of the History of Technology by Ian McNeil, p.984 This was a marked improvement over the invention of Jean Lepage, in which the fulminate was simply poured into a pan near the breech. The new cartridge was particularly considered useful for cavalry firearms, as the motion of the horse and the difficulty of movement rendered conventional loading extremely difficult. This center-fire design is today the most commonly used. The two men had set up a gunsmith shop together 4, rue des Trois-Frères, in Paris. In 1818, Prélat took a patent, or Certificat d'addition, for the invention of the percussion cap (ignition copper cap) to be used in cartridges,Hunting Weapons by Howard L.

Retrieved 10 November 2008) was an English diplomat and political commentator. He served as ambassador to Savoy for sixteen years, and later as ambassador to France. == Early life == Isaac Wake was the second son of Arthur, son of John Wake of Hartwell, Northamptonshire, a descendant of the lords of Blisworth. His father, a canon of Christ Church and master of St. John's Hospital in Northampton, was rector of Great Billing in Northamptonshire until 1573, when he was deprived for nonconformity;G. Baker, The History and Antiquities of the County of Northampton (John Bowyer Nichols, London 1822-30), I, pp. 23, 25 (Internet Archive). he afterwards lived for many years in Jersey. Born in 1580 or 1581,Archbishop Wake, a relation of Isaac Wake's, claimed he was born in 1575; but he is entered as only twelve years old at his Oxford University matriculation on 25 May 1593 Isaac Wake entered Christ Church, Oxford in 1593, and graduated B.A. in 1597; he was elected fellow of Merton College, Oxford in 1598, and graduated M.A. in 1603. In 1604 he became a student at the Middle Temple, and on 14 December 1604 was elected public orator of Oxford University.A. à Wood, ed. P. Bliss, Athenae Oxonienses and Fasti Oxonienses (F.C. & J Rivington, London 1815), II (Athenae), pp. 539-41 (Internet Archive). He took part in the reception of King James in 1605, delivering an oration \\"at the Hall-stair's foot in Christ Church.\\"J. Nichols, The Progresses, Processions, and Magnificent Festivities, of King James the First, 4 Vols (J.B. Nichols, London 1828), I, p. 546 (Internet Archive). The king seems to have thought his oratory polished, if soporific.It was King James's joke, that whereas Wake the orator sent him to sleep, (Anthony) Sleepe the deputy orator kept him awake. Wood, Athenae Oxonienses, II (Fasti), p. 345 (Internet Archive). In 1607, he delivered a funeral oration on John Rainolds. ==Diplomatic career== In 1609, Wake travelled in France and Italy, and soon afterwards became secretary to Sir Dudley Carleton at Venice. In March 1612, his leave of absence from Merton College was extended for three years; but in the following November he came to England for a few months, during which he pronounced a funeral oration on Sir Thomas Bodley. He returned to Venice in March 1613, and stayed there, and afterwards at Turin, as Carleton's secretary until the latter left for England in July 1615. Wake then became British representative at the court of Savoy, and retained that office for nearly sixteen years. In 1617 he went to Bern, at the request of Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy, to mediate an alliance between Savoy and the Swiss states. At the end of 1618 he came to London, being \\"much courted\\" by the French ministers on his way through Paris, and was knighted on 9 April 1619 at Royston, Hertfordshire, where the king lay ill in bed. Immediately afterwards he was sent back to Turin with an offer of support to the duke in his candidature for the imperial crown, and at the same time with an informal mission to Frederick V, Elector Palatine, whom he saw at Heidelberg on his way out. On the death of Sir Henry Savile, in February 1622, Prince Charles tried to secure Wake's election as warden of Merton; but he was beaten by (Sir) Nathaniel Brent, the influence of the Abbots, combined perhaps with Wake's constant absence from England, proving too strong. Wake was in England again in December 1623, when he married Anna, daughter of Edmund Bray of Barrington, and stepdaughter to Sir Edward Conway, the secretary of state.'443.

Ruigh, The Parliament of 1624: Politics and Foreign Policy (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass. 1971), pp. 85-86 (Google). until his departure in May as ambassador to Savoy and Venice, with special instructions to endeavour to gain the assistance of those states for the recovery of the palatinate. Towards the end of 1626 he was employed on a mission to Bern and Zurich on behalf of the Grisons; and in 1627 he endeavoured to mediate, at the king of Denmark's request, between that monarch and the Duke of Savoy. After narrowly escaping the plague which ravaged Piedmont in 1630, he was appointed ambassador to the French court, and had audience of Louis XIII in May 1631. Isaac Wake was spoken of as likely to succeed Viscount Dorchester as secretary of state when the latter died in February 1632; but before the appointment was made he died himself, from an attack of fever, at Paris in June 1632. His body was brought to England with the ceremony due to his rank, and buried in the chapel of Dover Castle. His widow petitioned the king for a pension, and for the payment of about £1,400 due to her husband at the time of his death, representing herself as destitute. The arrears at any rate seem to have been paid ultimately, for in 1633 Lady Wake bought an annuity from her half-brother, Lord Conway, for £1,450. She is mentioned in company with her kinswoman Lady Vere in the Diary of Samuel Rogers.T. Webster and K. Shipps (eds), The Diary of Samuel Rogers, 1634-1638 (Boydell Press, Woodbridge 2004), p. xlii (Google).

Mearsheimer in his book on offensive realism, The Tragedy of Great Power Politics. The aim is to induce rival states to engage in a protracted war of attrition against each other \\"so that they bleed each other white\\" while the baiter who encouraged the conflict remains on the sidelines and maintains its military strength. Mearsheimer cites as an example Russia's efforts to provoke Austria and Prussia into war with France shortly after the French Revolution, evidenced by Catherine the Great's statement to her secretary in 1791: \\"I am racking my brains in order to push the courts of Vienna and Berlin into French affairs.... There are reasons I cannot talk about; I want to get them involved in that business to have my hands free. I have much unfinished business, and it's necessary for them to be kept busy and out of my way.\\" ==Bloodletting== Mearsheimer describes a similar strategy which he calls \\"bloodletting\\", which does not involve incitement or baiting by a third party. When a state's rivals have already gone to war independently, the aim is to encourage the conflict to continue as long as possible to let the rival states weaken or \\"bleed\\" each other's military strength while the bloodletting party stays out of the fighting. This strategy is exemplified in US Senator Harry Truman's statement in 1941 regarding the invasion of Nazi- Germany and its Allies, Italy, Hungary, Finland, Romania of Russia, \\"If we see that Germany is winning we ought to help Russia, and if Russia is winning we ought to help Germany, and that way let them kill as many as possible, I don't want to see Hitler victorious under any circumstances.\\" Another example of this strategy was Soviet Russia's withdrawal from World War I while the fighting in Europe between Germany and the remaining Allies continued. In his report to the Third Congress of Soviets in 1918, Vladimir Lenin argued that by withdrawing from the conflict, \\"we rid ourselves... of both imperialistic groups fighting each other. We can take advantage of their strife... and use that period when our hands are free to develop and strengthen the Socialist Revolution.\\" ==See also== * Attrition warfare * Divide and rule * John J.

After squatting in three buildings, they received national attention when they squatted a townhouse in Mayfair, Westminster, Greater London in October 2008. The property, at 18 Upper Grosvenor Street, is a 30-room grade II-listed 1730s mansion worth an estimated £6.25 million owned by the billionaire Duke of Westminster, Britain's wealthiest private landlord. == Formation and First Three Spaces == Simon McAndrew (b. 1979), a hairdresser, co-founded DA! after squatting at Chez Robert in Paris. In 2005, he and partner Bogna McAndrew formed \\"a London equivalent of Chez Robert\\" in a six-story home on Kensington High Street. The collective has been self described as \\"a mix of visual, performance and conceptual artists, writers, musicians, thinkers, art students, students of other disciplines.\\" McAndrew and Bogna lived in the home for a year, and attracted new members such as Stephanie Smith. DA! continued to use spots at Knightsbridge and Tottenham Court Road before finding the spot at Grosvenor Street. == Grosvenor Street Squatting and Media Attention == The group had been observing the home for six months, putting tape on the keyhole to see if it was in use and checking the letterbox. One October 2010 night, several members wore high-visibility jackets (such as a construction worker) and climbed to an unlocked window. The members held a 24-hour occupancy in keeping with Land Registration Act 2002, which states that squatters must occupy for ten years before applying for ownership - at the time, squatting in a residential property was still a civil offense. McAndrew referred to this space as MADA!, combining \\"MA\\" from Mayfair with DA!. In a statement delivered from the balcony (bedecked with a blacked-out tattered Union Jack), Stephanie Smith declared: Two art shows were put on in MADA! on 8 November and 21 November. Visual installations, music, and performance art were among the projects displayed in the home. Word-of-mouth spread MADA!, and the occupation was reported in The Guardian, The Sun, Telegraph, The Daily Mail, Architects' Journal, and more. By the end of November 2010, DA! was given an eviction notice by lease owners Deltaland Resources Ltd. and left Grosvenor Street. == After Grosvenor \\"The Temporary School of Thought\\"=== Immediately after being evicted, DA! occupied a £22.5m property nearby in Clarges Mews. This project was titled \\"The Temporary School of Thought\\", and featured free and open group activities such as deschooling sessions, labyrinth-building and French book-binding. They remained undetected until the lease owners, Timekeeper Ltd., noticed a Christmas tree in the window. In mid-December 2010, they were evicted from this property. === m@ke-u.se === In 2011, McAndrew started a project called InEmptyBuildings - later named ma.ke-u.se (stylized as m@ke-u.se) which aimed to \\"enable artists, to support and stimulate each other; by using vacant commercial buildings in central London, at very low cost, on a short term basis.\\" Later, as the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 implemented harsher offenses for squatting, the project shifted to creating a \\"practical, media savvy, pro-squatting campaign to reverse the direction in which the law is currently heading\\". m@ke-u.se has not been updated since March 2014. === Possible Resurrection === After lying dormant with no projects for three years, the DA!

The EPA and companies responsible for the waste in this area, which includes a three-mile section of Portage Creek as well as part of the Kalamazoo River, into which it flows, are currently involved in an effort to reduce the amount of toxic waste at the site, which is contaminated by PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) from paper mills and other factories. ==History== After the Industrial Revolution, many paper mills that sprouted up along the Kalamazoo River were found to be the cause of PCB contamination. The publication in a 1953 issue of Life Magazine of a photograph depicting dead carp floating in the Kalamazoo River drew national attention to the public interest.\\"About Our River.\\" Bringing Back the Kalamazoo River. 2007. Kalamazoo Watershed Council. 16 October. 2008 The Kalamazoo Superfund site was added to the National Priorities List on August 30, 1990, and the First Cleanup Action began in late 1990. Between 1990 and 2000, under an agreement with the EPA and the State of Michigan, several of the current and past owners of plants that had been responsible for the contamination investigated the Portage Creek site. ==Contamination by polychlorinated biphenyls== Polychlorinated biphenyls constitute a wide array of now-banned organic chemicals with a variety of industrial applications. At the Kalamazoo River site, most polychlorinated biphenyls are a result of the recycling of carbonless copy paper during the 1970s, the waste products from which were dumped into the river. Polychlorinated biphenyls were produced from 1929 to 1979, when they were banned by the Toxic Substances Control Act. Polychlorinated biphenyls are human carcinogens, and can also have a negative effect on the human immune, reproductive, and endocrine systems.Effects.\\" Polychlorinated Biphenyls. 8 Aug. 2008. Environmental Protection Agency. 14 Oct. 2008. PCBs in the Kalamazoo River adhere to the fatty tissue of fish, and over time a process of bioaccumulation takes place, meaning that the PCBs appear in increasing concentrations in organisms higher up on the food chain, including humans. A report by the Michigan Department of Health found that the Kalamazoo River is now safe for recreational use despite some PCB contamination.Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. Michigan Department of Community Health. Health Consultation: Allied Paper/ Portage Creek/Kalamazoo River, Kalamazoo, Kalamazoo County, Michigan. May 2002. 15 October 2008. ==Kalamazoo River== The Kalamazoo River makes up a large portion of the Kalamazoo River Watershed, which spans about 162 miles and feeds into Lake Michigan. The 80 miles of the Kalamazoo River and Portage Creek are officially divided into five sections known as Operable Units (OU): Allied Paper/ Bryant Mill Pond (1), Willow Boulevard and A-Site Landfill (2), King Highway Landfill (3), 12th Street Landfill (4), and the Portage Creek (5). Portage Creek is southwest of Kalamazoo, connecting to the Kalamazoo River near the King’s Highway Operable Unit. The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) manages the Superfund site.Bucholtz, Paul. \\"Allied Paper, Inc/Portage Creek/Kalamazoo River.\\" Department of Environmental Quality. 2006. Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. 15 Oct. 2008. ==Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act / Superfund== The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, which was passed in 1980, calls for the cleaning up, under EPA supervision, of abandoned hazardous waste sites that release pollutants into the environment. The EPA works at the Kalamazoo Superfund site in conjunction with state and regional interest groups. ==National Priorities List== The National Priorities List allows for highly hazardous sites to be dealt with immediately. Substances deemed toxic are given Hazard Ranking System Package scores based on the level of toxicity and the potential hazard to human health and the ecosystem. Sites with Hazard Ranking System Package scores of 28.5 or higher out of 100 are placed on the NPL, pending official approval.Mazmanian, Daniel, and David Morell. Beyond Superfailure: America's Toxics Policy for the 1990s. Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 1992. ==Potentially Responsible Party== The Potentially Responsible Party is an individual, corporation, or group that can be held financially responsible, at least in part, for the cleanup of the Superfund site. Recent court actions have resulted in the following companies being identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as Potentially Responsible Parties for the Kalamazoo River: NCR, International Paper Company, Georgia-Pacific, Weyerhaeuser and Millennium Holdings. “Georgia-Pacific Consumer Products LP, Fort James Corporation, and Georgia-Pacific LLC, Plaintiffs, v. NCR Corporation, International Paper Co., and Weyerhaeuser Co. Defendants.” ==Remediation== The cleanup of Kalamazoo River Superfund site started upstream and has moved downstream. First, extant PCB sources were removed, with particular concern being expressed about the continuing release of PCBs in the Bryant Mill Pond area, where a $7.5 million removal program was carried out from June 1998 to May 1999. Two of the Operable Units, King Highway Landfill and Allied Inc., had sheet pile and caps installed, a process which does not remove PCBs but serves as a protective layering containing them. Time Critical Removal Action was declared in spring 2007 at the Plainwell site, where the removal process included sediment removal and the reintroduction of native plants. Any waste containing over 50 ppm (parts per million) of PCB was disposed of in Bellville’s Environmental Quality Corporation Wayne Disposal Landfill. Most of the waste, however, had a lower PCB concentration and was disposed of at nearby landfills. Since 1998, EPA, working with Potentially Responsible Parties, has removed nearly 450,000 cubic yards of contaminated material from the site, cleaned up and restored seven miles of the Kalamazoo River and banks, and capped 82 acres worth of contaminated material to lock it away. In September 2015, EPA signed a document called the Record of Decision for Area 1 of the river - Area 1 is the portion of the Kalamazoo River between Morrow Dam and the former Plainwell Dam, and includes Portage Creek between Cork Street and the Kalamazoo River. The cleanup for Area 1 includes excavation of PCB-contaminated areas in a two- mile section of the Kalamazoo River near the confluence of Portage Creek, and floodplain soil removal in the Plainwell Impoundment near the former Plainwell Dam. EPA projects that remediation work will begin in 2019. On December 21, 2016, EPA issued a Unilateral Administrative Order to Georgia-Pacific, International Paper and Weyerhaeuser to conduct the work specified in the record of decision. In September 2017, EPA signed a record of decision for Area 2 of the river - Area 2 is the portion of the Kalamazoo River between the former Plainwell Dam and the Otsego City Dam. The Area 2 cleanup includes removal of the Otsego City Dam, realignment of the river to create a single stable channel, bank soil and PCB “hot spot” excavation, capping of the anabranch areas (areas where streams break away from the main river and then rejoin further downstream), and long-term monitoring. * Operable Unit 5 – Area 2 Record of Decision (PDF) (111pp, 19.39MB) September 2017 In Feb. 2016, EPA approved the Area 3 site investigation report, which details the results of soil and water sampling at the site. This report indicated high levels of PCB- contamination in the soil and sediment. In August 2016, work began on a Time- Critical Removal Action in the Kalamazoo River upstream of the Otsego Township Dam and the M-89 bridge, which was completed in August 2018. Georgia-Pacific submitted the draft Area 4 site investigation report in Sept. 2017 - Area 4 is the Kalamazoo River between the Otsego Township Dam and Trowbridge Dam. This document shows where and how soil and sediment sampling was conducted in Area 4 of the river. EPA is currently reviewing this document. The Area 5 site investigation officially began in November 2016 - Area 5 is the Kalamazoo River between the Trowbridge Dam and Allegan City Dam. Georgia-Pacific began field investigations in October 2017. ==Allied Paper Landfill Update== EPA has been working with the bankruptcy Trustee for Allied Landfill to implement the design for the cleanup selected in the September 21, 2016, Record of Decision. The cleanup plan, or remedy, includes consolidation and capping of the waste into a 27-acre area and long-term groundwater monitoring. The project is currently in the design phase. EPA expects cleanup work to begin by 2020 and take up to three years to complete. * Operable Unit 1 - Allied Landfill Record of Decision (PDF) (138pp, 24.6MB) September 2016 ==Otsego Township Dam - Time- Critical Removal== In the later summer of 2018, the EPA completed the removal of PCB-contaminated sediment and soil along the Kalamazoo River near the Otsego Township Dam. The project involved a 1.7-mile area of PCB-contaminated sediment and soil immediately upstream of the former Otsego Township Dam. Between initial dredging in August 2016 and project completion in August 2018, workers dredged over 50,000 tons (33,000 cubic yards) of sediment and soil, stabilized riverbanks to prevent future contamination and erosion, and disposed of contaminated materials at an approved landfill. A temporary water control structure that was built in 2015 to replace the dam was removed, and the river is now an open channel. The area around the former auxiliary spillway has been restored as a wetland area. There are two public parking areas built at former project staging areas. The river is now open, and there is access to the river at these areas for kayaks and canoes. ==Plainwell Mill Update== EPA signed a record of decision for the former Plainwell Paper Mill in Sept. 2015. The selected cleanup plan requires the excavation and off-site disposal of contaminated soil from the former mill site. The cleanup work plans were finalized in Sept. 2016, and Pre-Design Investigation work was completed in 2017. Cleanup work will start once EPA approves the work plan, expected in 2018 or early 2019. ==Portage Creek== Work on the last OU, Portage Creek, began in September 2011. From April to October 2012, the EPA removed about 12,000 cubic yards of PCB-contaminated soil and sediment from Portage Creek, replaced it with clean sediment, and planted new trees and other vegetation. The EPA planned to return to the site in March 2013 to “try to complete the last segment of Portage Creek, where the creek and the Kalamazoo River meet.” If necessary, the EPA planned additional work at Portage Creek in the summer of 2014. ==See also== *List of Superfund sites in Michigan ==References== Category:Geography of Allegan County, Michigan Category:Geography of Kalamazoo County, Michigan Category:Superfund sites in Michigan ","title":"Kalamazoo Superfund Site"},{"id":"20140831","text":"The Communauté de communes des Villes Sœurs (before 2017: Communauté de communes interrégionale de Bresle maritime) is a Communauté de communes located in both the Seine-Maritime department (in the Normandy region) and the Somme department (Hauts-de-France region) of north-western France.

Before the advent of turnpikes or toll roads, ridgeway trails continued to provide the firmest and safest cart tracks. They are generally an opposite to level, valley-bottom, paved roads, which require engineering work to shore up and maintain. Unmaintained valley routes may require greater travelling distances than ridgeways. Prehistoric roads in Europe often variously comprised stretches of ridgeway above the line of springs, sections of causeway through bog and marsh, and other trackways of neither sort which crossed flat country. A revival of interest in ancient roads and recreational walking in the 19th century brought the concept back into common use. Some ancient routes, in particular The Ridgeway National Trail of southern England, have been reprised as long-distance footpaths. ==Origin== The Ridgeway passing through open downland Along ridge lines of hills, soil is often exposed and dry because of wind and natural drainage, and vegetation tends to be thinner. Where a beaten track evolves into a busier \\"road,\\" constant passage by beasts, sleds and wheeled vehicles suppresses regrowth of vegetation. With the help of rain (and soil creep), a shallow trail can be worn down into the topsoil and smoothed without any purposeful road-making work. The thin soil and rocky subsoil, combined with the natural drainage provided by the slopes on each side, also tended to keep such roads dry. In western Europe, where prehistoric roads have been extensively documented with the help of itineraries, traces on old maps and extant marks on the landscape, ridgeways are a typical feature of long-distance ancient routes through rugged, high-rainfall parts of Germany and across the island of Great Britain. These ancient trackways generally ran along the hilltops, only descending when necessary to cross valleys.Landau As such, they are an opposite to modern-style roads, which tend to run along the valleys and only ascend when necessary to cross the hilltops.Weimann, Reinhold. ==Courses== The Ridgeway (Uffington Castle ringfort in distance on left) In rugged parts of central Germany, ridgeways tend to strictly follow the watershed line proper, since traversing steep slopes was difficult for wheeled vehicles and uncomfortable for foot travellers unless someone had cut a track into the hillside and shored it up against washouts and slips. However, deviations around high peaks were common, usually taking the south side of the peak, presumably because the warmer side was usually drier.Nicke. On flatter British hills, the line of the tracks often runs a little below the actual crest of the ridge, possibly to afford some shelter from the wind or to avoid travellers presenting themselves to marauders as a target on the skyline.West. The discomfort of following ridgeways arises from their exposure to harsh weather and the fact that they are rarely level. The ridge line rises and falls. Moreover, at some point the ridge ends, so that the route must descend to ford a stream before rising again to follow the next ridge. Loads on two- wheeled carts had to be constantly shifted to the back during descents and to the front during ascents so that the animals could draw efficiently.Nicke. In medieval and later times ridgeways in England were used as drovers roads. Since ridgeways were informal routes, and the rounded tops of many British and German ridges might be hundreds of metres wide, the track might change seasonally, or spontaneously, if any land alongside the trail appeared drier and firmer. But where the tracks were seen as marking boundaries, the course could no longer change without causing a property dispute. English ridgeway routes became fixed in the course of enclosures beginning about 1750.The Ridgeway website. Retrieved on 2008-11-07 Notable prehistoric ridgeways include: ;in England *The Ridgeway between Avebury and Streatley in southern England *The Icknield Way on the escarpment of the Chiltern Hills and extending towards Norfolk in southern England *The Old Shaftesbury Drove and the Ox Drove leading from Shaftesbury and Blandford to Salisbury ;in Germany *The Rennweg (Arnsberger Wald), an old trade route along the Arnsberg Forest *The Brüderstrasse between Cologne and Siegen, Germany *The Rennsteig from Gerstungen through the Thuringian mountains of Germany, restored from 1896 onwards as a 169-kilometre trail ==Evaluation== Modern, informal military ridge trail Some modern authors have suggested several advantages a ridgeway might possess: * A ridgeway trail preserves itself without paving and constant maintenance, which were not available in medieval or early modern times in Europe.Nicke. * A watershed route can cover long distances without crossing water: valley roads require fords or bridges over tributary streams.Nicke, 7. * In some landscapes, a line along a hill is more direct, taking a route as the crow flies, whereas valley routes tend to meander.Nicke. * Routes well away from arable land in valleys can avoid tolls and customs charges imposed by land-owners or potentates.Mechelhoff * Despite laws on rights of way, lowland farmers encroach on paths which they themselves do not use.Mechelhoff. Travellers can bypass villages on higher ground,Quinlan. which has little agricultural value. * Treeless hilltops may be safer from attack by robbers or fierce animals than densely forested valleys.Quinlan. ==Demise== Some ridgeway routes were adopted and paved by the Romans,Jermy even though the prevailing Roman road-construction practice was to build straight roads from point to point, rising and falling with the landscape.Briggs Some German ridgeways were deliberately closed to force traffic into towns.Landau. In one instance, the central purpose of the Rheingauer Gebück, a 38-kilometre fence erected in the 12th century, may have been to close down a German ridgeway and force traffic onto the Rhine river.Mechelhoff. Many ridgeways have continued in use with macadam or paved surfaces in modern times. Others fell into disuse when more level paved routes, either along valley bottoms or cut transversely along hillsides, were built parallel to them. Noting the existence of such parallel routes, antiquarians in Britain came to associate ridgeways culturally with ancient Britons.Phelps. However the evidence for the great antiquity of ridgeway routes is ambiguous. In the modern era, new cart tracks have generally avoided inhospitable high ground: the 1840s and 1850s Wagon Trails from the Missouri River to Oregon and California -- rutted trails in bare earth -- generally followed low courses. ==Rediscovery== In Britain, the term ridgeway has been in continuous use since Anglo-Saxon times as a generic term to distinguish any high travel route from a lower one. The earliest extant written form is spelled hrycweg, dating from 938.Oxford English Dictionary. In German, a variety of terms of similar date match the concept of a ridgeway: Rennweg (since circa 860: RennewecLandau.), Rennstieg (1162: RinnestichLandau.), Bergstrasse (C9: BirgistrotunLandau.) and hohe Strasse (circa 1000 HowestrazeLandau.). A revival of interest in ancient roads in the 19th century brought the concept back into common use. Although the Great Ridgeway northwest of London was the best known of such routes, 19th-century British antiquarians rediscovered numerous other local ridgeways Phelps. and speculated that names such as Ryknild Street (a valley route) contained the word ridge in modified form.Hodgson. Scholars such as Georg Landau (1807-1865) began mapping and walking ancient ridgeway roads across Germany in the 19th century.Landau, introduction by Willi Görich. Recording prehistoric ridgeways today can be difficult. Trails only lightly worn into soil along ridge lines are generally no longer visible, but their courses are sometimes marked by modern roads and footpaths that have perpetuated the ridgeway routes. A ridgeway previously used by carts often remains physically evident in the form of a hollow way: a trench or fosse eroded deep into the soil by constant passage of wheels and hooves. These are most common at inclines. Sleds, axles scraping the soil between wheel ruts, locked wheels skidding downhill and heavy weights dragged over the ground to brake the carts' descents would all continue eroding the surface down to the bedrock, if any, which then forms a natural pavement.Nicke, 14. When it rains, the mud and debris in an inclined hollow way tend to be washed down the channel, slowly flushing it out and leaving banks on either side where hedgerows may develop and collect more material. Hollow ways can of course occur in any firm-ground trackway, not just in ridgeway sections. On level sections of a ridgeway, banks are less common'Nicke, 14. perhaps because travellers avoided large puddles and constantly changed the courses, or because any banks eroded. ==Recreational== Part of the outer circle at Avebury on The Ridgeway From the 19th century onwards, old ridgeways which had not been converted into highways were often revived by hiking clubs or tourism authorities, marked out as scenic trails for walking, horse-riding or mountain biking far from the disturbances of motor traffic. An 1890 Baedeker guide recommended walks on The Ridgeway,Great Britain: Handbook for Travellers, Leipzig, Karl Baedeker, 1890. and efforts to give that ridgeway legislative recognition began in 1947.Quinlan. Some completely new recreational ridgeways have been devised where there was no tradition of the route being used for trade in previous centuries. Examples include the Kammweg established in 1904 in eastern Germany and the 197-kilometre Wessex Ridgeway in England, devised in the 1980s by the Ramblers Association, following ridges between the Atlantic coast and Avebury, with a preference for firm paths, good scenery and free access.Quinlan. ==See also== *Ancient trackway *Causeway *Ford (crossing) *Hollow way *Drainage divide *Ridge *List of ancient roads *Trade route *Salt road ==NotesReferences== *Briggs, Keith.

Its original choreographer was Flemming Flindt in 1991. It tells the story of the eighteenth-century English princess Caroline Mathilde (sister of George III), who was sent to Denmark aged 15 to be married to the 17-year-old schizophrenic Danish King, Christian VII. The ballet portrays her unhappy marriage, the King's growing madness and her fatal love-affair with Struensee, the King's influential physician, which ultimately leads to their arrest, his execution and her exile at the age of 20, separated from her two young children.

Egland (1978) found 73% intelligibility with Huautla, the prestige variety of Mazatec. Literacy in Jalapa is taught alongside Spanish in local schools. ==Grammar== Jalapa Mazatec root words are primarily monosyllabic, and the intricate inflectional system is largely subsyllablic (Silverman 1994). ==Phonology== Jalapa Mazatec syllables are maximally CCGV. However, vowels distinguish several phonations, and like all Mazatec languages, Jalapa has tone. ===Tone=== Jalapa roots distinguish three tones, low , mid , and high . In morphologically complex situations, combinations of these may form short (or perhaps mid-length) vowels with contour tones: have been recorded. The simple tones are contrasted in \\"work\\", \\"puma\\", \\"mould\\". In much of the literature, these are written with the numerals 1 (low), 2 (mid), and 3 (high). Jalapa utilizes whistled speech, where each simple or contour tone is given a whistle pulse. ===Vowels=== Jalapa Mazatec distinguishes five vowel qualities, discounting phonation: , , , , . Phonations are modal voice, breathy voice, and creaky voice; all phonations may also occur with the five nasal vowels: :{ class=\\"IPA \\" +Jalapa Mazatec vowels - !Modal voice  i  æ  a  o  u -align=center !Breathy voice  i̤  æ̤  a̤  o̤  ṳ -align=center !Creaky voice  ḭ  æ̰  a̰  o̰  ṵ -align=center !Modal nasal  ĩ  æ̃  ã  õ  ũ -align=center !Breathy nasal  ĩ̤  æ̤̃  ã̤  õ̤  ṳ̃ -align=center !Creaky nasal  ḭ̃  æ̰̃  ã̰  õ̰  ṵ̃ } Breathy vowels may have strong breathy voicing throughout their length. However, typically they are voiceless for the first 40% and then have modal voice, so that for example may be pronounced or . Similarly, creaky vowels tend to confine their creakiness to the first part of the vowel, often with glottal closure before modal voice: as or . Jalapa is unique among the Mazatec languages in distinguishing breathy vowels. These arose through the contraction of Proto-Mazatecan disyllables of the form CVhV, where C was voiced and the two vowels were the same. When the two syllables carried different tones, these contracted into a contour. For example, proto-Mazatec \\"stone\\" became (through a presumed intermediate ); \\"thief\\" became ; and \\"your soap\\" became . Similar contractions occurred with CVʔV disyllables to produce creaky vowels, but creaky vowels already existed in the proto-language. Jalapa also has a phonemic distinction of unclear nature that has been suggested to be \\"ballisticity\\". However, it lacks the characteristics of ballistic syllables in other Otomanguean languages. The only consistent distinction Silverman et al. (1994) were able to measure was one of vowel length, with vowels of the alleged ballistic syllables being two-thirds the length of the vowels of the productive open class of nouns, with a slight increase in pitch. They may reflect the original short vowels of proto-Mazatec, as opposed to the vowels of morphologically complex monosyllabic nouns of modern Jalapa Mazatec. If so, Jalapa would have a three-way length distinction, as doubly long vowels are also found in morphologically complex situations. Note that this distinction is not marked in this article apart from this one table: {  border=\\"1\\" - ! \\"ballistic\\" (short?) ! trans. ! \\"controlled\\" (half long?) ! trans. -   \\"warm\\"   \\"blue\\" -   \\"slippery\\"   \\"needle\\" -   \\"guava\\"   \\"full\\" -   \\"y'all\\"   \\"six\\" } ===Consonants=== Jalapa consonants distinguish (prenasalized) voiced, tenuis, and aspirated plosives, as well as voiceless, voiced, and glottalized sonorants. {  border=\\"1\\" - ! colspan=2 ! Bilabial ! Alveolar ! Palatalized alveolar ! Velar ! Labialized velar ! Glottal - ! rowspan=3 Plosive ! aspirated       - ! tenuis       - ! voiced       - ! rowspan=3 Affricate ! aspirated       - ! tenuis       - ! voiced       - ! colspan=2 Fricative       - ! rowspan=3 Nasal ! voiceless       - ! voiced       - ! glottalized       - ! rowspan=3 Approximant ! voiceless       - ! voiced       - ! glottalized       } There is also a flap, , which only occurs in one morpheme, the clitic = \\"probably\\". In addition, the consonants , , are found in Spanish loan words. The labial velars become bilabial before front vowels: \\"it is finished\\" vs. \\"John\\", etc. Phonetically aspirated fricatives do not occur before creaky vowels, while aspirated stops do. Therefore, Silverman et al. (1994) treats them as fricative-/h/ clusters. Silverman (1994:126) remarks that voiced stops are prenasalized in intervocalic position, but later on the same page states that they are prenasalized in initial position. With voiced plosives, the nasalization is two-thirds the duration of the consonant. It is not clear if they ever appear without prenasalization. Voiceless nasals are voiced for the last quarter of their duration. Glottalized sonorants are variable in their production. The may occur as a glottal stop followed by a modally voiced sonorant, , , etc.; an initially creaky voiced sonorant switching to modal voice by the end; a fully creaky consonant; or the creak may extend into the following vowel. ===Phonotactics=== Aspirated consonants do not occur before breathy vowels, and glottalized consonants only occur before modally voiced vowels. Nasal consonants only occur before nasal vowels. Voiced plosives are prenasalized in intervocalic position. Consonant clusters include NC, where N is a nasal and C is a voiceless plosive or affricate, and SC, where S is a sibilant and C is a tenuis plosive or affricate. == References == * * * Category:Mazatecan languages pms:Lenga mazatec, chiquihuitlán ","title":"Jalapa Mazatec"},{"id":"20140989","text":"The Horse Range is a mountain range in Nye County, Nevada. == References == Category:Mountain ranges of Nevada Category:Mountain ranges of Nye County, Nevada Category:Mountain ranges of the Great Basin ","title":"Horse Range (Nevada)"},{"id":"20140990","text":"Leopoldo Gout is a film director, producer, author, and painter.

Her Observations on the Real Rights of Women (1818) was the first book on the rights of women by an American. ==Life and family== Hannah Mather born in Roxbury, Massachusetts, on June 27, 1752. She was the daughter of Samuel Mather, a Congregationalist minister, and Hannah Hutchinson. She was a descendant of the Mather dynasty founded in New England by Richard Mather (1596–1669), through his son Increase Mather (1639–1723) and his grandson Cotton Mather (1663-1728), all prominent Puritan ministers involved in the important religious and political issues of their era, including the Salem Witch Trials and the controversy over vaccination against smallpox. Her mother's brother was Thomas Hutchinson, Governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay in the years preceding the American Revolution. She inherited a portrait of the founder of the Mather dynasty. She was raised in a religious environment and had strong religious beliefs throughout her life. Her father was an educated man who believed in the importance of educating women, which lead to her passion for women's rights. She was extensively educated in languages, history, theology, and literature. In Reminiscences and Traditions of Boston, she recounted how as a teenager in 1775 she had hidden letters written by her father under her clothing, smuggled them out of British-occupied Boston, and delivered them to Joseph Warren, a leader of the rebel forces. On 18 March 1779, she married Joseph Crocker, a graduate of Harvard College and a captain in the Revolutionary War. He was also an advocate for women's rights. They had ten children between 1780 and 1795. During her marriage she became involved in Freemasonry and worked to advance women's place in society by founding St. Anne's Lodge, an all-female organization guided by masonic principles to provide women with instruction in literature and science. She also wrote and became a well-known essayist and poet. Her political affiliation was always with the Federalist Party. In 1812 she founded the School of Industry to provide instruction in vocational skills for \\"the female children of the poor in the Northern district of Boston\\". She died in Dorchester, Massachusetts, on July 11, 1829, and was interred in the Mather family tomb in Copp's Hill Burying Ground in Boston's North End. ==Writings== In 1787 she authored the North Square Creed. Never published, it is a statement in the style of a pledge taken by a new member of a fraternal organization. It is thought to be designed to allow husbands of women who joined St. Anne's Lodge to commit themselves to certain principles within marriage. The title uses coded language a Mason would recognize. She published Observations on the Real Rights of Women, with Their Appropriate Duties, Reminiscences and Traditions of Boston, Agreeable to Scripture, Reason and Common Sense in Boston in 1818. She argued that men and women were equal in mental capacity, though allowed for different expressions according to gender. This view formed the basis of her advocacy of female education: Her views remained in many respects traditional. She wrote, for example, that \\"It must be women's prerogative to shine in the domestic circle and her appropriate duty to teach and regulate the opening mind of her little flock.... The surest foundation to secure the female's right, must be in family government.\\" She included a defense of Mary Wollstonecraft, whom Boston society viewed as a libertine. In her chronicle Reminiscences and Traditions of Boston, authored between 1822 and 1829, she both described and analyzed the events of the American Revolution, laying out some of the early groundwork for a political and theoretical understanding of its causes and achievements. It presented an ideological argument that combined political theory with tradition descriptive historical writing, with an appreciation of the significance of popular demonstrations and an egalitarian emphasis. For example, she located the sources for the Boston riots that protested the Stamp Act in the tradition of anti-Catholic parades, their ritual acts of violence and the burning of effigies. She wrote in the voice of a personal witness to provide the reader with a sense of immediacy. The manuscript was discovered among her papers after her death and acquired by the New England Historic Genealogical Society in 1879, which published it in 2011. Her other works include: A Series of Letters on Free Masonry and The School of Reform; or, Seaman's Safe Pilot to the Cape of Good Hope. ==NotesReferences== ;Additional sources * L.W.

This access method works with a star topology. In this method, a node that wishes to transmit indicates this wish to the hub and also requests high- or regular-priority service for its transmission. After it obtains permission, the node begins transmitting to the hub. The hub is responsible for passing the transmission on to the destination node; that is, the hub is responsible for providing access to the network. A hub will pass high priority transmissions through immediately, and will pass regular-priority transmissions through as the opportunity arises. By letting the hub manage access, the architecture is able to guarantee required bandwidths and requested service priority to particular applications or nodes. It also can guarantee that the network can be scaled up (enlarged) without loss of bandwidth. Demand priority helps increase bandwidth in the following ways: A node does not need to keep checking whether the network is idle before transmitting. In current Ethernet implementations, a wire pair is dedicated to this task. By making network checking unnecessary, demand priority frees a wire pair. This is fortunate, because the 100BaseVG specifications use quartet signalling, which needs four available wire pairs. Heavy traffic can effectively bring standard Ethernet networks to a standstill, because nodes spend most of their time trying to access the network. With demand priority, the hub needs to pass a transmission on only to its destination, so that overall network traffic is decreased. This means there is more bandwidth available for heavy network traffic. ==References== Category:Media access control ","title":"Demand priority"},{"id":"20141122","text":"The Las Vegas Range is an arid mountain range in Clark County, Nevada.

Gibbus deformity most often develops in young children as a result of spinal tuberculosis and is the result of collapse of vertebral bodies.Kasper D.L. et al., Harrisons principles of internal medicine, 16.ed, 2005 p.958 This can in turn lead to spinal cord compression causing paraplegia.Davidson's Principles and Practice of Medicine, 20th Ed, 2006. In addition to tuberculosis, other possible causes of gibbus deformity include pathological diseases, hereditary and congenital conditions, and physical trauma to the spine that results in injury. Gibbus deformity may result from the sail vertebrae associated with cretinism (the childhood form of hypothyroidism), mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS), and certain congenital syndromes, including achondroplasia. Because most children with MPS I (Hurler Syndrome) also exhibit symptoms of a gibbus deformity, the latter can possibly be used to identify the former. Gibbus deformity is included in a subset of structural kyphosis that is distinguished by a higher-degree angle in the spinal curve that is specific to these forms of kyphosis. Other conditions within this subset include Pott's disease and Scheuermann kyphosis, but gibbus deformity is marked by an especially sharp angle. Viewed from behind, the resulting hunchback is more easily seen when bending forward. A kyphosis of >70° can be an indication of the need for surgery and these surgeries can be necessary for children as young as two years old, with a reported average of 8 years of age. ==References== Category:Skeletal disorders ","title":"Gibbus deformity"},{"id":"20141177","text":"Russell de Gree Flagg (1892-ca.1980, fl. 1905-ca.1975) was an American luthier.

The ensemble's reputation for excellence has encouraged composers to write music exploring these resources. Benjamin Britten composed the chamber music for his War Requiem for the Melos Ensemble and conducted the group in the first performance in Coventry. They should not be confused with two other chamber groups of similar name, the Melos Quartet or the Melos Art Ensemble (an Italian group). == Founding period, 1950 == The Melos Ensemble was founded by musicians who wanted to play chamber music scored for a larger ensemble in a combination of strings, winds and other instruments with the quality of musical rapport only regular groups can achieve. The Melos Ensemble played in variable instrumentation, flexible enough to perform a wide repertory of pieces. All its members were excellent musicians who held positions in notable orchestras and appeared as soloists. The founding members, namely Gervase de Peyer (clarinet), Cecil Aronowitz (viola), Richard Adeney (flute), and Terence Weil (cello) planned a group of twelve players, a string quintet and a wind quintet with harp and piano, that might be expanded by other players, to perform the great octets by Schubert and Mendelssohn, the septet by Beethoven, Ravel's Introduction and Allegro and the Serenade by Arnold Schoenberg.Melos Ensemble All Music Guide, Joseph Stevenson Neill Sanders (horn, a member for 29 years until 1979), and Adrian Beers (double bass) were members from the beginning. All these musicians stayed with the group for decades. == Early members == Other early members included Gervase de Peyer (first clarinet) Emanuel Hurwitz (leader 1956–1972), Ivor McMahon (second violin), William Waterhouse (bassoon), Osian Ellis (harp), James Blades (percussion), Lamar Crowson and Ernst Ueckermann (piano), Peter Graeme and Sarah Barrington (oboe), James Buck (horn), Edgar Williams (bassoon) and Keith Puddy (clarinet), expanded by Colin Chambers (flute and piccolo), Alan Hacker (bass clarinet), Eric Roseberry (piano), Leonard Friedman (violin), Kay Hurwitz (viola), William Bennett (flute), Stephen Pruslin (piano), Leonard Friedman (violin), Hilary Wilson (harp)Wardour Castle Summer School Concert programme 1965 and Timothy Brown (horn). In the opinion of William Waterhouse (writing in 1995), \\"it was the remarkable rapport between this pair of lower strings\\" (i.e. Terence Weil and Cecil Aronowitz) \\"which remained constant throughout a succession of distinguished leaders, that gave a special distinction to this outstanding ensemble.\\"Obituary Terence Weil The Independent, William Waterhouse, 9 March 1995, Obituary Gervase de Peyer\\"the Guardian\\" == Special projects == A remarkable premiere for the group was Jacques-Louis Monod's 1962 presentation of Roberto Gerhard's Concerto for Eight. This was followed by the 1962 premiere, and subsequent 1963 recording, of Benjamin Britten's War Requiem, for which the instrumental sections accompanying the English texts had been written specifically for the Melos, and were directed by the composer in the performance. The recording received a Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1998. In 1964 and 1965 the Melos Ensemble played several concerts at the new Wardour Castle Summer School, founded by Harrison Birtwistle, Peter Maxwell Davies and Alexander Goehr.Birtwistle timeline by Boosey & Hawkes,Wardour 1964 1965 Dr. Michael Hooper, 2009 On 16 August 1964 they played among others Monody for Corpus Christi by Birtwistle, Five Little Pieces (first performance) by Davies, and Suite Op.11 by Goehr. A chamber concert on 17 August featured the Horn Trio by Brahms, on 18 August the Quatuor pour la fin du temps by Messiaen. In 1965, the Melos Ensemble played on 16 August Pierrot Lunaire by Schoenberg. On 18 August parts of In Chymick Art, a cantata on texts by Edward Benlowes that Robin Holloway wrote for the Summer School, were performed for the first time. On 20 August they premiered two works they had commissioned, Tragoedia by Birtwistle, conducted by Lawrence Foster, and two 'In Nomine\\" of Seven in Nomine by Davies, conducted by the composer.A review of the Wardour Castle Concert 1965 The Times, 23 August 1965, p. 15Davies Premiere All Music Guide, Eugene Chadbourne == Festivals, broadcasts, tours == The Melos Ensemble performed regularly at British and International Festivals, among others Warsaw, Venice, Cheltenham, Edinburgh, Bordeaux and the Aldeburgh Festival, their first US tour was in 1966.Biography Neil Sanders Sotone Historic Recordings The group gave many BBC broadcasts, and made over 50 recordings, first with the publisher L'Oiseau- Lyre.

Hans Werner Henze composed Kammermusik 1958 for tenor, guitar and eight solo instruments, for example. In that way, the Melos Ensemble has directly and indirectly influenced music for new combinations of chamber musicians in contemporary music. == Publications == *[ Entries to the Melos Ensemble in allmusic] *Entries to the Melos Ensemble in WorldCat *Reviews in Gramophone Archive == References  External links == *Gervase de Peyer website, history of the Melos Ensemble Category:Chamber music groups Category:Musical groups established in 1950 Category:Grammy Hall of Fame Award recipients Category:English classical music groups Category:Musical groups from London Category:Contemporary classical music ensembles Category:1950 establishments in England ","title":"Melos Ensemble"},{"id":"20141265","text":"Jens Holmboe (5 November 1752 – 4 December 1804) was a Norwegian bailiff.

He was the inventor of fulminate percussion systems for firearms, which superseded the flint-lock mechanism and opened the way to modern firearms. This followed the discovery of fulminates by Edward Charles Howard in 1800. Between 1807 and 1810, Lepage invented a new way to fire portative firearms, by using the mercury fulminate priming medium to be fired by the blow of a percussion hammer. The new method permitted the abandonment of flint-lock firing mechanisms and opened the way to modern firing methods.Deanes' Manual of the History and Science of Fire-arms by John Deane p.89-90 The new mechanism used a magazine filled with fulminate primer, which would deliver a small amount of priming powder near the gun breech every time the magazine was cocked. Since the fulminate powder was highly sensitive to humidity, methods of coating the fulminate in varnish were developed, as well as methods of encasing the fulminate culminating with the invention of the percussion cap by François Prélat in 1818 and Deloubert in 1820. ==Notes== Category:1779 births Category:1822 deaths Category:French inventors ","title":"Jean Lepage"},{"id":"20141321","text":"The Leppy Hills are a mountain range in Elko County, Nevada. == References == Category:Mountain ranges of Nevada Category:Mountain ranges of the Great Basin Category:Mountain ranges of Elko County, Nevada ","title":"Leppy Hills"},{"id":"20141324","text":"WVXG (95.1 FM, \\"Classic Rock 95X\\") is a radio station licensed to serve Mount Gilead, Ohio, United States.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 7, 2008. In the episode, during a poker game, Mr. Burns wins ownership of the Austin Celtics basketball team and he decides to build a new stadium in Springfield that endangers a bee colony which Lisa built. Lisa's subplot refers to the current worldwide disappearance of bees. The episode was written by Stephanie Gillis and directed by Mark Kirkland. It marks a second use of the Christmas-themed opening, first seen in \\"Kill Gil, Volumes I & II\\". Billionaires Mark Cuban and Jeff Bezos and sportscaster Marv Albert guest star as themselves. In its original airing, the episode garnered 6.19 million viewers. It received mixed reviews from television critics. ==Plot== Mr. Burns attends the annual Billionaires' Retreat, where he wins the fictional Austin Celtics pro basketball team in a poker game against the Rich Texan. After witnessing the antics of Mark Cuban at a Dallas Mavericks game, Burns tries to win over Springfield basketball fans with his own antics. Burns fails miserably, and decides to build a luxurious sports arena. Meanwhile, Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney dare Bart to prank the second graders by hitting a beehive with his slingshot. Lisa discovers, however, the bees that should be in the hive are dead. Groundskeeper Willie explains the bees are dying all over Springfield by loss of habitat, thus contracting a fatal disease. Lisa seeks help from Homer (who at first was unwilling to save the bees until Lisa informs him that the bees make honey and, if they died, there will be no more honey) and Professor Frink who has an uninfected queen bee sting Lisa releasing pheromones which attracts many uninfected bees, which form a bee beard. After trying to keep the bees in the Simpson home, Lisa and Marge find an abandoned greenhouse for the bees to live in. However, the site of the greenhouse is exactly where Mr. Burns plans to construct his new arena. Lisa attempts to convince the town to save the bee population, but despite her logical protest that they always get into trouble when they ignore her advice, she fails when Burns informs everyone about the amazing features of his arena and threatens to trade the Excitement's recent draft pick and fan favorite, Alaskan native and Eskimo Muk Mu. Lisa becomes depressed that the bee population is slowly dying. Homer and Moe attempt to help save the bees by mating a queen bee from Lisa's hive with Moe's Africanized bees to create a hybrid bee species strong enough to survive anywhere. On the night of the grand opening of Burns' sports arena, Homer takes Lisa to the top of a hill and shows her the hive containing the hybrid bees. When Homer accidentally releases them, the bees attack Burns' new arena which resembles a bee hive. In the end, the arena is legally declared a bee sanctuary, enabling the bees to survive. At the next billionaires' retreat, Mr. Burns reveals how much the bees cost him. After it is discovered that he is four million dollars short of a billion he is kicked out of the retreat and into the millionaires' camp. Much to his horror, these millionaires got rich thanks to their low-class businesses, such as a minor-league hockey team. ==Production== Mark Cuban guest starred in the episode.The episode was written by Stephanie Gillis and directed by Mark Kirkland. Billionaires Mark Cuban and Jeff Bezos and sportscaster Marv Albert guest star as themselves. The episode marks a second use of the Christmas-themed opening, first seen in \\"Kill Gil, Volumes I & II\\". ==Cultural references== The episode's title is a reference to the expression \\"The birds and the bees\\", used by parents when explaining a sexual relationship to a child. Lisa's subplot refers to the worldwide disappearance of bees known as Colony Collapse Disorder. In a scene where Homer imagines a future without honey, a small green robot resembling WALL-E from the 2008 film WALL-E, gives him a bottle of honey and then turns Homer into a cube. The bee tombstone that set Jerry Seinfeld a reference to the 2007 film Bee Movie where Seinfeld played as the voice of Barry. The Billionaires' Retreat is the parody of the Bohemian Club. In the opening sequence, Mr. Burns appears to be Ebenezer Scrooge with Smithers as Jacob Marley from A Christmas Carol. The statue of Mr. Burns outside his new basketball arena is based on the Nike, Inc. \\"Jumpman\\" logo featuring Michael Jordan. Just before Burns is thrown out of the Billionaires' retreat, he asks Mark Cuban if he can let him \\"off the hook, for old times' sake\\" and Cuban refuses, referring to the scene in the 1972 film The Godfather in which Salvatore Tessio is led away to be executed after being revealed as a traitor. The Billionaires play Quidditch, as it is depicted in the Harry Potter film series, and use the paintings Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci, Whistler's Mother by James Abbott McNeill Whistler and The Scream by Edvard Munch as target practice. The songs featured in the episode include \\"Hip Hop Hooray\\" by Naughty by Nature during Mr. Burns' attempt to be more like Mark Cuban, and \\"Sea of Love\\" as performed by The Honeydrippers, which Homer and Moe play to their bees. Scott Joplin's \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" is also played in the episode. ==Reception== In its original airing, the episode garnered 6.19 million viewers. The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode 7/10 and said that with an episode like this \\"I just don't laugh as much as I would have liked\\". Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club gave the episode a grade of B and said that episode was \\"okay\\", but \\"boring\\". Erich Asperschlager of TV Verdict wrote: \\"Part of me knows that the only way to enjoy the modern incarnation of The Simpsons is to stop expecting its stories to make sense. [The episode is] not straightforward at all. It’s like sometime after the tenth season, The Simpsons writers started using Mad Libs to generate story ideas. In fact, I’ve got a sneaking suspicion the only reason this episode exists is because someone came up with the title 'The Burns and the Bees' and just had to make it work.\\" Harry Shearer received a nomination for a Primetime Emmy Award for Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his role as Mr. Burns, Smithers, Lenny and Dr. Hibbert in this episode, but lost to fellow Simpsons cast member Dan Castellaneta. Stephanie Gillis was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award in the Animation category in 2010 for writing the episode. The Simpsons was the only show to be nominated in the category, with the other nominated episodes being \\"Take My Life, Please\\", \\"Eeny Teeny Maya Moe\\", \\"Gone Maggie Gone\\" and \\"Wedding for Disaster\\".

After the World Wars, European global dominance faded and the doctrine of European balance was replaced with a worldwide balance of power involving the United States, Soviet Union and, in a later period, China as the modern superpowers. ==HistoryAntiquity to Westphalia=== The emergence of city-states (poleis) in ancient Greece marks the beginning of classical antiquity. The two most important Greek cities, the Ionian-democratic Athens and the Dorian-aristocratic Sparta, led the successful defense of Greece against the invading Persians from the east, but then clashed against each other for supremacy in the Peloponnesian War. The Kingdom of Macedon took advantage of the following instability and established a single rule over Greece. Desire to form a universal monarchy brought Alexander the Great to annex the entire Persian Empire and begin a hellenization of the Macedonian possessions. At his death in 323 BC, his reign was divided between his successors and several hellenistic kingdoms were formed.William C. Wohlforth, , et al. \\"Testing balance-of-power theory in world history.\\" European Journal of International Relations 13.2 (2007): 155-185 online. Rome unified Italy around the same period and then rose to prominence in the western and eastern Mediterranean through the Punic and Macedonian wars. Such a rapid expansion was followed by the so-called 'Roman Revolution', when the Gracchi, the Servile Wars, the Social War and Sulla's civil wars shook the Italian peninsula. Meanwhile, the popularity and wealth of Roman generals increased: notably Julius Caesar acquired fame for projecting military power north of the Alps into Gaul, east of the Rhine into Germania and across the English channel into Britain. A group of senators afraid of Caesar's title of dictator for life assassinated him the Ides of March of 44 BC. The adoptive son of Caesar, Octavian Augustus, defeated the killers of his father and became the first Roman Emperor (Princeps) in 27 BC.Daniel Deudney, \\"‘A Republic for Expansion’: The Roman Constitution and Empire and Balance-of-Power Theory.\\" The Balance of Power in World History (Palgrave Macmillan, London, 2007) pp. 148-175. online The Roman Empire peaked during the Pax Romana, stagnated during the crisis of the third century AD and ultimately split between the Latin West and the Greek East. Both parts of the Empire abandoned pagan polytheism in order to tolerate monotheistic Christianity and finally make it the state religion. The West collapsed around 476, following centuries of attacks by Germanic and Slavic peoples and several \\"barbarian\\" kingdoms were established on its former territory. The East continued to be ruled by the Byzantine Empire for an additional thousand years. Among the successor barbarian kingdoms in the West, that of the Franks was the largest, and under Charlemagne managed to unite most of present-day France, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, the Low Countries and Italy under one rule: he was subsequently crowned Holy Roman Emperor the day of Christmas in 800 by Pope Leo III. Meanwhile, the Iberian peninsula fell under Muslim control. The Germanic Emperor (Holy Roman Emperor) and the Roman Pontiff (Pope in Rome) came to be known as the universal powers of Europe, but then entered in conflict during the investiture controversy and the clash between their factions. Their rivalry made possible the birth of autonomous city-states in northern Italy and the rise of an independent feudal monarchy in France under the House of Capet. Around the same period, the Norse Viking expansion was taking place with the Norman conquest of England happening in 1066 and that of Sicily in 1130. With the holy land lost to Islam and the Byzantine Empire seeking help from Turks, the Pope initiated the crusades against Muslims in an attempt to restore Christian unity following the Eastern Schism of the Orthodox from the Catholics.Bryce Lyon, Medieval Constitutionalism: A Balance of Power (1961). Most of the crusades did not achieve their objective, but some of them had a massive impact on the political and economic landscape of Europe: the first crusade (1099) re-opened the trade routes in the Mediterranean and ushered the commercial revolution; the fourth crusade (1204) resulted in the formation of the Venetian maritime empire; and the sixth crusade (1228) temporarily made Frederick stupor mundi, heir of both the Kingdom of Sicily and the Holy Roman Empire, also King of Jerusalem. At the same time, the Reconquista of Christian forces was taking place in the Iberian peninsula and the kingdoms of Portugal, Castile and Aragon were formed. A vast part of the French nobility took part in the crusades under the leadership of their king: this made possible the formation of a strong centralized French monarchy. The rise of medieval France began with the Battle of Bouvines (1224) and the Avignon Papacy (1309) but ended with the outbreak of the Hundred Years' War (1337) with England and the return of the papacy to Rome (1378). As Europe recovered from the Black Death, a Renaissance in art and science began in Italy and spread to the rest of the continent. Portugal formed the first European colonial Empire in 1415 with the conquest of Ceuta. In 1453, the French expelled the English from their land and the Ottoman Turks caused the Fall of Constantinople, initiating the rise of the Ottoman Empire in Europe. In 1500, Charles V of the House of Austria was born in the Habsburg Netherlands. He inherited the territories of the Holy Roman Empire as well as the crowns of Castille and Aragon. In the Indies, recently discovered by Christopher Columbus for Castille and Aragon, he ordered the conquistadores to annex the Aztec Empire and conquer the Incas. He made use of the gold and silver coming from the Americas to finance the defence of his German territories in Austria from the Ottoman Empire (Siege of Vienna) and his Italian territories in the Duchy of Milan from France (Battle of Pavia). Styling himself as the protector of Catholicism, he resigned because of the growth of protestantism and split his territories between a Spanish Empire led by Philip II of Spain and a Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation led by Ferdinand I. The papacy launched the Catholic revival in an attempt to halt the growth of Protestantism and Ottoman expansion. Despite some successes, such as the Battle of Lepanto (1571) and the Siege of Paris (1590), the Anglo- Spanish War and the Long Turkish War questioned the Catholic ambitions. Ultimately, the Papacy lost its status and influence with the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) and many Protestant states experienced a golden age: the Netherlands (having obtained independence from both the Holy Roman Empire and the Spanish Habsburgs) formed the Dutch East India Company in Indonesia; Sweden formed an empire in northern Europe; and England began the colonization of North America. By the Treaty of Westphalia at the end of the Thirty Years' War, the Holy Roman Empire became a more decentralized entity in which constituent states, such as Prussia (which also had lands outside the Empire), were allowed to pursue their own foreign policy independent of that of the Austrian Habsburg Emperor. The Austrian Habsburgs also controlled some states outside of the Holy Roman Empire. It was France who took the status of dominant continental power from the Habsburgs thanks to the Treaty of Westphalia and the Treaty of the Pyrenees. ===English foreign policy=== In the 16th and 17th centuries, English foreign policy strove to prevent a creation of a single universal monarchy in Europe, which many believed France or Spain might attempt to create. To maintain the balance of power, the English made alliances with other states—including Portugal, the Ottoman Empire, and the Netherlands—to counter the perceived threat. These Grand Alliances reached their height in the wars against Louis XIV and Louis XV of France. They often involved the English (later the British) and Dutch paying large subsidies to European allies to finance large armies. In the 18th century, this led to the stately quadrille, with the major European powers of that century—Austria, Prussia, Great Britain, and France—changing alliances multiple times to prevent the hegemony of one nation or alliance. A number of wars stemmed, at least in part, from the desire to maintain the balance of power, including the War of the Spanish Succession, War of the Austrian Succession, the Seven Years' War, the War of the Bavarian Succession and the Napoleonic Wars. Following Britain's success in the Seven Years' War during which it was allied with Prussia, many of the other powers began to see Great Britain as a greater threat than France. Several states, most particularly France, entered the American War of Independence in the hope of overturning Britain's growing strength by securing the independence of the Thirteen colonies of British America.John R. Davis, \\"Britain and the European balance of power.\\" A companion to nineteenth-century Britain (2004): 34+ online ===19th century=== The national boundaries within Europe set by the Congress of Vienna After the end of the Napoleonic Wars, during which France directly or indirectly controlled much of Europe except for Russia, and the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved, the Concert of Europe tried to maintain the balance of power. The territorial boundaries agreed to by the victorious Great Powers (Prussia, Austria, Russia and Great Britain) at the Congress of Vienna in 1815 were maintained, and even more important there was an acceptance of the theme of balance with no major aggression.Gordon Craig, \\"The System of Alliances and the Balance of Power.\\" in J.P.T. Bury, ed., The New Cambridge Modern History, Vol. 10: The Zenith of European Power, 1830-70 (1960) p 266. Otherwise the Congress system says historian Roy Bridge, \\"failed\\" by 1823.Roy Bridge, \\"Allied Diplomacy in Peacetime: The Failure of the Congress 'System,' 1815–23\\" in Alan Sked, ed., Europe's Balance of Power, 1815–1848 (1979), pp 34–53 In 1818 the British decided not to become involved in continental issues that did not directly affect them. They rejected the plan of Tsar Alexander I to suppress future revolutions. The Concert system fell apart as the common goals of the Great Powers were replaced by growing political and economic rivalries.C.W. Crawley, \\"International Relations, 1815-1830\\" in C.W. Crawley, ed., The New Cambridge Modern History: Volume 9, War and Peace in an Age of Upheaval, 1793-1830. Vol. 9 (1965) pp 669-71, 676-77, 683-86. Artz says the Congress of Verona in 1822 \\"marked the end.\\"Frederick B. Artz, Reaction & Revolution: 1814–1832 (1934) p 170. There was no Congress called to restore the old system during the great revolutionary upheavals of 1848 with their demands for revision of the Congress of Vienna's frontiers along national lines.Paul W. Schroeder, The Transformation of European Politics: 1763–1848 (1996) p 800. Britain, with its naval, maritime, commercial and financial dominance, was committed to the European balance of power after 1815.John R. Davis, \\"Britain and the European Balance of Power,\\" in Chris Williams, ed., A Companion to Nineteenth‐Century Britain (2004) pp 34-52. Before 1850 Britain and France were the strongest powers in Europe, but by the 1850s they had become deeply concerned by the growing power of Russia, which had expanded westward towards Central Europe, and Prussia, which was increasingly assuming greater control and influence over the German lands, aside from Austria. The Crimean War of 1854–55 and the Italian War of 1859 shattered the relations among the Great Powers in Europe.René Albrecht-Carrié, A diplomatic history of Europe since the Congress of Vienna (1958) pp 65-68, 84-106. The creation in 1871 and rise of the Prussian-led German Empire (excluding Austria) as a dominant nation (Prussia had quickly defeated both Austria and France in wars) restructured the European balance of power. For the next twenty years, Otto von Bismarck managed to maintain the balance of power, by proposing treaties and creating many complex alliances between the European nations such as the Triple Alliance.Erich Eyck, Bismarck and the German Empire (1964) pp 58-68René Albrecht-Carrié, A diplomatic history of Europe since the Congress of Vienna (1958) pp 163-206. ===World Wars=== Formal and informal military and diplomatic connections in 1914 with the Triple Alliance (brown) and the Triple Entente (green) In Germany after 1890 the reckless Kaiser Wilhelm set out on his imperialist course of Weltpolitik (\\"world politics\\") to increase the empire's influence in and control over the world.Christopher Clark, Kaiser Wilhelm II (2000) pp 35–47John C.G. Wilhelm II: the Kaiser's personal monarchy, 1888–1900 (2004). Newly created alliances were proven to be fragile, something that triggered the First World War in 1914 with Germany and Austria- Hungary on one-side against Great Britain, France, Italy and Russia (until 1917) on the other. One of the objectives of the Treaty of Versailles, the main post-World War I treaty, was to abolish the dominance of the 'Balance of Power' concept and replace it with the (global) League of Nations and to form countries based mostly on ethnicity (although the diminished Austria containing only its German-speaking lands and the majority-German areas of the Czech lands were not permitted to join Germany). This idea floundered as Europe split into three principal factions in the 1920s and 1930s: liberal democratic states led by the UK and France, communist states led by the Soviet Union, and authoritarian nationalists led by Germany and Italy. The failure of the democratic states to prevent the advance of Nazi Germany ultimately led to the Second World War, which led to a temporary alliance between the UK and the Soviets. The UK did not condemn the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939, but declared war on Germany. Later they sided with the Soviet Union against Germany after the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union. ===Post-World War II: Cold War period=== During the post-Second World War era the Allies split into two blocs, a balance of power emerged among the Eastern Bloc (affiliated with the Soviet Union and the Socialist nations of Central and Eastern Europe), the Western Bloc (affiliated with the Western democracies, particularly France, the United States, and the United Kingdom), and neutral or non-aligned countries (including Ireland, Sweden, Switzerland, Austria and Yugoslavia) with Germany divided between the Western Block (northwest and southern portions of former country) and the Eastern Bloc (northeast portion, including most of Prussia's former lands) until 1989. The majority of the European democratic nations, together with Canada and the US, came together under the military alliance of NATO, which continues to this day and has expanded to other countries in Europe. The first NATO Secretary General, the British Lord Ismay, famously stated the organization's initial goal was \\"to keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down.\\" ===Post-Cold War era=== NATO Quint leaders discussing with Petro Poroshenko the Ukrainian crisis From the late 20th century, the successor state of the Soviet Union — the Russian Federation, being a potential superpower, has been a major great power, as well as a regional power in world politics, making it the primary geopolitical force in Europe. However, the four most powerful members of the European Union — the UK, France, Italy and Germany — are referred to as the Big Four of Western Europe. They are major European powers and the only EU countries individually represented as full members of the G7, the G8 and the G20. The NATO Quint is made up by the United States and the Big Four. The term G4 is especially (although not only) used to describe meeting of the four nations at the leaders' level. In addition, the term EU three (or G-3) is used to describe the grouping of foreign ministers from France, the UK and Germany (now re-unified) during the Iran nuclear talks. On the other hand, the grouping of interior ministers that includes Spain and Poland is known as the G6. Germany (which has the largest economy in Europe) is often regarded as the EU's economic leader, such as with the ongoing European sovereign debt crisis, whilst France and the United Kingdom (both permanent members of the UNSC) often lead in defence and foreign policy matters, such as the intervention in Libya in 2011. This, to an extent, represents a balancing of leadership power for the Western sphere of the continent. How this balance will change after the Brexit vote in 2016 is still an open matter. There continues however to be a wider, strategic balance of Western and (now) Russian power, albeit with the boundary between the two pushed further east since the collapse of the Soviet Union, with many former Communist countries in central Europe having since joined the EU and NATO. ==See also== * Balance of power (international relations) * Concert of Europe * International relations (1814–1919) * Treaty of Versailles * Great power ==ReferencesBibliography== * Albrecht-Carrié, René.

The show was written and hosted by Canadians Tas Melas and Phil Elder (J.E. Skeets), Australian Leigh Ellis and American Trey Kerby. It was shot, edited, and produced by Canadians Jason Doyle and Matt Osten. The show was broadcast on NBA TV from 2013 to 2019 and was also available on YouTube. They also created and released regular audio-only podcasts. ==Background== Melas, Skeets, Doyle and Osten met while attending Ryerson University's Radio and Television Arts program in Toronto, Canada from 2001–2005. Melas was the co-host of a talk show on SPIRITlive, Ryerson's Internet radio station, called the \\"Sports Doctors\\". Doyle produced the weekly program. Skeets also co-hosted a show on the station, though it was not sports related. Upon graduation, Melas worked as a story editor at The Sports Network and Doyle worked as a sound editor for Super Sonics, an audio post-production house. Skeets worked at a physician recruiting firm and Osten attended law school at McGill University. Skeets began blogging in 2005 when a friend bet him that he could not write a new post every day for a year.Blogger Interviews: J.E. Skeets, The Big Picture, Friday, May 04, 2007 The blog was called \\"J.E. Skeets\\" and was a hodgepodge of observations, photos, and videos about random, quotidian topics. Later in the year, Skeets wrote a post about basketball which was linked on Deadspin.com. Noticing a significant spike in reader traffic, Skeets began writing exclusively about basketball, usually from an irreverent and humorous perspective. He began to make his name with a popular series titled, \\"Romance on the Hardwood\\". These posts featured a photograph of two NBA players who appeared to be slow dancing accompanied by an imagined conversation between the athletes. Trey Kerby joined the team in 2010. He is the best known author of The Blowtorch's Big Book of Basketball Facts, a title that reached no. 1 on the New York Times Best Sellers List, and was Oprah's book of the week. The titled famously caused controversy in the U.K., when Richard & Judy refused to admit it to their book club, due to \\"ethical reasons\\". ==HistoryBeginnings (2006)=== Skeets soon moved his writing to a new website the group called \\"The Basketball Jones\\". Drawing on his past experience with radio, Skeets decided to use the emerging medium of podcasting to produce a basketball-related talk show. He approached Melas and Doyle with the idea and together they worked out the tone and format of the show. When it debuted in January 2006, The Basketball Jones podcast was a half-hour program recorded weekly at Doyle's house. The show immediately gained a small, but dedicated following. As its popularity increased, the three began recording shows more frequently. Each show consisted of segments dedicated to the on- and off-court happenings in the NBA separated by short musical breaks. Regular features included \\"Wanker of the Week\\", in which the hosts highlighted an NBA player, coach, or executive guilty of committing a gaffe and \\"One-on-One\\", in which the hosts took opposing views on a number of topics and argued over them in a \\"lightning-round\\" format. The show championed the \\"fan perspective\\" of sports reporting pioneered by ESPN's Bill Simmons. It also paid special attention to the NBA \\"blogosphere\\", a collection of bloggers who maintained web pages about their local teams. Many of these bloggers appeared on the show as experts on their particular team. ===2007–2013=== At the start of the '06 - '07 season, The Basketball Jones produced a daily in a 15-minute version called \\"The Fix\\" and in a half-hour weekly round-up episode. \\"The Fix\\" was recorded remotely by Doyle and the hosts interacted with each other through Skype from their respective homes. The group met on the weekend at Doyle's residence to record the longer show. Though the show's audience grew, the three partners became unsatisfied with the poor audio quality yielded by recording the show over the Internet. During the '07 - '08 season, The Basketball Jones was recorded daily in a studio at Super Sonics Productions in downtown Toronto and produced as a 20 minute show. The improved sound quality, word of mouth, and Skeets' growing popularity as a writer on Deadspin.com brought more listeners, bouncing the show into iTunes' top 100 most popular podcasts. At this time, the website, thebasketballjones.net, registered approximately 60,000 page views per month. Towards the end of the season, Skeets was hired by Yahoo! Sports to edit their basketball blog which he renamed, \\"Ball Don't Lie\\".\\"Ball Don't Lie\\", Yahoo Sports For the '08 - '09 season the show became a video podcast and was filmed in a downtown apartment building. The length of the show was shortened to 15 minutes.http://thebasketballjones.net/post/57512457/a-peek-behind-the-curtain In addition to being available on thebasketballjones.net, the video podcast was also embedded daily on the Ball Don't Lie website. Matt Osten, a Montreal native and graduate of McGill University's Faculty of Law, officially joined The Basketball Jones at the start of the '09 - '10 season. Osten, also nicknamed The Savage Bodyguard, only wears white suits while on bodyguard duty. Matt coined the phrase, \\"two towel performance\\", and regularly puts in a two towel performance during their off-season podcast, The Blank Jones. Leigh Ellis joined the podcast during the No Season Required tour. Born in Australia, Ellis is known for his unusual stories and a long-running Tweet of the week segment. The Basketball Jones recorded a live 500th episode on January 15, 2010. On the 31st of October, 2012, The Basketball Jones combined their Video podcast on iTunes with their Audio podcast. This led to them reaching the No. 1 spot on iTunes for the number of listeners. On March 1, 2010, The Basketball Jones proudly announced that they had officially joined The Score, a Canadian multi-media sports network. During the 2011-2012 NBA season, The Basketball Jones made a deal with the NBA to produce content that would be featured on NBA TV and NBA.com. During episode 1007, the final episode of the 2012–13 NBA season, The Basketball Jones announced that they would not be producing any Blank Jones podcasts during the offseason. The reason given to listeners was that TBJ was leaving the TheScore.com. It was confirmed the show would be continuing under a new umbrella, which at that time was unknown. ===As The Starters (2013–2019)=== On October 1, 2013, Tas Melas revealed that The Basketball Jones would not continue. The show relaunched in the 2013–14 NBA season on NBA TV, with episodes airing in late October. A video announcement was released on YouTube on October 2, 2013, where it was announced that TBJ was officially joining NBA TV and would continue as The Starters. The entire team has moved their operations from Toronto to the NBA TV headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. On October 21, 2013, The Starters launched their first podcast, the first of a group of previews answering 101 questions about the 2013–14 NBA season. The show has kept mostly the same format, with a few minor changes, most notably the removal of profanity. In 2019, The Starters joined The Athletic under the new name No Dunks, returning to a podcast-centred format. During this transition, Matt Osten left to pursue a writing career outside of the NBA sphere. ==FormatOriginal format=== Each podcast began with Skeets announcing the number of the episode, the date and a random phrase (example: \\"Hello, sweet world!\\", \\"More is not always better.\\", \\"I'm the one who's fighting. Not you, not you, and not you.\\" or \\"There are over a 1000 different types of bananas\\") over a random song. The \\"bouncing balls\\" opening graphics then continues with the theme song \\"Bones Attack!!\\" by The Meligrove Band. The show continued with Skeets introducing each show with the greeting, \\"Good morning, sweet world!\\". Skeets introduced Melas, Kerby (who responds with the phrase \\"ayoooo\\"), and Leigh who said the phrase \\"Girls\\" and then Matt and Doyle (whom he referred to as the man who makes the magic and drops happen). Doyle responded with \\"Hello!\\". The hosts then switched off reading the daily headlines. Then, the show was divided into one main talking segment followed by a shorter one that included viewers' questions, \\"The 'Whoa Boy' Fantasy Line of the Night\\", and the \\"Book-off picks\\", a feature in which the hosts competed at selecting winning teams based on gambling odds. The host with most losses at the end of the month had to do the 'Book-off Pay-off' in which the winner of the month chose something embarrassing for the loser to do. That was shown by the 'Book- off Pay-off: Repeat after me' on YouTube. Thursdays' shows typically featured a segment changing from week to week. Melas ended the show with a quote, to which Skeets replied, \\"Embrace the day people\\", followed by a sample of the song \\"Love Letter\\" by Easy Access Orchestra. \\"The Overdose\\", the hour-long audio-only episode on Friday, featured interview and commentary and frequently diverted from basketball into the wacky stories from the NBA's week. \\"The Overdose\\" featured the Pun Gun game, where Skeets, Melas, Osten, Kerby and Ellis made puns on an NBA player's name; also Leigh Ellis shared his Tweets of the week suggested by listeners on Twitter. Skeets' frequent malapropisms such as \\"The Internets\\" and mispronunciations such as Shane \\"Ba-ché\\", Melas' peculiar analogies and love of the phrase \\"There's no doubt about that\\", and Doyle's eclectic musical selections, as well as various \\"drops\\" including the infamous Kenny Smith quote \\"Gimme Some Raptor News\\", were all hallmarks of the show. During the podcast's first three seasons, Caroline Lesley, a New York- based actress, introduced the show and recorded several interstitials that ran at the episode's breaks. She has not been incorporated into the video podcast. Due to a switch in studios caused by Rogers Media purchasing The Score television channel, but not the website and mobile assets, The Basketball Jones discontinued distributing The Fix as a video podcast at the beginning the 2012–13 season. The Basketball Jones still live-streams video from The Fix on YouTube, but only releases the audio on their podcast feed. Additionally, \\"The Overdose\\" only appeared on the Grantland Network every third Friday for the 2012–13 season. ==Other work== Skeets' writing has appeared on ESPN.com and Deadspin.com. Melas has appeared as a pundit on Raptors NBA TV. Doyle is the co-host and producer of \\"Idol Chatter\\", a podcast about reality television. He has also done sound editing work for many animated television programs including Atomic Betty, Carl Squared, and Johnny Test. The show has also been featured on ESPN, The New York Times, and The Globe and Mail. For the 2012 and 2013 NBA seasons, the podcast was featured on Bill Simmons' Grantland Network podcast. ==References * \\"The Starters\\" official website on NBA.com * * Category:Comedy and humor podcasts Category:Basketball mass media Category:2013 podcast debuts Category:2019 podcast endings ","title":"The Starters"},{"id":"20141529","text":"Tregan is a village and a former municipality in the Elbasan County, central Albania.

She is the founder and executive director of the nonprofit PAVE: Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment. ==ActivismKidnapping and assault=== Rose was kidnapped by Robert Koppa at knife point on July 13, 1996, from the Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg, Illinois, where she worked when she was seventeen years old. Rose was approached from behind and her assailant held a \\"sharp object\\" to her throat. She was driven to a forest preserve in Wauconda, Illinois, where she was sexually assaulted. He forced her to change into a dress, forced her to perform sexual acts on him and then was allowed to change back into her clothes. Koppa then drove her to a rear stairwell of One Schaumburg Place and left her. Rose then contacted mall security. Rose and her parents contacted the police after she was released. She later picked Koppa out of a police lineup, identifying him as her assailant. On July 18, 1996, the police charged Koppa with \\"aggravated kidnapping, aggravated criminal sexual abuse and armed violence.\\" Koppa was also suspected as being the perpetrator of several other similar crimes. Koppa was on parole for murder when he kidnapped Rose. Koppa was convicted on \\"four counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse, two counts of aggravated kidnapping and two counts of armed violence\\" in June 2000. While the trial had been ongoing, Rose, along with other victims, had been circulating a petition to \\"urge legislators to get tough on sex offenders.\\" In 1998, the Illinois General Assembly passed the Sexually Violent Persons Commitment Act. and Rose has appeared on an episode of 48 Hours: Live To Tell called \\"I Remember Everything\\" (aired October 21, 2014, on CBS), The Montel Williams Show, I Survived..., The John Walsh Show, and newscasts across the country promoting her organization PAVE. Rose has presented workshops and given speeches at various conferences, military trainings, and on college campuses throughout the United States. In 2005, she was giving more than 100 speeches a year to high schools and college campuses. ===PAVE: Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment=== Rose founded PAVE: Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment in 2001 when she was still a senior at the University of Wisconsin.PAVE PAVE uses education and action to shatter the silence of sexual violence. PAVE's work has been illustrated on CNN and The Today Show. PAVE has created educational programming and tools as well as grassroots action campaigns. In 2002, PAVE produced a documentary called Transition to Survivor Parts 1 & 2 in which sexual assault survivors tell their stories. In the film, one woman talks about \\"blocking\\" her memories, becoming anorexic and self- harming. Another cries and talks of suicide. Eventually all the survivors went through counseling, friends, and family support. PAVE's Survivor Justice Campaign aims to bring awareness to perceived acts of misconduct towards victims of sexual assault throughout the criminal justice process. The organization, PAVE, inspired the creation of a chapter at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire and a men's sexual assault awareness group, Men Opposed to Sexual Assault (MOSA). In 2005, Rose released a CD-ROM called \\"Sexual Violence: It Can Happen to You,\\" in order to help educate people about sexual violence. Binding Project  Through PAVE, Rose launched the Binding Project: Breaking Old Binds, Creating New Ties. The Binding Project is an international art empowerment campaign where participants write a word of empowerment on plastic zip ties, one to wear and one to send back to PAVE to be included in an installation art piece.

The forerunners of the Spanish throne were the following: *Kings of Asturias *Kings of Navarre *Kings of León *Kings of Galicia *Kings of Castile *Kings of Aragon These seven lineages were eventually united by the marriage of the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand II of Aragon (king of the Crown of Aragon) and Isabella I of Castile (queen of the Crown of Castile). Although their kingdoms continued to be separate, with their personal union they ruled them together as one dominion. Spain was thereafter governed as a dynastic union by the House of Trastamara, the House of Habsburg, and the House of Bourbon until the Nueva Planta decrees merged Castile and Aragon into one kingdom. During the First Spanish Republic (1873–74), Spain had heads of state known as the President of the Executive Power. It is only during the Second Spanish Republic (1931–39), however, that the official title of President of Spain (or President of the Republic) existed. Today, Spain is a constitutional monarchy, and there is thus no person holding the title of President of Spain. However, the Prime Minister holds the official title of President of the Government. ==Kingdom of Spain (1479–1873)House of Trastámara (1479–1555)=== Under Isabella and Ferdinand, the royal dynasties of Castile and Aragon, their respective kingdoms, were united into a single line. Historiography of Spain generally treats this as the formation of the Kingdom of Spain, but in actuality, the two kingdoms continued for many centuries with their own separate institutions. It wasn't until the Nueva Planta decrees of the early 18th century that the two lands were formally merged into a single state. ===House of Habsburg (1516–1700)=== Following the deaths of Isabella (1504) and Ferdinand (1516), their daughter Joanna inherited the Spanish kingdoms. However, she was kept prisoner at Tordesillas due to her mental disorder. As Joanna's son, Charles I (the future Holy Roman Emperor Charles V), did not want to be merely a regent, he proclaimed himself king of Castile and Aragon jointly with his mother. Subsequently, Castilian and Aragonese Cortes alleged oath to him as co-monarch with his mother. Upon her death, he became sole King of Castile and Aragon, and the thrones were left permanently united to Philip II of Spain and successors. Traditional numbering of monarchs follows the Castillian crown; i.e. after King Ferdinand (II of Aragon and V of Castile jure uxoris as husband of Queen of Castille Isabella I), the next Ferdinand was numbered VI. Likewise, Alfonso XII takes his number following that of Alfonso XI of Castile rather than that of Alfonso V of Aragon, the prior Spanish monarchs with that name. { style=\\"text-align:center; background:#E6E6FA; width:100%\\"  ! !

Published by Yale University Press, 2001. Upon any possible refusal of the undivided Spanish possessions, the Crown of Spain would be offered next to Philip's younger brother Charles, duc de Berry, or, next, to Archduke Charles of Austria. Archduke Charles of Austria had a legal right to the Spanish throne due to the fact that Charles's father, Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor, was the son of Charles' aunt Maria Anna of Austria, but Philip still had the better claim because Philip's grandfather, King Louis XIV of France, was the son of Charles' aunt Anne of Austria, the older of the sisters of Philip IV. However, Philip IV had stipulated in his will the succession should pass to the Austrian Habsburg line, and the Austrian branch also claimed that Maria Theresa of Spain, Philip's grandmother, had renounced the Spanish throne for herself and her descendants as part of her marriage contract. This was countered by the French claim that it was on the basis of a dowry that had never been paid.Durant, Will. \\"The Age of Louis XIV\\", p.699. Simon and Schuster, New York 1963. Thus, the war broke out and Archduke Charles was proclaimed king of Spain, as Charles III, opposite to Philip V.He was proclaimed in Vienna (), and also in Madrid in the years 1706 and 1710. Charles renounced his claims to the Spanish throne in the Treaty of Rastatt of 1714, but was allowed the continued use of the styles of a Spanish monarch for his lifetime.

During the early 1980s, she was one of the leading new wave vocalists in SFR Yugoslavia. == Career Early career=== Slađana Milošević was born in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. Her talent for music became very apparent at the early age, so she started education in classical music at the age of five, playing piano.Official Biography of Slađana Miloševi Few years later, her interest turned to studying violin. At the age of twelve she became a singer and a bass-guitarist in a rock and roll school band, though she had not given up violin playing. She recorded a first single at the age of fifteen, playing violin and singing Indian influenced music with a group \\"Ganesha\\". ===1971—1977: Music groups=== From then on, her interests had shifted towards various artistic expressions such as acting, playing music and dancing in the fringe theatres and experimental movies. She acted in Belgrade's Ex Art Theatre, Atelje 212 Theatre and in Academic Kino Club Krsmanović. As a violinist, a member of Radio Television Belgrade Orchestra, her career continued doing studio work. Nevertheless, playing in a big orchestra appeared to be an obstacle for a further creative development, so she decided to proceed as a soloist. As a singer, she had won her first prize at \\"Maglaj Youth Festival\\" in 1974. In 1976, she toured the Soviet Union as a soloist in Sasha Subota Orchestra, where she had recorded a Compilation of World Hits LP and a single \\"Mikado\\" for Soviet label Melodiya. Besides extensive touring with hundreds of concerts performed throughout former Soviet Union, she took part in numerous TV shows. One of the highlights was her interpretation of Marina Tsvetaeva's poem \\"I Like When You Are Yearning for Me\\", sung in Russian on Moscow TV, in a special birthday greeting for Soviet Union's President Leonid Brezhnev. ===1977—1987: Successful solo artist=== Being in constant discordance with restrictive regime and the media, despite all the efforts, she could not release a solo record in her homeland Yugoslavia for many years. Thus, she invests her funds and finally manages to produce and release the first single in 1977. Unexpectedly, it had achieved an immediate success hitting No. 1 on the charts. Milošević's provocative first song \\"Au, Au\\" caused controversial reactions. However, her creative potential, persistence and consistence of ideas had won over. She stimulated and influenced younger musicians and other less courageous, to follow her path. From then on, every song she had released hit the top of the charts: “Au, Au” (1977), “Simpatija” (1978), \\"Sexy dama\\" (1978), then \\"Amsterdam\\", and \\"Očigledno nije mi svejedno\\", off of an Gorim od želje da ubijem noć LP (1979). Milošević’s fame spread throughout the entire region and the surrounding countries. At midnight, Hungarian audience celebrated with Alexandra an arrival of the New Year 1979, through her one-hour performance on National TV, Budapest. In 1982, as a Special guest, she embarked with her band on a national Yugoslav tour with English rockabilly legends Matchbox. In 1983, she started a band \\"Neutral Design\\" in Munich, Germany and released a self-titled album. Musicians who took part in this project collaborated with stars and bands known worldwide such as: Santana, Nina Hagen Band, etc. Songs off of this LP were broadcast and sold in West Germany, Sweden, Yugoslavia and other European countries. A single \\"Das Licht von Kairo / Miki, Miki\\" released in Yugoslavia, became a mega hit. At Opatija Festival 1984 Milošević won a \\"Special Award for Interpretation\\" for the composition \\"Samsara\\". Another great success followed, with maxi-single \\"Princeza\\", a duet with Dado Topić, which premiered at the Jugovizija 1984. In the summer of that year, Alexandra filmed a 24 minutes animated show \\"The Girl in a World of Chips\\", for Bosnian TV, Sarajevo. The show was awarded a Plaquette at the international Montreux TV Festival. It also took \\"The Best Yugoslav TV Show of the Year\\" award on national \\"Struga TV Competition\\". Milošević had continued cooperation with her colleagues abroad and moved to London to work with the likes of Alan Darby, Russell Bell and Peter Godwin (David Bowie's songwriter). She also did music for commercials for BBC1 Advertising Department. As a composer and arranger she contributed in the making of Alan Darby's LP, released in Great Britain in 1985, on CBS Records. She took part in the \\"U.S.E. Project\\" (United States of Europe, song performed by Alan Darby, author Midge Ure of Ultravox), recorded in Stevie Wonder’s studios in Paris where she took a role of a vocal producer assistant. In 1985, composition \\"Princess\\" was awarded a \\"Grand Prize\\" at Mesam Festival, Belgrade, winning \\"Song of the Year\\" title. She supported organization of Yugoslav Live Aid (International movement for hunger relief in Africa, originated by Bob Geldof) and took part in a song dedicated to the cause, titled \\"Za milion godina\\" (1986). Next success, composition \\"Fantastično putovanje\\", was performed on Mesam Festival 1986.Mesam – 2. Međunarodni Sajam Muzike – Parada Hitova at Discogs Soon after, Italian National Television with producer Gian Luigi Morgia, filmed her 20 minutes show for RAI2 TV channel. ===1988—1990: Yugoslav icon of 1980s=== In 1988, Milošević did a successful remake of a song \\"Dolazi zima\\" at the author's (Dušan Mihajlović) request. Album Aleksandra Slađana Milošević & Darko Kraljić with mellow jazz ballads, (an exception to her rock style), was recorded in 1987. That same year, a song off of the album \\"Bez nade\\" won \\"Grand Prize\\" at Mesam Festival. During her career, she performed title songs for several movies: Crazy Years, National Class and for few documentary movies. Frequently she had been a guest vocalist and a guitarist on other musician's albums such as: Dado Topić, Leb i Sol, Goran Milošević (Slađana's brother, singer of Generacija 5), Nityananda, YU grupa and others. She took part in numerous humanitarian projects. She was the originator and the executive producer of the Charity Festival \\"United Yu-Rock Forces\\", organized for the benefit of paraplegics in Belgrade in 1988. Belgrade Paraplegic Organization nominated her an \\"Honorable Member\\" for the support she had given to the cause. Thus far, doing concerts she had moved through hundreds of cities in the Soviet Union, from the polar region of Murmansk to the south of Crimea. From Niagara Falls through Chicago, Cleveland, Mississippi, New York City to Los Angeles and many other cities in the USA, West Germany, Hungary, Greece, China, Canada and the entire former Yugoslavia. In 1988, she joined the group of young classical composers from Belgrade Conservatorium recording and performing new classical artistic music. In 1989, composition \\"Toccata\\" by Igor Gostusky with Milošević’s vocal interpretation, had won two first prizes at the Experimental Classical Music Contest in Opatija and Munich. That same year, Slađana Milošević was invited to take part in the Invitational Contest of International Friendly Cities Singers Meeting in Beijing, China. She had won a \\"Special Honorary Award\\" for an overall two-part competition that included interpretation of a traditional Chinese song and her original music. In a free form competition she had won a \\"Silver Cup Award\\". Since she was so well received by Chinese audience, for whom this was one of the first encounters with western music, she was invited to perform in various concert-venues and television shows. The success of the first tour in China resulted in yet another invitation in 1989, when she performed a number of concerts and TV shows including a concert at the famous Pierre Cardin’s Maxim's. Chinese \\"Hundred Flowers Records\\" signed and compiled Milošević’s hit songs for their market in 1989. Upon returning to Europe she co hosted a TV periodical titled \\"Cultural Bridge Beijing-Belgrade\\", produced by TV Belgrade. Further on, she continued to contribute in maintaining and developing cultural relations between China and Yugoslavia. In 1989, she joined Baby Sister, headlining band on Sunset strip rock club scene in Los Angeles, California. A contract with a legendary American manager Richard Papasian and his management company Artists at Work was soon signed. After completing short tours in Yugoslavia and Switzerland she worked on a new demo- material in London. ===1990—1999=== In 1990, she continued working on her album with American recording and production team in Los Angeles that included major American celebrities, such as Guns N' Roses songwriter West Arkeen, Lary Wilkens, Jeff Buckley, Derek Davies, John Buxter with whom she did music for a Canadian CD-ROM production company. In the meanwhile she worked on improving her guitar skills, studying with Hollywood's MIT reputable instructors: Scott Henderson, Bruce Bouillet, Scott Van Zen, James Hagadone and others. During that time she appeared on American TV shows and live scene. Besides furthering her musical career, she enrolled in a Business school and specialized in the investment field, becoming a stockbroker. In this position she worked in film industry (Renegade Film Productions), digital communications (Digital Communications Inc.), interactive multimedia industry and projects in developing new computer technologies. After connecting with Tania Delic's International Trust Peace Fund, which enabled continuation of her musical endeavors, she visited Yugoslavia in 1995. She recorded five new songs among which \\"Times are Changing\\" a collaboration with American author Derek Davis. She scripted and directed an animated video clip for \\"Times are Changing\\" in 1995. The following 1996, she and her brother Goran Milošević, recorded a duet \\"One must forgive\\" (also released on Goran's album). Milošević continued appearing in numerous TV shows and live performances in Yugoslavia and Europe. In 1997, she started working on a material for the new album. During that period she visited China twice, where in Beijing she had directed a video clip for a title song \\"Harmony\\" for the album soon to be released. A video was a symbolic tale of man's discordance with nature, which poses a treat to his existence. In spring of 1998, CD Harmony – Compilation of Ballads vol. 1 was promoted in the artificial garden of Eden, Aleksandra designed for that purpose. When Serbia and Belgrade were bombed by NATO in spring of 1999, Aleksandra and her brother recorded and shot a video clip for \\"No More Tears\\", a song they wrote together. It was an emotional call against violence and the sadness it consequently causes. Finnish singer Janne Hurme recorded this song for the Finnish market, where it reached a considerable success. The first video clip off of the album Animal Tested soon to be released, Alexandra scripted and directed in December 1999. It was a controversial \\"Legalize Freedom\\", which was, due to the rules of the repressive political regime, immediately banned on almost all TV stations in Yugoslavia. ===2000—2003=== On January 13, 2000, Serbian (Julian) New Year celebration day, Milošević delivered the award to the \\"Most Resisting Media Reporter\\", political prisoner at the time. The celebration – protest was organized by \\"Otpor!\\" (Yugoslav Youth Resistance) at the main Belgrade's town square. During the protests against the authoritarian political regime of, at the time Yugoslav President Slobodan Milošević, Slađana Milošević took an active role. Later that year, over 100 000 people were present on Belgrade's Republic Square during the Democratic Opposition gatherings organized by NGO G17+, when Slađana took stage to play a set with her band. She joined the efforts of the people of Serbia in their strife for freedom and request for the new government. She also took part in \\"Vreme je\\" (The Time has Come) project conceptualized by ANEM (Association of Independent Media) and G17+. She sang and played the song in support of the awakening of the democratic awareness in Serbia and the first free elections. She had played concerts on public squares during the entire democratic campaign and spoke on the media in favor of it. After speaking at a Press Conference in Belgrade's Media Center in July 2000 with Mlađan Dinkić, one of G17+ leaders (former Treasurer in Đinđić’s Government, current Minister of Economy of Serbia), she was arrested in her residence. There was neither explanation nor there were any charges brought up. After questioning, she was let free. Voice of America soon reported about this harassment, which has continued for Milošević for some time. In the year 2000, Slađana's album Animal Tested got released in Great Britain for Wastelands Unlimited Record Label. She commented: “This album of mine is created to challenge stupidity and backwardness, and is a voice against all-out manipulation.” The second clip off of the album, “My Cross is Bleeding”, was also self written and directed in summer 2000. Due to her efforts in bringing new solutions to the disorganized music industry, Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Serbia appointed Aleksandra Slađana Milošević a “Coordinator of the Reform of Music Industry in Yugoslavia” in March 2001. RTS Radio \\"Program 202\\" produced 8 episodes of a one-hour weekly radio show she wrote and hosted, titled \\"Animal Tested\\". Her first literary achievement (with co-author Dr. Jasmina Malešević) Adam Don't Get Mad, was published and released by \\"Draslar Partner\\", on September 4, 2001. As a director and a screenwriter, Aleksandra promoted the book, putting up an outdoor theatrical performance in Belgrade's Knez Mihailova Street. One of the critic's highlights of the book Adam Don't Get Mad is the commentary made by one of the world most famous living authors Paulo Coelho: \\"When I first met Alexandra in ‘97, I was struck by the boldness and originality of her self-expression. Then I spoke to her and quickly noticed her acumen and sharp wit. Over the years we've kept in touch. I've learned that Alexandra is not only a versatile and eclectic person, but a highly resourceful individual as well. She has something that I've always admired in people: a heart to dream and courage to make her dreams come true. I hope that this book will just be the beginning of a long and rewarding writing career”. In the year 2002, her record label PGP RTS, released the greatest hits compilation Metamorfoza, a triple CD box set. The compilation was to celebrate her 25 Years Jubilee. Slađana also shot Metamorphosis, one- hour TV show, for the national TV RTS. ==DiscographyStudio albums=== # Gorim od želje da ubijem noć (PGP-RTB, 1979)GORIM OD ZELJE DA UBIJEM NOC at sladjana.com # Neutral design (Jugoton, 1983)Neutral design at Discogs # Alexandra Slađana Milošević & Darko Kraljić, with Darko Kraljić (PGP-RTB, 1988)Alexandra Slađana Milošević & Darko Kraljić at Discogs # Slađana+Dado, with Dado Topić (PGP-RTB, 1989) # Animal Tested (Wastelands Unlimited, 2000)Animal Tested at Discogs ===Compilation albums=== # Alexandra S.

At , it narrowly misses out on being the highest peak in the area, the title instead going to nearby Great Whernside (704 metres). The summit is marked by a trig point. == Routes of ascent == Buckden Pike offers walks a few different routes. Perhaps the easiest and shortest route up the mountain is a bridleway from Buckden, although this is steep and boggy in parts, and therefore somewhat unsuitable for cyclists and those on horseback. Another route, on Access Land, follows Buckden Beck as far as the disused Buckden Lead Mine, then joins a Permitted Footpath to the summit. A longer and more challenging walk is the circular route taking in Buckden, Buckden Pike, Great Whernside and Kettlewell. Walkers can start and finish at either of the car parks in Buckden or Kettlewell - traditionally the leg along the River Wharfe (part of the Dales Way) is completed at the end of the day for an easier finish. == Buckden Pike Memorial Cross == To the south of the summit is a memorial cross, dedicated to the memory of five Polish airmen of the Polish Air Force 18th Polish Operational Training Unit based at RAF Bramcote who crashed their Wellington Bomber on 30 January 1942. The memorial was created by, with help from various locals, the sole survivor of the crash Jozef \\"Joe\\" Fusniak, and completed on 8 August 1973. Fusniak died in July 2017. == The view == There are fine views from the summit. The most extensive are to the East and West. To the East is the ridge running from Little Whernside to the summit of Wharfedale's highest peak, Great Whernside. To the West are views into the heart of the Yorkshire Dales, including mountains such as The Yorkshire Three Peaks, as well as closer peaks such as Firth Fell and Yockenthwaite Moor. To be found close to the summit is a large wooden pole, standing vertically; it has a number of large holes focused on different views - this used to be labelled with information cards but is no longer. == Buckden Pike Fell Race == View of Buckden Pike, from the north-west on Kidstones Scar View west from Buckden Pike summit cairn, with Pen-y-ghent, Ingleborough and Whernside visible in the distance Every year, Buckden Pike is host to the Buckden Pike Fell Race, which is held on the third Saturday in June and coincides with Buckden village gala. The race was first run in 1981 on a course designed by Peter Jebb. In 1987, Peter altered the course to make it tougher and more interesting and it has remained unchanged ever since and this was the course on which the records were set. It has now become a classic race in the fell runners calendar and this is recognised by the fact that it is regularly selected as an English championship race. The race record is held by Colin Donnelly who, in 1988, completed the course in a time of 30:51. The women's record is held by Carol Greenwood who in 1993, finished with a time of 36:32. == See also == *List of peaks in the Yorkshire Dales == References == * \\"Buckden Pike\\", Buckden, Wharfedale Community Website * The Buckden Pike Memorial Cross Homepage *Buckden Pike Walk ==External links== Category:Marilyns of England Category:Peaks of the Yorkshire Dales Category:Wharfedale ","title":"Buckden Pike"},{"id":"20141906","text":"Izquierda Mirandesa (IM) is a Spanish political party from the city of Miranda de Ebro (province of Burgos).

Today, the legislature is made of two elements: the monarch of Canada, represented by the Lieutenant Governor of Newfoundland and Labrador, and the unicameral assembly called the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly. The legislature was first established in 1832. Like the Canadian federal government, Newfoundland and Labrador uses a Westminster-style parliamentary government, in which members are sent to the House of Assembly after general elections. The leader of the party with the most seats is called upon by the Lieutenant Governor of Newfoundland and Labrador to form a government and assume the position of premier Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador and Executive Council of Newfoundland and Labrador. The premier acts as Newfoundland and Labrador's head of government, while the Queen of Canada is head of state. The legislature was originally bicameral. From 1832 to 1934, it had an upper house called the Legislative Council of Newfoundland. That house was abolished in 1934. Between 1934 and Newfoundland's entry into Canadian Confederation in 1949, Newfoundland was under Commission of Government, and the General Assembly was suspended. ==List of General AssembliesPre-Confederation=== {  - !

He was the son of Sir Thomas Eustace (1480–1549), 1st Viscount Baltinglass and Margaret Talbot, daughter of Sir Peter Talbot of Malahide Castle, County Dublin. ==Early life== Little is known of his early life except that he seems to have lived at Blackrath (Calverston) until succeeding to the Baltinglass title and family estate at Harristown in 1549. This branch of the Eustace family held strongly to the Catholic faith through the Reformation. As a boy, Roland's father had completed New Abbey near Kilcullen which was dissolved by Henry VIII in 1539. In 1558, he took his seat in the first Irish Parliament of Queen Elizabeth, but strongly opposed her Act of Uniformity of that year and for this and other actions, he was ordered to be arrested in 1567 and conveyed to London, but the order was not carried out. During the interval, however he had been commissioned as one of the Justices of the Peace for County Kildare during the temporary absence of the Lord Deputy in 1561. ==Family== Roland Eustace married Joan, daughter of James Butler, 8th Baron Dunboyne in about 1528. They had six sons and two daughters. The daughters were: * Joan, who married Sir Barnaby Fitzpatrick, 2nd Baron Upper Ossory; and * Eleanor, who married Sir Edmund Butler of Cloughgrenan, second son of the 9th Earl of Ormond, and was the mother of Catherine, fourth wife of William Eustace of Castlemartin. The sons were: * James Eustace, 3rd Viscount Baltinglass, (1530–1585) * Edmund, who married Frances Pipho and secondly Joan, daughter of Richard Walsh of Carrickmines. Edmund was involved with his brothers in the Baltinglass Rebellion and escaped to Scotland in 1583 and later to Spain where he served in the Armada in 1588. He died childless in Portugal in 1597; * Thomas, was executed in 1582 for his involvement in the Baltinglass Rebellion. * William, fourth son was believed to have been slain in battle in 1581, for it was officially reported to Sir Francis Walsingham, Secretary of State in London, \\"Head of William Eustace, another Baltinglass brethren, taken this morning.\\" This report may not have been true because a branch of the Eustace family at Robertstown, County Kildare later made an unsuccessful claim to the Baltinglass title. * Walter Eustace was captured in 1583 and executed. * Richard Eustace, was living in Paris at the time of the Rebellion arranging for delivery of ammunition and supplies to aid his brothers. He later became a priest in Rome. ==References== Tickell, Sir Eustace F; The Eustace Family and Their Lands in County Kildare; (1955); Journal of the Co.

The industry, which provides international transportation, logistic and household services, cover the ocean division, air freight division, land freight division, custom brokerage division, packing, insurance and warehousing. ==History== Lebanese shipping, which witnessed flourishing periods in its early history, had its main expansion in the mid 20th century. Before 1975 the port of Beirut was a major entrepôt for the Middle East, especially for goods bound for Damascus and Amman. In 1974 approximately 3.4 million tons of goods were unloaded at the Beirut docks, 668,000 tons were loaded, and 932,000 tons of transit goods were handled. When the Civil War began, however, the port became a major battleground. Battles also took place there in subsequent clashes between 1978 and 1987. Despite strenuous efforts to restore the port to full working order, by 1987 it had yet to regain anything like its former prominence. Between the start of the Civil War in 1975 until 1983, the port's best year was 1980, when some 2.7 million tons of cargo were unloaded, 248,056 tons were loaded, and 209,080 tons were handled in transit. The Israeli siege of Beirut led to a drastic drop in port activity in 1982, when goods handled fell to less than two-thirds of the 1980 level. Lebanon's other traditional ports at Tyre and Sidon also have had troubled histories. Tyre suffered during the Civil War, during the Israeli invasions of 1978 and 1982, and during other Israeli military actions. Sidon was similarly afflicted, escaping only the 1978 assault. Both ports have also witnessed some internal conflict. After Israel's 1984 pullout from much of Lebanon, however, Tyre appeared to enjoy a revival of its local economy. Although Sidon suffered from further Shia-Palestinian conflict, it recovered modestly, and its export trade increased in early 1987. Israel has persistently intervened in Lebanese maritime affairs. Its actions ranged from dispatching gunboats to positions off Beirut, a fairly common occurrence, to closing ports under Israeli control, such as Tyre and Sidon in 1984. From time to time, Israeli forces searched ships bound to or from Lebanese ports. In 1984, late 1986, and early 1987, Israel also stopped several ships ferrying passengers between Larnaca in Cyprus and Juniyah, the principal port of the Maronite heartland. Israel claimed that the ships were being used to infiltrate Palestinian guerrillas into Lebanon and warned that the Larnaca-Juniyah link would be closed altogether if the vessels continued to carry Palestinian fighters.http://www.country-data.com/cgi- bin/query/r-8009.html. Retrieved 10 November 2008. ==Growth== Although the shipping industry witnessed some past downturns however current numbers show increasing records and expanding activities. Lebanon's Port of Beirut TEU activity up to July, 2008 reached 287,898 TEUs, representing an increase of 16% from the same period last year. On the other hand, Port of Beirut TEU activity increased 30.9% year on year to 444,165 in 2007. Retrieved 10 November 2008. With these records, expectations of future growth in the shipping industry are up to 30%, thus making it one of the leading Middle Eastern countries in this industry. ==Lebanese Shipping Companies== Some notable Lebanese shipping companies include: * GIFCO Freight Forwarding Company * IFFCO Shipping Lebanon * ABC Shipping Co * ORIENT SHIPPING & TRADING COMPANY S.A.R.L. * ABOU MERHI LINES S.A.L. * METZ SHIPPING AGENCY LIMITED * MOLLER-MAERSK, A.P., GROUP * Sabra Freight Services ==Environmental impact of shippingSee also== * Economy of Lebanon * Port of Beirut * Beirut Rafiq Hariri International Airport ==References *Lebanese Shipping Statistics for year 2006 Category:Economy of Lebanon Category:Merchant navy ","title":"Lebanese shipping"},{"id":"20142067","text":"Huffman is an unincorporated community in southwest Craig County, Virginia.

The eighteenth named storm and twelfth hurricane of the 1969 Atlantic hurricane season, Martha developed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on November 21\\\\. Initially, the storm developed with sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h), skipping tropical depression status. It remained stationary and quickly intensified into a hurricane. Martha attained maximum sustained winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) on November 22\\\\. Subsequently, Martha weakened and drifted southward. On November 24, Martha made landfall in Veraguas Province, Panama, as a strong tropical storm. The system weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated over land on November 25\\\\. Because the storm weakened prior to landfall, strong winds were not expected or reported in the impacted countries. In Panama, more than of precipitation may have fallen in some areas. Agricultural land was flooded in Almirante, Bocas del Toro and streets became inundated in low-lying areas of Puerto Armuelles, Chiriquí. The storm also brought significant rains to Costa Rica. Flooding and mudslides isolated most of the capital city of San José. Numerous streets were inundated in Golfito. Damage in Costa Rica reached $30 million (1969 USD) and 5 deaths were reported. ==Meteorological history== Winds aloft in the vicinity of San Andrés, Colombia and the Panama Canal Zone indicated that a low-level circulation developed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on November 20. According to the Best Track, Tropical Storm Martha formed at 1200 UTC on November 21, with an initial wind speed of 50 mph (85 km/h). Thus, Martha skipped tropical depression status. Centered about northeast of Bocas Town, Bocas del Toro, the storm remained stationary for 24 hours after tropical cyclogenesis. Martha immediately began deepening, becoming a hurricane at 0000 UTC on November 22. Operationally, the National Hurricane Center initiated advisories at 0300 UTC and erroneously indicated that it was a tropical depression and noted that conditions did not favor significant intensification. Later on November 22, a reconnaissance flight indicated Martha deepened to a compact hurricane, and the tropical cyclone attained a maximum sustained wind speed of 90 mph (150 km/h). Reconnaissance aircraft measured a minimum barometric pressure of , though it was later corrected to 979 mbar (28.92 inHg) in the post-season analysis. The eye feature was about wide and it was described as poorly organized, although convection was increasing. After reaching peak intensity, Martha began drifting due south and slowly weakened. At 1200 UTC on November 23, the tropical cyclone diminished to a tropical storm, after winds decreased to 70 mph (110 km/h) and a reconnaissance flight recorded an increased barometric pressure of . The storm maintained that intensity, and shortly before 1800 UTC on November 24, Martha made landfall in rural Veraguas Province, Panama, about east of the mouth of the Calovebora River. Operationally, winds were thought to be only 50 mph (85 km/h) when the storm moved inland. Martha was the only tropical cyclone on record to make landfall in Panama, although it is possible that other Panama tropical cyclones were not detected. The storm rapidly weakened inland, deteriorating to tropical depression status early on November 25, twelve hours before dissipating over southern Ngöbe-Buglé Comarca. ==Preparations and impact== Residents were warned to anticipate tides 5 feet (1.5 m) above normal near the expected point of landfall. Later, the forecast was decreased to 3 feet (0.9 m) above normal and pertained to tides in the Mosquito Gulf and Chiriqui Lagoon. Since Martha was a relatively weak tropical cyclone, flash floods were emphasized as the greatest threat. The National Hurricane Center stated that rainfall could exceed 10 inches (254 mm). Additionally, Arnold Sugg of National Hurricane Center warned residents of gale force winds and heavy precipitation, advising people living between Bluefields, Nicaragua and Almirante, Bocas del Toro, Panama to take precautions. In Panama, the storm dropped at least of precipitation, especially in the western portions of the country. As a result, at least half of agricultural land in Almirante, Bocas del Toro, was flooded, causing extensive crop damage. In Puerto Armuelles, Chiriquí, persistent rainfall led to street flooding and inundated other areas. Similar conditions were reported in Golfito, Costa Rica. The effects of Martha resulted in five deaths, all of which occurred in Costa Rica. The nation incurred flooding from heavy rainfall, which caused significant destruction. The capital city of San José received flooding. In all, damages were estimated near $30 million (1969 USD). ==See also== *Geography of Panama *Hurricane Cesar–Douglas *Hurricane Otto ==References== Category:1969 in the Caribbean Category:1969 Atlantic hurricane season Category:Category 1 Atlantic hurricanes Category:Hurricanes in Costa Rica Category:Hurricanes in Nicaragua Category:Hurricanes in Panama ","title":"Hurricane Martha"},{"id":"20142174","text":"Tamás Buday (born July 5, 1952) is a Canadian sprint canoe coach and retired Hungarian sprint canoer.

On November 29, 2012, Lenz confirmed that Everly split and will no longer be making music. ==HistoryDebut=== Lenz and Sweeney formed Everly in 2008. On November 5, 2008, Everly released a three-song acoustic EP on iTunes entitled Mission Bell. The duo released the EP through music outlets, iTunes, Amazon and CD Baby. Mission Bell featuring \\"Home Is Me – You Are Mine,\\" \\"Stars,\\" and \\"Little Children,\\" all written by Lenz and Sweeney. On November 15, 2008, the duo released three additional tracks added onto Mission Bell titled \\"Hotel Café,\\" \\"Mrs. Scott,\\" and \\"Scheming Star,\\" and a bonus track titled \\"Karen's Café\\", which was a specifically altered version of \\"Hotel Café\\" for an episode of Lenz's television series One Tree Hill. Mission Bell reached the No. 1 spot on CD Baby, an online music store specializing in the sale of physical compact discs and digital music downloads from independent musicians directly to consumers. The duo also digitally released an acoustic Christmas album in 2009 titled Fireside. ==Everly on One Tree Hill== Lenz has performed a string of original tracks on One Tree Hill due to her character's ambitions to reestablish her music career. Everly had continued to use One Tree Hill as an avenue to promote their latest music. In the episode titled \\"Even Fairy Tale Characters Would Be Jealous,\\" Lenz's character Haley James Scott's friend Peyton Sawyer produces a USO concert at the military base where her brother is stationed. The concert also featured Lenz's then-husband Michael Galeotti's band Enation, the band Angels & Airwaves, and occasional One Tree Hill guest star and fellow musician Kate Voegele. After its airing, Everly's single Feel This rose to No. 14 on the iTunes folk charts and allowed them to maintain the No. 1 top seller spot on CD Baby for several weeks. In the episode titled We Three (My Echo, My Shadow and Me), Karen's café is transformed into a glamorous nightclub with Lucas as its proprietor and Haley as the cabaret singer; Lenz premiered more songs featured in Everly's EP. In the seventh season of One Tree Hill, Lenz re-released \\"Quicksand,\\" a song originally written and performed by Lenz for her album with Epic. Her character then began her first solo tour, Flying Machine. In the fictional tour, songs written and performed by Everly were featured on the show while concurrently being released through iTunes and CD Baby. ==DiscographyEPs=== {  border=\\"1\\" - ! Year !

Tokuma Shoten has published four novels as of October 2013. The novels have been adapted to a drama CD, a manga serialized in Monthly Comic Ryū, and an anime television series aired in 2009. The TV series had been licensed in North America by Sentai Filmworks, anime distributor Section23 Films released the complete collection on November 16, 2010. ==Story== In 1925, after being told by a baseball player that women should become housewives instead of going to school, two 14-year-old Japanese high school girls named Koume and Akiko decide to start a baseball team in order to prove him wrong. During this time, when even running was considered too vulgar for women, baseball is known as \\"what the boys do\\" and they face many difficulties when having to find enough members, to get permission from their parents and also when learning about the sport itself. The first book in the series opens in Taishō 14 (1925), introducing Koume, who is the 14-year-old daughter of a yōshoku restaurant owner, and a student at a local girls' academy. One day, Koume's friend, Akiko, asks her to join in an all-girl baseball team and have a match against a boys team. While the first volume can be read as a stand- alone work, the second volume develops the storyline further. The second book is set in the summer of Taishō 14. Koume, Akiko, Manoe and the rest of the nine members of the Baseball Girls continue to face off against numerous all- boy teams, and have trouble dealing with the fast balls thrown by the boys. To combat the anxiety they experience, playing against more experienced teams, they decide to abandon their traditional baseball uniforms in favor of a kimono-style uniform. The girls also partition off the batter's box so that other teams cannot see what they are doing. Apart from baseball, the series also deals with certain cultural changes that are not seen quite so often in anime. For example, the popular \\"sailor\\" school uniforms, now a staple of real-world Japanese schools, as well as school-based anime and manga, are only just being introduced into Japanese society during the Taishō period in which this work is based. ==CharactersMain characters=== The main characters are the members of the girls' baseball team Ouka-kai.

Most of those who were helped were ex-military, former government officials, educators, writers and artists who found it difficult to adapt to their new circumstances in a foreign country. The nascent organization immediately began to raise funds under the leadership of its founders, Mr. and Mrs. Jan Dembinski. Initially the activity of Polish Assistance consisted of small grants and loans to individuals in need. Eventually, three boarding houses were purchased between 1973 and 1975 in Ocean Grove, New Jersey to accommodate up to two dozen people.. The houses were liquidated between 1992–1998. After the fall of communism in Poland in 1989, another property was purchased near Warsaw, Poland to accommodate those elderly who wanted to return to Poland. Eventually, the property was donated to a Polish foundation for the blind. ==Mission statement== \\"To provide financial assistance to needy persons of Polish origin; to assist such needy persons in adapting themselves to new economic and social conditions, and to help them to become better integrated in community life; to lend assistance to them in case of illness and distress and voluntarily to help them in any other possible way in case of need; to provide an information center to aid in the fulfillment of the foregoing purposes.\\"\\"Polish Assistance Inc.” Retrieved on September 8, 2008. ==Present activity== Presently, Polish Assistance is focused on assisting needy Polish immigrants in the New York metropolitan area and it is expanding its efforts in Florida as well.

It has his sources in the western slope of the Nahuelbuta Range to the east of the city and port of Lebu, capital of the province and named for the river. The Lebu is formed from the confluence of the Riachuelos of Curanilahue and Pilpilco that meet at the base of that mountain range. From the confluence it continues to the west, widening with the flow of the Riachuelos of Quilañanco and Curihuillín, and with several streams that join it from the wooded heights on both of its banks. It goes on to empty into the Pacific Ocean at 37° 36' Lat. and 73° 41 ' Lon. after a course of about 100 kilometers until it is below the ford of Cupaño, at the salto de Gualgalén, where this strong torrent of the river that is about 20 kilometers from its mouth meets the upper reach of the tidal estuary. At the river mouth the coast forms a port or anchorage between the Morro de Tucapel to the south, and the Punta de Millonhue to the north. Between them extends the bar of the mouth, that only opens the way by a narrow channel. Above the mouth the river estuary in front of the city is narrow and further up the river is wide and deep. In the upper part of this estuary, is the location of the old fort of Santa Margarita de Austria. The name of the river is an alteration of the Mapudungun leufü or leuvu, “river”; and in colonial times a valley of a river, that contained habitations of Indians was called a levo.

All these aspects give probable answers as to how and why Roman objects got into Germanic hands, and why a vast amount of Roman objects still can be found as far north as Norway. It is noteworthy to understand how Roman objects brought elements of Roman culture with them, and how they to some extent shaped Germanic culture and identity.KolbergThis article is based entirely on a paper written by Are Skarstein Kolberg as part of the Bachelor's degree in Archaeology at the University of Oslo in 2007. ==Brief historical introduction== The first contacts happened by the late 2nd century BC, when Roman authors recount that Gaul, Italy and Hispania were invaded by migrating Germanic tribes. This culminated in military conflict with the armies of the Roman Republic, in particular those of the Roman Consul Gaius Marius. Six decades later, Julius Caesar invoked the threat of such attacks as one justification for his annexation of Gaul to Rome. As Rome expanded to the Rhine and Danube rivers, it incorporated many societies into the Empire. The tribal homelands to the north and east emerged collectively in the records as Germania. The peoples of this area were sometimes at war with Rome, but also engaged in complex and long-term trade relations, military alliances, and cultural exchanges with Rome as well. The Cimbri and Teutoni incursions into Roman Italy were thrust back in 101 BC. These invasions were written up by Caesar and others as presaging of a Northern danger for the Roman Republic, a danger that should be controlled. In the Augustean period there was — as a result of Roman activity as far as the Elbe River — a first definition of the \\"Germania magna\\": from Rhine and Danube in the West and South to the Vistula and the Baltic Sea in the East and North. Caesar's wars helped establish the term Germania. The initial purpose of the Roman campaigns was to protect Transalpine Gaul by controlling the area between the Rhine and the Elbe. In AD 9 a revolt of their Germanic subjects headed by the supposed Roman ally, Arminius, (along with his decisive defeat of Publius Quinctilius Varus and the destruction of 3 Roman legions in the surprise attack on the Romans at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest) ended in the withdrawal of the Roman frontier to the Rhine. At the end of the 1st century two provinces west of the Rhine called Germania inferior and Germania superior were established. Important medieval cities like Aachen, Cologne, Trier, Mainz, Worms and Speyer were part of these Roman provinces. North of Limes, there were only trade contacts between Romans and Scandinavia, mainly with Jutes of Denmark. Indeed, the Roman Empire maintained trade-routes and relations with Danish or proto-Danish peoples, as attested by finds of Roman coins. Depletion of cultivated land in the last century BC seems to have contributed to increasing migrations in northern Europe and increasing conflict between Teutonic tribes and Roman settlements in Gaul: Roman artifacts are especially common in finds from the 1st century in Jutland. It seems clear that some part of the Danish warrior- aristocracy served in the Roman army.Birger Storgaard, Cosmopolitan aristocrats, pp. 106-125 in: The Spoils of Victory - The North in the shadow of the Roman Empire, Nationalmuseet, 2003. . == Military aspect == Members of different Germanic tribes and communities served in the Roman legions, and fought with the Romans. It's probable that for instance Germanic Chieftains who fought with the Romans, tried to adapt to, and adopt, Roman culture, and that they tried to identify with the Roman nobility. In exchange for military service, the Germanics got Roman objects, although not Roman weapons, as there were Roman laws against exporting arms to the Germanic tribes. Germanic tribes who fought against the Romans got war spoils, and they often used captured Roman swords and armour. The Romans probably influenced Germanic military tactics and organisation as well. As can be told from the huge Illerup Ådal excavation in Denmark, in which huge amounts of Roman and Roman inspired arms and equipment were found. Many of these were probably produced in Scandinavia, and many had Scandinavia \\"factory seals\\", after a Roman model. This not only tells us that the Germans did indeed use Roman arms, but it also tells us that they had the required knowledge and social organisation to support large armies, and produce standardised arms and equipment.Ilkjær 2000: 67,74,78,88,90,92; Jørgensen 2001: 9 Finds of Roman inspired Spangenhelm type helmets in Germanic chieftain graves, also tell us that the Germanics were in awe of Roman culture (generally speaking.) We know that the Romans used this kind of helmet, amongst other sources from the Column of Trajan in Rome, on which Roman legionaries are depicted, wearing helmets.Granscay 1949: 272 Stephen V. Granscay writes: > We do know that the Spangenhelm shows barbarian contact with another > civilization […]. We also know that it was an important object of personal > adornment as well as protective value […]. The man who wore such a headpiece > was no longer a skin-clad barbarian….Grancsay 1949: 277 Grancsay's text may be outdated, but it is still interesting because Grancsay points at examples of how Roman culture helped shape Germanic identity, by ways of objects. He also suggests that these Roman objects embody the factors that made the basis of the Germanic warrior aristocracy that developed alongside and following the Roman Empire, such as the notable Himlingøje Dynasty, in the ways which the Romans may have supported Germanic tribes due to military regards, and equipped these tribes. And there may have been Germanics of a high class who participated in fights with or against the Romans, and thus acquiring Roman objects and Roman ways of thinking in military terms (strategies, organisation, etc...). It has been suggested that the Romans supported and equipped Germanic tribes in the part of Germania which is today's Denmark. Archaeological sources tell of Roman equipment and arms that have been discovered as far north as Scandinavia. Danish archaeologists: Lars Jørgensen, Birger Storgaard and Ulla Lund Hansen have suggested Germano-Roman alliances, in which Romans supported a Germanic power in today's Denmark. According to Jørgensen, this was either to destabilize Scandinavia, or to create a Roman friendly power which could help ensure peace and stability in the border areas.Jørgensen 2001: 13 Ulla Lund Hansen and Birger Storgaard have also suggested that Roman interests in Scandinavia were strong, and that there was direct contact. Storgaard alluded to a text written in accordance with an expedition led by Tiberius in year 5 A.D., in which Tiberius describes what has been interpreted to be Jutland, in Denmark, although this interpretation is based on myth.Storgaard 2003: 106 Jørgensen points to the Gudme-Lundeborg complex in Denmark. Archaeologists have found Roman coins and scrap metal at Lundeborg, a trading place in relation to this complex.Thrane 1991: 70 Hansen, Jørgensen and Storgaard interprets from these archaeological finds that Lundeborg may have functioned as a Roman port.Hansen 2001: 114; Jørgensen 2001: 13 == Trade aspect == The Roman Empire depended on trade in many different ways, such as the import of grain. This was especially the case in the early periods of the Roman Empire. Lynn F. Pitts wrote: > ”…At all periods Rome needed to have some kind of relationship, friendly or > otherwise, with her neighbours…”.Pitts 1989:45, 46 It's thus very likely that a lot of the Roman objects found in Scandinavia arrived via trade and trade networks. Grain was a significant commodity in the Roman society. This trade may have been carried out via already existing trade networks, from the Mediterranean, via Germanic Chieftains to Scandinavia. These trade networks may have been established prior to the Roman Empire and suggest a complex and advanced social structure and organisation among the Germanic tribes and societies. Scandinavian amber has been found at Mycene, in Greece.Dobson 1936: 73 This brings the term \\"tribe\\" into question, many archaeologists have abandoned this term as it may provide a faulty image of the Germanics as a primitive people. == Gift aspect == Another aspect of Germanic-Romanic inter-relations is the exchange of gifts. Artifacts may have been traded to the Germanics as diplomatic gifts in order to enhance and strengthen alliances, bonds and the likes.Jørgensen 2001: 13 Archaeologist Lynn F. Pitts writes about the Roman relationship to the Marcomanni and the Quadi that: > \\"Rome was perhaps concerned to cultivate these Germanic tribes in order to > counterbalance […] their neighbours. Diplomacy rather than military strength > kept the peace along […] the frontier.\\"Pitts 1989: 46 The Roman empire became increasingly vulnerable as they expanded, thus stretching their military capacity. Pitts go on to write that the Marcomans were a very strong military power, with a standing army of 7000 infantry and 4000 cavalry.Pitts 1989:46 It's obvious that the Romans wanted to maintain peaceful relations with certain Germanic tribes, especially towards the end of the Roman Empire, when it became ever increasingly weak. Pitts points out that ”…it is apparent [sic?] that, apart from short periods of hostilities, relations between Rome and the Marcomanni and Quadi were friendly…”. It became more and more common, as the Roman Empire neared its end, that the Romans paid tribute to Germanic armies who threatened to invade Rome. This takes us to the plunder aspect. == Plunder aspect == As the Western Roman Empire collapsed, Germanic tribes reclaimed land taken by the Roman Empire.

Dale and Eve are also walked down the aisle by their parents, to the sound of ChoQosh blowing a conch. In spite of some awkward moments, the brides exchange their vows. The series closes with some words from each of the couples, describing the difference that getting married has made in their lives. } ==Reception== LGBT-interest magazine The Advocate described Gay Weddings as \\"deliciously gripping\\". MetroWeekly out of Washington, D.C. dissented, saying that the series \\"is not [a] stellar example of reality TV\\" and that it \\"has a cheap, thrown together on-the-fly feel\\". Bravo aired the complete eight-part series on January 26, 2003 as counterprogramming to Super Bowl XXXVII. The ratings success of the marathon led Bravo to develop additional LGBT-interest programming, including the very successful Queer EyeEngstrom, p. 346 and the gay dating show Boy Meets Boy. With the success of the first season, the production company advertised for couples to appear in a second season of the program. However, no second season was produced. Bravo has no plans to revive the series. ==Controversy== During the series' September 2 premiere, Bravo inadvertently ran a commercial for \\"family restaurant\\" chain Applebee's during Gay Weddings, despite Applebee's having asked not to have its advertising placed in the series. Right-wing advocacy group Focus on the Family criticized Applebee's as an advertiser. Bravo acknowledged that the ad was placed in error and no additional Applebee's ads ran during the series. The LGBT media advocacy organization Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation called Applebee's request not to have its ads run during Gay Weddings disappointing and suggested that Applebee's ran a risk of alienating a significant customer base. ==NotesReferences== * Engstrom, Erika. \\"The 'Reality' of Reality Television Wedding Programs\\".

There is a sexist belief that football is not a sport for women. It was illegal for women to play football in Brazil from 1941 to 1979. The country lacks a national women's league, and runs only state competitions because there is limited financial interest and support. The national league Campeonato Brasileiro de Futebol Feminino ran for a year and was cancelled. The Copa do Brasil de Futebol Feminino was first played in 2007. Brazilian clubs won all editions of the Copa Libertadores Femenina. Women's football in Brazil only recently became more popular. During the 20th century, women were discouraged from playing \\"masculine\\" sports such as football and told they should focus more on aesthetic sports such as gymnastics. The health experts in Brazil at the time even claimed that females playing these sports were at risk of becoming homosexual. At a very young age, young boys were taught to be strong while girls were taught how to become better mothers. Women were often bullied for playing football and forced to leave fields in order to make more time for men to play. Despite the social challenges, women still continued to play football as officials worried about the masculinization of the female body and how detrimental that would be to their society. These fears sparked President Getúlio Vargas to organize a national sports council to establish sports guidelines. The council proceeded to ban women from playing any aggressive sports such as football due to health precautions. Many female players resisted this ban; Primavera FC continued to play up until they ran out of funding and resources. This law was not strictly upheld as some women continued to play. In the 1970's women's football was gaining popularity across the world; this inspired several feminist protests in brazil. Eventually the ban on women's football in Brazil was finally lifted in 1983 influenced by the Union of European Football Associations. The best players, such as Marta and Cristiane, were accidentally discovered and directly invited to play on the Brazil national team. In recent years, the national team contested the World Cup finals and Olympics gold medals, increasing the popularity of TV broadcasts of those tournaments. However, this was not sufficient to stimulate the footballing culture among women who prefer to support men's football over women's. Brazil has developed a major rivalry with the United States women's national soccer team. In 2014 FIFA World Cup held in their nation, Brazilian men's team had made a serious disappointment after only gaining fourth place. This created a huge supports for the women's team with hopes that they could gain the title in the women's tournament of 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup. ==See also== *Football in Brazil *Brazil women's national football team ==References== ","title":"Women's football in Brazil"},{"id":"20142362","text":"Campagna Shepherd Boy, by Edward Sheffield Bartholomew Edward Sheffield Bartholomew (1822 - May 2, 1858) was a noted American sculptor active in Italy.

He was praised by traditional historians for his frugality and personal integrity, but blamed for being overly harsh and cruel in his governance. == Background == Han Huang was born in 723, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. His family was from the Tang Dynasty capital Chang'an and traced its ancestry to the royal house of the Warring States period state Han. It also claimed, as ancestors, a line of officials during Han Dynasty, Jin Dynasty (265-420), Northern Wei, Northern Qi, Northern Zhou, Sui Dynasty, and Tang.New Book of Tang, vol. 73. His father Han Xiu was an important official early during the middle of Emperor Xuanzong's reign and briefly served as chancellor in 733.New Book of Tang, vol. 126 . He had at least five older brothers — Han Hao (), Han Qia (), Han Hong (), Han Huan (), and Han Hong (韓汯, note different character than his other brother) — and at least three younger brothers — among whom were Han Hun () and Han Hui ().Another younger brother's name is apparently not in Unicode and therefore unavailable from online sources. Han Huang himself was said to be firm and studious in his youth. Because of his heritage, he was made an officer in the imperial guards early.Old Book of Tang, vol. 129. In 755, the general An Lushan rebelled at Fanyang, and by summer 756 the armies of his new state of Yan were approaching Chang'an, forcing Emperor Xuanzong to flee. After Chang'an fell to Yan forces, Yan forces tried to force Han Hao to serve in the Yan administration. Han Hao, Han Hong (), Han Hong (), Han Huang, and Han Hun tried to flee Chang'an and join Emperor Xuanzong's crown prince Li Heng, who would be proclaimed emperor at Lingwu (as Emperor Suzong). However, Han Hao, Han Hong () and his four sons, and Han Hun were captured by Yan forces and executed although Han Hong () and Han Huang were able to get away. Emperor Suzong honored the Han family members who were killed with posthumous honors. == During Emperor Suzong's reign == Early in the Zhide era (756-758) of Emperor Suzong, Deng Jingshan () the military governor (Jiedushi) of Qingqi Circuit (青齊, headquartered in modern Weifang, Shandong) invited Han Huang to be his secretary and the military commander of the militia of Qingqi's capital Beihai Commandery. However, with the realm engulfed in warfare at the time, Han was not able to report to Qingqi, and he fled to Shannan Circuit (山南, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi). The surveyor of Shannan, Li Chengzhao (), had Han serve as his secretary. Subsequently, when Deng was moved to Huainan Circuit (淮南, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), he again asked for Han to serve on his staff, but before Han could report to Huainan, he was recalled to Chang'an, then again under Tang control, to serve as Dianzhong Shiyushi (), a low-level imperial censor. However, Han Hong () had offended the chancellor Wang Yu by failing to praise Wang with grand words when drafting the edict promoting Wang, and therefore, after Wang became chancellor in 758,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 220. he retaliated by putting the Han brothers in positions with no power. After Wang was removed from his chancellor position in 759,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 221. the popular opinion was that they had been unfairly treated, and Han Huang thereafter successively served as Sibu Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of rites (禮部, Lǐbu); Kaogong Yuanwailang (), and then Lìbu Yuanwailang (), both low- level officials at the ministry of civil service affairs (吏部, Lìbu, note different tone than the ministry of rites). It was said that Han Huang was capable at evaluating officials and strong in character, and during the five years he served as Libu Yuanwailang, he paid great attention to detail and knew the records well. == During Emperor Daizong's reign == During the Dali era (766-779) of Emperor Suzong's son Emperor Daizong, Han Huang was promoted to be Libu Langzhong (), who supervised the Libu Yuanwailang, as well as imperial attendant (給事中, Jishizhong). At that time, there was an incident where Wei Dang (), the magistrate of Fuping County (富平, near Chang'an) was assassinated. After the assassins were captured, it was discovered that they were members of the Northern Army (), under the command of the powerful eunuch Yu Chao'en. Yu sought a pardon for them on account of their military abilities, but Han Huang submitted a secret petition opposing Yu's request, and the assassins were executed.As Yu was executed in 770, this incident must have occurred before then. See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 224. Han was thereafter made Shangshu You Cheng (), one of the secretaries general of the executive bureau of government (尚書省, Shangshu Sheng). In 770, he was put in charge of selecting officials for the ministry of defense (兵部, Bingbu). In 771, he was made the deputy minister of census (戶部侍郎, Hubu Shilang) and put in charge of the economic affairs for the western half of the empire, replacing Diwu Qi.Old Book of Tang, vol. 123 . At that time, the imperial treasury was drained due to wars and corruption. Once Han was in charge, he concentrated on details and stamped out corruption, and whenever he found corruption in his subordinates or in local official, he sought to punish them harshly. Further, by that point, there had been reduced instances of Tufan and Huige incursions and several straight good harvests, and therefore the imperial treasury was able to be replenished. However, it was also said that Han was cruel, unrelenting in his pursuit of money, and stripping every bit of revenues he could find. As a result, he drew much resentment.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 224. In fall 777, major rainstorms fell on the western parts of the empire. Many of the salt pools at Hezhong Municipality (河中, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) were damaged, but Han, not willing to exempt the taxes from the households in charge of the salt pools, submitted a report claiming that the pools not only were not damaged, but there was an unusual kind of salt being formed that showed good fortune. Emperor Daizong doubted this, and sent the officials Jiang Zhen () to examine the salt pools. Jiang, after return from Hezhong, confirmed Han's report, and further requested that a shrine be established to celebrate the divine blessing. Emperor Dezong agreed, but this was viewed by popular sentiment as a major scandal at the time. Around the same time, Li Gan () the mayor of Jingzhao Municipality (京兆, i.e., the Chang'an region) submitted a report stating that the fields of Jingzhao were being heavily damaged. Han, again fearing tax exemptions, stated that there was no damage. One of Li's subordinates, Liu Zao () the magistrate of Weinan County (渭南, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi), wanted to ingratiate Han, and therefore submitted a report claiming no damage. The imperial censor Zhao Ji () also confirmed this report, but Emperor Daizong became suspicious and sent another censor, Zhu Ao (), to reexamine, and Zhu pointed out that much damage was being incurred. Emperor Daizong exiled Liu and Zhao, but did not punish Han.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 225. == During Emperor Dezong's reign == In 779, Emperor Daizong died and was succeeded by his son Emperor Dezong. Emperor Dezong had heard about Han Huang's harshness, and therefore stripped him of his financially related responsibilities and made him the minister of worship (太常卿, Taichang Qing), transferring his responsibilities to Liu Yan. He then sent Han out of Chang'an to serve as the prefect of Jin Prefecture (晉州, in modern Linfen, Shanxi). Later in the year, he made Han the prefect of Su Prefecture (蘇州, in modern Suzhou, Jiangsu) and governor (觀察使, Guanchashi) of Zhejiang Circuit ().Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 226. In 781, he made Han the prefect of Run Prefecture (潤州, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu) and military governor (Jiedushi) of Zhenhai Circuit (鎮海, i.e., same area as Zhejiang Circuit).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 227. It was said that Han was an effective governor, and that he comforted the people and balanced the taxes. However, it was also said that he was harsh, and that whenever local minor officials — often members of strong local clans — committed crimes, he would execute them without mercy, believing that by doing so he would be stamping out potential rebellions against his rule. For the same reason, eh also banned the slaughtering of cattle, under the rationale that beef and wine were often used at feasts that were preludes to rebellions. He also executed large numbers of people due to allegations of crimes without certainty of their guilt, leading to much terror in the region. In 783, due to Zhu Ci's rebellion, Emperor Dezong fled from Chang'an to Fengtian (奉天, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi). With the empire thrown into confusion, Han trained his soldiers in preparation of war, and he also sent soldiers to aid the campaign against another rebel, Li Xilie, who had declared himself the emperor of Chu. His soldiers were instrumental in aiding the general Liu Qia () in recapturing Bian Prefecture (汴州, in modern Kaifeng, Henan) from Li Xilie. He also prohibited people from entering and exiting Zhenhai Circuit and built fortresses (including rebuilding Shitou) and fleets, under the rationale that if Emperor Dezong decided to evacuate the Chang'an region and flee to the Yangtze River region like what occurred with Jin Dynasty (265-420), Zhenhai could become the emperor's base for recovery, and also to defend against potential attacks by Li Xilie's one-time ally Chen Shaoyou (), the military governor of neighboring Huainan Circuit (淮南, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu). This, however, led to suspicions that he was intending to rule Zhenhai as an effective independent realm. Meanwhile, though, because he was shipping supplies to Emperor Dezong, Emperor Dezong awarded him the title of Duke of Nanyang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 229. Emperor Dezong was suspicious of Han's intentions. However, by 784, after Zhu's rebellion was defeated, with the Chang'an region stricken by a serious famine, at the persuasion of his key advisor Li Mi, he alleviated Han's apprehension by sending Han's son Han Gao () to Zhenhai to request that he send food supplies as soon as possible. In response, Han sent a large supply of rice, causing Emperor Dezong to be very happy with him. HIs trust in Han was further enhanced when Chen died later in the year, and Han was able to dissuade Chen's subordinate Wang Shao () from starting a disturbance to take over Huainan. He gave Han the honorary chancellor designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi () and put him in charge of the Yangtze-Huai River supply system.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 231. Han was created the Duke of Zheng, and later his title was changed to Duke of Jin. In 786, Han headed to Chang'an to pay homage to Emperor Dezong — and ultimately, he would remain there until his death, even though he retained the title of military governor of Zhenhai as well. As he went through Bian Prefecture, he also persuaded Liu Qia, whose name had been changed to Liu Xuanzuo (), to go to Chang'an to pay homage to the emperor as well, by means of making large payments to both Liu and his army. Once he arrived at Chang'an, he began to exercise actual chancellor authorities, and he attacked the official Yuan Xiu (), whom the chancellor Cui Zao had put in charge of financial affairs for improprieties.Han's biography in the Old Book of Tang and the account in the Zizhi Tongjian appear to largely suggest that his criticism of Yuan was proper, although Han's biography in the New Book of Tang explicitly stated that his accusations against Yuan were unjustified. Compare Old Book of Tang, vol. 129 and Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 232 with New Book of Tang, vol. 126. With Emperor Dezong particularly happy about the large shipments of supplies that Han was shipping from Zhenhai to Chang'an, he put Han again in charge of the financial affairs. In late 786, he tried to defuse the tension between the major general Li Sheng, with him he was friendly, and Zhang Yanshang, by holding feasts (along with Liu Xuanzuo) for them and asking them to be sworn brothers. He also supported Li Sheng's advocacy for military action against Tufan.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 232. Meanwhile, it was said that Han was so trusted by Emperor Dezong that he had the greatest authority among chancellors. He was also described to be so harsh that he would even batter minor officials to death within the office of the chancellors. Fellow chancellor Liu Hun, whom he had recommended, sternly spoke to him about this, and thereafter, it was said that Han was embarrassed and curbed his ways slightly. He died in spring 787 and was buried with great honors. == Notes and references == * Old Book of Tang, vol. 129. * New Book of Tang, vol. 126. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 224, 225, 226, 227, 229, 230, 231, 232.

He was home-tutored from an early age, and was not enrolled in school until 1810. Following a short period at the Royal Frederick University, which included a stint as assistant to Christopher Hansteen, Holmboe was hired as a mathematics teacher at the Christiania Cathedral School in 1818, where he met the future renowned mathematician Niels Henrik Abel. Holmboe's lasting impact on mathematics worldwide has been said to be his tutoring of Abel, both in school and privately. The two became friends and remained so until Abel's early death. Holmboe moved to the Royal Frederick University in 1826, where he worked until his own death in 1850. Holmboe's significant impact on mathematics in the fledgling Norway was his textbook in two volumes for secondary schools. It was widely used, but faced competition from Christopher Hansteen's alternative offering, sparking what may have been Norway's first debate about school textbooks. ==Early life and career== Bernt Michael Holmboe was born in Vang in 1795, the son of vicar Jens Holmboe (1746-1823) and his wife Cathrine Holst (1763-1823). He grew up in Eidsberg with his nine siblings, and was the elder brother of noted philologist Christopher Andreas Holmboe. Holmboe was homeschooled from an early age, but was sent to the Christiania Cathedral School in 1810 to complete his secondary education. There he undertook extracurricular studies in mathematics. He enrolled as a student at the Royal Frederick University in 1814, a turbulent year in Norwegian history. Norway had been a province of Denmark since 1397, but had come under Swedish control in the January 1814 Treaty of Kiel. Following Norway's declaration of independence in the Constitution of 17 May, Sweden responded by waging a military campaign against Norway during the summer of 1814. Holmboe was a spokesperson for the student group opposed to the presence of Swedish troops in the country. Any outspokenness from the student community was highly visible at the time, as the university had only seventeen students as of 1813, its year of establishment. As well as his private studies, Holmboe attended lectures given by Søren Rasmusen. In 1815 he was appointed to the position of scientific assistant under Christopher Hansteen, a lecturer at the university, and delivered some lectures himself. In early 1818, Holmboe became a mathematics teacher at the Christiania Cathedral School, a position that had become vacant in 1817. The school principal, Jacob Rosted, had invited Holmboe's brother, Christopher Andreas, who had also studied mathematics, to take up the position, but he had decided instead to concentrate on philology; Christopher went on to research the Sanskrit language among others. In his teaching, Holmboe drew inspiration from Joseph-Louis Lagrange. ===Niels Henrik Abel=== At the Christiania Cathedral School, Holmboe met Niels Henrik Abel, then a pupil there. Holmboe quickly discovered Abel's talent, and proclaimed him as a \\"splendid genius\\" in his report card.Quote: In English: \\"A splendid mathematical genius.\\" (remark written by Holmboe) The school's primary focus was on classical education and Latin, and so Holmboe tutored Abel privately. His personal support for Abel has been called \\"[Holmboe's] most important contribution to mathematics\\".Quote: In English: \\"... the way Holmboe supported and helped Abel should be considered his most important contribution to mathematics.\\" (statement of the article writer) Holmboe and Abel became close friends. Two of Holmboe's younger brothers studied with Abel, and the three were also on friendly terms. Abel was invited to the Holmboe family residence in Eidsberg on several occasions, including to celebrate Christmas. Abel died from tuberculosis in 1829, at the age of twenty-six. Ten years after Abel's death Holmboe edited and published his complete works in two volumes--Oeuvres complètes de N.H. Abel ('Complete Works of N.H. Abel'). He was the first to do so. ==Later life and career== Holmboe published his first textbook in mathematics in 1825. The 274-page book was named Lærebog i Mathematiken. Første Deel (Textbook in Mathematics. Part One). In 1827 he followed with the second volume, Lærebog i Mathematiken. Anden Deel (Textbook in Mathematics. Part Two), consisting of a further 155 pages. He used his own teaching experience as the background for his writing; mainly abstract, the purpose of the books was to instill logical thinking. For instance, in the field geometry, it enticed readers to envisage a figure instead of putting it to paper. The books became widely used, and were reprinted in four and five volumes respectively. In 1826, Holmboe was appointed a lecturer at the Royal Frederick University. Some claimed that he owed his appointment to Abel's absence, as the latter was travelling around in Europe at that time. Holmboe also taught mathematics at a military college, from 1826 until his death, and was promoted to professor at the Royal Frederick University in 1834. His later publications include Stereometrie (Stereometry) (1833), Plan- og sfærisk Trigonometrie (Plan and Spherical Trigonometry) (1834), and Lærebog i den høiere Mathematik (Textbook of Advanced Mathematics) (1849). Holmboe was an influence on other mathematicians as well as Abel, including Ole Jacob Broch (born 1818). At the university, Holmboe again met Christopher Hansteen, who had become a professor there in 1816. In 1835, Hansteen published his own mathematics textbook for secondary schools. A reaction to Holmboe's books and method of teaching, it was more practically oriented. Holmboe wrote a review of the book for the newspaper Morgenbladet, in which he advised schools not to use it. A public debate followed, with contributions from other mathematicians. It has been claimed that this was the first debate on the subject of school textbooks in Norway. Hansteen's textbook was not reprinted. Holmboe also became involved in the field of insurance. From 1832 to 1848 he was a member of Tilsynskomiteen for private forsørgelses- og understøttelsesselskaper, the country's first public committee for the supervision of insurance companies. On the other side of the table, from 1847 Holmboe was a member of the board of directors of the insurance company Gjensidige, founded by his former student Ole Jacob Broch. ==Legacy== A Bernt Michael Holmboe Memorial Prize for teachers of mathematics was established in 2005, and is awarded annually. The prize money, NOK 50,000, are provided by the Abel Foundation, which awards the Abel Prize.The Abel Prize web site, The Abel Fund: Activity Profile The prize is administered by the board of the Norwegian Mathematical Society. The current board chairman is Tom Lindstrøm, professor at the University of Oslo. A street at Majorstuen in Oslo, Holmboes gate, has been named after Bernt Michael Holmboe. Before 1879 it was named Hansteens gate, after Christopher Hansteen. ==Marriage and children== Holmboe married twice. His first wife, Nikoline Antonie Finkenhagen, born 1804 in Toten, died in 1839 after five years of marriage. They had three daughters, two of whom (Fredrikke and Nikoline, Jr.) reached adulthood, and one stillborn son. He married his second wife, Ingeborg Thorp in 1842. She was born in 1812 in Voss. This marriage produced two sons, Christopher and Jens, and two daughters, Cathrine and Olava. Only Jens and Cathrine reached adulthood.Genealogical entry for Bernt Michael Holmboe - published by Fogd Jens Holmboes legat. Retrieved on 9 November 2008.

During the summer of 1939, she operated off Portsmouth, New Hampshire, first to assist in rescuing 33 crewmen from the sunken submarine USS Squalus (SS-192) in May 1939, and later to assist in raising the submarine herself, including towing of the raised submarine to shallower water in August 1939. Wandank was transferred to Boston, Massachusetts, on 8 October 1940 for special duty in the 1st Naval District. She operated out of Boston on coastal towing duties throughout World War II. Her duties included towing yard oilers and other small craft and participating in the towing of transport USS Wakefield (AP-21), which had been severely damaged by fire in September 1942. On 15 May 1944, Wandanks designation was changed again, to ATO-26.

Its transversal arch construction derives from old building traditions of the Hauran region and is arguably unique in Roman bridge building. == Road network of the Hauran == The Bridge at Nimreh is located in the Hauran (ancient name: Auranitis), a mountainous volcanic region c. 80 km southeast from Damascus in the transitional zone between agricultural land and the desert. Due to fertile soils and sufficient rainfalls, the area yielded in Roman times particularly high returns, which could be transported on the extensive Roman road network. The Hauran lay at the junction of several long distance trade routes: the inland trade route between Petra, Damascus and Aleppo went right through the main emporium Bostra, while the trans-Arabian caravan route and the road to Palmyra, the later Strata Diocletiana, touched the north respectively south of the region. After the annexation by emperor Trajan in 106 AD, the infrastructure of the newly established Provincia Arabia was greatly expanded by the construction of Roman forts and military roads to ward off nomadic incursions; in Bostra the Legio III Cyrenaica was stationed. The rugged terrain, with many wadis crisscrossing it, made necessary the construction of solid bridges, another two of which have survived to this day: the Gemarrin Bridge and the Kharaba Bridge. == Construction == The bridge is situated 10 km southeast from Shahba, close to the modern road at the foot of the mountain village Nimreh, which was known in the Onomastikon of Eusebius by the name Namara and regarded as an important place (vicus grandis). Here, the bridge crosses the Wadi al-Liwa almost right-angled, making a small bend of 120° at its western end; a slightly elevated causeway continues for about 100 m before trailing off. The bridge is 25 m long, with the eastern section covering the larger part (15 m). Its width of 4.52 m corresponds exactly to that of the Kharaba Bridge.All data: The span of its single arch is 6.73 m, with a rise of 3.10 m, resulting in a slightly less pronounced profile (c. 160°) than the typical Roman semi-circular arch (180°); the overall height from the riverbed to the apex of the arch is reported as 3.60 m.All data: The vault was made of three parallel, transversal arches standing at intervals of 1.20 m; the arches were built of 60 cm long, 30 cm wide and just as high ashlar, while the spaces in between are covered with longish basalt blocks. This design principle – transversal arches with lintels – seems to be unique among Roman bridges. It also appears in the Hauran in roof constructions of late antique basilicas, and the early Christian church in Nimreh, indicating a construction date in the 3rd or 4th century AD. Possibly, the bridge was built in the 3rd century AD, when the region prospered, culminating in a large building program which emperor Philippus Arabs (r. 244-249 AD) initiated for his home town Shahba, then Philippopolis. The practice of using transversal arches for vaulting large chambers was continued in the Hauran until the early 20th century. Presumably, the bridge was built directly onto the solid stone. Its almost unadorned masonry walls consist of rectangular, roughly smoothed basalt blocks of varying size without mortar (opus quasi-quadratum). Since Roman bridges rarely featured basalt, its use is undoubtedly due to the availability of the material in situ. The spandrel walls on both sides are broken up, revealing the interior filling of stone, sand and earth. The pavement, parts of which are well preserved, consists of large, smoothed basalt stones.All data: == See also == * List of Roman bridges * Roman architecture * Roman engineering == References  Sources == * Category:Roman bridges in Syria Category:Deck arch bridges Category:Stone bridges in Syria Category:Buildings and structures in as-Suwayda Governorate ","title":"Bridge at Nimreh"},{"id":"20142856","text":"The Gasunie Building is one of the most famous buildings in Groningen.

Edmund George Lind (June 18, 1829 – 1909) was an English-born American architect, active in Baltimore, Atlanta, and the American south. ==Biography== Lind was born in Islington, now a part of London, England; his father, Alexander Lind, was an engraver who had fought on the British side as a Loyalist at the Battle of Bunker Hill outside Charlestown, Massachusetts near Boston in 1775. When he was young, the family moved to Birmingham, England, where drawing and painting became his favorite amusements. After an attempt at studying law, he studied architecture at the London School of Design, then worked for several years in various architects' offices in London.AIA Baltimore A Chapter History from 1870–2005, Charles Belfoure, pg. 91 In 1855 Lind emigrated to New York City where he found employment as chief draftsman and assisting Nathan G. Starkweather, designer of the brownstone Gothic-style, fourth structure for the First Presbyterian Church in Baltimore, which was finally completed with the tallest spire in the city in 1875, (first three structures from colonial times in downtown area at northwest corner of East Fayette and North Streets (now Guilford Avenue), sold the site after the Georgian/Federal-era twin-spired church from 1795, was razed to the Federal Government for a new U. S. Courthouse, built 1859-60); and then moved to more residential and up-scale, tomey, Victorian-era Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood, just north of central business district at West Madison Street and Park Avenue). Lind moved to Baltimore to supervise its construction, but in 1856, left Starkweather's office to partner with William T. Murdoch, with whom he was associated with until about 1860. He married his partner's cousin, Margaret Murdoch. In the late 1850s, Lind & Murdoch were selected to design the Peabody Institute in Baltimore, on behalf of financier George Peabody, who although born and raised in Massachusetts, spent a great deal of business time in New York City and London, had special regard for the city of Baltimore. Its original wing facing the 1815-1829 Washington Monument on the west side bordering Washington Place, which is also North Charles Street was begun in 1858, completed in 1861, and dedicated in 1866 in Peabody's presence, containing Peabody Hall (now Friedberg Concert Hall), conservatory rooms, and a picture gallery. In 1875, its east wing was begun along intersecting Mount Vernon Place (which is also East Monument Street), and in 1878, was finished under Lind's supervision. Its most impressive feature is its large central reading room, rising to the full height of the building under a skylight, with six stories of alcoves with wrought-iron work giving room for 300,000 volumes, and a checker board floor of alternating black and white marble slabs. Other examples of Lind's Baltimore work include the Memorial Protestant Episcopal Church at Bolton Street and Lafayette Avenue in the Bolton Hill neighborhood of northwest Baltimore, a church at the southwest corner of Dolphin and Etting streets, and the monument to Capt. John Gleason, of the 5th Maryland Infantry, in Cathedral Cemetery. He is also thought to have designed the English Tudor, Gothic-style building at North Howard and West Centre Streets for the Baltimore City College, the first of two on the site in 1875. The City College (formerly Central High School of Baltimore), an all-male public high school, was founded on Courtland Street (now St. Paul Street/Place and Preston Gardens), near East Saratoga Street in 1839, is the third oldest public high school in America. It was formerly located since 1843 in the old \\"Assembly Rooms\\" (a social dancing hall and place for society ladies and gentlemen for dinners, soirees, receptions and events), originally constructed in 1797 by Robert Cary Long, Sr. and also contained space for the first paid-membership and subscription Library Company of Baltimore at the northeast corner of Holliday and East Fayette Streets, until it burned along with the famous neighboring Holliday Street Theatre in a massive fire in 1873. Lind's first building was the first structure to be erected specifically for the use of the high school in its history. It collapsed in 1892, when the Howard Street Tunnel was being dug and constructed beneath from Camden Street Station in the south to the new Mount Royal Station in the north for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad through the downtown business district. It was replaced by 1895 by a second structure for BCC, designed by the architect partnership Baldwin & Pennington, which is still there today (2013), although now renovated since 1980 for apartments and condos, known as \\"Chesapeake Commons\\". Lind designed Washington, Georgia's Mary Willis Library in 1889. In 1882 Lind transferred his practice to Atlanta, Georgia, where for a decade he designed mansions, factories, libraries, courthouses, hotels, Masonic lodges, commercial buildings, textile mill housing, and churches in Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, Washington, D.C., and elsewhere. His finest building in these years was the Central Presbyterian Church in Atlanta (1884). He also designed the Gwinnett County Courthouse in Lawrenceville, Georgia; the Mary Willis Library in Washington, Georgia; and the Milton Candler House in Decatur, Georgia; as well as a combined market and city hall for Guayaquil, Ecuador. Following the severe economic depression of 1893, Lind retired to Baltimore where he continued to practice on a limited basis. He died in 1909. He completed several works in North Carolina. During his career, Lind was active in both national and professional roles. He served as assistant supervising architect for the United States during the administration of President Ulysses S. Grant. He became a member of the American Institute of Architects in 1857, and a Fellow in 1870. Lind was a founding member of the Baltimore Chapter of the AIA in 1870 and he also served as president in 1871, and also from 1876 to 1882. He also served as vice president of the national AIA organization on two occasions. His interests extended beyond architecture. In 1894 he wrote an essay on the relationship between music and color, and transposed \\"Yankee Doodle\\", \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\", and a number of other popular songs from music into color. He also investigated the importance of the number seven in acoustics and architecture, based on the seven colors of the rainbow and the seven sounds of the diatonic scale. A number of his works are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, maintained by the United States Department of the Interior. ==Selected works== *1858–1861: Peabody Institute Buildings, Washington Monument circle, North Charles Street (Washington Place) and East Monument Street (Mount Vernon Place); Baltimore, Maryland. *1858–1861: Coolmore, near Tarboro, North Carolina, an Italianate style villa designed for Dr. Joseph J.

It is the 24th edition of the ASB Classic, and was part of the WTA International tournaments of the 2009 WTA Tour. It took place at the ASB Tennis Centre in Auckland, New Zealand, from 5 through 10 January 2009. The singles draw is led by WTA No. 4, Luxembourg, Dubai winner, Olympics gold medalist Elena Dementieva, Tokyo, New Haven, Stockholm titlist Caroline Wozniacki and Strasbourg champion, Fes, Portorož runner-up Anabel Medina Garrigues. Also competing are Stanford champion Aleksandra Wozniak, Prague quarter-finalist Shahar Pe'er, Nicole Vaidišová, Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Carla Suárez Navarro. ==Changes== At the 2008 tournament, the courts were changed to a blue Plexicushion surface, replacing the green Rebound Ace. This was consistent with the surface change that was also implemented at the Australian Open. For the 2009 WTA Tour the ASB Classic was chosen as part of the new 55 tournament calendar. A new tournament director, Brenda Perry, was brought in, and there was also an increase in prize money from $145,000 to $225,000. The event underwent a change in sponsorship, with Zealandia, a New Zealand horticulture firm, becoming a supporting partner. ==EntrantsSeeds=== Nadia Petrova, who was set to be the number two seed, was forced to pull out when it was announced that she had contracted viral meningitis in mid-December. {  border=\\"1\\" - !

In the 2008 event, Erakovic had reached the semifinals, defeating the top seed Vera Zvonareva in the process. Erakovic went on to have the most successful season of her career, despite some poorer results and injuries in the latter half of the year. Commenting on the 2009 tournament, Erakovic said, \\"Even though the ASB Classic is important and I want to do well in my home town, my sight is set on the Australian Open and to be 100 percent for that.\\" Erakovic had had to rely on a wildcard to gain entry to the previous year's event, but in 2009 was a direct entrant. Another entry which drew attention from the media was that of Mirjana Lučić, who had reached the Wimbledon semifinals ranked 134 in 1999, but had been largely absent from the Tour in the preceding years for personal reasons. Lučić received a wildcard for the main draw. ===Qualifying=== The qualifying tournament was played from 3–4 January. Four players received wildcards: # Di Hollands # Aucklander Kairangi # Michaëlla Krajicek # Petra Martić The four players to qualify were Ayumi Morita and Aiko Nakamura (both Japan), German player Kristina Barrois, and Italian Alberta Brianti. ==Review== Day by day summaries of the women's singles and doubles events. The singles draw is composed of 32 players, with 8 of these players seeded, while the doubles draw features 16 players, 4 of which are seeded. ===Day one=== The singles and doubles events both started on 5 January. In the women's singles, the seeded players who featured on the first day all advanced to the second round. Third seed and WTA #22 Anabel Medina Garrigues beat Italian Mara Santangelo 7–5, 6–0. Fourth seed Aleksandra Wozniak overcame her opponent Magdaléna Rybáriková from Slovakia in three sets, winning 6–3, 6–7(4), 7–5. Shahar Pe'er, the fifth seed from Israel, sealed her passage into the next round with a straight sets triumph against Petra Cetkovská of the Czech Republic. The final seed to go through, Czech Nicole Vaidišová took three sets before triumphing 7–6(3), 4–6, 7–5 against Alla Kudryavtseva of Russia. In other matches, another Czech Barbora Záhlavová-Strýcová beat France's Virginie Razzano 1–6, 6–2, 6–3 to line up a second round match with Pe'er; Romanian Edina Gallovits also found out her opponent would be Medina Garrigues after beating yet another Czech, Klára Zakopalová 3–6, 6–2, 7–5. American Jill Craybas and French Aravane Rezaï recorded victories against Kimiko Date-Krumm and Eleni Daniilidou respectively. Several matches were played in the doubles event on the first day. The most notable result saw top seeds Jill Craybas (playing her second match of the day following her singles victory) and New Zealander Marina Erakovic knocked out by the Spanish pairing of Nuria Llagostera Vives and Arantxa Parra Santonja 6–4, 6–2. They were the only seeds to fall, with fourth seeds Chan Yung-jan (from Chinese Taipei) and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova of Russia advancing comfortably with a 6–2, 6–2 win over İpek Şenoğlu of Turkey and German Jasmin Wöhr. Chan and Pavlyuchenkova's win set up a second round match with Russians Elena Dementieva and Elena Vesnina who beat Natalie Grandin from South Africa and Latvia's Līga Dekmeijere 6–1, 6–3. *Seeded players out (singles): None *Seeded players out (doubles): Jill Craybas/Marina Erakovic ===Day two=== Day 2 saw the completion of the first round of matches in both the singles and doubles competitions. The remaining seeds who were not in action on the first day all won their matches and qualified for round two. During the day session, top seed and ATP no. 4 Russian Elena Dementieva had a far from straight forward match against Chan Yung-jan from Chinese, eventually coming through 7–5, 6–3. The young player from Taipei was hard-hitting but did not have enough to beat Dementieva. Second seed Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark, ranked at a career high of #12, crushed her opponent, Italian qualifier Alberta Brianti 6–1, 6–0 in 56 minutes to achieve a meeting with Jill Craybas. No.8 seed Carla Suárez Navarro from Spain beat Nathalie Dechy 6–4, 6–0. She found out her opponent for round two later in the day, with Anne Keothavong from Great Britain winning 6–4, 6–2 against Croatian wildcard Mirjana Lučić. In other day matches, Elena Vesnina routed qualifier Aiko Nakamura, 6–1, 6–0 and qualifier Ayumi Morita beat Marta Domachowska, 6–4 4–6 6–4. The unseeded Marina Erakovic of New Zealand sealed her place in the second round by beating Nuria Llagostera Vives from Spain 7–5, 6–4. Seventh seed Russian Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova ensured that all eight of the seeds had made it to the second round by winning her match in the night session against German Kristina Barrois 6–3, 6–1. In doubles, second seeds Shahar Pe'er and Caroline Wozniacki progressed to the quarter-finals by defeating Argentinian Betina Jozami and Indian Shikha Uberoi 6–2, 6–2 but no. 3 seeds Czech Vladimíra Uhlířová and Ekaterina Dzehalevich of Belarus were beaten 6–4, 6–4 by Italian Mara Santangelo and French player Nathalie Dechy, a three-times Grand Slam doubles titlist. In other matches, Sarah Borwell from Great Britain and her partner Martina Müller qualified for the quarter-finals, overcoming the disappointment of a 6–0 first set to take the next two 7–5, 10-7 on champions tiebreak against Aiko Nakamura (Japan) and Marta Domachowska (Poland). Edina Gallovits and Eva Hrdinová defeated Australian wildcards Shona Lee and Kairangi Vano 6–3, 6–4. Finally, in an all American tie, Raquel Kops-Jones and Abigail Spears lost to Julie Ditty and Carly Gullickson 6–1, 6–3 to complete the quarter-final lineup. *Seeded players out (singles): None *Seeded players out (doubles): Vladimíra Uhlířová/Ekaterina Dzehalevich ===Day three=== After the first round passing without losing any seeds, five were knocked out on day three, all in straight sets, leaving just three seeds qualifying for the quarter-finals. 3rd seed Anabel Medina Garrigues lost to Edina Gallovits 6–3, 6–3. No. 6 seed Nicole Vaidišová was beaten 6–4, 6–3 by Elena Vesnina. Aleksandra Wozniak, the 4th seed, was knocked out by Ayumi Morita 7–5, 6–2, no. 7 Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova failed to progress as she lost 6–2, 6–3 to Aravane Rezaï while Carla Suárez Navarro succumbed to Briton Anne Keothavong who continued her good start to life in the top 60 with a 6–2, 6–4 win. As for the seeds that progressed, top seed Elena Dementieva beat New Zealand's Marina Erakovic 6–2, 6–3; No. 2 seed Caroline Wozniacki narrowly saw off veteran Jill Craybas 6–4, 7–5. 5th seed Shahar Pe'er had to try hard to concentrate on her tennis because an Auckland-based protest group staged protests at her decision not to pull out of the tournament with a war taking place in Gaza. Nevertheless, she became the third seed to progress, beating Barbora Záhlavová-Strýcová in a topsy-turvy match 6–3, 4–6, 6–2. *Seeded players out (singles): Anabel Medina Garrigues, Aleksandra Wozniak, Nicole Vaidišová, Anastasia Palyuchenkova, Carla Suárez Navarro *Seeded players out (doubles): Shahar Pe'er/Caroline Wozniacki ===Day four=== *Seeded players out (singles): Caroline Wozniacki, Shahar Pe'er *Seeded players out (doubles): Chan Yung- jan/Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova ===Day five=== Day five saw both semi-finals take place in the singles draw. The only seeded player left in the draw, top seeded Russian Elena Dementieva and the world no. 4 as of the start of the tournament was involved in the first match. She faced French player and last year's beaten finalist Aravane Rezaï. Dementieva won the match 6–2, 6–2 in less than an hour. Later in the day, unseeded Russian Elena Vesnina took on British number 1 and world no. 60 Anne Keothavong, playing in only her second WTA Tour semi-final and whose ranking should improve after her progress during the tournament. Keothavong matched Vesnina for much of the first set, falling behind 5–3 with a single break of serve. But she did not give up and she broke back and then held her service game to level the first set. The set eventually went to a tiebreak, which the British player took 7-3. The second set was a completely different story, Vesnina dropping just one game to win it 6–1. This set up a final-set decider which went with serve until the seventh game when Keothavong felt she had been given a wrong linecall and ended up being broken. She fought back to 5–5 but was broken again in the eleventh. Keothavong managed to save two match points but then, after saving two break points of her own, Vesnina hit an ace to seal victory and complete a match lasting almost two hours. The second semi-final of the doubles competition was a match between American pair Julie Ditty and Carly Gullickson, and France's Nathalie Dechy partnering Italian Mara Santangelo. Santangelo and Dechy, bidding for their second title as a partnership following Rome Masters victory in 2007 advanced to the final 6–2, 6–4. Their final opponents being Spaniards Nuria Llagostera Vives and Arantxa Parra Santonja. *Seeded players out (singles): None *Seeded players out (doubles): None ===Day six=== *Seeded players out (singles): *Seeded players out (doubles): ==ChampionsSingles=== Elena Dementieva defeated Elena Vesnina, 6–4, 6–1 *It was Dementieva's first title of the year and 12th of her career. ===Doubles=== Nathalie Dechy / Mara Santangelo defeated Nuria Llagostera Vives / Arantxa Parra Santonja, 4–6, 7–63, 12–10 ==See also== * 2009 Heineken Open – men's tournament ==References *Official website ASB Classic ASB Category:WTA Auckland Open ASB ","title":"2009 ASB Classic"},{"id":"20143118","text":"London Progressive Journal (LPJ) is a UK-based weekly online magazine covering domestic and international current affairs from a politically left perspective.

He is a professor at Northern Arizona University where he studies referential communication, using prairie dogs (Cynomys gunnisoni) as a model species. Much of his recent research has shown a complex communicative ability of the Gunnison prairie dog alarm calls. In early 2008 he formed the Animal language Institute to create a place where people can find and share research in animal communication, including language. == Background == He was born in China to Russian émigré parents, as a child his dad was a surgeon and when he came across a high up citizens who needed help, his dad and the high up citizen made a deal, he would heal him in exchange for visas for his whole family to go to America and then moved to the United States as a young child with his parents, who settled in San Francisco. Slobodchikoff's early love of biology was fostered by his membership in his teenage years in the Student Section of the California Academy of Sciences, where he went on numerous field trips to different habitats in California. He received an A.A. degree from City College of San Francisco in 1964, and a B.S. in 1966 and Ph.D. degree in 1971, both from the University of California, Berkeley. After receiving his Ph.D., Slobodchikoff joined the biology faculty of Northern Arizona University, where he remains today as a tenured professor. He also was a Fulbright Fellow and a visiting professor at Kenyatta University in Kenya in 1983. == Research == His initial research involved the behavior and ecology of tenebrionid beetles and their response to vertebrate predators. However, in the mid-1980s he switched his research efforts to studying the social behavior and communication of prairie dogs. He has been decoding the communication system of alarm calls, and he and his students have found that prairie dogs have a sophisticated communication system that can identify the species of predator and provides descriptive information about the size, shape, and color of the individual predator animal. His research in prairie dog communication has also shown displacement, the ability to communicate about things that are not present. This finding challenges prior theories on animal communication, since only humans have been known to use this linguistic process.http://www.keepmywords.com/2009/11/04/prairie-dogs/ In addition, his work with prairie dogs suggests that they may have a \\"complex communication system that borders on language.\\" Not only do they have a developed communication system as described above, they also have different escape behaviors in response to different predator calls. His research with the prairie dogs also helps to explain why animals have social behavior. Because these animals form a colony, they form a set of different social groups, which apparently exist for other reasons besides mating and may be a way to take advantage of limited resources. Con also writes a Dog Behavior Blog which gives some advice on how to solve behavior issues and has several short essays about some of the research about dogs and dog behavior. Through Slobodchikoff's research, it has been found that prairie dogs also have the ability to construct new words referring to novel objects or animals in their environment, which is called productivity. Prior to the study, only humans have been recognized with the ability of productivity within a communication system. Slobodchikoff and his research team are currently taking a look at breaking down the grammar of prairie dogs through computer technology to better understand the nature of their vocalizations in comparison to the phoneme system used by humans. Through this approach, they have been able to find how these vocalizations are put together to construct word-like structures and further constructed to form sentences. Con Slobodchikoff has shown strong intention of preserving the habitats of prairie dogs. One specific area that has evidence of the destruction of their environment is New Mexico. An organization, Prairie Dog Pals has dedicated themselves to prevent the urban expansion that threatens the dog's lifestyles. Prairie Dogs are seen as bothersome creatures to city employees. They are viewed as a threat to home owners and the general public by digging burrows into parks and playgrounds. Unfortunately, animal lovers are worried that their extinction will be the cause of the extinction of other creatures. Drastic measures such as poisoning, bulldozing and drowning their habitats have been implemented by the city's urban expansion workers. This has caused a major push in Con Slobodchikoff research, because of his drive to inform society of how intelligent these remarkable creatures are, and how they can really can contribute to further research. Slobodchikoff has examined the language, communication, and social behavior of prairie dogs for more than twenty years. He selected prairie dogs as the main focus of his research because he believes they have a high degree of social behavior and are easy to study due to their close proximity. The prairie dogs live near the university that Slobodchikoff teaches, Northern Arizona University. He has taken what he has learned from the findings of his research with prairie dogs to offer consultations about problems that pets may have with behavior and offer advice to correct those problems. He has also offered dog training classes based on what he has learned in his research. == Published Writings == Slobodchikoff has published numerous papers in animal behavior, ecology, and evolution. One of his better known papers on evolution was published with Thomas G. Whitham in 1981 in the journal Oecologia: Evolution of individuals, plant-herbivore interactions, and mosaics of genetic variability: the adaptive significance of somatic mutations in plants. A seminal paper on prairie dog communication was published in 1991 in the journal Animal Behaviour: Semantic information distinguishing individual predators in the alarm calls of Gunnison's prairie dogs. He has been editor or co-editor of several books including: Concepts of Species; A New Ecology: Novel Approaches to Interactive Systems; and The Ecology of Social Behavior. He is lead author, along with Bianca S. Perla and Jennifer L. Verdolin, of the book: Prairie Dogs: Communication and Community in an Animal Society, published by Harvard University Press. His book Chasing Doctor Dolittle: Learning the Language of Animals will be published by St. Martin's Press in November 2012. == Media == Slobodchikoff's work with the prairie dog communication system has been featured in a number of video productions, magazines, radio interviews, and newspaper accounts. His video appearances included: NBC Dateline, ABC World News with Peter Jennings, CNN, Country Canada, Quantum (Australian Broadcasting Corporation), Teirzeit (Belgian- German TV), BBC, Turner Broadcasting, Brixen Productions (Discovery Channel), Evolve (History Channel). Radio interviews have been with: NPR All Things Considered, BBC radio, PBS Flagstaff, Phoenix, Santa Fe, Idaho, and Colorado. Magazine stories about his work have appeared in: Smithsonian Magazine, National Geographic, People Magazine, Discover Magazine, the Phoenician, Best Friends Magazine, Boys' Life, Reader's Digest.

The street is parted on the middle by Øverparken with the famous fountain and the town square, referred to as Torget by locals. The current/\\"modern\\" street plot of Levanger was laid out by the Swedish king Carl III in the early 19th century. The street is laid out in an axis from the Mo farm area in the southwest to the northeast. It passes by the Levanger videregående skole, the old Høgskolen i Levanger (now part of Nord-Trøndelag University College), past the Levanger Church (hence the name \\"Kirkegata\\"), down to the Levangselva bridge, the lower harbour area, and the old Levanger slaughter house. At the northeastern end of the road, it joins Norwegian County Road 774. ==CharacterWooden houses=== Most of the buildings facing Kirkegata are old wooden houses of a very fine and distinct character, constructed towards the end of the 19th century, following the last of the great fires of Levanger (in 1848, 1863 and 1897). The last fire prompted new and better fire protection measures, such as a firewall between each house. The general high amount of fine wooden houses in Levanger, has earned Levanger the status as national wooden house town in Norway. Some fine wooden houses were demolished and replaced by modern buildings in the 1950s-1970s and even later. ===Other distinctive buildings=== Not all of the old houses lining Kirkegata are old wooden houses. The old Levanger bank building is constructed from brick. The only proper hotel in downtown Levanger, Backlund Norlandia hotel, is to be found in Kirkegata 41. The modern Backlund is a multi-story brick building erected after the old one was destroyed in a fire. The old Backlund hotel was famous for having housed the Swedish king Oscar II. The new one housed the Norwegian king Olav V in the 1960s. A modern spa hotel, Levanger Fjordhotell and Spa, is to be constructed down at the harbour area, a part of a gentrification process, including the transformation of the old Trønder Mat factory (a meat processing plant) into high class apartments. ===Dining=== Numerous cafés, pubs, and bars are located along Kirkegata. No39 is a cafe in the ground floor of Backlund hotel, that offers an outdoor area during summertime. Oskars Irish Pub is an Irish themed pub, offering beer and whiskey. They can also offer an outdoor area during summer. ==Gallery== File:woodenhouseskirkegata.jpgView of some of the wooden houses File:gammelbankbygget.jpgThe old Levanger bank building File:oskarslevanger.jpgOskars Irish pub ==External links== *http://www.levanger.kommune.no/ Category:Streets in Norway Category:Levanger Category:Roads in Trøndelag ","title":"Kirkegata (Levanger)"},{"id":"20143248","text":"Saina is both a given name and a surname.

It is located along the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal on the north bank of the Potomac River, just west of Seneca Creek. The quarry was the source of stone for two Potomac River canals: the Potowmack Canal (opened in 1802, and officially known as the Great Falls Skirting Canal) on the Virginia side of Great Falls; and the C&O; Canal, having supplied red sandstone for the latter for locks 9, 11, 15 - 27, and 30, the accompanying lock houses, and Aqueduct No. 1, better known as Seneca Aqueduct, constructed from 1828 to 1833. Seneca red sandstone, also known as redstone, formed during the late Triassic age, 230 to 210 million years ago. The current geological name is Poolesville Member of Manassas Sandstone. Iron oxide gives the sandstone its rust color. It was prized for its ease of cutting, durability and bright color. The stone quarried here for the Smithsonian Castle was originally described as \\"lilac grey\\" in color when quarried,\\" but turned rusty red as it weathered. Numerous quarries operated on the one-mile stretch of the Potomac River west of Seneca Creek. The C&O; Canal provided a way for the heavy sandstone to reach the Washington, DC market, and the quarry's success is attributed to the canal. The Peter family of Georgetown, which built Tudor Place, owned the quarry from 1781 until 1866. John P.C. Peter, a great- grandson of Martha Washington, made the quarry into a commercial success by utilizing the C&O; and winning the bid to supply red sandstone for the Smithsonian Castle, constructed 1847-1855. Peter built the stonecutting mill, drawing power from the adjacent canal turning basin. He also built a miniature of Tudor Place near the quarry called Montevideo, now owned by the Kiplinger family. Seneca Quarry provided the stone for hundreds of buildings around the Washington, DC area, including houses in the Dupont Circle and Adams Morgan area, the James Renwick, Jr-designed Trinity Episcopal Church (1849; demolished 1936), Luther Place Memorial Church (1873), and the D.C. Jail in the 1870s. Montgomery C. Meigs purchased the Government Quarry nearby for the Washington Aqueduct project in the 1850s, and that quarry provided stone for the parapet of the Union Arch Bridge, better known as the \\"Cabin John Bridge,\\" the Washington Aqueduct Dam at Great Falls, McClellan Gate at Arlington National Cemetery, as well as the mile-long boundary wall that surrounds the cemetery. After the American Civil War, the Seneca Sandstone Company purchased the quarry in 1866, expanding the stonecutting mill in 1868, but went bankrupt in 1876 after financial mismanagement, sometimes referred to as the \\"Seneca Stone Ring Scandal.\\"[Convertible Bond Certificate - Maryland Freestone Mining and Manufacturing Company (Seneca Sandstone Company) - Maryland 1870] It was closed for seven years. In 1883, the Potomac Red Sandstone Company reopened the quarry but only operated until 1889, when the Great Flood of 1889 knocked out the C&O; Canal for two years. Baltimore quarry operator George Mann purchased the Seneca quarry in 1891 and operated it for the next decade. By 1901, quarrying operations had stopped as the quality of the rock diminished and Victorian architecture was no longer in vogue. The Seneca Schoolhouse, a small one-room schoolhouse of red sandstone, was built in 1866 to educate the children of the stone cutters who worked at the quarry. Located in Poolesville, Maryland, it provides tours to schoolchildren so that they can experience a typical school day as it would have been on March 13, 1880. Seneca Quarry is now overgrown with sycamore trees, tulip poplars, and dense brush such as wild rose, such that it is impenetrable much of the year. It is best visited in winter. The property includes ruins of the stonecutting mill, located at \\"the Junction of Seneca Creek and the C&O; Canal, just NW of the aqueduct\\" and the restored quarry master's house, located within Seneca Creek State Park. The quarry proper, Seneca Aqueduct, and the quarry cemetery are all part of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park. The quarry falls within the boundaries of the Seneca Historic District. Seneca Quarry was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. ==References *, including photo in 1997, at Maryland Historical Trust website *Seneca Quarry articles, including National Register nomination *WAMU 88.5 FM Metro Connection, \\"From Stone to Bright Red Structure: A Tour of the Seneca Quarry,\\" March 30, 2012. * *Stone Cutting Building, Tschiffeley Mill Road, Seneca vicinity, Montgomery, MD at the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) Category:Quarries in the United States Category:Buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Maryland Category:Buildings and structures in Montgomery County, Maryland Category:Historic American Buildings Survey in Maryland Category:National Register of Historic Places in Montgomery County, Maryland ","title":"Seneca Quarry"},{"id":"20143255","text":"This article provides information on candidates who stood for the 2001 Australian federal election.

It is a part of the Terrebonne Parish School District. South Terrebonne High currently serves the coastal communities of Bourg, Chauvin, Montegut, Pointe-aux-Chenes, and the eastern part of incorporated Houma in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana. It was the second high school built in Terrebonne Parish after the parish's sole high school, Terrebonne High School, became overcrowed with an influx of students from the lower reaches of the parish. The school was designed by the architectural firm of Curtis and Davis, who later designed the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans. South Terrebonne High was officially opened in 1961, with the first graduating class commencing in 1962. Most of the first graduating class were transferred into South Terrebonne for their senior year when the district was reapportioned, and some students delayed their graduation from Terrebonne High in 1961 in order to graduate in the first graduating class at the new school in 1962. Prior to 1988, South Terrebonne housed students in their sophomore, junior, or senior year. Once Ellender Memorial High School was expanded from a junior high school to become the parish's fourth high school, freshmen were then added to South Terrebonne. Today, the school houses over 1,000 students in grades 9-12, with 8th graders added in special education or advanced gifted classes. ==History== In 1968 Southdown High School (originally Houma Colored High School), which educated black students in Terrebonne Parish, closed. Students were moved to South Terrebonne High and Terrebonne High School. From 2015 to 2016 the Louisiana State Department of Education score for this school increased from 88.8 to 108, meaning the ranking improved to an \\"A\\" level. ==Academics== South Terrebonne has been an A school for the past 4 years now ==Athletics== South Terrebonne competes in District 7 of Class AAAA(4A) (the second highest classification level of athletics in the state of Louisiana). The school participates in varsity, junior varsity, and freshman athletics in 13 sports. * baseball * basketball (boys & girls) * cross country (boys & girls) * football * golf (boys) * soccer (boys & girls) * softball * swimming (boys & girls) * tennis (boys & girls) * track & field (boys & girls) * volleyball (girls) * bowling (boys & girls) * powerlifting (boys & girls) ===Championships=== Football * State Championships: 1 (Class AAAA - 1992) * District Championships: 6 Soccer =Boys= * District Championships: 1 (1992) * State 4AAAA Runners-up (2002) Softball * District Championships: 6 Swimming =Individual Boys= * State Championships: 4 (100 yd.

The schools are both known for their intense \\"dislike\\" for one another, on and off the fields of play. * Ellender Memorial High School - This became most recent rivalry, especially in football, when Ellender became a high school in 1988. Both schools share a common football field located at South Terrebonne's campus. South Terrebonne has dominated Ellender since 1996, and has only lost one game to Ellender since then. Also, each school's student body competes in the \\"Battle for the Spirit Stick\\", where students purchase construction paper chain links in each schools colors to adorn the stadium on game night. The school who sells the most links maintains the Spirit Stick until the following year. This is where the South Terrebonne's tradition of \\"Camo-Day\\" originated. Each South Terrebonne/Ellender football game the students at South Terrebonne High School dress in their camouflage clothing, paint their faces, and decorate the school with a swamp theme. Both schools have pep rallies for this occasion that show the \\"special\\" rivalry between the two schools. * South Lafourche High School - This is the lesser-advertised rivalry in the area. Both are the southernmost high schools in their respective parishes. Each school has a history of surprising wins and devastating losses to the other in many sports. The rivalry is further fueled by each school's fan base, where old-fashioned \\"in your face\\" mockery is steeped in the area's Cajun culture. ==Extracurricular clubs and activities== * 4-H * Art Club - made up of students taking classes in Art * Band Council - made up of members from the STHS Band * Carnival Tableau - Mardi Gras carnival court voted and presented by student body, with accompanying talent show * STHS Cheerleaders * STHS Choir * Choir Council - made up of members from the STHS Choir * COE - for students interested in administrative field * DECA * Drama Club * Gatorettes - high-step dance team * Key Club - philanthropy * Library Club * Million Dollar Band from Gatorland - award-winning marching band, drumline, and color guard * Multi Media - television/video/radio/music production * National Honor Society - academic honor society for juniors and seniors * G3(Gators Gone Godly)-South Terrebonne non denominational Christian Club * Publications - Gator Tales newspaper and Notre Temps yearbook * Quiz Bowl - students participate against other schools in rapid-fire quiz format * Renaissance Club - Honors Student Incentive Program * STHS Student Council - voted by student body ==School songs== The South Terrebonne High Fight Song was written from the combination of fight songs from two universities. The first verse was taken from the Victory March of the University of Notre Dame, while the second verse was taken from The Victors of the University of Michigan. ==Notable alumni== * Norby Chabert (Class of 1994), state senator from Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes since 2009 * Troy Johnson (Class of 1979), NFL wide receiver * Phillip Livas (Class of 2007), NFL wide receiver from 2011-2012 * Clarence Verdin (Class of 1979), NFL wide receiver ==References * South Terrebonne High Website Category:Public high schools in Louisiana Category:Schools in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana ","title":"South Terrebonne High School"},{"id":"20143266","text":"No More, No Less is the first album by the Youngstown, Ohio band Blue Ash, released in 1973 on Mercury Records SRM1-666.

It supported their fifth studio album Out of Control. Initially, just ten dates in bigger arenas were announced in November 2008. Due to demand, more dates were added. Girls Aloud performed thirty-two dates across the United Kingdom and Ireland. The tour commenced on 24 April 2009 at the Manchester Evening News Arena, with the final show on 6 June 2009 in Newcastle's Metro Radio Arena. The show was divided into five unique sections with distinct costumes, including the encore. Each member of the group had their own respective platform. During the show, Girls Aloud use pole dancing techniques and themes of BDSM. Most of the songs performed come from Out of Control, but earlier singles and cover versions were also performed. Like 2008's Tangled Up Tour, there is a smaller stage in the centre of the arena that Girls Aloud perform on during the show. ==Background and development== Girls Aloud performing at the Manchester Evening News Arena on 24 April 2009 Girls Aloud announced their plans to tour in support of Out of Control in mid- November 2008. Initially, just ten tour dates in bigger arenas across the United Kingdom and Ireland were announced, with tickets going on sale on 14 November. Due to arenas selling out, Girls Aloud added a number of live shows to the tour. Cheryl Cole's hometown of Newcastle sold particularly well, with the group scheduled to play a record-breaking four nights. Girls Aloud were also scheduled to play three dates in Belfast, Birmingham, Glasgow, Liverpool, and four dates in London and Manchester. The group performed three nights in O2 Arena and two at Wembley Arena. Nadine Coyle said, \\"We can't wait to get back out on the road to see our fans. We'll play the music that we love from the past albums. And it'll be great doing the new songs in those arenas, too.\\" The group began rehearsals \\"straight after Christmas\\". They took pole dancing lessons to prepare for a routine. Cheryl Cole and Kimberley Walsh missed some tour rehearsals, citing exhaustion following their charity climb of Mount Kilimanjaro for Comic Relief. Girls Aloud's rider includes treadmills, various exercise machines, and scented candles, as well as a physical therapist and masseuse. Each individual member has her own respective hairdresser and make- up artist. Emma Deigman was confirmed as the supporting act during the tour. Other support acts included Julian Perretta, Girls Can't Catch and Absent Elk. In addition to their own dates, Girls Aloud and American rapper Jay Z were support acts for Coldplay's Viva la Vida Tour at Wembley Stadium on 18 September 2009. ==Concert synopsis== Nicola Roberts performing at the Metro Radio Arena in Newcastle during the final date of the tour Girls Aloud start the show with their number one Brit Award-winning single \\"The Promise\\", \\"burst[ing] up out of the floor wearing long, spangly dresses which they whipped off to reveal short mini skirts.\\" They rise above the stage on individual hydraulic podiums.

A DVD called \\"Out of Control: Live From The O2 2009\\" was released on 5 October 2009, with a Blu-ray following on 12 October respectively. As well as the full live show, the DVD included several bonus features, including a Girl-cam that allowed the viewer to follow their favourite band member as she performed a song on tour. Also included are the videos for the singles \\"The Promise\\", \\"The Loving Kind\\" and \\"Untouchable\\", as well as the tour screen visuals and interviews. A limited edition was also available from Girls Aloud's official website, including a live CD to accompany the DVD/Blu-ray. In a review of the DVD, Phil Udell of State said, \\"Girls Aloud are great pop stars. […] their fourth live DVD finds them bestriding the live pop experience in high heels. […] It's hugely entertaining.\\" CBBC Newsround gave the release three stars out of five, stating, \\"It's definitely a hit for fans, but it's unlikely to convert anyone who isn't already into their music.\\" The live video album reached number two on the music DVD chart in its first week, falling to the number three in its second week. The DVD remained at number three in its third week. It returned to number two the following week. The DVD was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry. ===DVD track listing=== *Entire concert *Special features **Music videos for \\"The Promise\\", \\"The Loving Kind\\" and \\"Untouchable\\" **Girl cam: \\"Revolution in the Head\\" (Cheryl), \\"Love Machine\\" (Nicola), \\"Miss You Bow Wow\\" (Sarah), \\"Sound of the Underground\\" (Nadine), \\"Love Is the Key\\" (Kimberley) **Behind-the-scenes tour interview **Tour screen visuals: \\"Womanizer\\", \\"Love Machine\\", \\"Love Is the Key\\", \\"Revolution in the Head\\" and \\"Biology\\" ==Critical reception== The Out of Control Tour received mostly positive reviews from contemporary music critics. Phil Udell of State wrote, \\"As a spectacle, it's second to none – opening with the five raised high into the air on moving plinths and taking in floating stages, dancers, pyrotechnics, costume changes, brass sections […] some of the best pop songs this side of the sixties.\\" A reviewer from the Daily Mirror stated that \\"the slick routines proved why they're the UK's No1 girl band.\\" David Balls of Digital Spy called it Girls Aloud's \\"most spectacular live show yet.\\" Lauren Mulvenny of the Belfast Telegraph wrote, \\"the fiery five-piece proved themselves again as the queens of the pop anthem.\\" Gillian Orr of The Independent gave the show three stars out of five, but felt that Girls Aloud should have performed more of their older hit singles as opposed to newer album tracks. Dave Simpson of The Guardian also awarded three stars out of five. Writing for City Life, Simon Donohue comments that \\"they sing, dance, smile and wave as though they each have an extra set of lungs and a monopoly on confidence.\\" The show was dubbed Girls Aloud's \\"raunchiest performance ever\\" due to provocative performances that employ pole dancing techniques and BDSM. Mulvenny wrote, \\"The show got even sexier when the costumes took a dominatrix twist […] alongside raunchy routines with shirtless male backing dancers.\\" ==References== Category:2009 concert tours Category:2009 in British music Category:2009 video albums Category:Concert tours of the United Kingdom Category:Concert tours of Ireland Category:Girls Aloud concert tours Category:Girls Aloud video albums Category:Live video albums Category:April 2009 events in the United Kingdom Category:May 2009 events in the United Kingdom Category:June 2009 events in the United Kingdom Category:April 2009 events in Europe Category:May 2009 events in Europe Category:June 2009 events in Europe ","title":"Out of Control Tour"},{"id":"20143366","text":"The Brookeville Historic District is a national historic district located at Brookeville, Montgomery County, Maryland.

It is a small orchid only known from a few sites near the towns of Tallong and Wingello on the Southern Tablelands and is only relatively easy to find for about a month, when it flowers. It has been classified as \\"Endangered\\" under the EPBC Act. ==Description== Genoplesium plumosum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herb, usually with a few inconspicuous, fine roots and a pair of more or less spherical tubers. The tubers are partly covered by a protective fibrous sheath which extends to the soil surface. There is a single cylindrical, glabrous leaf fused to the flowering stem. The leaf is long and the part which is free from the stem is long and ends below the flowers. The leaf of flowering plants is solid but the leaves on plants without flowers are hollow. The inflorescence is a spike tall, with between one and eight, non- resupinate flowers. The flowers are more or less pendulous, moderately crowded, , greenish with purple stripes and have a purplish-red labellum. The dorsal sepal is narrowly egg-shaped, long, about wide, dished on the lower surface with smooth edges and a pointed tip. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, long, about wide and diverge from each other. The petals are narrow egg-shaped, long, about wide with a long, pointed tip. The labellum is above the column and stiffly hinged to it, and is oblong, about long, wide with hairy edges and a pointed tip. The callus is narrow egg-shaped to lance- shaped and extends nearly to the tip of the labellum. Flowering usually occurs 4 to 6 weeks following summer or autumn rainfall. The fruit is a non-fleshy, dehiscent capsule containing hundreds of seeds. ==Taxonomy and naming== The first formal description of Prasophyllum plumosum was by Herman Rupp in 1942 from a specimen found near Kurnell and the description was published in The Victorian Naturalist. In 1989, David Jones and Mark Clements placed it and most other species of Prasophyllum into Genoplesium. In 2002 Jones and Clements have proposed moving all but one of Genoplesium back to Corunastylis but the move has not been widely accepted. The specific epithet (plumosum) is a Latin word meaning \\"feathered\\". ==Distribution and habitat== Tallong midge- orchid grows among low shrubs in forest and in moss gardens over sandstone mainly between Sydney Harbour and Marulan. ==Conservation== Genoplesium plumosum has not been observed at the type location for more than 80 years and is now only known from a total area of and with a total population estimated in 2008 to be between 250 and 280 plants near Tallong and Wingello with a few individual plants in the Morton National Park. The main reasons for its decline have been land clearing and grazing by the introduced European Rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). The species is now listed as \\"Critically Endangered\\" in terms of the EPBC Act. ==External links== * ==References== plumosum Category:Orchids of New South Wales Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Plants described in 1942 ","title":"Genoplesium plumosum"},{"id":"20143462","text":"Princess Anna of Ysenburg und Büdingen (10 February 1886, Büdingen – 8 February 1980, Detmold) was the youngest child of Bruno, 3rd Prince of Ysenburg and Büdingen and his wife, Countess Bertha of Castell-Rüdenhausen.

It is situated at above sea level, a few kilometres south-west of the town of Zermatt in the canton of Valais in Switzerland. It is also known as Berghaus Matterhorn. http://www.hoernlihuette.ch/reservation_46.html The first Hörnli hut was built by the Swiss Alpine Club in 1880 and had 17 beds. It has since been expanded and rebuilt several times. In 1911, the municipality of Zermatt built a hut directly next to the Hotel Belvédère (also Berghaus Matterhorn). Both were merged in 1987 and managed by the municipality and offered since its last renovation in 1982 a number of 170 beds. From 2013 to 2015, the Belvédère was renovated and a new extension built. The original Hörnli hut was demolished. The new hut was inaugurated on 14 July 2015, the 150th anniversary of the first ascent of the mountain. It offers 130 beds (in a total of 34 8-,6-,4- and 2-person rooms) and an enlarged kitchen, modernized sanitation with showers and electricity from solar energy.

This United States Tennis Association (USTA) event is one of the most important competitions for male 16- and 18-year-olds tennis players, attracting 400 to compete from across the country. ==History== The United States Tennis Association (USTA) is the national governing body in the United States for the sport of tennis. The USTA was originally known as the United States National Lawn Tennis Association in 1881. The name was changed first to U.S. Lawn Tennis Association, and to the present name in 1975. The USTA has 17 different sections in different parts of the country, including: New England, Eastern, Middle States, Mid-Atlantic, Southern, Florida, Caribbean, Midwest, Northern, Missouri Valley, Texas, Southwest, Intermountain, Pacific Northwest, Northern California, Southern California, and Hawaii Pacific. Each of these sections have different regulations and procedures, but they all share the same mission statement: Each of the sections was started at a different time, as interest in the sport grew in that location. The USTA Midwest Section started in 1910 as the Western Lawn Tennis Association at the Chicago Beach Club in Chicago, Illinois. It originally controlled all of the tennis clubs west of the Alleghenies Mountains, and had great influence over the USTA at national meetings. When the USTA Midwest proposed a national clay court championship in 1910, the USTA agreed without dissent. In the 1920s, tennis became very popular in America and they started to train junior players. Originally the tournament was held at West Side Tennis Club in Forrest Hills, New York from 1916 to 1920 and then again in 1927. It moved to Longwood Cricket Club in Boston, Massachusetts from 1921 to 1923. From 1924 to 1926 it was at South Side Tennis Club in Chicago, Illinois. Then it was at Culver Military Academy in Culver, Indiana from 1928 to 1942. Due to WWII, it was necessary to move the tournament from a military base. Dr. Allen Stowe influenced the USTA to relocate the tournament to Kalamazoo College, where he was a coach. ==Nationals at the Zoo== In 1943, the first \\"Nationals at the Zoo\\" (\\"Zoo\\" for Kalamazoo, Michigan) had 90 entries for the two age divisions: 18 and under and 16 and under. The event has become one of the most-important events for juniors, attracting 400 players from across the United States. The event takes place over a ten-day period from which there are winners in singles and doubles tennis. The winners from the 18 and under tournament automatically receive a bid into the main draw of the U.S. Open Tournament. Many great names in men's tennis have participated in the competition. Past Participants include Rod Laver, Barry MacKay, Stan Smith, Arthur Ashe, Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe, Aaron Krickstein, Andre Agassi, Jim Courier, Pete Sampras, James Blake, Andy Roddick, Bob and Mike Bryan, Mike Franks, Jack Sock, and Jon Douglas. All of these prominent tennis players participated in the tournament, though only Laver (1956), Smith (1964), and Sock (2010, 2011) won the boys' 18-and-under National Championships for singles. Kalamazoo College's facilities include the Stowe Tennis Stadium which has eleven well-maintained hard courts outside, with seating for 3,000 spectators. The Markin Racquet Center has four indoor courts. Nearby Western Michigan University has made available their 20-court Raymond Sorensen complex for the growing tournament. ==Similar events== There are many events that are similar to the Junior National Tennis Championship. Girls' Championships have a similar event that takes place every year in San Diego, California for 16- and 18-year-olds. Along with having these great events in the US, there are also events all around the world. In Europe, there are tournaments for boys and girls. These events come in different age groups such as 12, 14, 16 and 18-and-under. ==References== *Tennis Europe Junior Department Retrieved October 26, 2008. * USTA, USTA2, USTA3.

The ship is possibly best known for supporting scientific operations in the Marianas, in particular serving as communication relay and support ship for the bathyscaphe Trieste in Project Nekton; she towed the bathyscaphe some 260 nautical miles (482 kilometers) from Guam to the vicinity of the Challenger Deep, where, on 23 January 1960, Trieste descended to a record 37,000 feet (11,278 meters). ==Construction and commissioning== Originally projected as steel-hulled rescue tug USS ATR—131, Wandank was laid down as USS ATA-204 on 25 September 1944 at Port Arthur, Texas, by the Gulfport Boiler and Welding Works. She was launched on 9 November 1944 and commissioned on 18 January 1945 with Lieutenant, junior grade, Vernon L. Ryan, USNR, in command. She was 143 ft in length and displaced 835 tons. ==First period in commission, 1945-1947World War II service, 1945=== Following her shakedown in the Caribbean, ATA-204 got underway on 23 February 1945 for the Panama Canal, en route to World War II service in the Pacific Ocean. She operated with the United States Pacific Fleet through the end of hostilities, performing services at locales ranging from Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, to the Marshall Islands. ===Postwar service and decommissioning, 1945-1947=== After hostilities ended on 15 August 1945, ATA-204 returned to the United States at San Francisco, California, late in August 1945. She soon shifted to the Puget Sound Navy Yard, Bremerton, Washington. She operated in the 13th Naval District until she was decommissioned on 26 November 1947 and placed in reserve. ==Second period in commission, 1952-1971Pearl Harbor service, 1952-1955=== The onset of the Korean War (1950-1953) gave ATA-204 a new lease on life by triggering the expansion of the United States Navy. ATA-204 was reactivated on 17 April 1952 at Astoria, Oregon, for assignment to the 14th Naval District. Recommissioned at Pearl Harbor on 3 May 1952 with Lieutenant William A. Walden in command, she was renamed USS Wandank while retaining her \\"ATA-204\\" designation. She operated out of Pearl Harbor until 1955, providing tug and tow services for the Pacific Fleet, and occasionally deployed to American Samoa and other Pacific islands with tows. ===Mariana Islands service, 1955-1967=== On 9 September 1955, Wandank was transferred to the Mariana Islands. There, she towed barges of supplies, stood ready to assist in search-and-rescue operations, provided target services for gunnery and torpedo exercises, and conducted local surveillance missions out of Guam into the 1960s. During this deployment, Wandank supported scientific operations in addition to her more routine duties. In January 1960, for example, she served as communication relay and support ship for the bathyscaphe Trieste in Project Nekton; she towed the bathyscaphe some 260 nautical miles (482 kilometers) from Guam to the vicinity of the Challenger Deep, where, on 23 January 1960, Trieste descended to a record 37,000 feet (11,278 meters). Hydrophone gear aboard Wandank was still able to communicate with the craft once on the bottom, although the sound waves took seven seconds to make a one-way journey from ship to bathyscaphe, which was nearly seven miles deep. On occasion, Wandanks operations nonetheless assumed a dangerous character during tropical storms. During one of these storms, which occurred October 19, 1963, Wandank was trapped between two typhoons while en route to her annual buoy maintenance duty at Chichi Jima in the Bonin Islands. In the heavy seas, her tow line parted, leaving USS YCV-18 adrift. During the ensuing recovery operations, the tug's Lieutenant JG, J. B. Clark, ordered everyone off the fantail out of harm's way. While operating the winch he was knocked overboard when the tow line snapped. Several crewmen jumped in to try to save him but were not able to get him back on board. In November 1964, Wandank conducted a survey of the Solomon Islands in a joint project sponsored by the University of Hawaii's Institute of Geophysics and the Office of Naval Research; during the course of this operation, she measured the earth's gravity in the area. In July 1966, Wandank rendezvoused with Japanese merchantman Yeiji Maru, which had been experiencing engine trouble, and escorted the distressed ship to Guam. Later that year, she towed SS Old Westbury to a safe haven, relieving auxiliary ocean tug USS Sunnadin (ATA-197), which had run low on fuel on 11 November 1966. The year 1967 passed with much the same routine. ===Vietnam War and Mariana Islands service, 1968-1971=== In 1968, Wandank participated in her first operations in connection with the Vietnam War. She towed gasoline barge USS YOG-131 from Guam to Da Nang, South Vietnam, from 3 January 1968 to 15 January 1968. After returning from Vietnamese waters, she performed island survey duties in the western Caroline Islands and subsequently helped to search for floating drydock USS AFDM-6, which had broken loose from her civilian tow vessel. Wandank next participated in special operations into the summer of 1968 before making a second voyage to Vietnamese waters, towing USS APL-30 to Vung Tau, South Vietnam, from 16 August 1968 to 1 September 1968. Wandank commenced in 1969 with more island surveillance missions in the central Caroline Islands, sending a landing party ashore from her crew to ascertain the needs of the islanders who lived under the care and protection of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. She conducted a training mission to Yokosuka, Japan, in February and March 1969 before returning to a schedule of surveillance operations in the northern Mariana Islands. She trained for possible participation in Project Apollo in April 1969 before she towed three barges from Sattahip, Thailand, to Vung Tau, South Vietnam, from 13 April 1969 to 8 May 1969. Upon returning to the vicinity of the Mariana and Caroline Islands soon thereafter, she conducted local operations through the end of 1969. Wandank interrupted this duty only long enough to tow landing craft utility USS LCU-1483 to Ponape Island and USS LCU-1497 to Majuro, from 25 November 1969 to 4 December 1969. During her final full year of naval service, 1970, Wandank conducted local operations out of her home port of Apra Harbor, Guam.

The event was dubbed \\"It's Only Rock And Roll\\". Only artists who had released material on the Atlantic label in the United States performed, spanning the company's forty-year existence. Lavern Baker and Ruth Brown were the longest tenured Atlantic acts to perform, while Debbie Gibson was the most recent. Some Atlantic signings, who had either officially split up or not performed together for a number of years, re-formed especially to perform. These included The Rascals, Iron Butterfly, and the former members of Led Zeppelin. Other notable performers included Yes, Genesis, Crosby, Stills & Nash, Keith Emerson and Carl Palmer (representing Emerson, Lake & Palmer), Foreigner, Paul Rodgers, Bob Geldof, Booker T. Jones, Wilson Pickett, The Coasters, The Spinners, Peabo Bryson, The Blues Brothers (featuring Dan Aykroyd and Sam Moore), Roberta Flack, The Manhattan Transfer, Bee Gees, Ben E. King and Vanilla Fudge. Plans to close the performance with a greatest hits all-star jam were shelved.Lewis, Dave and Pallett, Simon (1997) Led Zeppelin: The Concert File, London: Omnibus Press, p. 140. Instead, the former members of Led Zeppelin were the last act. \\"No rehearsal and just shambling on,\\" recalled guitarist Jimmy Page. The concert was broadcast live in the US on FM radio and HBO television; commentary for the latter being provided backstage by comedian Robert Townsend. HBO commenced its live broadcast a few hours into the event and interspersed footage of the concert that had been taped earlier by the network. In so doing, some of the artists' sets were edited or omitted. An edited version aired later that year on ABC hosted by Robert Hays. The audio was recorded by David Hewitt and Stanley Johnston on the Record Plant Black Truck. Banners heralding the reunion of Led Zeppelin were displayed like tapestry by excited fans – but, to the fans' dismay, were taken down before HBO went with their live feed. In the United Kingdom, the event was broadcast over four weeks by BBC Two, presented as hour-long episodes. Atlantic issued this production on video as Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary: It's Only Rock 'n' Roll. The release intercut concert footage with highlights of earlier performances, and older footage from the Atlantic archives. ==Performances== Marv Albert *Introduction The Coasters *\\"That Is Rock-N-Roll\\" *\\"Charlie Brown\\" Phil Collins *\\"In the Air Tonight\\" Phil Collins *Introduction of LaVern Baker Lavern Baker *\\"Jim Dandy\\" *\\"Saved\\" Roberta Flack *Introduction of Foreigner Foreigner *\\"Hot Blooded\\" *\\"Juke Box Hero\\" *\\"Urgent\\" *\\"I Want To Know What Love Is\\" Laura Branigan *\\"Gloria\\" Stephen Stills *Introduction of Ben E.

However, the SudaSuda π 2126, Potamon says that Potamo lived in the age of Augustus (late 1st century BC) which, if true, would mean that Laërtius probably copied a statement, without alteration, from an earlier writer.Robert Drew Hicks, Diogenes Laërtius: Lives of Eminent Philosophers, page 21. Loeb Classical Library. According to Laërtius he combined doctrines derived from the various philosophy schools (Platonism, Peripateticism, Stoicism, etc.) together with original views of his own. According to the Suda he wrote a commentary on the Republic of Plato. Diogenes Laërtius provides us with some details concerning his philosophical views: > He himself states in his Elements of Philosophy, he takes as criteria of > truth (1) that by which the judgement is formed, namely, the ruling > principle of the soul; (2) the instrument used, for instance the most > accurate perception.

In Brands Hatch, he shared a 910 with Jochen Rindt, finishing 11th. Zeltweg was another DNF, in a 906 entered by Scuderia Lufthansa, and the penultimate round in Switzerland, the Hill Climb at Ollon-Villars, saw him finishing with a tiny Fiat-Abarth 1000cc at the lower end of the field. For the 1968 World Sportscar Championship season, Schütz joined the Italian Alfa Romeo Tipo 33 factory team, scoring 5thhttp://wspr-racing.com/wspr/results/wscc/ms1968.html#1 place at the 24 Hours of Daytona, with the rest of the season being rather disappointing. Schütz returned to Porsche for the 1969 World Sportscar Championship season and was paired there with Gerhard Mitter, mostly on a Porsche 908/02, fitted with spyder or long tail body. The season began at Daytona with a 24th place following camshaft trouble, and a 5th place at Sebring. In the third round at Brands Hatch they scored their first podium finish, beaten by two sister cars. The first Italian race, the 1000km Monza, ended with an engine failure, but the second one, in Sicily, with a triumph.

For the 1969 1000km Spa, a fast track like Monza and Le Mans, they opted to drive the powerful new Porsche 917 for the first time ever in a race, even though they had qualified it only at 8th, slower than their 908. The flat-12-cylinder engine failed in lap 1 before Schütz could take over from Mitter. At the Ring, Mitter/Schütz qualified 3rd in their 908/02,http://20832.com/event.php3?event=690601_h&id;=10⟨=eng but due to suspension problems ended up 31st while the other 908s occupied the first five places. At the 1969 24 Hours of Le Mans, Mitter and Schütz were back in the 908. After 14 hours, in lap 199, Schütz at high speed crashed his #23 Langheck badly after a collision with the #64 sister car driven by Gérard Larrousse, getting ejected from the car when it rolled, surviving without severe injuries. Having already secured the championship, the Porsche System Engineering factory team did not participate in the penultimate round at Watkins Glen in mid July. Only three 908/02 cars were shipped overseas and entered by other teams, and Schütz was not among the drivers. After his driving partner Gerhard Mitter died two weeks later in practice for the 1969 German Grand Prix, Schütz skipped the ultimate round in Zeltweg and retired, sticking to his decision even when Ferrari looked for experienced drivers for their Ferrari 512S multi-car effort in 1970. In total he won 50 races, three of them counting towards the world championship. He has won the German Sports car championship in 1966, scored 2nd with and for Porsche in the 1967 World Sportscar Championship season, finished 3rd with Alfa in 1968, and helped Porsche to finally secure the World Sportscar Championship in 1969. He focused on his company Schütz Werke in his home town of Selters (Westerwald), which offers also containers.

Together with I Ngendon, he was one of the foremost painters from Batuan. Unlike Ngendon, Togog was not particularly interested in Western ideas. He was comfortable with the Balinese way of life and adhered closely to the Balinese belief system. As a member of the high priest family, Togog was very familiar with Balinese lontar (religious literature) and Balinese myths and folklore. His works were primarily drawn from religion and local myths from an insider's view point and he narrates them through his drawings, just like in the Wayang tradition. The strength of his drawings was neither his draftsmanship nor composition, but his narration of complex religious beliefs and the united life in Bali as a balance between the macrocosm and microcosm, between the benevolent and good spirits. According to Wim Bakker, it was the Dutch painter Rudolf Bonnet, who inspired him to translate images in Balinese lontars into drawings. During 1936 to 1938, he was befriended by Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead and produced 83 paintings for them. As Bateson and Mead went to Bali to do research on Balinese character, they requested Togog to give an expression of his dreams. He produced a large number of drawings on dreams and his own interpretation in the context of Balinese beliefs as he understood it. His works can be found in Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam and in the Rudolf Bonnet collection at the Ethnography Museum in Leiden, the Netherlands. In Bali, his can be viewed at the Puri Lukisan Museum and the Agung Rai Museum of Art (ARMA) in Ubud, Bali. == References == Category:Balinese art Category:Indonesian artists Category:Indonesian Hindus Category:1913 births Category:1989 deaths Category:Balinese people ","title":"Ida Bagus Made Togog"},{"id":"20143630","text":"Solvay Hut The Solvay Hut or Solvay Bivouac (German: Solvayhütte) is a mountain hut located on the north-eastern ridge (Hörnli Ridge) of the Matterhorn, near Zermatt in the canton of Valais.

He served as a Senator for New South Wales from 1901 to 1913. Walker was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. He spent his early childhood in New South Wales, before returning to Scotland with his family to study finance. Joining the Bank of New South Wales, he returned to Australia and held various financial positions in New South Wales and Queensland. Gaining a public reputation for financial expertise, he was active in the Federationist cause and was a delegate to the 1897 Constitutional Convention, where he was a significant figure in the development of Commonwealth finance schemes. After assisting the successful \\"Yes\\" campaign for the 1898 referendum, he was elected to the Senate in 1901 as a Free Trader. As a senator, Walker continued to focus on finance, although his views on social policy sometimes saw him on the outside of his party. He supported the White Australia policy but disagreed with key elements, and was a leader in opposition to the dictation test, by which a potential immigrant was required to pass a test in any European language before their application was accepted. He also campaigned for a transcontinental railway and for a capital city to be located on federal territory. Attempts to guide financial reform through the parliament as a backbench senator led to frustration, and Walker retired due to ill health in 1913 with his legislation unpassed. ==Early life and career== Walker was born on Leith Walk in Edinburgh to grazier John William Walker and his wife Elizabeth, née Waterston. The family migrated to New South Wales in 1844 and settled on Castlereads Station near Boorowa. In 1849, John Walker sold the property to Hamilton Hume and returned to Scotland. James was educated at the Edinburgh Institution and King's College London before returning to Edinburgh in 1857. After several years in Scotland working first for the paper manufacturers Cowan & Sons, and then for stockbroker Robert Allan, he joined the Bank of New South Wales' London branch in March 1860; his cousin, Thomas Walker, was one of the bank's directors. In January 1862 he departed for Melbourne on Swiftsure and was posted to the bank's Sydney office. Walker was then sent by the bank to Rockhampton in Queensland, where he worked as an accountant until 1866 when he was appointed manager of the Townsville branch. In 1867 he was transferred to the Toowoomba branch, which he managed until 1878 when he was promoted assistant inspector in Brisbane. He married Janette Isabella Palmer on 16 April 1868 at Range View. In 1885 he resigned from the Bank of New South Wales to become the first manager of the Royal Bank of Queensland, but in 1887 he returned to New South Wales to manage the estate of Eadith Walker, the daughter of his late cousin Thomas. ==Federation== James Walker at the 1898 Australasian Federal Convention. Walker had a strong interest in Federation and was a member of the Australasian Federation League of New South Wales. In 1896 he attended the People's Federal Convention in Bathurst, where he proposed a financial scheme that would provide savings for a federal government based on income from state taxes and federal spending. His reputation for financial expertise saw him elected to the Australian Federal Convention in 1897. There he supported equal representation for all states in an upper house, Commonwealth control of railways, and a national capital on federal territory. He reiterated his financial proposals, but was overlooked for the finance and trade committee, having been described by Alfred Deakin as \\"a mere commercial man\\". Despite this setback, Walker continued to play an active part in the development of the Australian Constitution. He had the name of the federal upper house changed from the \\"States Assembly\\" to the Senate, although his proposal that the federated colonies adopt the name \\"Commonwealth of Australasia\\", with a view to the future inclusion of New Guinea, New Zealand and Fiji, was not adopted. He also supported a minimum age for senators of twenty-five, rather than twenty-one, and voted for Paddy Glynn's proposal to include recognition of a \\"Divine Sovereign\\" in the Constitution. The second session of the Convention took place in Sydney in September 1897. Walker was appointed to a subcommittee on federal finance, which proposed a financial scheme based on Walker's Bathurst proposal that was adopted by the Convention. He was active in the Federation referendum campaign, travelling around New South Wales to encourage a \\"Yes\\" vote. He mostly focused on financial issues, and in 1899 went to Western Australia, the most reluctant colony, to increase support. Following the success of the referendum, Walker was encouraged to stand for the Senate by a petition of over 6500 signatures. A staunch free trader, Walker campaigned as part of the Free Trade Party's endorsed ticket. He had resigned as president of the Bank of New South Wales in 1897, but remained a director. At the first federal election in March 1901, Walker was elected as a New South Wales senator at the head of the poll. ==Senate career== Portrait of Senator Walker by Tom Roberts, 1901 As a senator, Walker devoted his support to a variety of causes, including a transcontinental railway and equal pay for women. He opposed a federal old-age pension scheme on the grounds of lack of funds, and also opposed the Immigration Restriction Bill, although he supported the White Australia policy in principle. He opposed the proposed form of the dictation test and supported James Macfarlane's amendment requiring the test to be administered in a language known to the immigrant, moving his own amendment after Macfarlane's was defeated. He also expressed reservations about the deportation of Kanaka labourers, supporting the reduction in their use but advocating that those resident in Australia for at least five years be permitted to remain. He vigorously opposed compulsory arbitration, and voted against the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. Re-elected as an Anti-Socialist in 1906, Walker expressed the view that the three-party system of the Australian Parliament's first decade was dysfunctional, and implored electors to vote \\"for either socialism or anti-socialism, and so end this triangular government\\". He continued to support the transcontinental railway and lamented the slow progress of the decision on a site for the federal capital, and supported a higher rate of immigration and the watering down of the Immigration Restriction Act. In 1908, he introduced the Commonwealth Companies Reserve Liabilities Bill, which permitted special reserve funds for banks to assist shareholders during a financial crisis, and in 1910 followed with the similar Commonwealth Banking Companies Reserve Liabilities Bill. He complained of the difficulty of passing private senators' bills, and at the 1913 election he retired, suffering from ill health. ==Later life== Walker maintained an interest in politics after his retirement, and remained a director of the Bank of New South Wales until 1921. He had been president of the Australian Golf Club (1903-19), a director of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, and a member of the Presbyterian Church's finance committee. A fellow of the Institute of Bankers in London since 1886 and vice-president of the Australian Economic Association, he also continued as a director of the Australian Mutual Provident Society and a councillor of St Andrew's College at the University of Sydney.

After a number of appearances in the Worcestershire second team, he made his first-class debut against Oxford University at The University Parks in May 1985. In his first game, Kimber scored 14 not out at number ten in his only innings, bowled seven wicketless overs and held one catch. Kimber also appeared against Cambridge University, taking his first three first-class wickets, but that was to be his only other first-team outing for Worcestershire. Kimber's English appearances in 1986 were confined to a handful of Second XI games with Derbyshire, but that winter he went to South Africa and played a couple of first-class matches for Natal B in the Castle Bowl, claiming six wickets in the match against Eastern Province B. For 1987 he joined Sussex, with whom he was to remain until 1989. It was during this period that he produced his only first-class half-century: 54 against Nottinghamshire in early August 1987. In the 1987 season he appeared eight times in first-class cricket, his most in a single season, but the only time he was anything like a regular was in the one-day form of the game the following summer, when he made 20 List A appearances. However, in those games he took only 14 wickets and failed entirely with the bat, compiling just 81 runs in his 11 innings. The rest of Kimber's cricketing career was spent in South Africa, again playing for Natal B and -- in 1990-91 -- the province's main team. He proved a considerably more successful wicket-taker here than he had been in England, claiming four or more wickets in a first-class innings on five occasions and in January 1992 achieving his only five-wicket innings haul when he took 5-63 for Natal B against Transvaal B. He played his final match in December 1993. ==NotesReferences== * * Category:English cricketers Category:Worcestershire cricketers Category:Sussex cricketers Category:KwaZulu-Natal cricketers Category:1963 births Category:Living people ","title":"Simon Kimber"},{"id":"20143712","text":"Shah Nikdur (Punjabi, Urdu:شاہ نکڈر) is a small town in district of Sargodha, Punjab, Pakistan on the border between Sargodha and Jhang District.

It is approximately long and wide. It divides the northernmost bank of the Caribbean islands into two nearly equal parts. To the north and northeast is the Great Bahama Bank and the Bahama Islands; and to the south the bank on which the island of Cuba rests. The Old Bahama Channel is connected at its north-western extremity end to the Florida Straits by two arms, enclosing Cay Sal Bank, of which the northern is called Santaren Channel and the southern Nicholas Channel. It is considered as terminating on the east between Cape Maysi in Cuba, and Inagua island in the Bahamas. However, it can also be considered to include the deep sea which separates the minor banks north of Haiti from this island, so that it extends to the Mona Passage, or the strait between the islands of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico. The narrowest portion of the Old Bahama Channel is between 22° and 23° North latitude, where its width rarely exceeds . ==History== In the 1500s, Alonso Valiente was one of the discoverers of the Old Bahama Channel. The Spanish colonial trade routes in the Spanish West Indies originally favored the Old Bahama Channel, then shifted to the Straits of Florida—New Bahama Channel, as it was a safer alternative. In the Old Bahama Channel, ship captains had to pick their way through the low-lying cays and shoals of the southern Bahama Banks.

He was of Huguenot ancestry and a native of Lübeck. His most influential work was Kyrios Christos, an attempt to explain the origins of devotion to Christ as the product of second century Hellenistic forces, and is still the most widely influential academic work on early Christology, even if its conclusions are not supported by modern scholarship.Hurtado, Larry W. \\"Wilhelm Bousset's Kyrios Christos: An Appreciative and Critical Assessment.\\" Early Christianity 6.1 (2015): 17-29, esp. 23-24 ==Biography== He began his studies at the University of Erlangen, where he met Ernst Troeltsch (1865–1923), with whom he would maintain a friendship that would last throughout his career. Later on, he studied at Leipzig, where he was student of Adolf von Harnack (1851–1930), and afterwards continued his education at the University of Göttingen. In 1890 he became a professor of New Testament exegesis at Göttingen, later relocating to the University of Giessen (1916). Bousset was a prominent figure in the Religionsgeschichtliche Schule (history of religions school), a group that included scholars such as Richard August Reitzenstein (1861–1931), Albert Eichhorn (1856–1926) and Hermann Gunkel (1862–1932). His better known work involved comparative studies between the Early Christian Church and other religious beliefs, particularly Hellenistic Judaism. == Kyrios Christos == In 1913, Wilhelm Bousset published his classic work Kyrios Christos analyzing the early emergence of Christ devotion in the first two centuries of Christianity. Bousset's work qualified as the most influential work on the history of early Christology and Christ devotion in the 20th century, and Bousset's work has shaped over a generation of scholarship. It underwent various editions, and in 1970, was translated into English. Bousset posited a distinction between the early Palestinian community of Jesus' followers and the second generation of Christians, composed, to a much more significant degree, of non-Jewish Gentile Christians. Bousset, in coming to this conclusion, rejected evaluation of any sources outside the Synoptic Gospels, including the letters of Paul. These Christians, who lived and were highly familiar with the pagan and Hellenistic communities of the Roman world, developed a belief that Jesus was Kyrios, Lord, analogous to other pagan beliefs in cultic deities and deified men. The letters of Paul and Gospel of John reveal evidence of this Hellenism, whereas second century Christians such as Ignatius, Justin Martyr and Irenaeus reveal even more pagan influence. Despite the major impact made by Bousset's work, numerous recent developments in scholarship and an increase in the available texts from this period has led to a rejection of Bousset's thesis, and it is now recognized that Bousset's work was largely influenced by his liberal Protestant bias and attempt to create a form of earliest Christianity that resembled his own views.Hurtado, Larry W. Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2005, 1-27.Karsten Lehmkiihler, Kultus und Theologie: Dogmatik und Exegese in der religionsgeschichtliche Schule, Forschungen zur systematischen und okumenischen Theologie 76 (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1996) Larry Hurtado, a major modern scholar in early Christology, writes; > To summarize up to this point: Bousset has been shown to be seriously wrong > both in his portrayal of his \\"primitive\\" Jewish Christian community and in > his characterization of key features of the devotion of Paul and the > Christian groups he represents. These alone are major reasons to set aside > Kyrios Christos as an account of the development of Christ-devotion. The > extent of the problems with Bousset's characterization of early devotion to > Jesus is such that one wonders how such an erudite scholar could have made > such mistakes, and the answer, I suggest, has to do with the approach and > assumptions that Bousset brought to his analysis. As I have stated already, > Bousset sought to make the story of early Christ-devotion a simple tale of > Hellenization, more specifically, the progressive paganization of a > supposedly pure, primitive Christian faith.Hurtado, pg. 23 Hurtado describes other significant components of Bousset's thesis that are now widely rejected by modern scholarship. Bousset argued that the primitive Christian community believed in a heavenly redeemer figure called the 'Son of Man' from pre-Christian Jewish traditions, and that Jesus referred to this figure in his sayings in the Gospels. Bousset believed this title was used in early christological confessions in the primitive Christian community. However, modern scholars have concluded that the \\"Son of Man\\" never constituted a title in pre-Christian Jewish tradition,Hare, Douglas RA. The Son of Man Tradition. Fortress press, 1990. Hare writes pg. 21, \\"No scholar can fairly claim on the basis of the extant evidence that 'the Son of man' had become a widespread, universally recognized title for a supernatural figure who was expected to function as God's deputy in the last judgment.\\", nor that it was used as a confessional title in the early Christian community. Furthermore, scholars now widely regard Jesus to be self-referential when mentioning the \\"Son of Man\\" figures in the Gospels, rather than referring to some alternative heavenly redeemer figure.Hurtado, Lord Jesus Christ, pg. 20 Furthermore, Bousset also relied on a distinction between \\"Palestinian\\" and \\"Hellenistic\\" for his studies on early Christology that, though was widely accepted in his day, has now been rejected by modern scholars as being simplistic. The relationship between Palestinian Judaism and Hellenistic Judaism is considered to be complex, with varying influences between the two concepts in different communities rather than clearly separable layers by which study on early Christology can be conducted.Marshall, Howard. \\"Palestinian and Hellenistic christianity: Some critical comments.\\" New Testament Studies 19.3 (1973): 271-287.Hengel, Martin.

A solicitor, businessman and citizen soldier before his entry into politics, Gould was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1882 to 1898, during which time he served as Minister for Justice in two Free Trade governments. He later served two years in the New South Wales Legislative Council from 1899 to 1901 until his election to the Australian Senate. Gould's interest in parliamentary procedure saw him become involved with the relevant standing committee and he was elected unopposed as the second President of the Senate in 1907. His tenure is remembered as more traditionalist and Anglophilic than his predecessor's. Defeated by the Labor nominee in 1910 following the Liberal government's defeat, Gould remained in parliament as a backbencher until 1917, when he retired after he was not re- endorsed by the Nationalist Party. He was active in community and religious affairs during his long retirement. ==Early life and career== Gould was born in Sydney, the son of solicitor John Morton Gould and his wife Anne (née Livingstone). He attended William Woolls' school in Parramatta, and went on to study law at the University of Sydney, although he did not take a degree. He served his articles with his father and was admitted to the bar in December 1870. He then worked in Singleton for a Sydney legal firm. Gould also developed significant business interests, being involved with the Great Cobar Copper Mining syndicate and serving as a director of the Electric Light and Power Supply Company, the City Bank of Sydney and the Oriental Timber Corporation. On 12 September 1872, he married Jeanette Jessie Maitland at St Paul's Church of England in West Maitland. Gould was also a citizen soldier, enlisting as a volunteer in the West Maitland company of the New South Wales volunteer forces. He later took command of the Singleton Company, becoming a major in 1886. He later received the Volunteer Officers' Decoration for long service; he would retire from the regiment in 1902 as a lieutenant-colonel. ==State politics== In 1882, Gould was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the member for Patrick's Plains (renamed Singleton in 1894). Initially an opponent of the coalition associated with Henry Parkes and John Robertson, he later supported Robertson's government in 1885. By 1887 he was supporting his career with his own legal practice in Singleton and Sydney, and when the party system came into being in New South Wales in that year he identified as a Free Trader. In 1889 he was appointed Minister for Justice under Parkes, serving until 1891; he held the position again under George Reid from 1894 to 1898. During the first period of his ministry he became involved in a dispute with the Chief Justice, Sir Frederick Darley, over requests for improved court accommodation and a contested punishment for contempt of two witnesses. Despite embarrassing his premier, he remained close with Parkes throughout his state career and in later years frequently gave speeches in his memory. Gould's career as justice minister was marked by consolidation of the law, tightening of licensing laws and reforms relating to police courts. A supporter of Federation, he nevertheless opposed the 1898 bill, which he believed deprived New South Wales of adequate recognition. He was defeated in the election of that year, but in 1899 he was one of Premier Reid's twelve appointments to the Legislative Council that enabled the passage of the legislation for a referendum on Federation. ==Senate career== Following Federation, Gould contested the first federal election in March 1901, standing for the Senate as a Free Trader. He was elected in the third of six positions, entitling him to a six-year term. His first speech was largely devoted to his impassioned support for free trade, and in his early years as a senator he also supported decentralisation and opposed proposals to establish a federal capital. A supporter of the White Australia policy, he expressed concern over Kanaka labour in Queensland, although his assumption that the arrangement was temporary enabled his pragmatism on this issue. Gould was also involved in defence matters, supporting the introduction of conscription and maintaining loyalty to the Empire, where \\"there are men much more experienced in the principles of government than we are\\". At the 1906 election, Gould was easily re-elected in the first position, winning the largest vote for any senator to that time. From 1901 Gould maintained an interest in the procedure of the Senate, and was a member of the standing orders committee from its appointment in 1901 until 1907. He had supported the opening of Senate proceedings with prayer and had made frequent reference to the standing orders of the British House of Commons. He contested the Presidency of the Senate in 1904, but was defeated by the incumbent, Sir Richard Baker. On Baker's retirement, Gould was unanimously elected President on 20 February 1907. He endeavoured to keep the Senate representative of the states' interests and free from party politics, and his rulings focused on unparliamentary language and relevance. Gould, appointed Knight Bachelor in 1908, differed from his predecessor in his adherence to British influence. With the election of the Fisher Labor Government in 1910, Gould was defeated by Harry Turley for the presidency. Despite his support for conscription, Gould was not endorsed by the new Nationalist Party to contest the 1917 election. Deeply offended, Gould nevertheless elected to retire rather than run as an independent and split the Nationalist vote. ==Later life== In his retirement, Gould continued his community involvement. A director of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital and the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children, he also served as a member and chancellor of the Sydney and Newcastle synods of the Church of England. He died in July 1936 at Rose Bay aged 89; he was survived by two sons and three daughters (his wife died in 1928; one daughter had also predeceased him). Gould was given a state funeral at St Andrew's Cathedral and was buried at South Head Cemetery. ==References== Category:Free Trade Party members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Commonwealth Liberal Party members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Australian Senate for New South Wales Category:Members of the Australian Senate Category:Presidents of the Australian Senate Category:Members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly Category:Members of the New South Wales Legislative Council Category:Australian Knights Bachelor Category:Australian politicians awarded knighthoods Category:Australian Anglicans Category:1847 births Category:1936 deaths Category:Nationalist Party of Australia members of the Parliament of Australia Category:20th-century Australian politicians ","title":"Albert Gould"},{"id":"20143837","text":"Robin 'Bob' Greenwood (born 24 March 1947) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with Essendon in the Victorian Football League (VFL) during the late 1960s and early 1970s.

Michael Kincaid Davis was born in Baltimore on December 6, 1939. He was one of three children. While his father was a captain in the United States Coast Guard, it was his experience as an anthropologist and archeologist that triggered his nautical interests. He graduated from Beloit College in 1964 and was awarded a master's degree at the University of Oklahoma in anthropology. He worked with archeological teams from the University of Chicago, and spent several years working on an archeological dig in Turkey at Diyarbakır, near the Euphrates River. The dig was interrupted by guerrilla activity. After spending time in Istanbul and seeing how individuals could easily rent a boat and take it out rowing on the Bosporus, he came to the conclusion that the same thing should be available on the Hudson River. Davis noted that \\"as late as 1933 there were 41 boathouses in Manhattan, while now there is just one.\\"Kaufman, Michael T. \\"ABOUT NEW YORK; Tales of Times Square: Rowboats and Ice Cream\\", The New York Times, February 15, 1995. Accessed November 9, 2008. After reading articles in boating journals, Davis created an organization called Floating the Apple in March 1994 to help provide boating opportunities on the Hudson River. With financial assistance from the Open Space Institute, Davis decided that the group should build boats and make them available for public use. A design was developed for a boat that could accommodate ten passengers, and the boats were constructed using donated tools in space made available to Davis by the 42d Street Development Corporation. The boats that Davis constructed were Whitehall gigs, a longer version of the traditional Whitehall Rowboat that dates back to a 250-year-old design that was the type of boat George Washington used to get his troops across the East River during the Battle of Long Island. , Floating the Apple was located at Pier 84 in Hudson River Park. Other spinoff groups, such as the Village Community Boathouse, are now located at Pier 40, the East River Crew on East 96th Street, Rocking the Boat in the South Bronx, in Weehawken, New Jersey and at five other locations north of New York City. Davis was a resident of Manhattan and died at age 68 on November 3, 2008. The cause of death was not immediately determined.Hevesi, Dennis. \\"Mike Davis, 68, Builder of Boats and Dreams, Dies\\", The New York Times, November 8, 2008.

It is now a major invasive plant species with millions of dollars spent on its control. ==Introduction to New Zealand== Introduced from Western Europe in the very early stages of European settlement, it was recorded by Charles Darwin during his voyage through New Zealand waters in 1835 as growing in hedges in the Bay of Islands. Its spread and development as a weed in New Zealand's temperate climate was rapid, but settlers failed to recognise the threat; gorse seed continued to be imported and plantings deliberately established into the 1900s. ==Uses== Gorse has been used for hedges and windbreaks on the Canterbury Plains since the 1850s. These windbreaks have a combined length of 300,000 kilometres. A patch of gorse surrounded by regenerating native bush at Hinewai Reserve on Banks Peninsula. Gorse has been found to form a useful nursery for many species for native bush regeneration. When young, gorse bushes are very dense. As they grow older, they become 'leggy', and provide the ideal conditions for native seeds to germinate and grow. The native seedlings grow up through the gorse, cutting out its light and eventually replacing it. This technique is working successfully and within a short time frame at Hinewai Reserve on Banks Peninsula. ==Problems== Example of gorse being one of the fastest plants to colonise disturbed areas of forest, Wellington, NZ The introduction resulted in large spreading infestations over hundreds of hectares, peaking in the late 1940s. It was recognised as a threat as early as 1861 where the Provincial Council in Nelson passing an act to prevent the planting of gorse hedges. The seed can lie dormant on the ground for up to 50 years, germinating quickly after the adults have been removed. Unfortunately, most methods of removing adult gorse plants, such as burning or bulldozing them, create the ideal conditions for the gorse seeds to germinate and total eradication with current technology seems impossible. Gorse is now one of the most widely recognised agricultural weeds in New Zealand. It covers at varying densities — a total of 5% of the land area of New Zealand when excluding existing indigenous forest, vegetated sub-alpine and alpine areas.. Gorse became New Zealand's most costly weed to control, an estimated $22 million per annum by the early 1980s . ==Biological control== Current research areas are: active management of control agents, development of a bioherbicide, and the use of modelling. Biological pest control of gorse has been investigated since the 1920s. Seven different agents have been released in New Zealand. Results have been mixed, but in general neither the seed-feeding nor foliage-feeding insects are doing enough damage to be viable as a stand-alone control agent. ==See also== *Agriculture in New Zealand *Conservation in New Zealand *Pesticides in New Zealand ==References *Ulex europaeus at the Royal New Zealand Institute of Horticulture Category:Agriculture in New Zealand Category:Invasive plant species in New Zealand * ","title":"Gorse in New Zealand"},{"id":"20143893","text":"Bacton railway station was a station in Bacton, Herefordshire, England.

Neild's family arrived in Australia in 1860, and he worked as an insurance agent and company manager before winning election to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1885. He served intermittently until 1901 and had a tumultuous career as a backbencher, eventually contributing significantly to the fall of the Reid government in 1899. He also established his own volunteer regiment, which had a difficult and sometimes hostile relationship with military command. Elected in 1901 to the Senate, Neild was a vigorous supporter of old-age pensions, free trade and several other causes, but his ambitions of promotion were never realised. Passionately loyal to the British Empire, he questioned aspects of the White Australia policy and spoke in support of the children of Kanaka labourers facing deportation. His continued disputes with the military, including an attempt to have the commander of the Australian military forces found in contempt of Parliament, saw him lose respect among his colleagues and his later career was spent in comparative isolation. He lost his seat in 1910 and died the following year. ==Early life== Neild was born in Bristol on 4 January 1846 to Maria Greenwood and John Cash Neild, a surgeon. He was named after his father. In 1853 the family moved to Taranaki in New Zealand, evacuating to Sydney in 1860 to escape the First Taranaki War. On 29 October 1868 Neild married Clara Matilda Gertrude Agnew, whose father Philip founded the New South Wales Free Church of England. Clara died in 1879, three years after the death of the only child of the marriage; Neild remarried on 19 February 1880 at St Paul's Anglican Church in Redfern, to Georgine Marie Louise Uhr, daughter of a former New South Wales sheriff. Neild had received a private education and was first employed at Montefiore, Joseph & Co., an importing firm. In 1865 he set up as a commission agent, becoming an insurance agent by 1870 and later managing several companies. He was elected to Woollahra Municipal Council in 1876 and in 1882 unsuccessfully stood for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly seat of Paddington. He was successful at his second attempt in 1885, when he was elected as a supporter of Henry Parkes; remaining on Woollahra Council, he served as mayor from 1888 to 1889, leaving the council in 1890. ==Colonial politics and military career== Neild devoted his first speech to criticism of the Protectionist Dibbs government, and became known for pursuing causes such as free trade, old-age pensions and law reform. He earned the nickname \\"Jawbone\\" on 23 June 1886, after speaking for nine hours against the Jennings government's introduction of ad valorem duties. He was narrowly passed over by Parkes for a ministry in January 1887, but was given charge of Sir Alfred Stephen's divorce extension bill, which passed in 1892. Neild continued to be active in religious affairs, serving from 1891 to 1893 as Right Worshipful Grand Master of the Loyal Orange Institution of New South Wales, although he offended many extreme Protestants by praying for the recovery of the Pope. Neild began to encounter difficulties in his political career towards the end of the 1880s; his oversight of the establishment of the 1887 Adelaide Jubilee International Exhibition led to investigation by a Legislative Assembly select committee, which absolved him of accusations of extravagance and using his office for personal gain. In 1895 he began to agitate for old-age pensions, but in 1899 he was investigated again after Premier George Reid paid him £350 for writing a report; although Neild repaid the money, the incident was part of the pretext for a successful no confidence motion in September which brought down the Reid government. In 1896, in response to the establishment of an Irish-Australian unit in the New South Wales citizen army, Neild raised a volunteer regiment that became St George's English Rifles. He was promoted major of the regiment in July 1896 and lieutenant-colonel in April 1898, and frequently led his men, dressed as British soldiers, around Circular Quay to the tune of \\"The British Grenadiers\\" or \\"The English Gentleman\\". Despite his promotions, Neild had no previous military experience, and in 1899 Lord Beauchamp, the Governor, wrote that his organisation was \\"in a state of ridiculous insubordination\\". He was suspended around Easter of that year for publicly criticising a staff officer and encouraging insubordination; following unfavourable findings by a military inquiry, Neild avoided dismissal only by investing considerable amounts of money into the regiment. ==Senate== Neild contested the first federal election in 1901, running as a Free Trade candidate for the Senate. Together with Senator Cyril Cameron, he was one of two parliamentarians to wear full dress uniform to the opening of Parliament. He introduced the Parliamentary Evidence Bill on 9 August 1901, which aimed \\"to enable and regulate the taking of evidence by Parliament and Parliamentary Committees\\". The bill was withdrawn and reintroduced several times over the next decade but never passed into law. Harbouring ambitions of becoming deputy President, Neild was active in many committees but failed to achieve his aim, although he did serve as Temporary Chairman of Committees from 1903 to 1910. Neild was not a supporter of party discipline, refusing to follow Sir Josiah Symon's leadership of the Free Trade Senators. He spoke against the dictation test for non-British immigrants and the deportation of Kanaka workers, and continued to advocate free trade and old-age pensions. Having won the fifth position at the 1901 election, Neild faced re-election in 1903, and his impassioned support of the British Empire saw him elected at the head of the poll despite failing health. In March 1904 Neild attacked the government's military policy and the commander of the military forces, Major-General Sir Edward Hutton, who had long wished to dismiss Neild from the citizen army. Neild had incited a near mutiny by destroying a well-known sergeant's military career, and was suspended from duty; Neild responded by accusing Hutton of intimidation and infringing a Senator's right of freedom of expression. In April 1904 the Senate formed a committee to investigate alleged contempt of Parliament by Hutton, which found that Neild had not been intimidated. In 1905 Neild retired from the militia. Neild's adventures had seen him lose respect in his political career, and he was now openly mocked in the Senate chamber, becoming something of a joke. He introduced a number of bills in his remaining five years in the Senate, all of which lapsed. He spoke in support of Muslim camel drivers and opposed military training for boys, and continued to oppose elements of the White Australia policy, raising concerns about Australian-born children of Kanaka labourers: \\"They will have difficulties enough in front of them in a country that is so rampantly strong on the white Australia policy without our making their case worse.\\" Neild was defeated at the 1910 election. Suffering from hepatic cirrhosis, Neild died at his home in Woollahra on 8 March 1911, aged 65, survived by his second wife and their two children. He received a military funeral before being buried with Anglican rites at Waverley Cemetery in Sydney. ==Other interests== Neild published an anthology of his own poetry, Songs 'neath the Southern Cross, in 1896. ==References== Category:Free Trade Party members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Commonwealth Liberal Party members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Australian Senate for New South Wales Category:Members of the Australian Senate Category:Members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly Category:Australian Anglicans Category:Deaths from cirrhosis Category:1846 births Category:1911 deaths Category:20th-century Australian politicians Category:English emigrants to Australia Category:Australian military officers ","title":"John Neild"},{"id":"20143919","text":"The Mittelfranken Cup (German: Mittelfränkischer Pokal) was a domestic cup competition for the Bavarian Bezirk of Middle Franconia (German: Mittelfranken), played until 2009. ==Modus== All senior men's teams from the Middle Franconia region were eligible to compete in the cup, except fully professional sides, meaning clubs in the Bundesliga and 2.

There he became a vigorous campaigner for free trade, and was a co-founder of the Free Trade and Liberal Association in that colony, the body that would later become the machine behind the Free Trade Party. Although his attempts to enter the New South Wales Legislative Assembly were abortive, he was appointed to the Legislative Council in 1895 and served until 1901, when he was elected to the Senate. An uncompromising opponent of all forms of protectionism, following the 1909 Fusion of the anti-Labour forces he joined the Liberal Party only with reluctance. Pulsford is also remembered for his avid opposition to the White Australia policy and other forms of racial discrimination. Whilst financial editor of the Daily Telegraph he attacked restrictive immigration laws, and he fought against the policy in the state parliament and later in the Senate, where he was one of the few to oppose the 1901 Immigration Restriction Act. This racial tolerance, combined with his opposition to women's suffrage, has led the economist John Hawkins to describe him as \\"probably the least racist but perhaps the most sexist member of the Australian Senate in its first decade\\". ==Early life== Edward Pulsford was born at Burslem in Staffordshire on 29 September 1844. His mother was Mary Ann, née Cutler, and his father, James Eustace Pulsford, was a Baptist minister and businessman. He received a private education and worked with his father as a commission agent; together they worked in Hull, Yorkshire, from 1870 to 1884. On 23 February 1870, he married Mary Charlotte Stainforth at Hull; she would predecease him. In 1883 Edward embarked for New South Wales, while his father travelled to New York to become resident secretary of the Liverpool, London & Globe Insurance Company. After his arrival in Sydney, Pulsford immediately became involved in the free trade cause, and in 1885 he co-founded the Free Trade and Liberal Association of New South Wales (FTLA, a forerunner of the Free Trade Party) with Bernhard Wise. His campaigning on behalf of free trade led to his becoming an honorary member of the Cobden Club. ==Colonial politics== From its foundation until 1891, Pulsford was secretary of the FTLA, and became an organiser and ferocious pamphleteer. He received a prize for an essay on \\"The Beneficial Influence of a Free Trade Policy upon the Colony of New South Wales\\", written as a contribution to the 1887 centennial edition of the Year-Book of Australia. He became actively involved in journalism as proprietor of the Armidale Chronicle and financial editor of the Daily Telegraph from 1890 to 1898. While focusing overwhelmingly on free trade, actively denigrating the neighbouring colony of Victoria's protectionist policies, he also worked on the compilation of an Australian biographical supplement to Webster's International Dictionary and supported Federation. Pulsford was a leading proponent of the free-trade cause, although an intended candidacy for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1891 did not eventuate. He had contested a by-election for East Sydney earlier that year, losing to protectionist candidate Walter Bradley. He was nevertheless nominated to the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1895 by the Free Trade Premier, George Reid. He continued his support of free trade policies, but differentiated himself from his colleagues by firmly opposing restrictions on Asian immigration. He had expressed regret concerning the fate of the Australian Aborigines in a Telegraph article in 1888 and also opposed Sir Henry Parkes's poll tax on the Chinese, and now opposed the continuing restrictive measures passed in 1896 and 1898. He served as president of the Australian Free Trade and Liberal Association's New South Wales branch in 1900 and was deputy president of the federal election campaign committee, standing himself for the Senate in New South Wales. ==Federal politics== Pulsford as a senator At the first federal election in March 1901, Pulsford was elected as a senator for New South Wales in the sixth and final position, narrowly defeating fellow Free Trader John Gray. He continued his fervent support of free trade and was one of the few senators to oppose the White Australia policy, describing \\"the whole of the inhabitants of Asia as [his] friends\\". He opposed the 1901 Immigration Restriction Act, supported Asians' eligibility for the old-age pension, and decried the treatment of Kanaka labourers as \\"cattle\\". In his opposition to immigration restriction he highlighted the diplomatic insult to Japan and other Asian nations, and published a pamphlet in 1905 supporting the protestations of the Japanese government against the policy. Pulsford spoke for five hours in the debate on the 1902 Customs Tariff Bill, although he later supported time limits for speeches. Missing out on a frontbench portfolio when the Free Traders were briefly in government from 1904 to 1905, he was absent from parliament for most of 1907. Described by the Tribune as \\"the best living authority on Australia's tariff question\\", his pamphlet to the Cobden Club in 1907 attracted a favourable reception. He opposed women's suffrage on the grounds that it would put Australia \\"in advance of public opinion throughout the world\\", believing it would lead to the \\"vulgarisation of women\\". The Fusion in 1909 between the Free Trade and Protectionist parties to form the Liberal Party was difficult for Pulsford, who had \\"no faith in either the old Protection or the new Protection\\", and although he did join the new party, his support of any protectionist legislation would be \\"in order to show that all such legislation must be a failure\\". He was defeated at the 1910 election when the Labour Party won all the Senate seats in New South Wales. ==Later life== Pulsford continued his support for the free-trade cause outside Parliament, and in May 1914 planned to establish a free-trade paper to be circulated around Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, a scheme that was abandoned following the outbreak of World War I. He revised his book Commerce and the Empire (originally published in 1903) in 1917, arguing that free trade was central to the freedoms the Empire was fighting for, and calling for free trade with Germany after the war. On 2 March 1919 he married Blanche Elspeth Brown at Neutral Bay, but he died later that year on his seventy-fifth birthday, 29 September 1919. Survived by his second wife and the three sons of his first marriage, Pulsford was buried at Gore Hill cemetery after an Anglican service. ==References== Category:Free Trade Party members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Commonwealth Liberal Party members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Australian Senate for New South Wales Category:Members of the Australian Senate Category:Members of the New South Wales Legislative Council Category:1844 births Category:1919 deaths Category:English emigrants to Australia Category:20th-century Australian politicians Category:Burials at Gore Hill Cemetery ","title":"Edward Pulsford"},{"id":"20143978","text":"\\"There's No One as Irish as Barack O'Bama\\" is a humorous folk song written in 2008 by the Irish band Hardy Drew and the Nancy Boys (later known as The Corrigan Brothers), and set to a tune derived from a traditional air. The song celebrates the Irish ancestry of the former President of the United States, Barack Obama. The song was a minor hit in the Irish Charts, peaking at Number 24 in November 2008. ==Production and themes== Main Street, Moneygall where in Ollie Hayes' pub the song was first performed. Obama's roots have been traced back to Moneygall in County Offaly, Ireland in the 19th century. Moneygall has a population of 298 people.CSO Ireland, Census 2006 - Volume 1 Population Classified by Area (Page 32) Obama had previously remarked, \\"There's a little village in Ireland where my great-great-great grandfather came from and I'm looking forward to going there and having a pint,\\" prompting the Irish Taoiseach Brian Cowen - also a native of County Offaly - to invite him to do so. The village of Moneygall (population 298) from which one of Obama's great- great-great grandfathers came Hardy Drew and the Nancy Boys consists of brothers Ger, Brian and Donnacha Corrigan from Castletroy, County Limerick. The song was performed by the band's lead singer Ger Corrigan, with Aedhmar Flaherty, Róisín O'Brien and Aodhán Ryan, in Ollie Hayes's pub in Moneygall. It was originally written by the established group in February 2008, and the group have since appeared on several Irish television and radio shows. It has since been featured on MSNBC show Hardball with Chris Matthews. The song, which received huge publicity in America and was described as a \\"web hit\\" by the BBC, became popular after being released on YouTube, and as of 6 November 2008 it had over 50,000 hits, (80,000 by 10 November, 300,000 by 15 November, whilst Black's version had 700,000) and the band reported that they had been invited to perform in the anticipated victory celebrations for Obama, and at the Irish-American Democrats inauguration party in Washington in January 2009. ==Conflicts== Ger Corrigan alleged that Shay Black, brother of Irish musician Mary Black, \\"hijacked\\" the song and claimed a co-writing credit while failing to acknowledge Hardy Drew and the Nancy Boys' authorship of the original version, a charge Black denied. Both sides sought legal advice; the band contacted YouTube's solicitors as well as a copyright solicitor before announcing in a press release that the dispute had been resolved. Journalist Fintan O'Toole criticized the song in The Irish Times for \\"its ignorance of cultural history\\", claiming that it was inappropriate given Irish Americans' history of racism against African Americans, and that emphasizing Obama's Irish heritage would be \\"muscling in on his parade\\". Canon Stephen Neill, the rector of Moneygall who accompanied the band on their American trip, responded that it was only a pop song, and that African Americans had universally welcomed them. Ger Corrigan later reported that the Corrigan Brothers had signed a deal with Universal for two singles and one album, with an option on a second album. ==Welcome Home President Barack O'Bama== In March 2011, the Corrigan Brothers released a new version of their song for radio play to celebrate Barack Obama's visit to Ireland the following May. Entitled Welcome Home President Barack O'Bama, the song focused on Obama's visit to his ancestral home in Moneygall. ==References *Corrigan Brothers website **Song lyrics on the website *HardyDrew's YouTube listing (official) *Shay Black version YouTube listing (official) *CorriganBrothers verstion YouTube listing (official) *Interview with Ger Corrigan by Ryan Tubridy; RTÉ Radio One on 30 September 2008.

Two years later Roger's wife Linnie ascended the tower via the ladder, one of a total of about 215 who have used the ladder. The last use was by Babe \\"The Human Fly\\" White in 1927. The present tower ladder consists of a series of wooden stakes connected on the outside by vertical wood planks. One end of each stake is driven sideways into a rock crevice, vertically ascending the southeast side of the tower. Attached with nails and/or bailing wire to the other end of the stakes are 12-inch lengths of 1 x 4 - inch lumber. The ladder ascends from about 100 feet above the ground to the summit, and is about 170 feet long. Because of its small scale in comparison to the tower, it is very difficult to see in modern photographs, and visitors to the tower usually must view it through a telescope. The lowest 100 feet were removed in the 1930s as a safety measure. The remaining ladder was restored in 1972. ==See also== *Entrance Road-Devils Tower National Monument *Entrance Station-Devils Tower National Monument *Old Headquarters Area Historic District ==References *National Park Service Devils Tower First Fifty Years - Stake Ladder * at the National Park Service's NRHP database *Devils Tower Ladder at the Wyoming State Historic Preservation Office Category:National Register of Historic Places in Devils Tower National Monument Category:National Register of Historic Places in Wyoming Category:Buildings and structures in Crook County, Wyoming Category:Ladders Category:Stairways in the United States Category:Stairways on the National Register of Historic Places Category:Transportation buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Wyoming Category:1893 establishments in Wyoming ","title":"Tower Ladder (Devils Tower National Monument)"},{"id":"20144001","text":"King George and Jaffa Street pedestrian scramble, 2007 King George Street 1945 Froumine House, early 1950s King George Street (, Rehov ha-Melekh Jorj, Shara'a al-Malik Jurj) is a street in central Jerusalem which joins Ben Yehuda Street and Jaffa Road to form the Downtown Triangle central business district.Neighborhoods in brief The street was named in honour of King George V on December 9, 1924.About King George Street ==History== King George Street was dedicated in honour of the seventh anniversary of the British conquest of Jerusalem under General Allenby.

He and three former high school teammates left the school shortly after their freshman season; deciding to sit out a year instead of continuing to play for the \\"tyrannical\\" John Cherberg in Seattle. He attended Santa Monica College, then transferred to the University of Utah in Salt Lake City in 1957, leading a passing offense under head coach Jack Curtice that was advanced for its time. Monday Night Football broadcaster Al Michaels credits Grosscup for developing the shovel pass or \\"Utah pass,\\" although Grosscup acknowledges that the play was used decades earlier in the 1920s. Grosscup finished his junior season in 1957 completing 94 of 137 passes (68.6%) for 1,398 yards and 10 touchdowns. He was named a first-team All-American by Look, the Newspaper Enterprise Association, the Williamson National Football Rating, and Today and finished tenth in the balloting for the Heisman Trophy, won by John David Crow of Texas A&M.;http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/utah/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/09-footbl- mg-184-189.pdf A shoulder injury hampered his senior season under first-year head coach Ray Nagel in 1958, but Grosscup was selected to play in the Senior Bowl in early 1959. ==Professional career== Selected by the New York Giants with the tenth overall pick in the 1959 NFL Draft, Grosscup appeared in eight games in his three seasons with the Giants. The Giants were the Eastern champions in 1959 and 1961, but fell in both title games on the road. In August 1962, his contract was purchased by the second-year Minnesota Vikings, but he was cut before the beginning of the season. This allowed Grosscup to return to New York in September, this time with the New York Titans of the American Football League, in its third season. He began the season as the starter, but missed six weeks with a knee injury. Grosscup was cut on the final day of the 1963 preseason and signed with the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League three days later. That same year, Grosscup released his first book, entitled Fourth and One. After failing to make the San Francisco 49ers, Grossup spent the 1964 season on the Oakland Raiders' taxi squad. He was cut by the Raiders the following season and signed with the Hartford Charter Oaks of the newly formed Continental Football League. ==Broadcasting career== After the 1966 season, Grosscup began a career in broadcasting. He spent one season calling AFL games for NBC before beginning a twenty-year stint as a college football analyst for ABC, working alongside notable voices such as Bill Flemming, Chris Schenkel, Keith Jackson, Verne Lundquist and Al Michaels. Grosscup was also a broadcaster in the USFL, first as a radio analyst for the Oakland Invaders, then as a television analyst on ABC from 1984–1985. Grosscup was the radio analyst for the Sacramento Gold Miners of the CFL during the and seasons. Grosscup was a voter in the Harris Interactive College Football Poll. ===California Golden Bears=== Grosscup was a member of the California Golden Bears broadcast team for 32 years, including 17 years as a color analyst and 15 years as part of the team's postgame coverage. From 1986 to 2003, Grosscup was the radio analyst for broadcasts alongside Joe Starkey. Former Cal quarterback Mike Pawlawski took over as radio analyst in 2004 despite Grosscup's willingness to continue until 2007.

They often worked for Mr. Carver (Savalas), protecting him from enemies he made during his career as a criminal lawyer.Terrace, Vincent (2009). Encyclopedia of Television Shows, 1925 through 2007 (Volume 1). Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland & Company, Inc. . ==Background== Taeger and Coburn were starring in Klondike, another Ziv Television/NBC series, when it was cancelled after 17 episodes. In order to fulfill Ziv's contract with the network, they were recast in Acapulco, which premiered two weeks later in the same time slot as Klondike (Mondays at 9:00 PM). The new show lasted for only eight episodes. ==Cast and characters== *Ralph Taeger as Patrick Malone *James Coburn as Gregg Miles *Telly Savalas as Mr. Carver *Bobby Troup as Himself *Allison Hayes as Chloe *Jason Robards, Sr. as Max ==Episodes== {  - !

Guitar Fest) is a music festival held in Zaječar, Serbia. Held since 1966, Gitarijada is one of the longest lasting festivals in Serbia and in South Eastern Europe and the largest festival of young and unaffirmed bands in South Eastern Europe. Apart from the competition of unaffirmed bands from the region of former Yugoslavia, the festival program includes performances of established acts. ==History== Gitarijada was founded in 1966 by Zlatni Prsti guitarist and vocalist Momčilo Radenković. First Gitarijada was held in Dom JNA in Zaječar. During the following years, Kosta Kostadinović \\"Čauš\\" became the festival's main organizer.

It was intended to be both a film honouring Johnson, who had died in 1941 during a ferry flight of an Airspeed Oxford, and a propaganda call to arms at the height of the war years. ==Cast== * Anna Neagle as Amy Johnson * Robert Newton as Jim Mollison * Edward Chapman as Mr. Johnson * Nora Swinburne as ATA Commandant * Joan Kemp-Welch as Mrs. Johnson * Brefni O'Rorke as Mac * Charles Carson as Lord Wakefield * Martita Hunt as Miss Bland * Anthony Shaw as Official * Eliot Makeham as Mayor of Croydon * David Horne as Solicitor * Miles Malleson as Vacuum Salesman * Aubrey Mallalieu as Bill, the Barber * Charles Victor as Postmaster * Hay Petrie as Old General * John Slater as Officer on Interview Panel * Percy Parsons as Man * Cyril Smith as Radio Operator On Aquitania * George Merritt as Reporter * Muriel George as Kitty, the Housekeeper * Ian Fleming as Secretary * William Hartnell as Scotty (as Billy Hartnell) * Arthur Hambling as Policeman * Peter Gawthorne as RAF Officer * Ronald Shiner as mechanic at Stag Lane ==References* * 10K bullets: DVD review of They Flew Alone Retrieved 2013-01-06 Category:1942 films Category:British aviation films Category:1940s war films Category:British black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Herbert Wilcox Category:British World War II propaganda films Category:British war drama films Category:British biographical drama films Category:British films Category:Films scored by William Alwyn Category:RKO Pictures films Category:Cultural depictions of Amy Johnson Category:1940s biographical drama films Category:Films set in London Category:Films set in Australia Category:1942 drama films ","title":"They Flew Alone"},{"id":"20144138","text":"Allan McDougall (2 August 1857 – 14 October 1924) was an Australian politician. He was an Australian Labor Party member of the Australian Senate from 1910 to 1919 and from 1922 until his death in 1924. McDougall was born in Pyrmont, Sydney and received a primary education before undertaking a boilermaker apprenticeship with the Australasian Steam Navigation Company, later working at Mort's Dock. He was one of the first members of the United Society of Boilermakers and Iron Shipbuilders of New South Wales and was heavily involved in the union for many years, serving alternately as president and secretary at various times. He also served as secretary of the Eight Hours Day committee for ten years. A keen sportsman and footballer, he was also patron of the New South Wales League of Wheelmen (a cycling club) and the Glebe District Rugby League Football Club. In 1910, he was elected to the Australian Senate as a member of the Labor Party. He was chairman of the Select Committee on Fitzroy Dock and a member of the Joint Committee on Public Accounts. In 1917, he was tried and acquitted for an alleged breach of the War Precautions Act after a speech regarding voting in the conscription referendum. He was defeated in 1919, but was re-elected in 1922. In 1923, he was a member of the Royal Commission on National Insurance. However, he died in office in 1924 from complications of diabetes; he had reportedly been in poor health for some time.

The pair now have one daughter and one son together. Kelly previously worked for East Coast FM and then for the state broadcaster's pop music station RTÉ 2fm. Reared in South Dublin county, Kelly's father Michael was a lawyer and a major influence on her career. Jenny would attend horse races with him, and was seen at the Galway Races in 2003 whilst running in the 2.30 race. She attended St Joseph of Cluny's primary school and Newtown School in Waterford for her secondary education before spending time delved in theatre studies at Trinity College, Dublin. Before obtaining a position in RTÉ, Kelly volunteered for a place at Dublin South Community Radio and received in return a weekly half-hour arts programme to present. She began working with state broadcaster RTÉ in 1994, working on 2FM where her first national broadcast took place from on top of the world's biggest, fastest roller coaster. In 1997, she joined East Coast Radio, where she co-presented The Breakfast Show and produced the mid-morning show. Early in 2000, she transferred to Today FM to work in music programming with Phil Cawley and Tim Kelly. In September 2000, D'Arcy joined the station and The Ray D'Arcy Show began. When Kelly's father, Michael, died in his sleep on 8 April 2011, she learned of the death from Today FM chief executive Willie O'Reilly while on air. The Ray D'Arcy Show was abruptly taken off the air, prompting thousands of texts and calls from worried listeners. Living in Dublin, the pair have two children: daughter Kate was born 25 November 2006, shortly after 20:00, at Mount Carmel Hospital and weighing just above seven pounds. She went into labour after laughing when watching Pat Kenny get heckled on live television on The Late Late Show. The pair were stalked by the tabloid press when D'Arcy publicly exposed their partnership on Saturday Night With Miriam in 2005. They attended the wedding of Tommy Tiernan as a couple. In January 2012, they announced their engagement and that they were pregnant with a second child. In June 2012, D'Arcy and Kelly had their second baby, a son called Tom Michael D'Arcy. ==References * Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of Trinity College Dublin Category:Irish radio producers Category:East Coast FM presenters Category:People from South Dublin (county) Category:RTÉ 2fm presenters Category:The Ray D'Arcy Show ","title":"Jenny Kelly"},{"id":"20144199","text":"You and I is the second studio album by R&B; singer O'Bryan. ==Reception== The album was named after O'Bryan's cover of the Stevie Wonder ballad.

They were promoted by the Ministry of Food during the Second World War since they require fewer eggs and less sugar than ordinary cakes, an important savings in a time of strict rationing. Traditional recipes bulked them with oatmeal, which was more readily available than white flour. ==Recipe== Mrs Beeton's widely known 1861 recipe book includes two early recipes for rock cakes. One calls for flour, butter, 'moist sugar', lemon, milk, and baking powder. The other recipe more closely resembles shortbread, as it uses flour, butter, and currants but no leavening agent. A typical modern recipe for 12 cakes requires about 200 g of flour, 100 g of butter or margarine, 50 g of sugar, 1 beaten egg, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, 2 tablespoons of milk, 150 g of dried fruit such as currants, raisins, candied orange peel, etc., and a pinch of nutmeg and mixed spices. Usually, flour and butter are first mixed until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs; then the other ingredients are added to create a stiff dough, which is dropped from a spoon to a baking tray or roughly formed with two forks. The cakes (optionally sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon) are baked for about 15 minutes at 200-220°C, retaining an uneven form and contour. Variations include the Jamaican rock cake, which is similar, but usually includes grated coconut, and the traditional British rock cake, which contains oatmeal. ==In popular culture== Author Agatha Christie mentions rock cakes in her stories and novels, including Three Blind Mice and The Murder at the Vicarage. Detective Alan Grant is offered rock buns in Josephine Tey's novel The Daughter of Time. They are also a common feature in the popular Harry Potter series of books and films; for example, Hagrid serves rock cakes to Harry and Ron at tea in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Early in The African Queen, Mr. Allnut (Humphrey Bogart) is offered a rock cake while at tea. Rock cakes are also referred to in an early scene in the 1939 movie, Goodbye Mr. Chips. They are mentioned as an alternative to doughnuts in the 1940 British film Night Train to Munich. In the Benny Hill song \\"Ernie (The Fastest Milkman in the West)\\", Ernie is killed by a rock cake below the heart and a pork pie to the face. In the British soap opera EastEnders, rock cakes are stocked in the local cafe. Tamwar Masood frequently eats them as an alternative to pastries. In the British series 'Allo 'Allo, season 7, episode 10, rock cakes are used to feed the British Airmen that are trapped in the sewers under the village. René Artois (Gorden Kaye) and his wife also give rock cakes to the gypsies to get information from them. In the P. G. Wodehouse novel Sam the Sudden, (1925), Willoughby Braddock warns Kay Derrick against eating rock cakes baked by Clara Lippet, the cook as they are her worst effort. In Wodehouse’s novel Money in the Bank, (1942), character J G Miller tosses unwanted rock cakes into the office across the way; when he goes to that office to apologize, he encounters Anne Benedick and her uncle Lord Uffenham, beginning the plot. ==See also== *Scone *Fat rascal ==References * Cooking for Girls; a rock cake recipe written for children.

Since the event's inception in 2005, it has been sanctioned by the world's dominant women's professional golf tour, the LPGA Tour in the U.S., although it is an unofficial event in which no earnings by the competitors affect their positions on the LPGA money list. The competition took place on the Bukit Course at The Singapore Island Country Club in Singapore from 28–30 November 2008. Lexus was the title sponsor; Rolex, DBS, Singapore Airlines, Callaway Golf, and Singapore Sports Council were main sponsors. This was the last official LPGA appearance for Team International captain Annika Sörenstam, who had previously announced her retirement at the end of the 2008 season. ==Teams== As in the similar team events of the Solheim Cup (USA vs. Europe women), Ryder Cup (USA vs. Europe men), and Presidents Cup, each team is made up of twelve players. Four players for Team Asia and four for Team International earn sports through the Rolex Rankings. Four additional players for each team qualified through their position on the LPGA Official Money List, as of 2 November 2008. Once the top eight players for each team were confirmed, four additional players—two captain's picks and two sponsor's exemptions—were selected for each team.

After years of hardship, they were finally liberated in February 1945. ==In Manila== At the outset of World War II, US Army and US Navy nurses were stationed at Sternberg General Hospital in Manila, and other military hospitals around Manila. During the Battle of the Philippines (1941–42), eighty-eight US Army nurses escaped, in the last week of December 1941, to Corregidor and Bataan.E. Norman, We Band of Angels, pg. 24. Sternberg General Hospital, Manila, 1940. Two Army nurses, Lt. Floramund A. Fellmeth and Lt. Florence MacDonald, accompanied severely wounded patients from Sternberg aboard the improvised hospital ship Mactan that departed Manila shortly after midnight of the New Year of 1942 for Australia. The navy nurses, under the command of Lt. Laura M. Cobb, stayed behind in Manila during the initial invasion to support the patients there. One of them, Ann A. Bernatitus, escaped from Manila to Bataan just before Manila fell.E. Norman, We Band of Angels, pg. 25; E. Monahan and R. Neidel-Greenlee, All This Hell, p. 31.

US Government Poster Lt. Juanita Redmond, one of the few nurses to escape, published a memoir of her experiences on Bataan in 1943 that concluded with a dramatic reminder that her colleagues were still prisoners.Lt. J. Redmond, ANC, I Served on Bataan, pp. 166–167 (JB Lippincott Co. 1943) (dedicated to the staff of Bataan Hospital No. 1) The nurses' story was dramatized in several wartime movies,E.

(Paramount 1943) (based on the Redmond book) *They Were Expendable (MGM 1945) When So Proudly We Hail was shown in the theaters, a recruitment booth staffed with Red Cross volunteers was set up in the lobby.Kathi Jackson, They Called Them Angels, pg. 3 (2000)() ===Final year of Internment=== In January 1944, control of the Santo Tomas Internment Camp changed from Japanese civil authorities to the Imperial Japanese Army, with whom it remained until the camp was liberated.E. Norman, We Band of Angels, p. 183; E. Monahan and R. Neidel-Greenlee, All This Hell, p. 125.

Norman, We Band of Angels, pp. 194, 199. A Department of Veterans Affairs study released in April, 2002 found that the nurses lost, on average, 30% of their body weight during internment, and subsequently experienced a degree of service-connected disability \\"virtually the same as the male ex-POW's of the Pacific Theater.\\"W.

It reads: > TO THE ANGELS-- In honor of the valiant American military women who gave so > much of themselves in the early days of World War II. They provided care and > comfort to the gallant defenders of Bataan and Corregidor. They lived on a > starvation diet, shared the bombing, strafing, sniping, sickness and disease > while working endless hours of heartbreaking duty. These nurses always had a > smile, a tender touch and a kind word for their patients. They truly earned > the name--THE ANGELS OF BATAAN AND CORREGIDOR.\\"The plaque can be read near > the end of the documentary \\"Angels of Bataan\\" (2008)(produced and directed > by Rainer Loeser) Maj. Maude C. Davison, credited by many for keeping the army nurses alive by her insistence on the nurses maintaining their identity as nurses throughout their internment, was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Medal on August 20, 2001.Lyn Kukral, WWII Nurse POW Gets Posthumous Award (Army News Service, Arlington, Va.

This was the first game announced as part of the DJMax METRO PROJECT. An international version of the game was released in North America by PM Studios. A sequel to the game, DJMax Technika 2, was announced on March 4, 2010. DJMax Technika Tune is an adaptation of the game for the PlayStation Vita. DJMax Technika Q for the iOS and Android platforms was announced on September 2013, and the global version was released on March 25, 2014.2013-09-10, DJMAX TECHNIKA Q, 출시 전 티저 영상 공개, Ruliweb On December 9, 2013, it was announced that the online service for DJMax Technika 2 and DJMax Technika 3 would be closed on December 31, 2013. ==Cabinet== The arcade cabinet consists of two screens, a bottom 22-inch touch screen where the game is played, and an upper 32-inch screen for spectators to view, both in Hi-Definition. There is a vibrating stage and game-based lights and speakers. There is an ID-Card Reader for people who have a Platinum Crew ID Card. The system is powered by Intel Celeron E1400, 2GB of RAM, Biostar P31 mainboard, 160GB Western Digital hard drive, Creative Audigy Sound card and ATI Radeon graphics, with Windows XP Embedded as the core operating system. The touch screen is infrared which allows multiple simultaneous input during gameplay. ==Gameplay== The game offers four gameplay types: * Lite Mixing - A tutorial and three songs can be played. The difficulty of songs is easier than latter modes, and unlike Popular Mixing mode, the result is not recorded on Platinum Crew. This mode only contains a song pattern called Lite Pattern, and not all songs are playable in this mode. * Popular Mixing - Normal gameplay mode where three songs can be played. Most of the songs that appear have the Popular Pattern note chart. * Technical Mixing - four songs can be played. The player can select three songs from a disk set. The last song to be played is determined by the play result of previous three stages. Some of the songs on Technical Mixing mode may not be available in Popular Mixing mode. This mode contains a note chart called Technical Pattern, where songs have faster scroll speeds or different, harder notes in comparison to their Popular Pattern counterparts. * Platinum Mixing - Only available to people who have a Platinum Crew ID Card, and the machine they're playing on has to be connected to the internet (something common in Korean arcades, but less than often seen in America, where arcades have lost popularity). This mode features a series of missions. Player may be rewarded by Max points and items. Some of the hidden songs, hidden patterns, and Technical Mixing Discs Sets can be unlocked only through missions (although, players only get to use them a certain number of times and after that, they have to complete the mission again to get more uses, and uses can be stockpiled onto each other). Events and online tournaments are also held in this mode. This mode contains a note chart exclusive to it called Special Pattern, though only a handful of songs have it. The Special Pattern is arranged in sets of 3 and every month, a new set of three songs get special patterns (e.g. February 2009 Special Patterns is Flea, Supersonic, then Oblivion) and completing them gets rewards. The player has 60 seconds to pick a song. If the timer hits zero, the song currently highlighted will be chosen. The player must touch the notes as the time line crosses them. If they fail to touch them after the time line passes them, it counts as a break, which means the combo is reset to zero and the player loses HP, which is also recovered when notes are hit. When the player's HP decreases to zero, the game ends. The game has 4 types of note charts: * Lite Pattern - Only used in Lite Mixing, easiest note chart in the game. * Popular Pattern - Used in Popular Mixing. Some popular patterns also used in Technical Mixing. (ex: Dear my lady, Creator, BlythE, Sweet shining shooting star) * Technical Pattern - Used in Technical Mixing, but the Technical Patterns can be unlocked to use in Popular Mixing through completing missions in Platinum Mixing. * Special Pattern - Appears in Platinum Mixing only. Only a handful of songs have this pattern. Every month a set of three songs with this pattern appears. When compared to the charts of the PSP DJMax games, Popular, Technical, and Special Patterns are the Technika equivalent of Normal Style, Hard Style, and MX Style note charts respectively, and Lite pattern is the Technika equivalent of Easy Style in the early DJMax Online game. Note Types: * Note - Simply touch the note once, when the time line matches the center of the note. * Dragging Long Note - Drag the circular note along the path while keeping it on the time line. * Repeat Note - Keep pressing the circular note each time the time line is on a little purple line that is part of this note. * Holding Long Note - Hold finger on the circular note until the time line passes the blue line at the end of the note. * Chain Note - Hit all notes in the path when time line passes over them.

Diagram of bacterially-induced corrosion. In a humid environment and anoxic conditions the corrosion of metals occurs as a result of a redox reaction that generates molecular hydrogen from hydrogen ions, requiring bacteria, unlike anaerobic corrosion that occurs spontaneously. A base metal, such as iron (Fe) goes into aqueous solution as positively charged cation, Fe2+. As the metal is oxidized under anaerobic condition by the protons of water, H+ ions are reduced to form molecular H2. This can be written in the following ways under acidic and neutral conditions respectively: :Fe + 2 H+ -> Fe2+ \\\\+ H2 :Fe + 2 H2O -> Fe(OH)2 \\\\+ H2 Usually, a thin film of molecular hydrogen forms on the metal. Sulfate-reducing bacteria, oxidize the molecular hydrogen to produce hydrogen sulfide ions (HS−) and water: :4 H2 \\\\+ SO42− -> HS− \\\\+ 3 H2O + OH− The iron ions partly precipitate to form iron (II) sulfide. A reaction with water also occurs, producing iron hydroxide. :Fe2+ \\\\+ HS− -> FeS + H+ :3 Fe2+ \\\\+ 6 H2O -> 3 Fe(OH)2 \\\\+ 6 H+ The net equation comes to: :4 Fe + SO42− \\\\+ H+ \\\\+ 3 H2O -> FeS + 3 Fe(OH)2 \\\\+ OH− This form of corrosion by sulfate- reducing bacteria can, in this way, be far more harmful than anaerobic corrosion. ==See also== *Corrosion *Microbial corrosion ==References== * Georg Fuchs (Hrsg.): Allgemeine Mikrobiologie, 8.

Some were dissolved during the Reformation in the mid-16th century, but a number survived as Catholic institutions until the secularisation of the Napoleonic period, while others became Lutheran and continued either as schools or as establishments for the unmarried daughters and widows of the aristocracy (Damenstifte). The Communist period after World War II saw little activity in terms of religious houses, for obvious reasons: a conspicuous exception was the re-foundation of Huysburg Priory in 1972.

Spence briefly toured with the band, and during his tenure recorded one album's worth of material, which – due to Galley's departure to replace Bernie Marsden in Whitesnake – remains unreleased. Several of the songs from these sessions however (Demos exist in bootleg form), would form a very small part of Tom Galley's Phenomena project, which Spence would later join to sing and play bass on the 1992 album \\"Innervision\\" (billed as \\"O'Ryan\\") Spence later went on to buy the rights to the project, cashing in (and dining out) with a 'best of' compilation which featured a very small percentage of his work tagged onto the work of the real members of the project. ===Wishbone Ash=== Following the break-up of Trapeze, Spence was offered an audition for Wishbone Ash while he was pitching demo material to various outlets. On the strength of his vocal range and enthusiasm, Spence became a member of the band. Spence would perform on one album by the band, 1985's Raw to the Bone. ===Post-Wishbone Ash=== Spence left Wishbone Ash in 1986 \\"to pursue family matters\\". He has since released two solo albums under the name \\"O'Ryan\\" (his mother's maiden name), 1993's Something Strong and 1995's Initiate.

He was an Australian Labor Party member of the Australian Senate from 1914 to 1917, representing the state of New South Wales. Watson was born in Rutherglen in Scotland, and migrated to Australia at 15, settling in the Newcastle suburb of Lambton. He was a miner there for sixteen years, spent some years with the Australian Baptist Home Mission in the Dungog area, then returned to mining at Newcastle. Watson was working in the Pelaw-Main Colliery when he became president of the Northern District Miners' Union during the 1909 miners' strike, succeeding Peter Bowling. He remained in the role until his election to the Senate, with the abolition of the afternoon shift in the mines being a major achievement during this time. Watson was also a long-term temperance advocate and Baptist lay preacher. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the Senate at the 1913 federal election. In 1914, Watson was elected to the Australian Senate as a Labor Senator from New South Wales. He campaigned against conscription during the 1916 and 1917 referendums. In March 1917, amidst the fallout of the 1916 Labor split, he alleged on the floor of the Senate that Prime Minister Billy Hughes and Senators George Pearce and Thomas Givens had attempted to bribe him to join their new National Labor Party, which was furiously denied. Hughes subsequently sued him for slander, which after a high-profile months-long legal battle in the Supreme Court of Victoria was settled in October 1917. Watson lost his seat in the double-dissolution election of 1917. Following his Senate defeat, he turned to full-time temperance organising, initially in Victoria and Queensland before moving to Sydney 1921 to head up the field staff for temperance organisation the New South Wales Alliance. He frequently toured the country speaking in support of prohibition of alcohol in these roles until his death. He attempted to make a political comeback at the 1922 state election, but was defeated. He died at Lewisham Hospital in December 1924 after experiencing complications from a surgical procedure. He was buried in the Baptist section of Sandgate Cemetery. ==References== Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Australian Senate for New South Wales Category:Members of the Australian Senate Category:1870 births Category:1924 deaths Category:20th-century Australian politicians Category:Scottish emigrants to Australia Category:Australian miners ","title":"David Watson (New South Wales politician)"},{"id":"20144524","text":"Hydrogen corrosion is a form of metal corrosion occurring in the presence of anoxic water.

Conversations in private places are banned from third party audio recording and a member of a conversation can covertly record the conversation without the consent of others. Conversations that occur in public can be recorded by a third party (see O.C.G.A. § 16-11-62). Recording actions in public places without the consent of those being recorded is legal. Recording actions in a private place that is out of public view requires the consent of all those being recorded (see O.C.G.A. § 16-11-62). The law has further clauses regarding recording actions of individuals under 18 as well as when it is on one's own property. ==Examples== A person can \\"tap\\" his or her own phone and record the conversation without the permission of the person to whom they are talking. That is because the person is consenting to the recording and they are actively involved in the conversation being recorded. A person may have a small tape recorder with a microphone (like a lapel mike) attached somewhere on their person whether visible or not.

Such environments “provide a rich opportunity for collaborative knowledge building, particularly through peer-to-peer dialogue.2 In context of virtual collaborative learning, virtual structures and spaces are designed for individual and collaborative learning activities . Virtual collaborative learning in terms of problem-oriented project work in groups facilitated is becoming increasingly common in distributed learning settings where participants are physically in different locations.4 The basic affordances of virtual collaborative learning are to have the ability to synchronously and asynchronously communicate via an array of electronic tools, e.g.: group and discussion chats, wikis, and blogs, where application transparency is essential. The main barrier to virtual collaborative learning is the difficulty in achieving agreement when diverse viewpoints, cultural boundaries, acuity of thoughts, or different working and cognitive learning styles exist.5 Virtual collaborative learning systems can be divided into two main categories: action-oriented from where the participant’s knowledge is captured and shared or text-oriented which focuses on participants sharing knowledge via written communication. Within these categories, the participants may use a range of tools for both synchronous (e.g. chat, telephone conference, video conference) and asynchronous (e.g. threaded forum, document pool, e-mail) communication. 6 The evolution of virtual collaborative learning systems will depend upon the participant's cognitive processes. The participant may adapt to the technology to change the way that they learn or the participant may utilize their learning and collaborative situation to optimize use the technology.7,8 == See also == * Collaborative workspace * Computer-supported collaborative learning * E-Learning * Virtual Learning Environment == References == * * == External links == 1\\\\.

Notable producers of wine from the variety are Abdyika Vineyard, Villa Melnik, Damianitza, Logodaj and Sintica wineries. ==Synonyms== Other transliterations that have been attested include Chiroka Melnichka Losa, Chiroka Melnichka, Melnik, Shiroka Melnichka Loza, Shiroka Melnishka, and Shiroka Melnishka Loza. ==Related Varieties== The traditional Broadleafed Melnik grape ripens late, and is harvested as late as October. This makes fully ripened grapes difficult to achieve, as the climate in south- west Bulgaria is becoming cold and damp by this time. In the 20th century there have been number of experimental hybrids made of various varieties to try to develop them in a way more suitable for Bulgarian vineyards. In 1963 a mixture of pollen from Valdiguié, Durif, Jurançon and Cabernet Sauvignon was used to hybridise with the Broadleafed Melnik vine. The resultant variety was approved for use in 1977 but was not much taken up until the first professional fermentation of it in 1999 generated more interest. The variety is called under various synonyms: Melnik 55, or Early Melnik, or Ranna Melnishka Loza (). Genetic testing has now shown the pollen parent was in fact Valdiguié. The resultant wine is usually quite different from that made from Broadleafed Melnik, although some bottles confusingly still bear front labels calling the wine merely \\"Melnik\\". ==References * Damianitza Winery * Logodaj Winery * Villa Melnik Winery Category:Red wine grape varieties Category:Bulgarian wine ","title":"Siroka Melniska"},{"id":"20144824","text":"Ronald Mark Davis (June 18, 1956 – November 6, 2008) was an American physician who specialized in preventive medicine and was a public health and anti- tobacco advocate. Davis served a one-year term as president of the American Medical Association from 2006 to June 2007. == Biography == Davis was born in Chicago on June 18, 1956, to George and Alice Komessar Davis. He earned his Bachelor of Science in zoology from the University of Michigan in 1978, received a Master of Arts in public policy from the University of Chicago in 1981 and was awarded an M.D. from the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine in 1983.Ronald M. Davis, M.D., M.A., University of Michigan School of Public Health. Accessed November 9, 2008. He served from 1987 to 1991 as the director of the Center for Disease Control's Office on Smoking and Health and was chief medical officer of the Michigan Department of Public Health from 1991 to 1995. He later served as the director of health promotion and disease prevention for the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit. In 1992, he was the founding editor-in-chief of the medical journal Tobacco Control, published by the British Medical Association. He became the first resident ever named to board of the American Medical Association, serving from 1984 to 1987. He was elected to the AMA's board again in 2001 and re-elected in 2005. He served as AMA's 162nd president from June 2007 to June 2008. He was the first physician specializing in Preventive Medicine to be named president of the AMA. After being diagnosed with the disease in February 2008, Davis used his role as the AMA's president to encourage doctors to increase awareness of pancreatic cancer, a disease that ultimately killed Davis and which kills 34,000 Americans each year. As president of the AMA, Davis played a major role in the apology issued for the AMA's longstanding policies that effectively excluded African-American physicians from joining the organization. The AMA required doctors to be members of local medical associations, many of which refused to admit black doctors. Davis noted \\"a feeling of profound regret and embarrassment for what has been uncovered. That is why we are issuing this apology, but also because we believe that by confronting our past we can build a better future.\\"Steenhuysen, Julie. \\"U.S. physicians apologize to black doctors\\", International Herald Tribune, July 10, 2008.

She signed with Amos Records in 1971 and released her debut album Rest on Me in the same year. Her self-titled second album was released in the following year. Kim Carnes yielded one single, \\"You're a Part of Me\\", which became Carnes' first charting title. The song reached number 32 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. None of Carnes's albums charted until the release of her fifth studio album Romance Dance (1980). The album peaked at number 57 on the Billboard 200, number 77 on the Canadian Albums Chart and number 89 on the Australian Albums Chart. Romance Dance produced two singles, one of which—the Smokey Robinson and the Miracles cover \\"More Love\\"—made the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100. Carnes' success peaked with the release of Mistaken Identity (1981), which reached number one on the Billboard 200, and certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album's lead single \\"Bette Davis Eyes\\" was an international success, reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and in several other countries. Carnes' follow-up album Voyeur saw moderate success, with the title track reaching the top 30 on the Billboard Hot 100 and in Australia. The singer released three more albums, Café Racers (1983), Barking at Airplanes (1985) and Light House (1986), before failing to chart on the Billboard 200 again. The most successful single releases from these albums were \\"Invisible Hands\\", \\"You Make My Heart Beat Faster (and That's All That Matters)\\" and \\"Crazy in the Night (Barking at Airplanes)\\", which peaked at numbers 40, 54 and 15, respectively, on the Billboard Hot 100. Carnes permanently relocated to Nashville after the release of View from the House (1988); its lead single, \\"Crazy in Love\\", reached number 13 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. Her last two albums, Checkin' Out the Ghosts (1991) and Chasin' Wild Trains (2004), failed to chart worldwide. ==AlbumsStudio albums=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + List of studio albums, with selected chart positions and certifications !

The grape is a permitted blending variety along with Nebbiolo in the Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) wines of Ghemme. In the Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) wine region of Oltrepò Pavese the grape is often blended with Barbera and Croatina. While Uva Rara's name means \\"rare grape\\" in Italian, the variety is actually widely planted with 608 hectares (1,502 acres) of the vine recorded in Italy in 2000.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pg 1105 Allen Lane 2012 ==History and relationship to other grapes== While name Uva Rara means \\"rare grape\\" in Italian, the grape is actually widely planted throughout the provinces of Piedmont. Uva Rara has a long history of being grown in the Piedmont and Lombardy region, particularly in the provinces of Alessandria, Asti, Biella, Novara, Torino, Vercelli and Pavia. Here the grape has been historically used as a blending grape, with Nebbiolo in Piedmont and with Barbera and Croatina in Lombardy. Uva Rara is often confused with the Gattinara and Oltrepò Pavese grape Vespolina that is also known as Uva Rara, which means \\"rare grape\\" in Italian. Around the communes of Novara, Pavia and Vercelli, Uva Rara is known as Bonarda which has led it to be confused with many of the other grape varieties known as Bonarda, particularly Bonarda Piemontese. However, despite the similarities of synonyms and use in many of the same wines, there is no known relationship between Uva Rara and these other grape varieties. ==Viticulture== Uva Rara is a mid to late-ripening grape variety. Among the viticultural hazards that the vine is most susceptible to includes the fungal infection of powdery mildew and millerandage which can lead to the malformation of grape berries if the weather is unfavorable during flowering. ==Wine regions== Vineyard in the Colline Novaresi DOC where Uva Rara can be used in the DOC red blend with Nebbiolo and Vespolina or made as a varietal. In 2000, there were 608 hectares (1,502 acres) of Uva Rara planted throughout Italy with the vast majority in the Piedmont and Lombardy regions. Here the grape is a permitted blending variety in several DOCs and can be made as a varietal in the Colline Novaresi DOC. In the Oltrepò Pavese and San Colombano al Lambro DOC, Uva Rara is usually blended with Croatina and Barbera while in the Boca, Fara, Coste della Sesia DOC and Sizzano DOCs, it plays a secondary role to Nebbiolo. It is also permitted in the DOCG wine of Ghemme where it plays a similar role in softening the Nebbiolo-based wines of the region. ==Styles== While Uva Rara is primarily a blending grape, adding softness and fruit to the wines, it can also be made into a varietal. According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, varietal styles of Uva Rara tend to be soft, medium bodied with a very perfumed bouquet but the potential to have a bitter finish. ==Synonyms== Over the years Uva Rara has been known under a variety of synonyms including: Balsamea, Balsamina, Balsamina , Bonarda, Bonarda di Cavaglia, Bonarda di Gattinara, Bonarda Novarese, Foglia Lucente, Martellana, Oriana, Orianella, Oriola, Raione, Rairon, Raplum, Raplun and Rara.Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Uva Rara Accessed: April 27th, 2013 ==References== Category:Red wine grape varieties ","title":"Uva Rara"},{"id":"20144858","text":"Astromantic is the third studio album by the Japanese hip-hop group M-Flo.

A native of Siberia, Nechayev met Cheryl Haigler, an American citizen, in Switzerland in 1976, while he was playing for the Red Army team. They married in 1980 in Leningrad. In April 1982, Nechayev was granted permission to join his wife in the United States. In the 1982 NHL Entry Draft, Nechayev was picked 132nd overall by the Kings. Unlike other Soviet players, Nechayev was able to join the team immediately, since he was already living in North America at the time he was drafted.

The lilacine amazon is generally smaller than its related species, with a black beak and more subdued coloring. Lilacine amazons are said to make favorable companion parrots because of their gentle, affectionate nature and agreeable temperament. According to the IOC World Bird List, it is still considered to be a subspecies of the red-lored amazon as Amazona autumnalis lilacina. == Description == The lilacine amazon is a small parrot, approximately 34 cm long when mature, with primarily green plumage. Like the red-lored amazon, it has red lores and yellow cheeks; its distinguishing features include a fully black beak, and lilac-tipped feathers on its crown. == Behavior == The lilacine amazon is known for its gentle and timid nature. In the wild it avoids confrontation with intruders, opting to seek cover in nearby foliage until danger has passed. It usually spends time in small- to medium-sized groups, with which it roosts at night; many birds pair off monogamously within the larger group, and they are most frequently seen flying in pairs. === Diet === The diet of the lilacine amazon consists primarily of fruits, nuts, berries, and seeds. Like most parrots, it possesses a powerful beak; its dexterous tongue also helps to break down and consume a diverse suite of foodstuffs. === Breeding === Sexual maturity is reached at three or four years of age. Like most parrots, the lilacine amazon is a monogamous breeder and a cavity nester. The hen will lay two to four eggs in a tree cavity and incubate them for a period of three weeks; the young fledge about two months after hatching. As with many other parrots, the male will keep the female and chicks nourished during their time in the nest by consuming additional food and regurgitating it for them. == Distribution and habitat == The lilacine amazon is native to the tropical dry forests of western Ecuador north of the Gulf of Guayaquil, extending to Nariño in extreme south-western Colombia adjacent to the Ecuadorian border, where it intersects with the subspecies A. a. salvini. == Aviculture == Lilacine amazons have become well regarded as companion parrots, intelligent with a personality often described as gentle, affectionate, and loyal. In captivity, they enjoy the company of people, and will often form a strong bond with their owner. They are not known as exceptional talkers, but most individuals are able to learn to mimic at least a few phrases. The lilacine amazon has only recently become popular and common in the pet trade, formerly being quite rare. At least one captive breeding program has been established in Europe to increase the bird's numbers. == References  External links == *Amazona lilacina - Ecuador Amazon lilacine amazon Category:Endemic birds of Ecuador lilacine amazon ","title":"Lilacine amazon"},{"id":"20144906","text":"Jan Němeček (born February 14, 1976) is a Czech former professional ice hockey defenceman.

He was drafted by the Los Angeles Kings in the fourth round (116th overall) of the 2001 NHL Entry Draft. ==Playing career== The Los Angeles Kings drafted Petiot in 2001 from the Camrose Kodiaks of the AJHL. He then played four years of collegiate hockey with Colorado College. Petiot signed a two-year contract with the Kings after his senior year with the Tigers on August 11, 2005. Petiot made his professional debut in the 2005–06 season, playing mostly with Kings affiliate, the Manchester Monarchs. Petiot spent the next two injury-plagued seasons with the Monarchs before signing as a free agent for the Toronto Maple Leafs on July 15, 2008. In the 2008–09 season, the Leafs assigned Petiot to their affiliate, the Toronto Marlies, then traded him to the Tampa Bay Lightning for Olaf Kolzig, Andy Rogers, Jamie Heward and a fourth round selection on March 4, 2009. On July 9, 2009 he was signed as a free agent by the Chicago Blackhawks. On July 2, 2010, he was signed as a free agent with the Edmonton Oilers to a one-year contract. During the 2010–11 season, Petiot was called up from the Oklahoma City Barons to replace an injured Theo Peckham on March 1, 2011. On July 2, 2011, Petiot was signed by former team, Tampa Bay, to a one-year, two-way contract. Petiot was limited to only 6 games during the 2011–12 season with affiliate, the Norfolk Admirals, due to injury. With the NHL lockout affecting his status as a free agent, Petiot waited until the conclusion of the dispute before signing to a professional try-out contract with the St. John's IceCaps of the AHL on January 9, 2013. ==Career statistics== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:60em\\" - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Playoffs - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

Wallacut was laid down on 14 August 1944 by the United States Coast Guard Yard at Curtis Bay, Maryland. She was launched on 28 October 1944, sponsored by Miss Sally Koshorek, and completed on 23 March 1945. She was delivered to the U.S. Navy and placed in service on 31 March 1945. Wallacut departed Curtis Bay on 8 April 1945 and, after stops at Norfolk, Virginia, Charleston, South Carolina; Miami, Florida; Key West, Florida; New Orleans, Louisiana, and Balboa in the Panama Canal Zone, reached Eniwetok on 21 July 1945. She remained there for two weeks, then moved on, via Guam and Saipan, to Okinawa, where she arrived on 3 September 1945, the day after Japan's formal surrender ceremony ended World War II. She served at Okinawa until June 1947 when she headed, via Guam and Kwajalein, to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, where she was placed out of service, in reserve, in August 1947. Wallacut remained in reserve until American involvement in the Korean War increased the U.S. Navy's need for active ships. She returned to active service on 11 August 1950 and departed Pearl Harbor for the Far East on 3 October 1950. After stops at Kwajalein, Guam, and Sasebo, Japan, the tug reached Korean waters on 16 November 1950. She served at Hungnam in December 1950 during the evacuation of United Nations troops following the intervention of Chinese communist troops. At the completion of her part in that operation, she stopped over at Pusan briefly before returning to Sasebo on 27 December 1950. Records of Wallacuts service after 1950 are almost nonexistent. She continued to be listed as an active unit of the United States First Fleet until 1960, when she was assigned to the Commander, Naval Forces, Far East. Within a year, she was reassigned simply to the United States Pacific Fleet, and her duty location or locations are unrecorded. In February 1962, Wallacut was redesignated a medium harbor tug and reclassified YTM-420. As such, she continued to serve the Pacific Fleet until January 1973, when she was placed in reserve and berthed at Guam in the Mariana Islands. After three years of inactivity at Guam, she was struck from the Navy list in June 1976. She was sunk as a target on 1 September 1976. ==References *Naval Vessel Register Inactive Vessels *Photo gallery at navsource.org Category:World War II auxiliary ships of the United States Category:Korean War auxiliary ships of the United States Category:Sassaba- class tugs Category:Ships built in Baltimore Category:1945 ships ","title":"USS Wallacut (YTM-420)"},{"id":"20145041","text":"The Headquarters Historic District of Glacier National Park comprises the administrative and housing buildings near West Glacier, Montana on the west side of the park.

It represents and processes systems of mixed hypothetical and categorical syllogisms, no matter how large and complex. The hypothetical premises or rule systems are represented in River graphics that are tributary structures like Ishikawa diagrams that may be nested to any depth required by the expertise. Instructions on the user’s categorical premises are received as input when answers are given to questions in the communication system of the interface. Each antecedent and consequent in the rule system is represented as a node in the River graphic, and each node has a question with three alternative answers: positive, negative and uncertain. As answers are selected by the user, their node labels appear as feedback in the appropriate adversarial case window and the Current result is available in the Current result window if the Current result button is pressed. The answers are alternate three values and there is a fourth value, unanswered, allowed in the combinatoric deductive processing, where the user does not select an answer. Thus the process simulates the application of a four value logic. Its heuristics incorporate expert priorities in conjunctions and disjunctions, in determining pro tem and Final consequents throughout a consultation. Each node may also be glossed in different ways. A spectrum gloss is available to represent inductive instances that fall into the three categories of positive, negative and uncertain, as data to assist the selection of answers. Abductive glosses may take free form as text providing justification or reasons for a rule or part thereof. There may also be gloss links to other programs or websites that provide further understanding of the rule system and what input should be given by the user. Dr Pamela N.

Medical evacuations by air are also performed by the United States Armed Forces (for example in combat areas, training accidents, and United States Coast Guard rescues) and United States National Guard (typically while responding to natural disasters). ==Cost== In 2002, the federal government increased the reimbursement for medical flights for Medicare and Medicaid patients. This caused an increase in the number of for-profit ambulance services, which charge much higher rates than non-profit hospitals and expanded services available to people with private health insurance. With lower reimbursements, hospitals could still operate the service as a loss leader because severely injured patients would be incurring significant charges for medical treatment. NPR cited one 2008 case where two patients were transported from the same accident scene to the same hospital, where the hospital charged $1,700 and the private service charged $13,000.Why The Cost Of Air Ambulances Is Rising ==List of air ambulances== An Airlift Northwest Crew receives a patient transfer from the United States Coast Guard A Mercy Jets crew loading a patient for transport in a Gulfstream Aerospace GIV air ambulance * AC Global Medical Transports * Acadian Ambulance & Air Med Services – Headquartered in Lafayette, Louisiana, covers most of the state of Louisiana and parts of western Mississippi. * Advanced Air Ambulance – a fixed-wing air ambulance company, headquartered in Miami, Florida.

This campaign, fought between the French and the Spanish on the one side and the Vietnamese on the other, began as a limited punitive expedition and ended as a French war of conquest. The war concluded with the establishment of the French colony of Cochinchina, a development that inaugurated nearly a century of French colonial dominance in Vietnam. == Background == The Vĩnh Long campaign was undertaken by the French and Spanish as a reprisal for Vietnamese guerrilla attacks in February and March 1862 on French troops and gunboats in the vicinity of Mỹ Tho. French marching columns were sniped at on the roads, and on 10 March a French gunboat (No. 25) carrying a company of soldiers blew up shortly after it left Mỹ Tho. Fifty-two men were killed or wounded in this incident, and a commission of enquiry found that the explosion was due to sabotage.Thomazi, Conquête, 68; Histoire militaire, 35 Convinced that the mandarins of the province of Vĩnh Long were behind these attacks, Admiral Louis-Adolphe Bonard, the French commander-in-chief, decided to capture the town of Vĩnh Long with a flotilla of despatch vessels and gunboats and a joint Franco-Spanish landing force. On 20 March 1862 he arrived before the fortress of Vĩnh Long with the dispatch vessels Ondine (his flagship) and Shamrock, the gunboats Dragonne and Fusée and seven small gunboats. The landing force, embarked aboard the gunboats, numbered 700 French soldiers and 300 Spanish soldiers, under the orders of Lieutenant-Colonel Reboul of the marine infantry. On 20 March these troops, reinforced by the ships’ landing companies, were set ashore at Dinh Kao, to the southeast of the citadel.Thomazi, Conquête, 68; Histoire militaire, 35 == The capture of Vĩnh Long == Vietnamese wooden cannon found by the French in the citadel of Vĩnh Long. Caliber: 97 mm. Length: 1.90 m. Musée de l'Armée, Paris The following account of the attack by Reboul's French and Spanish troops on Vĩnh Long was given by Colonel Thomazi, the historian of the French conquest of Indochina: > On 22 March they crossed two arroyos under fire and advanced into view of > the enemy batteries, which had been fighting a violent artillery duel with > the gunboats. During the night, after a seven-hour struggle, all the > batteries were occupied, and on the following day we entered the citadel, > where we found 68 cannon and considerable quantities of materiel.Thomazi, > Histoire militaire, 35 == Mopping-up operations == The Vietnamese defenders of Vĩnh Long fell back to a fortified earthwork at My Cui, west of Mỹ Tho. Admiral Bonard sent two columns under the respective command of capitaine de vaisseau Desvaux and Colonel Carlos Palanca y Guttierez to capture My Cui. Desvaux's column, which consisted of two companies of Turcos and a detachment drawn from the garrison of Vĩnh Long, set off from Vĩnh Long and approached My Cui via Cai Lay. Palanca y Guttierez's column, which consisted of 200 Spanish troops, a company of Turcos and a section of artillery, marched directly on My Cui from Vĩnh Long. The two columns attacked My Cui simultaneously and captured it. Lieutenant de vaisseau Vergnes, who was watching the arroyos around Mỹ Tho with a detachment of fusiliers-marins, intercepted and inflicted a further defeat on the retreating Vietnamese. Vietnamese casualties were heavy, and the allies also captured a large number of weapons.Thomazi, Conquête, 68–9; Histoire militaire, 35–6 == Aftermath == Coming on the heels of earlier allied victories at Mỹ Tho (April 1861) and Biên Hòa (December 1861), the capture of Vĩnh Long disheartened the Court of Hue, and in April 1862 Tự Đức let it be known that he was willing to make peace.Thomazi, Conquête, 69–71 ==NotesReferences== * Taboulet, G., La geste française en Indochine (Paris, 1956) * Thomazi, A., La conquête de l'Indochine (Paris, 1934) * Thomazi, A., Histoire militaire de l'Indochine français (Hanoi, 1931) Vinh Long Vinh Long Vinh Long Category:1862 in Vietnam Category:Conflicts in 1862 Category:Cochinchina Campaign Category:March 1862 events Category:History of Vĩnh Long Province ","title":"Capture of Vĩnh Long"},{"id":"20145226","text":"\\"Grace of My Heart\\" is MAX's 11th single released under Avex Trax.

The fairgrounds site occupies and is located on the site of the former Palm Beach Speedway at the intersection of Southern Boulevard (US 98/SR 80) and Fairground Road, adjacent to the Coral Sky Amphitheatre. In 2012, the fairground celebrated its 100th anniversary since its opening in 1912. Nearly 500,000 people attend the South Florida Fair each year. The fair features a midway of rides, games, and concessions, themed exhibition halls, an agricultural and livestock agriplex, and smaller exhibition areas. There is also Yesteryear Village, a history park on the northeastern corner of the property. ==History== The South Florida Fair began as the Palm Beach County Fair in March 1912. The first fair took place under a single tent near the Palm Beach County Courthouse in downtown West Palm Beach over a four-day period. Sponsored by prominent local citizens, the fair aimed to showcase livestock, winter crops, and real estate, with farmers receiving monetary prizes from Henry Flagler. In 1913, the fair moved the railroad depot, located just north of its previous location. After the fair experienced growth in its early years, the Great Depression forced it to only operate a carnival midway between 1930 and 1937, before being discontinued altogether. The attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 disrupted plans to restore the fair in 1942. The fair resumed in 1946 at the National Guard Armory in West Palm Beach. Two years later, the fair moved to Morrison Field (now the Palm Beach International Airport) and stayed until the United States Air Force converted the airport to a military base for the Korean War a few years later. In 1953, the fair incorporated as an organization. Between then and 1955, the fair was held at the Palm Beach Speedway, near the present site of the South Florida Fairgrounds. The fair moved to the current location of Palm Beach State College's (then known as Palm Beach Junior College) Lake Worth campus in 1956 after being deeded by the Palm Beach County government. However, the county reversed its decision and deeded the land to PBJC instead, forcing the fair to move to John Prince Memorial Park in 1957. Later that year, the fair bought the Palm Beach Speedway property, comprising about . The acquisition of the land occurred in June via the fair organizing selling $100,000 in bonds and receiving matching funds from the Florida Department of Agriculture after depositing $30,000. Additionally, Palm Beach County donated about in exchange for the property at John Prince Memorial Park, to be used to expand PBJC. Construction on two exhibition halls began on June 10. Finally, on January 27, 1958, the fair began operating at its present location. In 1960, the Palm Beach County Fair was renamed the South Florida Fair. ==Organization== The South Florida Fair and Palm Beach County Expositions, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) non- profit corporation organized and existing pursuant to Chapter 616 of the Florida Statutes. It has a Board of Trustees that consists of 17 people who are responsible for setting policy and seeing that management of the association is carried out under direction of an executive staff consisting of the President/CEO and currently two Vice Presidents. The Fair also has Directors who serve in an advisory capacity. There are currently 55 Directors. The Trustees and Directors are non-paid volunteers. The day-to-day operation is the responsibility of the President, Rick Vymlatil, who oversees a staff of over 45 full-time employees. ==Economic impact== According to a study released in 2000 by Economic Research Associates, Inc., the South Florida Fairgrounds generated a total economic impact of $149,924,000 in 1999. This was prior to the development of the Expo East Exhibit Hall, the enhancement of Yesteryear Village (including the new Bink Glisson and the Sally Bennett \\"Big Band Hall of Fame\\") and the aggressive marketing of the Americraft Expo Center exhibit floor space. In addition, the Cruzan Amphitheatre alone is estimated to generate an economic impact in excess of $20 million. But not only does the Fair generate a significant economic impact, it makes a substantial annual cash distribution to the youth of this area from its own resources. In the 2007/08 fiscal year, the South Florida Fair paid in excess of $200,000 in scholarship and 4-H premium awards, compensation to choruses and bands performing during the annual Fair, and contributions to Palm Beach County schools through its Partners-In-Education Advance Ticket program. ==Fairgrounds== Approximately comprise the property known as the South Florida Fairgrounds. In 1957, Palm Beach County gave the fair at its present site but later took back for the stockade. This contribution was made in consideration of the fair agreeing to relocate from John Prince Park in order that the county could vie for a state university (PBCC). The fairgrounds is partitioned into several pods or tracts: the parking tracts, Yesteryear Village, the Coral Sky Amphitheatre, and the exhibit buildings, including the Americraft Expo Center and the Agriplex. The space available on the fairgrounds for trade shows and exhibits exceeds . During the annual South Florida Fair, the southern parking tract is utilized as the \\"midway\\" containing rides, shows, games, and concessions. ===Events=== The main event on the fairgrounds is the annual South Florida Fair, which occurs over a 17-day period, generally in the last two weeks of January each year. Over the past several years, the annual fair has incorporated a theme as a means of stimulating tourism as well as the educational and cultural interest of the residents of Palm Beach County. For instance, \\"Florida\\" was featured at the 1998 fair and \\"Alaska\\"; \\"Tales of the American West\\"; \\"New England\\"; \\"Hollywood\\"; \\"Having a Ball\\"; \\"Dreams, screams, thrills, chills\\"; \\"Party with the Animals\\"; and \\"A World of Fun\\" were showcased in previous fairs. One of the greatest aspects of the annual fair is its agricultural and livestock exhibits which clearly provide the greatest variety of such exhibits anywhere within Palm Beach County. Even though agriculture is such a tremendous part of Palm Beach County's economic base, many school children have never been exposed to it. However, at the annual South Florida Fair, not only can they see and learn all about agriculture, but can even witness a calf being born, or learn how a dairy is operated. The annual fair attracts nearly 500,000 people through its turnstiles. However, 650,000 people will attend various events on the fairgrounds on an annual basis. Besides the . Americraft (now South Florida Fair) Expo Center, there are 10 other smaller exhibit buildings along with the Cruzan Amphitheater, Agriplex, Palm Beach Model Railroaders and Yesteryear Village. These events constitute 250 event days. ===Yesteryear Village=== Yesteryear Village is a history park and exhibit on , showcasing buildings and artifacts from the 1850s to the 1950s. It exhibits a large collection of early, original, and replicated buildings, including an old school, a farm, a blacksmith shop, a general store, a church, a fire department, a post office, a bait & tackle shop, and the famed Riddle House. Included is the only big band museum in the United States, the Sally Bennett Big Band Hall of Fame Museum.

From its western end, Sam Cooper Boulevard continues east for to reach its eastern terminus at the Interstate 40/Interstate 240 interchange. The road was originally planned in the 1950s. It was proposed as a segment of I-40 that would intersect the center of Memphis and continue west to Arkansas. The proposed route would have cut through Overton Park, an old forest public park in Memphis. Following a United States Supreme Court decision in 1971 the route was revised, I-40 was routed around Memphis in the north and plans of routing an Interstate highway through the city were abandoned. Ownership of the completed segments of the highway was transferred to the City of Memphis. As a road that is owned and maintained by the City of Memphis, no route number is assigned to Sam Cooper Boulevard. ==HistoryProposed route=== I-40/I-240 planned routes (1955) In the 1950s, Interstate 240 (I-240) was planned as a complete loop around Memphis, consisting of a southern leg and a northern leg. Interstate 40 (I-40) was proposed to be routed through the center of the City of Memphis and to continue west into Arkansas over the Hernando de Soto Bridge, which was opened in 1973 and carries the traffic on modern I-40 over the Mississippi River. The I-240 loop was planned to route traffic not destined for Memphis around the city and to improve the flow of increasing traffic. The proposed I-240 loop would connect westbound and eastbound traffic to I-40 and southbound and northbound traffic to Interstate 55 (I-55). What is now known as Sam Cooper Boulevard was planned as a segment of I-40, intersecting Memphis and distributing eastbound and westbound traffic with a destination in Memphis within the city. After a U.S. Supreme Court ruling stopped the plans to complete the section of I-40 cutting through Memphis in 1971, I-40 was re-routed. The routing of modern I-40 coincides with the proposed routing of the northern leg of I-240. Instead of the proposed I-240 loop around Memphis, the modern routing designates I-240 as the southern leg of the loop and I-40 as the northern leg of the loop. From the west to the east, the proposed routing of Sam Cooper Boulevard coincides with the route of modern I-40 from the Hernando de Soto Bridge in downtown Memphis to the modern I-40/I-240 interchange west of North Bellevue Boulevard in midtown Memphis. East of the I-40/I-240 interchange, the proposed route of Sam Cooper Boulevard would have been routed almost due east for circa , parallel to and south of Overton Park Avenue and north of Peach Avenue until it reached Evergreen Street. From there, it would have continued northeast for about to reach the intersection of Galloway Avenue and North McLean Boulevard. From there, the route would have continued roughly to the east, parallel to and about south of North Parkway, just south of the Memphis Zoo and cutting through the northern portion of Overton Park, to connect to the western terminus of modern Sam Cooper Boulevard at East Parkway North. At the western terminus of Sam Cooper Boulevard there is a concurrency of East Parkway North with U.S. Route 70, U.S. Route 79 for south of Summer Avenue and north of Union Avenue. East Parkway North also concurs with Tennessee State Route 277. ===Namesake=== In 1968, the road was named after Sam Cooper, a Memphis businessman and longtime president of the Humko Corporation, a refinery of vegetable oils. He also was the vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Memphis. Cooper used his wealth to support St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and the University of Tennessee Medical School. ===Citizen protests=== In 1971, the United States Supreme Court in the case of Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe stopped an extension of I-40 through Overton Park. Sam Cooper Boulevard was originally planned as an extension of I-40 to intersect the City of Memphis. The proposed route was completed as proposed east of North Highland Street and west of I-240 in Berclair, in the northeastern quadrant of Memphis. The portion of Sam Cooper Boulevard west of North Highland Street was never built as planned. The unbuilt portion west of East Parkway North was not completed because it was proposed to go through Overton Park, the Memphis Zoo, and several historic neighborhoods of Memphis. Citizens residing in the neighborhoods of midtown Memphis along the route of the proposed highway were able to stop the route cutting through the old forest of Overton Park in the lawsuit Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe. Once the case was decided by the United States Supreme Court, the ownership of the completed segments of Sam Cooper Boulevard was given to the City of Memphis. Instead of following the planned route cutting through the center of Memphis, I-40 was routed around Memphis in the north. The new routing of I-40 to the north of Memphis follows the proposed northern leg of the I-240 loop. Construction of the route segment of Sam Cooper Boulevard west of North Highland Street and east of East Parkway North began in 2001 and was completed in 2003. The construction did not follow the originally proposed freeway design for the road but implemented a parkway design with at-grade intersections, a raised median, traffic lights and sidewalks for pedestrians. ===21st century=== Extension to East Parkway Tillman St intersection (2009) In 2001, the City of Memphis began construction on an extension of Sam Cooper Boulevard west of the North Highland Street exit. After completion of the first phase of construction, Sam Cooper Boulevard transitioned into Broad Avenue between North Holmes Street and Vandalia Street, about west of North Highland Street. The route coinciding with Broad Avenue had several intersections with traffic signals and two major railroad crossings, creating traffic congestion at peak times. The extension of Sam Cooper Boulevard was routed about south of Broad Avenue. Several of the intersections were eliminated, a viaduct was constructed to avoid the railroad crossings and the route was extended to East Parkway North. The original route east of North Highland Street, was designed as a six-lane freeway without intersections, traffic signals and without sidewalks for pedestrians, allowing only motorized traffic on the road. The extension of Sam Cooper Boulevard west of the North Highland Street exit was constructed as a six-lane controlled- access parkway. Pedestrians are allowed on the route on sidewalks installed on both sides of the parkway west of Vandalia Street, located about west of North Highland Street. The median is raised and there are at-grade intersections present equipped with traffic signals and pedestrian crossings. The segment of Sam Cooper Boulevard west of North Highland Street and east of East Parkway North was completed in 2003. Random shootings at cars In 2004, it was reported by local newsmedia that several cars driving on Sam Cooper Boulevard had been shot at randomly in the section west of Tillman Street and east of North Hollywood Street in the Binghampton neighborhood. The Memphis Police Department (MPD) reported 13 shootings between August and October of that year. A spokesman of the MPD stated that only vehicle damage had occurred and that no persons were hurt in the shootings. Police recovered a nine millimeter bullet from the front door of one vehicle. A special police task force was assigned to the case. It is not known if the shooter was caught. Revitalization attempts Broad Avenue (2010) In 2006, citizens from the Binghampton neighborhood of Memphis voiced concerns about negative effects that the completion of the western portion of Sam Cooper Boulevard has had on the community. Claims were made that construction of the road between North Highland Street and East Parkway North cut the Binghampton area in half by creating \\"high-speed traffic\\" and \\"confusing traffic patterns\\". It was mentioned that the routing of Sam Cooper Boulevard to the south of Broad Avenue had \\"effectively made\\" the circa long stretch of Broad Avenue a \\"ghost town\\", creating vacant lots in the partly industrial area and an unsafe neighborhood. The Memphis Flyer cites Robert Montague, executive director of the Binghampton Development Corporation: \\"When they built Sam Cooper, this area really got buried\\". Citizens suggested changes in the zoning and a re- design of the Broad Avenue area north of Sam Cooper Boulevard and south of Summer Avenue to re-vitalize that part of the neighborhood and attract business and residents. The following year, trees and shrubs were planted alongside Sam Cooper Boulevard and in the median west of North Highland Street. A few decorative flowerbeds were also installed in the median of the road to enhance the parkway design of the road. ==Exit listProposed exits=== Exit #8 at Graham St (2009) Sam Cooper Boulevard is owned and maintained by the City of Memphis. No route number is assigned to Sam Cooper Boulevard and it is not a designated business route for interstate traffic headed for Memphis. The exit numbering system on Sam Cooper Boulevard has not been changed since the route was planned. The exits are still numbered as if I-40 ran along Sam Cooper Boulevard as it was proposed to be built straight through Memphis to connect to Arkansas over the Hernando de Soto Bridge. In fact, overhead gantry signs still told westbound motorists that they were heading towards Little Rock until the lettering was removed from the signs in March 2016. The exits for I-40 along the proposed route segment through the center of Memphis, west of East Parkway North, that was never completed were planned in downtown Memphis (planned as exit 1), at Danny Thomas Boulevard (planned as exit 2), west of North Bellevue Boulevard as an interchange with modern-day I-240 (planned as exit 3) and at Stonewall Street in the Evergreen District of midtown Memphis (planned as exit 4). I-40 exits were proposed at East Parkway North (planned as exit 5) and Tillman Street (planned as exit 6). The planned exit 1 along Sam Cooper Boulevard exists as exit 1 and exit 1A of modern-day I-40 in downtown Memphis just south of the Pyramid Arena. Exit 1 serves traffic to and from North Riverside Drive and Front Street; at exit 1A westbound traffic exits to North 2nd Street and eastbound traffic enters I-40 from North 3rd Street. Planned exit 2 coincides with modern exits 1B–D on I-40 at Danny Thomas Boulevard. Planned exit 3 exists as exit 1E on modern I-40 at the I-40/I-240 interchange west of North Bellevue Boulevard in the Medical district of Memphis. Planned exit 4 at Stonewall Street was never constructed. Planned exit 5 is an at-grade intersection with traffic signals at the western terminus of Sam Cooper Boulevard at East Parkway North, and planned exit 6 is an at-grade intersection with traffic lights at Tillman Street. Exits 7–9 and Exits 10A and 10B were constructed as proposed. ===Existing exits=== Western terminus (2010) The following table lists the existing exits and intersections of Sam Cooper Boulevard as of 2017 from west to east. ==Points of interest== Points of interest along Sam Cooper Boulevard (west to east). * Memphis Zoo, west of the western terminus * Memphis Brooks Museum of Art, west of the western terminus * Overton Park at the western terminus * Memphis National Cemetery, north of Highland Street exit * Site of the first Holiday Inn hotel, east of Perkins Road exit * Wolf River at the eastern terminus * Shelby Farms Park, east of the eastern terminus ==See also== * Interstate 40 in Tennessee * Interstate 240 (Tennessee) ==References * TDOT smartway Information System * TDOT smartway traffic camera at Sam Cooper Boulevard and Perkins Street * TDOT smartway traffic camera at Sam Cooper Boulevard and Graham Street * TDOT smartway traffic camera at Sam Cooper Boulevard and High Point Terrace * TDOT smartway traffic camera at Sam Cooper Boulevard and Highland Street Category:Transportation in Memphis, Tennessee Category:Freeways in Tennessee Category:Interstate 40 Category:Transportation in Shelby County, Tennessee ","title":"Sam Cooper Boulevard"},{"id":"20145243","text":"Al Qaeda Network Exord is a classified order that allows the U.S. military to direct operations against al-Qaeda in 15 to 20 countries around the world, including those not at war with the United States.

The word comes from Latin aēneus or ahēneus, \\"brazen\\", from aes, \\"copper alloy\\". ==In war== While the size of individual Roman military units, or alae, may have varied, alae made extensive use of both acoustical and visual signaling in communications and each had an assigned banner bearer (vexillarius) and at least one aeneator. A variety of instruments were used by aeneators, including the buccina, cornu, tuba, and lituus. In addition to their roles within battle, aeneators were also used for processionals and games, particularly in marching home from war. ==Categories of aeneators== Aeneators who blew a cornu (a G-shaped horn made of brass) were known as \\"cornicines\\"; those who blew a tuba (a straight bronze horn with a slight flare at the end) were known as \\"tubicens\\"; those who blew a buccina (a C-shaped horn made of bronze or silver or animal horn) were known as \\"bucinators\\". Cornicens and tubicens mostly performed uncomplicated tactical signaling on the battlefield, and therefore were not accorded special status in the military unit. They had call duties in the barracks, just as other commonly conscripted soldiers had. By contrast, the bucinator was seen as a specially-skilled member of the unit who was capable of performing a wider repertoire and was used to perform a variety of ceremonial duties. Many units accorded bucinators immunes status, and there were equestrian bucinatores that served as cavalry buglers. ==Non-military uses== Aeneators were not the only skilled or specialized players of wind instruments in Ancient Roman culture.

Margaret Harrington, the chief operating officer of Victory, described FitzSimons as having a \\"transition problem.\\" Martha Woodall of the Philadelphia Inquirer stated in a 2006 article that the boys assigned to FitzSimons had tension with the boys assigned to Rhodes, and that tensions increased when they were combined into the same school. Richard H. Jenkins Sr., the principal of FitzSimons, said in that Philadelphia Inquirer article that he began establishing order with the students as the 2005-2006 school year progressed. Victory Schools has been relieved of responsibility for the school; for the 2009-2010 school year, the school has been returned to the authority of Philadelphia Public Schools.

Overton of his duties as the school made its transition from The Young Mens Leadership School at Thomas FitzSimons High School to Thomas FitSimons High School- Promise Academy. In August 2011, budgetary issues and political unrest within The School District of Philadelphia negatively impacted the school's program direction and Thomas FitzSimons High School did not open as a Promise Academy. However, that school year, Thomas Fitzsimons High School operated as a comprehensive neighborhood high school adopting some of the reform measures associated with the Promise Academy model. The new school, led by Principal Jafar Baraka focused on re-shaping academic programing, highlighting gender based education, systems building to address school safety and climate as well as focusing on instructional rigor and parental partnerships.

Born in Camden, New South Wales, he was educated at state schools before becoming a bank officer. Having studied law, he became a solicitor in 1905. He contested the 1919 federal election as a Nationalist candidate for the Senate, but was unsuccessful. On 15 December 1921, however, when Nationalist Senator Herbert Pratten resigned to contest a by-election in the House of Representatives, Garling was appointed to replace him. He was defeated, however, at the 1922 election, leaving the Senate immediately so that Allan McDougall could continue the rest of Pratten's term. Garling returned to law, and died in 1942. ==References== Category:Nationalist Party of Australia members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Australian Senate for New South Wales Category:1870 births Category:1942 deaths Category:20th-century Australian politicians ","title":"Henry Garling"},{"id":"20145519","text":"Chris Henderson (born April 7, 1984) is a Canadian country musician born in Estevan, Saskatchewan and currently based out of Regina, Saskatchewan, and is the two-time SCMA Male Artist of the Year (2018, 2019). == 620 CKRM Contest == In 2006, Chris entered, and won, the 620 CKRM Big Country Talent Show, which essentially launched his career as a recording artist, whether he knew it at the time or not. As prize for winning the contest, Chris was awarded the opportunity to record a single with SCMA and CCMA award-winning Saskatchewan band, the Poverty Plainsmen. Working with the band, Chris released the single \\"The Difference You Make\\" in October of the same year. The single became a tune frequently played on CKRM and its success encouraged Chris to pursue other recording opportunities. Other notable winners of the CKRM contest include Brad Johner, Kal Hourd, Jess Moskaluke, Katie Hess, and Sheila Deck. == Follow the Signs == In September 2007, Chris travelled to Nashville to record his first full-length album, Follow the Signs. Initial recording on the album was completed at Grand & Gee Music and subsequent recording was done at B-Rad Studios in Regina. The album's first single, \\"You Don't Scare Me\\" was released in September 2008 and as of October, it has reached No. 87 on the CanCon Country Music Charts. It is being played on radio stations nationwide. Other singles that were from this album include: \\"All Of Me\\" and \\"The Cover of Country Weekly\\". == It Isn't Christmas Without Snow == Henderson released a self-penned Christmas song in 2010, which was recorded in Regina, Sk at B-Rad Studios with Brad Prosko producing, engineering, and mixing. The song featured Jayson Brinkworth on drums, Dave Chobot on bass and keys, and Brad Prosko on acoustic and electric guitar. == \\"The Next Big Thing\\" == In 2010, Henderson entered a contest sponsored by CHBD-FM (Big Dog 92.7), a radio station in Regina, Sk which has since been rebranded to Pure Country. The prize was for $15,000, which included a showcase at the Canadian Country Music Awards in Edmonton, Alberta that year, and much more. Henderson was crowned the winner of the contest, and took the opportunity to head back into the studio to begin work on a sophomore album. His music career started to get busy enough that he resigned from his previous career as a high school English Language Arts teacher in 2011. == My Turn == After slowly working away at a new album, Henderson returned to the studio to finish \\"My Turn\\" in 2013, and released it the following year. \\"Don't Miss Your Kiss Goodbye\\" was released as the lead single, and reached #47 on the Canadian BDS charts, making it the top wholly independent song on the charts at the time. The song also won the 2014 Saskatchewan Country Music Award for \\"Song of the Year\\" awarded to the writers including Henderson, Troy Kokol, and Willie Mack. The follow up single \\"I Sure Hope He Loves You\\" reached #51 on the BDS Charts as well, and Henderson was nominated for 5 SCMA awards that year. == The Charm == The Charm was Henderson's 3rd full-length album, and was released in 2017. The lead single, \\"My Regret\\" reached #47 on the Canadian Country Mediabase chart, and remained in that position for four weeks. The follow up single, \\"Kissing Sadie\\" reached #75 on the charts in Canada, and was also nominated for an Alberta Country Music award for \\"Songwriter(s) of the Year\\". It was eligible because Henderson's co-writers, Joni DeLaurier and Mike Little, both reside in Alberta. == Point of View == Point of View will be Henderson's 4th studio project, and is scheduled for release in the fall of 2019. The album's lead single, \\"I'll Be Your Mountain\\" was released in January of 2019, and reached at peak of #72 on the Canadian charts. == Discography == *The Difference You Make (2006) – single release *Follow the Signs (2008) *#\\"The Cover of Country Weekly\\" – 3:29 (by Sean Hogan & Jerry Holthouse) *#\\"You Don't Scare Me\\" – 3:16 (by Steve Fox) *#\\"Follow the Signs\\" – 4:16 (by Chris Henderson and Jocelyn Armbruster) *#\\"All of Me\\" – 3:09 (by Anthony Kelly & Arranged by Chris Henderson) *#\\"The Difference You Make\\" – 3:55 (by Cyril Rawson, Ritchie McDonald, & Ron Harbin) *#\\"You Can't Cry Your Way Out of This\\" – 3:09 (by Sean Hogan & Jerry Holthouse) *#\\"I Miss The Old You\\" – 3:06 (by Cory Churko, Kevin Churko, Michael Norman & Shane Hendrickson) *#\\"Believe\\" – 4:08 (by Chris Henderson) *#\\"The Trouble With Love\\" – 3:21 (by Cyril Rawson, Tebey Ottoh & Carl Utbult) *#\\"All I Know is What I Heard\\" – 3:58 (by Cyril Rawson, Glen Coulson, Marty Beecroft & Joe Heslip) *#\\"Sad And Sorry Man\\" – 5:36 (by Sean Hogan) *It Isn't Christmas Without Snow (2010)- single release *My Turn (2014) *#\\"Don't Miss Your Kiss Goodbye\\" – 4:07 (written by Chris Henderson, Troy Kokol, and Willie Mack) *#\\"(Thanks For Making Me) Look So Good\\" – 2:56 (written by Chris Henderson) *#\\"Crazy's Comin' Outta the Bottle\\" – 3:00 (written by Chris Henderson) *#\\"I Sure Hope He Loves You\\" - 3:33 (written by Chris Henderson) *#\\"Have a Little Faith in Me\\" - 3:41 (written by John Hiatt) *#\\"Dance or 3\\" - 2:31 (written by Chris Henderson and Joel Henderson) *#\\"The List of What I'll Miss\\" - 3:29 (written by Chris Henderson) *#\\"Murphy's Law\\" - 3:59 (written by Chris Henderson) *#\\"Taking Sides (feat.

They publish 35-40 titles a year in many genres and on many topics, with a special focus on South Australian stories. In 2019, the publisher celebrated its 30th anniversary under its current management and name. ==History== A publishing company under the name The Wakefield PressIts name originates from Edward Gibbon Wakefield, an early figure in the colonisation of South Australia, after whom several landmarks are named. was founded in 1942 by Adelaide bookseller Harry Muir (1909-1991), owner of Beck Book Company Limited in Pulteney Street. His intention was to publish small, historical monographs which he believed would otherwise go unread. The company's first publication was A Checklist of Ex-Libris Literature Published in Australia, owing to Muir's interest in bookplates. The press operated out of the bookshop from the 1940s to 1960s. In the 1980s, the state government re-established the name as Wakefield Press, as part of the state's sesquicentenary (150-year anniversary) celebrations, and a series of histories was published. As proprietor of the monthly cultural magazine the Adelaide Review, Christopher Pearson bought the name of the Wakefield Press from the South Australian government and operated the company from 1986 to 1988. Michael Bollen, who had worked with Pearson, took over the company in 1989, with Stephanie Johnston buying in a year or so later. They moved to premises in The Parade West, Kent Town, where they stayed until relocation to Mile End in August–September 2014. ==Current management== under the directorship of Michael Bollen, Wakefield publishes 35-40 titles each year on a diverse range of topics, including literary and popular fiction, young adult fiction and a range of non-fiction topics. They retain their focus on Australian authors and topics, particularly South Australian. They have boosted their focus on young adult fiction, with editor Margot Lloyd as publisher of the Young Adult list. They successfully launched Making Friends with Alice Dyson by Adelaide first-time author Poppy Nwosu in 2019. The management team believe that they can take risks that larger companies, being controlled by their marketing departments, cannot take. They have a backlist of around 500 titles, and a growing e-book list. ==Notable publications== *Ochre and Rust: Artefacts and Encounters on Australian Frontiers, by Philip Jones, Senior Curator at the South Australian Museum, won the non-fiction prize in the inaugural Prime Minister's Literary Awards in 2008. *Mallee Boys by Charlie ArchboldMallee Boys Mallee Boys was awarded Honour Book for Older Readers in the 2018 Children's Book Council of Australia Awards.CBCA Awards 2018 *Red Professor: The Cold War Life of Fred Rose, by Peter Monteath and Valerie Munt,Red Professor: The Cold War Life of Fred Rose was shortlisted for the Prime Minister's Literary Awards Prize for Australian History in 2016. *An Unsentimental Bloke: The life and work of C.J.

It was created by an American soldier named Edgar Woolbright stationed in the Philippines as an alternative to poker, and is a popular pastime of Danish businessmen overseas.http://www.balut.org/rules.html The game is named after a delicacy made from the fetal duck egg available in some Southeast Asian countries. The international Danish community has taken the game as a popular method of social interaction abroad and at home, with Danish expatriates/businessmen gathering to play the game monthly. Rules of the game, code of conduct including dress code are enforced by participants and by the gamemasters, and games are organized by members of the International Balut Federation, or IBF.IBF website ==Play== The game involves rolling five dice up to 3 times to make various combinations, which are noted on a scorecard. A Balut is a five- of-a-kind of any denomination, but unlike in Yahtzee it counts for little in terms of points. Players who obtain a Balut announce it to the other players by calling out \\"Balut!\\"—similar to calling out \\"bingo!\\", and note it on a special scorecard. Players try to guess before gameplay how many Baluts will be made during the game; correctly guessing the total number can earn a prize. Fun Free Party Games ===South East Asia variation=== There is also a different version of Balut played in Members’ Clubs in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines which follow a set of rules established in 1978 at Singapore Town Club. These Clubs organize regular local and international tournaments as well as gathering together each year for the STC Balut Interport Championship. The 28th was held at the British Club Bangkok in 2008 and the 29th was held at the Sabah Golf & Country Club in 2009.

Frank Baum, Lawence, KS, University Press of Kansas, 1997. The publication of the book was timed to coincide with the centennial of the original Oz book, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (as was also true of Edward Einhorn's Paradox in Oz and Dave Hardenbrook's The Unknown Witches of Oz). It was the winner of the Club's Centennial book contest, which received over 100 entries in 1998. Wickwar supplies her book with a range of puns, verbal tricks, and imaginative elements: Silica Valley and its inhabitants, plus the Magnetic Field, the Draw Bridge, a Babbling Brook and Caterwauling Cataracts, Snap Dragons, and Dragon Flies. ==The plot== Wickwar introduces a new child protagonist, Emma Lou, an orphan from Arizona, a tomboy and baseball pitcher. She is carried to Oz by the agency of Chief Thundercloud, an animated wooden Indian. There, Emma Lou falls in with a crowd of old and new Oz characters including the Glass Cat, Princess Vitrea, Ketzal (an animated feathered boa), and a blue parrot named Beak. (Indeed, Wickwar deliberately crowds her book with characters, in imitation of Baum's The Lost Princess of Oz. Paddy, the rainbow-painting leprechaun in search of his lost pot of gold, is one of many.) The characters have to confront the machinations of Zeebo the Sorcerer. With the aid of familiar figures like the Wizard, the Tin Woodman, the Sawhorse, and Polychrome the fairy, Emma Lou and her friends unravel the mystery of the missing Prince of the Blue Mountain, Vitrea's love. ==References * On The Hidden Prince of Oz Category:Oz (franchise) books Category:2000 fantasy novels Category:2000 American novels Category:2000 children's books ","title":"The Hidden Prince of Oz"},{"id":"20145591","text":"Robert Llewellyn Clancy is an Australian clinical immunologist and a pioneer in the field of mucosal immunology.

He was elected as a member of the Labor Party, but after the 1931 party split joined the breakaway Lang Labor faction. He was one of only two Lang Labor senators, but was designated as the party's Senate leader. Dunn was a trade unionist and World War I soldier before entering politics. He was a perennial candidate for state and federal office between 1919 and 1945, but won only a single election. ==Early life== Dunn was born \\"probably\\" in Kirkdale, Liverpool, England. He was the son of Irish parents, Margaret (née Kavanagh) and Thomas Dunn. He went to sea at the age of 16, jumping ship in South Africa and taking up an engineering apprenticeship in Simon's Town. He later travelled to Australia, working for a glass company in Sydney, and then on to New Zealand where he worked as a miner, timber-trucker, and wharf labourer. Dunn became involved in the New Zealand labour movement, helping to establish the Greymouth Carters' and Drivers' Union and serving as vice- president of the Westland Trades and Labor Council. He was an unsuccessful candidate for Greymouth Borough councillor in 1909. The following year, Dunn moved to Queensland, Australia, where he joined the Australian Workers' Union. He was involved in the 1911 sugar workers' strike. He subsequently moved to Sydney, finding work as an engine-driver at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. He was vice-president of the Combined Iron Trades Federation and a delegate of the Federated Iron Workers' Association to the Labor Council of New South Wales. In 1914, Dunn joined the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force and was sent to New Guinea. He caught malaria and was returned to Australia, where he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force. He was sent overseas in March 1916, and saw active service in France and the Middle East. Dunn was discharged in November 1919 and returned to Cockatoo Island. ==Politics== Dunn c. 1920s Dunn was elected to the Labor Party state executive in 1921. He first stood for parliament at the 1919 federal election, losing to Walter Marks in the Division of Wentworth. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the Senate in 1922 and 1925, eventually winning a seat at the 1928 election. Three months prior to the election, he adopted \\"Digger\\" as one of his middle names so it would appear on the ballot. He was subsequently criticised by Major General Pompey Elliott for doing so. Dunn's term in the Senate began on 1 July 1929. He attributed the Great Depression to the \\"international money power, which controls the very existence of every man and woman in the capitalist-controlled countries on this earth\\". In March 1931, Dunn joined the breakaway Lang Labor faction, which comprised supporters of Jack Lang's left-wing populist economic policies. He was one of only two Lang Labor senators, along with 71-year-old Arthur Rae, but was nonetheless nominated as its Senate leader. He was among those who voted to bring down the Scullin Government in November 1931, and played a key role in coordinating the vote with United Australia Party, working with UAP senator Hal Colebatch. Dunn was defeated at the 1934 federal election. Although he personally polled 32.7 percent of the vote, the preferential block voting system in use at the time meant that the Coalition won all three seats with just over half of the total. Undated photo After his defeat, Dunn established a chemical manufacturing company whose main product was a compound analgesic marketed as a headache powder. He remained politically involved, and at the 1938 state election stood as a candidate of the Industrial Labor Party, another breakaway group. He lost to the official Labor candidate in Leichhardt. In 1941, Dunn's old Lang Labor colleague Eddie Ward secured him a position in the Department of Labour and National Service. He was terminated in November 1943 after Ward left the department. Dunn eventually rejoined the Labor Party, standing unsuccessfully in Manly at the 1941 and 1944 elections. His final candidacy came at the 1945 Manly by-election, caused by the death of Alfred Reid. He was denied ALP preselection and stood as a Soldiers' Party candidate, which precipitated his expulsion from the Labor Party. ==Personal life== Dunn married Alice Mary Hynes on 2 February 1924. The couple had three children together, two sons and a daughter. In 1932, his wife was imprisoned for one month after being convicted of forgery, uttering, and obtaining money under false pretences. He obtained a divorce in the same year, and received custody of the children. Dunn was \\"a Roman Catholic, a non-smoker and teetotaller\\". He died suddenly at his home in Dee Why on 21 November 1945, and was buried at Frenchs Forest Bushland Cemetery. ==References== Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Lang Labor members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Australian Senate for New South Wales Category:Members of the Australian Senate Category:Australian trade unionists Category:Australian miners Category:Australian people of Irish descent Category:English emigrants to Australia Category:1887 births Category:1945 deaths Category:20th-century Australian politicians ","title":"James Dunn (Australian politician)"},{"id":"20145717","text":"The Walton Ranger Station in Glacier National Park was constructed to \\"Standard Ranger Station, GNP\\" plans as a year-round station at Walton to replace the old Paola Ranger Station and to place a station near US 2, a well- traveled highway through the park.

The club is based in Victorian town of Cudgewa and plays its home games at the Cudgewa Recreation Reserve. The club fields senior, reserve and junior sides as well as fielding all netball sides. ==History== The Blues were among the founding members in 1893 of the Corryong Football Association, the competition which, after several name changes, became the Upper Murray Football League in 1937. The side finished second in its debut season and again in 1895 before claiming its first premiership in 1896. This inaugural flag was won on the basis of the number of premiership points attained during the home and away season, but by the time Cudgewa next went top, in 1904, the Association had introduced a finals system. The Blues won that year's grand final against Corryong, and by the time of the outbreak of world war one had added further such triumphs at the expense of Federal in 1911, Corryong in 1913, and Federal in 1914. Between the wars Cudgewa claimed another four premierships but it was during the first four decades after world war two that the club really came into its own. Over the course of the forty-one season period from 1946 to 1986 the Blues contested no fewer than twenty-four senior grade grand finals, winning sixteen of them. ==2000 and Beyond== Since the late 1990s Cudgewa has experienced mixed success under a variety of coaches starting by going back to back Premiers in 1999 and 2000. However, by the early 2000s the Blues were struggling with the retirement of several older players and the reformation of the Bullioh Football Club the Blues were drained of many of its better players. For the rest of the decade the Blues made the finals on only 4 occasions as they slowly rebuilt with some of the more promising players in the competition. By 2011 under new coach Bill Deery, and with a host of new recruits, the club made a resurgence to reach the Grand Final only to be defeated by Bullioh by 63 points in the decider. ==See also== *Upper Murray Football Netball League *Tallangatta & District Football League *Australian rules football in Victoria *Australian rules football in New South Wales ==References== Category:Netball teams in Victoria (Australia) Category:Australian rules football clubs in Victoria (Australia) Category:1893 establishments in Australia Category:Sports clubs established in 1893 Category:Australian rules football clubs established in 1893 Category:Multi- sport clubs in Australia ","title":"Cudgewa Football Netball Club"},{"id":"20145787","text":"Bedford County Public Schools is a school district based in Bedford, Virginia, United States.

Alternatively stated, they are a small section of the system Hilbert space where the system is decoupled from the environment and thus its evolution is completely unitary. DFSs can also be characterized as a special class of quantum error correcting codes. In this representation they are passive error-preventing codes since these subspaces are encoded with information that (possibly) won't require any active stabilization methods. These subspaces prevent destructive environmental interactions by isolating quantum information. As such, they are an important subject in quantum computing, where (coherent) control of quantum systems is the desired goal. Decoherence creates problems in this regard by causing loss of coherence between the quantum states of a system and therefore the decay of their interference terms, thus leading to loss of information from the (open) quantum system to the surrounding environment. Since quantum computers cannot be isolated from their environment (i.e. we cannot have a truly isolated quantum system in the real world) and information can be lost, the study of DFSs is important for the implementation of quantum computers into the real world. == Background  Origins === The study of DFSs began with a search for structured methods to avoid decoherence in the subject of quantum information processing (QIP). The methods involved attempts to identify particular states which have the potential of being unchanged by certain decohering processes (i.e. certain interactions with the environment). These studies started with observations made by G.M. Palma, K-A Suominen, and A.K. Ekert, who studied the consequences of pure dephasing on two qubits that have the same interaction with the environment. They found that two such qubits do not decohere. Originally the term \\"sub-decoherence\\" was used by Palma to describe this situation. Noteworthy is also independent work by Martin Plenio, Vlatko Vedral and Peter Knight who constructed an error correcting code with codewords that are invariant under a particular unitary time evolution in spontaneous emission. === Further development === Shortly afterwards, L-M Duan and G-C Guo also studied this phenomenon and reached the same conclusions as Palma, Suominen, and Ekert. However, Duan and Guo applied their own terminology, using \\"coherence preserving states\\" to describe states that do not decohere with dephasing. Duan and Guo furthered this idea of combining two qubits to preserve coherence against dephasing, to both collective dephasing and dissipation showing that decoherence is prevented in such a situation. This was shown by assuming knowledge of the system- environment coupling strength. However, such models were limited since they dealt with the decoherence processes of dephasing and dissipation solely. To deal with other types of decoherences, the previous models presented by Palma, Suominen, and Ekert, and Duan and Guo were cast into a more general setting by P. Zanardi and M. Rasetti. They expanded the existing mathematical framework to include more general system-environment interactions, such as collective decoherence-the same decoherence process acting on all the states of a quantum system and general Hamiltonians. Their analysis gave the first formal and general circumstances for the existence of decoherence-free (DF) states, which did not rely upon knowing the system-environment coupling strength. Zanardi and Rasetti called these DF states \\"error avoiding codes\\". Subsequently, Daniel A. Lidar proposed the title \\"decoherence-free subspace\\" for the space in which these DF states exist. Lidar studied the strength of DF states against perturbations and discovered that the coherence prevalent in DF states can be upset by evolution of the system Hamiltonian. This observation discerned another prerequisite for the possible use of DF states for quantum computation. A thoroughly general requirement for the existence of DF states was obtained by Lidar, D. Bacon, and K.B. Whaley expressed in terms of the Kraus operator-sum representation (OSR). Later, A. Shabani and Lidar generalized the DFS framework relaxing the requirement that the initial state needs to be a DF-state and modified some known conditions for DFS. === Recent research === A subsequent development was made in generalizing the DFS picture when E. Knill, R. Laflamme, and L. Viola introduced the concept of a \\"noiseless subsystem\\". Knill extended to higher-dimensional irreducible representations of the algebra generating the dynamical symmetry in the system-environment interaction. Earlier work on DFSs described DF states as singlets, which are one-dimensional irreducible representations. This work proved to be successful, as a result of this analysis was the lowering of the number of qubits required to build a DFS under collective decoherence from four to three. The generalization from subspaces to subsystems formed a foundation for combining most known decoherence prevention and nulling strategies. ==Conditions for the existence of decoherence-free subspacesHamiltonian formulation=== Consider an N-dimensional quantum system S coupled to a bath B and described by the combined system-bath Hamiltonian as follows: :\\\\hat{H} = \\\\hat{H}_{S}\\\\otimes\\\\hat{I}_{B} + \\\\hat{I}_{S}\\\\otimes\\\\hat{H}_{B} + \\\\hat{H}_{I} , where the interaction Hamiltonian \\\\hat{H}_{I} is given in the usual way as :\\\\hat{H}_{I} = \\\\sum_{i}\\\\hat{S}_{i}\\\\otimes\\\\hat{B}_{i}, and where \\\\hat{S}_{i}\\\\big(\\\\hat{B}_{i}\\\\big) act upon the system(bath) only, and \\\\hat{H}_{S} \\\\big(\\\\hat{H}_{B}\\\\big) is the system(bath) Hamiltonian, and \\\\hat{I}_{S}\\\\big(\\\\hat{I}_{B}\\\\big) is the identity operator acting on the system (bath). Under these conditions, the dynamical evolution within \\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{H}}_{S}\\\\subset\\\\mathcal{H}_{S}, where \\\\mathcal{H}_{S} is the system Hilbert space, is completely unitary \\\\forall\\\\phi\\\\rangle (all possible bath states) if and only if: (i) \\\\hat{S}_{i}\\\\phi\\\\rangle = s_{i}\\\\phi\\\\rangle, s_{i}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{C} for all \\\\phi\\\\rangle that span \\\\mathcal{\\\\tilde{H}}_{S} and \\\\forall\\\\hat{S}_{i}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{O}_{SB}(\\\\mathcal{H}_{SB}), the space of bounded system-bath operators on \\\\mathcal{H}_{SB}, (ii) the system and bath are not coupled at first (i.e. they can be represented as a product state), (iii) there is no \\"leakage\\" of states out of \\\\mathcal{\\\\tilde{H}}_{S}; that is, the system Hamiltonian \\\\hat{H}_{S} does not map the states \\\\phi\\\\rangle out of \\\\mathcal{\\\\tilde{H}}_{S}. In other words, if the system begins in \\\\mathcal{\\\\tilde{H}}_{S}(i.e. the system and bath are initially decoupled) and the system Hamiltonian \\\\hat{H}_{S} leaves \\\\mathcal{\\\\tilde{H}}_{S} = span\\\\big[\\\\big\\\\\\\\{\\\\phi_{k}\\\\rangle\\\\big\\\\\\\\}_{k=1}^{N}\\\\big] invariant, then \\\\mathcal{\\\\tilde{H}}_{S} is a DFS if and only if it satisfies (i). These states are degenerate eigenkets of \\\\hat{S}_{i}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{O}_{SB}(\\\\mathcal{H}_{SB}) and thus are distinguishable, hence preserving information in certain decohering processes. Any subspace of the system Hilbert space that satisfies the above conditions is a decoherence-free subspace. However, information can still \\"leak\\" out of this subspace if condition (iii) is not satisfied. Therefore, even if a DFS exists under the Hamiltonian conditions, there are still non-unitary actions that can act upon these subspaces and take states out of them into another subspace, which may or may not be a DFS, of the system Hilbert space. Operator-sum representation formulation Let \\\\mathcal{\\\\tilde{H}}_{S}\\\\subset\\\\mathcal{H}_{S} be an N-dimensional DFS, where \\\\mathcal{H}_{S} is the system's (the quantum system alone) Hilbert space. The Kraus operators when written in terms of the N basis states that span \\\\mathcal{H}_{S} are given as: :\\\\mathbf{A}_{l} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} g_{l}\\\\mathbf{\\\\tilde{U}} & \\\\mathbf{0} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{0} & \\\\mathbf{\\\\bar{A}}_{l} \\\\end{pmatrix},\\\\quad g_{l} = \\\\sqrt{a_{j}}\\\\langle k\\\\mathbf{U}_{C}j\\\\rangle where \\\\mathbf{U}_{C} = \\\\mathit{exp}\\\\big(\\\\frac{-i\\\\mathbf{H}_{C}t}{\\\\hbar}\\\\big) (\\\\mathbf{H}_{C} is the combined system-bath Hamiltonian), \\\\mathbf{\\\\tilde{U}} acts on \\\\mathcal{\\\\tilde{H}}_{S}\\\\subset\\\\mathcal{H}_{S}, and \\\\mathbf{\\\\bar{A}}_{l} is an arbitrary matrix that acts on \\\\mathcal{\\\\tilde{H}^{\\\\bot}}_{S} (the orthogonal complement to \\\\mathcal{\\\\tilde{H}}_{S}). Since \\\\mathbf{\\\\bar{A}}_{l} operates on \\\\mathcal{\\\\tilde{H}^{\\\\bot}}_{S}, then it will not create decoherence in \\\\mathcal{\\\\tilde{H}}_{S}; however, it can (possibly) create decohering effects in \\\\mathcal{\\\\tilde{H}^{\\\\bot}}_{S}. Consider the basis kets \\\\big\\\\\\\\{j\\\\rangle\\\\big\\\\\\\\}_{j=1}^{N} which span \\\\mathcal{\\\\tilde{H}}_{S} and, furthermore, they fulfill: :\\\\mathbf{\\\\bar{A}}_{l}j\\\\rangle = g_{l}\\\\mathbf{\\\\tilde{U}}j\\\\rangle,\\\\quad \\\\forall{l}. \\\\mathbf{\\\\tilde{U}} is an arbitrary unitary operator and may or may not be time-dependent, but it is independent of the indexing variable \\\\mathbf{\\\\mathit{l}}. The \\\\mathbf{\\\\mathit{g}}_{l}'s are complex constants. Since \\\\big\\\\\\\\{j\\\\rangle\\\\big\\\\\\\\}_{j=1}^{N} spans \\\\mathcal{\\\\tilde{H}}_{S}, then any pure state \\\\psi\\\\rangle\\\\in\\\\mathcal{\\\\tilde{H}}_{S} can be written as a linear combination of these basis kets: :\\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\sum_{j=1}^{N}b_{j}j\\\\rangle,\\\\quad b_{j}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{C}. This state will be decoherence-free; this can be seen by considering the action of \\\\mathbf{\\\\bar{A}}_{l} on \\\\psi\\\\rangle: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{\\\\bar{A}}_{l}\\\\psi\\\\rangle &= \\\\sum_{j=1}^{N}b_{j}(\\\\mathbf{\\\\bar{A}}_{l}j\\\\rangle)\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\sum_{j=1}^{N}b_{j}(g_{l}\\\\mathbf{\\\\tilde{U}}j\\\\rangle)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{\\\\bar{A}}_{l}\\\\psi\\\\rangle &= g_{l}\\\\mathbf{\\\\tilde{U}}\\\\psi\\\\rangle. \\\\end{align} Therefore, in terms of the density operator representation of \\\\psi\\\\rangle, \\\\rho_{initial} = \\\\psi\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\psi, the evolution of this state is: : \\\\begin{align}\\\\rho_{final} &= \\\\sum_{l}\\\\mathbf{A}_{l}\\\\rho_{initial}\\\\mathbf{A}^{\\\\dagger}_{l}\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\sum_{l}g_{l}\\\\mathbf{\\\\tilde{U}}\\\\psi\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\psih_{l}\\\\mathbf{\\\\tilde{U}}^{\\\\dagger} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\mathbf{\\\\tilde{U}}\\\\psi\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\psi\\\\mathbf{\\\\tilde{U}}^{\\\\dagger}. \\\\end{align} The above expression says that \\\\mathbf{\\\\mathit{\\\\rho}}_{final} is a pure state and that its evolution is unitary, since \\\\mathbf{\\\\tilde{U}} is unitary. Therefore, any state in \\\\mathcal{\\\\tilde{H}}_{S} will not decohere since its evolution is governed by a unitary operator and so its dynamical evolution will be completely unitary. Thus \\\\mathcal{\\\\tilde{H}}_{S} is a decoherence-free subspace. The above argument can be generalized to an initial arbitrary mixed state as well. Semigroup formulation This formulation makes use of the semigroup approach. The Lindblad decohering term determines when the dynamics of a quantum system will be unitary; in particular, when \\\\mathbf{\\\\mathit{L}}_{D}[\\\\rho] = 0, where \\\\mathbf{\\\\mathit{\\\\rho}} is the density operator representation of the state of the system, the dynamics will be decoherence-free. Let \\\\big\\\\\\\\{j\\\\rangle\\\\big\\\\\\\\}_{j=1}^{N} span \\\\mathcal{\\\\tilde{H}}_{S}\\\\subset\\\\mathcal{H}_{S}, where \\\\mathcal{H}_{S} is the system's Hilbert space. Under the assumptions that: *(i) the noise parameters of the coefficient matrix of the Lindblad decohering term are not fine-tuned (i.e. no special assumptions are made about them) *(ii) there is no dependence on the initial conditions of the initial state of the system a necessary and sufficient condition for \\\\mathcal{\\\\tilde{H}}_{S} to be a DFS is \\\\forall{j\\\\rangle}: :\\\\mathbf{F}_{\\\\alpha}j\\\\rangle = \\\\lambda_{\\\\alpha}j\\\\rangle,\\\\quad\\\\forall\\\\alpha. The above expression states that all basis states j\\\\rangle are degenerate eigenstates of the error generators \\\\big\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{F}_{\\\\alpha}\\\\big\\\\\\\\}_{\\\\alpha=1}^{M=N\\\\times{N}}. As such, their respective coherence terms do not decohere. Thus states within \\\\mathcal{\\\\tilde{H}}_{S} will remain mutually distinguishable after a decohering process since their respective eigenvalues are degenerate and hence identifiable after action under the error generators. ==DFSs as a special class of information-preserving structures (IPS) and quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs)Information-preserving structures (IPS)=== DFSs can be thought of as \\"encoding\\" information through its set of states. To see this, consider a d-dimensional open quantum system that is prepared in the state \\\\mathbf{\\\\rho} \\\\- a non-negative (i.e. its eigenvalues are positive), trace- normalized \\\\big(\\\\mathbf{\\\\mathit{Tr}}[\\\\rho]=1\\\\big), d\\\\times d density operator that belongs to the system's Hilbert–Schmidt space, the space of bounded operators on \\\\mathcal{H} \\\\big(\\\\mathcal{B(\\\\mathcal{H})}\\\\big). Suppose that this density operator(state) is selected from a set of states S = \\\\big\\\\\\\\{\\\\rho_{i}\\\\big\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^{n}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{\\\\tilde{H}}_{S}, a DFS of \\\\mathcal{H}_{S} (the system's Hilbert space) and where \\\\mathbf{\\\\mathit{n}}<\\\\mathbf{\\\\mathit{d}}. This set of states is called a code, because the states within this set encode particular kind of information; that is, the set S encodes information through its states. This information that is contained within \\\\mathbf{\\\\mathit{S}} must be able to be accessed; since the information is encoded in the states in \\\\mathbf{\\\\mathit{S}}, these states must be distinguishable to some process, \\\\mathbf{\\\\zeta} say, that attempts to acquire the information. Therefore, for two states \\\\mathbf{\\\\rho}_{i},\\\\mathbf{\\\\rho}_{j}\\\\in\\\\mathit{S} \\\\big(i e j\\\\big), the process \\\\mathbf{\\\\zeta} is information preserving for these states if the states \\\\mathbf{\\\\rho}_{i},\\\\mathbf{\\\\rho}_{j} remain as distinguishable after the process as they were before it. Stated in a more general manner, a code \\\\mathbf{\\\\mathit{S}} (or DFS) is preserved by a process \\\\mathbf{\\\\zeta} iff each pair of states \\\\mathbf{\\\\rho}_{i},\\\\mathbf{\\\\rho}_{j}\\\\in\\\\mathit{S} is as distinguishable after \\\\mathbf{\\\\zeta} is applied as they were before it was applied. A more practical description would be: \\\\mathbf{\\\\mathit{S}} is preserved by a process \\\\mathbf{\\\\zeta} if and only if \\\\forall\\\\mathbf{\\\\rho,\\\\rho'}\\\\in\\\\mathit{S} and \\\\mathit{x}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{+} :\\\\big\\\\\\\\mathbf{\\\\zeta}\\\\big(\\\\mathbf{\\\\rho}-\\\\mathit{x}\\\\mathbf{\\\\rho'}\\\\big)\\\\big\\\\_{1} = \\\\big\\\\\\\\mathbf{\\\\rho}-\\\\mathit{x}\\\\mathbf{\\\\rho'}\\\\big\\\\_{1}. This just says that \\\\mathbf{\\\\zeta} is a 1:1 trace-distance-preserving map on \\\\mathbf{\\\\mathit{S}}. In this picture DFSs are sets of states (codes rather) whose mutual distinguishability is unaffected by a process \\\\mathbf{\\\\zeta}. ===Quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs)=== Since DFSs can encode information through their sets of states, then they are secure against errors (decohering processes). In this way DFSs can be looked at as a special class of QECCs, where information is encoded into states which can be disturbed by an interaction with the environment but retrieved by some reversal process. Consider a code C = \\\\operatorname{span}\\\\big[\\\\big\\\\\\\\{j_{k}\\\\rangle\\\\big\\\\\\\\}\\\\big], which is a subspace of the system Hilbert space, with encoded information given by \\\\big\\\\\\\\{j_{k}\\\\rangle\\\\big\\\\\\\\} (i.e. the \\"codewords\\"). This code can be implemented to protect against decoherence and thus prevent loss of information in a small section of the system's Hilbert space. The errors are caused by interaction of the system with the environment (bath) and are represented by the Kraus operators. After the system has interacted with the bath, the information contained within \\\\mathbf{\\\\mathit{C}} must be able to be \\"decoded\\"; therefore, to retrieve this information a recovery operator \\\\mathbf{R} is introduced. So a QECC is a subspace \\\\mathbf{\\\\mathit{C}} along with a set of recovery operators \\\\big\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{R}_{r}\\\\big\\\\\\\\}. Let \\\\mathbf{\\\\mathit{C}} be a QECC for the error operators represented by the Kraus operators \\\\big\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{A}_{l}\\\\big\\\\\\\\}, with recovery operators \\\\big\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{R}_{r}\\\\big\\\\\\\\}. Then \\\\mathbf{\\\\mathit{C}} is a DFS if and only if upon restriction to \\\\mathbf{\\\\mathit{C}}, then \\\\mathbf{R}_{r}\\\\propto\\\\mathbf{\\\\tilde{U}}_{S}^{\\\\dagger}, \\\\forall{r}, where \\\\mathbf{\\\\tilde{U}}_{S}^{\\\\dagger} is the inverse of the system evolution operator. In this picture of reversal of quantum operations, DFSs are a special instance of the more general QECCs whereupon restriction to a given a code, the recovery operators become proportional to the inverse of the system evolution operator, hence allowing for unitary evolution of the system. Notice that the subtle difference between these two formulations exists in the two words preserving and correcting; in the former case, error-prevention is the method used whereas in the latter case it is error-correction. Thus the two formulations differ in that one is a passive method and the other is an active method. ==Example of a decoherence-free subspaceCollective dephasing=== Consider a two-qubit Hilbert space, spanned by the basis qubits \\\\big\\\\\\\\{0\\\\rangle_{1}\\\\otimes0\\\\rangle_{2}, 0\\\\rangle_{1}\\\\otimes1\\\\rangle_{2}, 1\\\\rangle_{1}\\\\otimes0\\\\rangle_{2}, 1\\\\rangle_{1}\\\\otimes1\\\\rangle_{2}\\\\big\\\\\\\\} which undergo collective dephasing. A random phase \\\\mathbf{\\\\mathit{\\\\phi}} will be created between these basis qubits; therefore, the qubits will transform in the following way: : \\\\begin{align}0\\\\rangle_{1}\\\\otimes0\\\\rangle_{2} & \\\\longrightarrow 0\\\\rangle_{1}\\\\otimes0\\\\rangle_{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0\\\\rangle_{1}\\\\otimes1\\\\rangle_{2} & \\\\longrightarrow e^{i\\\\phi}0\\\\rangle_{1}\\\\otimes1\\\\rangle_{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1\\\\rangle_{1}\\\\otimes0\\\\rangle_{2} & \\\\longrightarrow e^{i\\\\phi}1\\\\rangle_{1}\\\\otimes0\\\\rangle_{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1\\\\rangle_{1}\\\\otimes1\\\\rangle_{2} & \\\\longrightarrow e^{2i\\\\phi}1\\\\rangle_{1}\\\\otimes1\\\\rangle_{2}. \\\\end{align} Under this transformation the basis states 0\\\\rangle_{1}\\\\otimes1\\\\rangle_{2}, 1\\\\rangle_{1}\\\\otimes0\\\\rangle_{2} obtain the same phase factor \\\\mathbf{\\\\mathit{e}}^{i\\\\phi}. Thus in consideration of this, a state \\\\psi\\\\rangle can be encoded with this information (i.e. the phase factor) and thus evolve unitarily under this dephasing process, by defining the following encoded qubits: : \\\\begin{align} 0_{E}\\\\rangle &= 0\\\\rangle_{1}\\\\otimes1\\\\rangle_{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1_{E}\\\\rangle &= 1\\\\rangle_{1}\\\\otimes0\\\\rangle_{2} \\\\end{align}. Since these are basis qubits, then any state can be written as a linear combination of these states; therefore, :\\\\psi_{E}\\\\rangle = l0_{E}\\\\rangle + m1_{E}\\\\rangle,\\\\quad l,m\\\\in\\\\mathbb{C}. This state will evolve under the dephasing process as: :\\\\psi_{E}\\\\rangle\\\\longrightarrow l0\\\\rangle_{1}\\\\otimes e^{i\\\\phi}1\\\\rangle_{2} + e^{i\\\\phi}m1\\\\rangle_{1}\\\\otimes0\\\\rangle_{2} = e^{i\\\\phi}\\\\psi_{E}\\\\rangle. However, the overall phase for a quantum state is unobservable and, as such, is irrelevant in the description of the state. Therefore, \\\\psi_{E}\\\\rangle remains invariant under this dephasing process and hence the basis set \\\\big\\\\\\\\{0\\\\rangle_{1}\\\\otimes1\\\\rangle_{2}, 1\\\\rangle_{1}\\\\otimes0\\\\rangle_{2}\\\\big\\\\\\\\} is a decoherence-free subspace of the 4-dimensional Hilbert space. Similarly, the subspaces \\\\big\\\\\\\\{0\\\\rangle_{1}\\\\otimes0\\\\rangle_{2}\\\\big\\\\\\\\}, \\\\big\\\\\\\\{1\\\\rangle_{1}\\\\otimes1\\\\rangle_{2}\\\\big\\\\\\\\} are also DFSs. ==Alternative: decoherence-free subsystems== Consider a quantum system with an N-dimensional system Hilbert space \\\\mathcal{H}_{C} that has a general subsystem decomposition \\\\mathcal{H}_{C} = \\\\oplus_{j=1}^{N}(\\\\otimes_{i=1}^{l_{N}}\\\\mathcal{H}_{ji}). The subsystem \\\\mathcal{H}_{ji} is a decoherence-free subsystem with respect to a system- environment coupling if every pure state in \\\\mathcal{H}_{ji} remains unchanged with respect to this subsystem under the OSR evolution. This is true for any possible initial condition of the environment. To understand the difference between a decoherence-free subspace and a decoherence-free subsystem, consider encoding a single qubit of information into a two-qubit system. This two-qubit system has a 4-dimensional Hilbert space; one method of encoding a single qubit into this space is by encoding information into a subspace that is spanned by two orthogonal qubits of the 4-dimensional Hilbert space. Suppose information is encoded in the orthogonal state \\\\alpha0\\\\rangle + \\\\beta1\\\\rangle in the following way: :\\\\alpha0\\\\rangle_{1} + \\\\beta1\\\\rangle_{2}\\\\longrightarrow \\\\alpha0\\\\rangle_{1}\\\\otimes1\\\\rangle_{2} + \\\\beta1\\\\rangle_{1}\\\\otimes0\\\\rangle_{2}. This shows that information has been encoded into a subspace of the two-qubit Hilbert space. Another way of encoding the same information is to encode only one of the qubits of the two qubits. Suppose the first qubit is encoded, then the state of the second qubit is completely arbitrary since: :\\\\alpha0\\\\rangle_{1} + \\\\beta1\\\\rangle_{2}\\\\longrightarrow \\\\big(\\\\alpha0\\\\rangle_{1} + \\\\beta1\\\\rangle_{2}\\\\big)\\\\otimes\\\\psi\\\\rangle. This mapping is a one-to-many mapping from the one qubit encoding information to a two-qubit Hilbert space. Instead, if the mapping is to \\\\psi\\\\rangle, then it is identical to a mapping from a qubit to a subspace of the two-qubit Hilbert space. ==See also== * Quantum decoherence * Quantum measurement ==References== Category:Quantum measurement Category:Quantum information science ","title":"Decoherence-free subspaces"},{"id":"20145877","text":"The Johannite Church, properly known by its full name, l'Église Johannite des Chrétiens Primitifs (The Johannite Church of Primitive Christians), is a Gnostic Christian denomination founded by the French priest Bernard-Raymond Fabré-Palaprat in 1804.\\"The Gnostics: History, Tradition, Scriptures, Influence\\" by Andrew Phillip Smith, Watkins, 2008 Hermetic.com The Johannite Church received its full name in 1828 after Fabré-Palaprat's claimed discovery of the Levitikon gospels.Rev.

He was the founder of the Riverina Movement, which advocated for the separation of his native Riverina region from the state of New South Wales. ==Early life== Born in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, he was educated at Geelong Grammar School before serving in the military 1917–1919. He returned to become a manufacturer of building supplies, and was a leader of the Riverina new state movement. ==Senate== In 1931, he was elected to the Australian Senate for New South Wales as a member of the Country Party, taking his seat in 1932. He did not regularly attend the Senate chamber and described it as \\"simply an echo of city interests that have more than their fair share of representation\\". In October 1935, Hardy was elected as the Country Party's Senate leader. His elevation to the position was opposed by Western Australian senators William Carroll and Bertie Johnston; Carroll had previously served as the party's de facto leader. Johnston contested the leadership ballot against Hardy, but was unsuccessful and subsequently left the party to sit as an independent. Hardy failed to win re- election at the 1937 election, with his term concluding on 30 June 1938. ==Later life== Having left politics, he became a co-ordinator of works with the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). In May 1941, Hardy was appointed as a business liaison officer to the Department of Air, working in an honorary capacity and supervising construction expenditure. Two weeks before his death, he was seconded to the Department of Defence Co-ordination. ===Death=== Hardy and two others were killed when an Airlines of Australia charter flight crashed in Far North Queensland on 27 August 1941. The other victims were the pilot Frank Cohen and Lieutenant-Colonel Ramsay Miller, a director of works with the Australian Army. Hardy and Miller were returning from a trip to Thursday Island in the Torres Strait. Their de Havilland Puss Moth was en route to Cairns when it crashed into a bank of the Coen River outside of the township of Coen. Eyewitnesses reported the plane veering out of control before bursting into flames in mid-air. Hardy's body was recovered some distance from the wreckage. Hardy's body was brought to Sydney and cremated at the Northern Suburbs Crematorium. A memorial service was held on 31 August at St Alban's Church, Lindfield, with Prime Minister Arthur Fadden in attendance. ==References== Category:National Party of Australia members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Australian Senate for New South Wales Category:Members of the Australian Senate Category:1898 births Category:1941 deaths Category:20th-century Australian politicians Category:People educated at Geelong Grammar School Category:People from Wagga Wagga Category:Victims of aviation accidents or incidents in 1941 Category:Victims of aviation accidents or incidents in Australia Category:Accidental deaths in Queensland Category:Royal Australian Air Force personnel of World War II Category:Australian military personnel killed in World War II ","title":"Charles Hardy (Australian politician)"},{"id":"20145899","text":"Glycerol phosphate may refer to: * Glycerol 1-phosphate * Glycerol 2-phosphate * Glycerol 3-phosphate ","title":"Glycerol phosphate"},{"id":"20145909","text":"Brad W.

He studied at the diocesan seminary and was ordained a priest. Leaving the priesthood, he studied medicine in Montpellier and Caen, where he received his medical degree on 12 April 1798. Moving to Paris the same year, he obtained another medical degree on 16 September 1803, and became the director general of the Société médico-philantropique. ==Order of the Temple== On 4 November 1804 Fabré-Palaprat founded the Order of the Temple Emmanuel Rebold, A General History of Free-masonry In Europe: Based upon The Ancient Documents relating to, and the Monuments erected by this Fraternity from its foundation in the Year 715 B.C. to the present time, page 225 (Cincinnati: American Masonic Publishing Association, 1869). and revealed the existence of the Larmenius Charter (or \\"Charter of Transmission\\"). Knights of the Order were always addressed as \\"Sir Knights\\".Charles William Heckethorn, The Secret Societies of All Ages & Countries, Volume 2, pages 48-50 (Cosimo Inc., 2005; originally published in 1875). The Grand Master of the Order was addressed as \\"Most Eminent Highness, Very Great, Powerful, and Excellent Prince, and Most Serene Lord.\\"E. R. Johnston, Masonry Defined: A Liberal Masonic Education that Every Mason Should Have. Compiled from the Writings of Albert G. Mackey and Many Other Eminent Authorities, Part 2, page 842 (Kessinger Publishing, LLC, 2010, originally published in 1930). The Larmenius Charter, allegedly written in Latin in 1324, listed 22 successive Grand Masters of the Knights Templar from 1324 to 1804, Fabré-Palaprat's name appearing last on the list. The Charter is named after Johannes Marcus Larmenius, who allegedly wrote the document and was allegedly appointed Grand Master by Jacques de Molay while imprisoned, also having the power to appoint his successor (Thomas Theobaldus Alexandrinus in 1324; the first name on the list). The list of Grand Masters in the Larmenius Charter differs from the list of 'Scottish' Grand Masters given by the German Strict Observance, and the Larmenius Charter also anathematized the 'Scottish' Templars,Peter Partner, The Murdered Magicians: The Templars and Their Myth, page 135 (Barnes & Noble books, 1993). who were excommunicated by Johannes Marcus Larmenius in 1324, who declared them \\"Deserters of The Temple\\".Manual of The Knights of the Order of The Temple, page 11, Translated by Henry Lucas (Liverpool: David Marples, 1830) Fabré-Palaprat's Order of the Temple claimed to possess significant relics: the sword of Jacques de Molay, the helmet of Guy Dauphin d'Auvergne, the Beausant, and four fragments of burnt bones taken from the funeral pyre where Jacques de Molay had been executed.George Kenning, Kenning's Masonic Encyclopedia and Handbook of Masonic Archeology, History and Biography, pages 108-109 (Kessinger Publishing, LLC, 2003; originally published in 1878). These relics, described as \\"The Sacred Treasure of The Order of The Temple\\" in the Manual of the order (and described within an Inventory in the Statutes of the order),Manual of The Knights of the Order of The Temple, page 34, and pages 45-47. Translated by Henry Lucas (Liverpool: David Marples, 1830) were displayed in March 1808 on the anniversary of Jacques de Molay's death, when members of the Order celebrated a public requiem for the 'martyred' Grand Master in the Church of St. Paul in Paris.Partner, page 136. ==Johannite Church== In 1812 Fabré-Palaprat formed the Johannite Church, introducing faith-based elements into his order. He later ordained Ferdinand-François Châtel, a radical clergyman who left the priesthood following the July Revolution, as Primate of the Johannite church, on 4 May 1831.José Orval, Une Histoire Humaine de la Franc-Maçonnerie Spéculative, page 192 (Liége: Céfal, 2006). Châtel established his new French Catholic Church (Eglise Catholique Française) in former shop premises in Montmartre, decorating it with the bust of Louis Philippe I placed under the Tricolour flag. The Johannite church was located in a former bottle shop in the Cour des miracles, dubbed the \\"Apostolic Court of the Temple\\". The Order dated its documents from 'Magistropolis', a mystical calendar commencing from the foundation of the Knights Templar in 1118.Partner, page 148. In 1831, following the July Revolution, Fabré-Palaprat published the Evangelikon, a Gnostic version of the Gospel of John that omits intra-textual commentary and the Resurrection narrative, preceded by an introduction and a commentary allegedly written by Nicephorus, a Greek monk of Athens, that carries the name Lévitikon. The Lévitikon contains an esoteric lineage from Jesus to the Knights Templar, and hints that Jesus was an initiate of the mysteries of Osiris, which were passed on to John the Beloved. Fabré-Palaprat claimed to have bought this vellum manuscript (allegedly dating from the 15th century), from a Paris second-hand bookstall on New Year's Day in 1814. It was translated into English for the first time in 2010.Rev. Donald Donato, The Lévitikon: The Gospels According To The Primitive Church (Apostolic Johannite Church, 2010). Neo-Templar orders that claim descent from the Larmenius Charter support the assertions of the Lévitikon.Chevalier Emerys, Revelation of The Holy Grail, page 175 (Timothy W. Hogan, 2007). Fabré-Palaprat introduced a Johannite Mass in 1834. The title \\"Christ\\" was reserved not just for Jesus but used for all leaders of the Johannite tradition who had attained Gnosis. In 1836 a schism, led by the Duc de Choiseul resulted out of dissatisfaction with the new Johannite church that had replaced the previous chivalric-style order. Fabré-Palaprat responded by admitting Sir Sidney Smith to the Johannite church.Partner, page 149. The Duc de Choiseul was later elected Grand Master of the Order of the Temple in 1838, dying the same year.Nicolaus C. Heutger, Die Tempelherren einst und heute: Zum 50. Jubiläum der Reaktivierung des Tempelherren-Ordens in Deutschland, page 174 (Berlin: Lukas Verlag, 2007). List of Grand Masters of the Order of the Temple Sir Sidney Smith was invited to take over as Grand Master of the Order, an offer he declined, but consented to preside over as Regent until a successor to Fabré-Palaprat had been chosen (which did not happen during his lifetime).William White, Notes and Queries: Second Series, Volume First, January - June, 1856, page 461 (London: Bell & Daldy, 1856). ==Distinctions== Fabré-Palaprat was awarded the Legion of Honour for his defence of Paris in 1814, and received the July Medal for his actions during the Three Glorious Days of the Revolution of 1830.Anna Klumpke, Rosa Bonheur: The Artist's (Auto)biography, page 108 (University of Michigan Press, 2003). \\"Memoir of the Late M. Bernard Raymond Fabré-Palaprat, Grand Master of the Order of the Temple\\" was published by Robert Bigsby the Younger, in The Miscellaneous Poems and Essays of Robert Bigsby (London: Whittaker And Co., 1842). ==Aftermath== The Regency of the Order of the Temple was at one stage passed on to Joséphin Péladan, later becoming amalgamated among other occult groups headed by Papus, finally becoming legally incorporated by a Belgian group known as the Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem (SMOTJ),Massimo Introvigne, \\"Ordeal by Fire: The Tragedy of the Solar Temple\\", pages 22-23 in James R. Lewis, The Order of The Solar Temple: The Temple of Death (Ashgate Publishing Ltd., 2006). as well as the Sovereign Order of the Initiatory Temple (OSTI), and its outer order known as International Circle for Cultural and Scientific Research (CIRCES International), with CIRCES being created by Raymond Bernard in 1988. Raymond Bernard describes his initiation into the OSTI in 1955, and the mission he was charged with for bringing OSTI public, in his 1966 book entitled A Secret Meeting In Rome. Raymond Bernard created CIRCES International as an outward Templar vehicle to eventually prepare people for initiation into the inner Order of the OSTI. CIRCES International also continues to protect and perpetuate L'Ordre Martiniste of Papus, which Joseph Péladan had been initiated into.Carlson Anyangwe, Imperialistic Politics In Cameroun: Resistance & The Inception of The Restoration of the Statehood of Southern Cameroons, page 122 (Langaa Research & Publishing Common Initiative Group, 2008). Massimo Introvigne claimed Raymond Bernard asked Julien Origas (1920-1983) to establish an OSTI chapter in 1971, that remained largely dormant until it was revived by Bernard in 1988.

It was reauthorized in March 2020 in reaction to the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the 2020 stock market crash. ==First iteration (2008-2010) == The CPFF was created on October 27, 2008 and funded a special purpose vehicle (SPV) that purchased three-month unsecured and asset-backed commercial paper (CP) from eligible issuers. This resulted in greater availability of credit for firms doing business. It worked under the aegis of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York where the NY Fed finances the purchase of highly rated unsecured and asset- backed commercial paper from eligible issuers via eligible primary dealers. The facility expired February 1, 2010. The final CP purchased matured on April 26, 2010. All CP notes purchased were repaid in full. === Explanation === The CPFF began operations on October 27, 2008 following the collapse of Lehman Brothers and government bailout of AIG and the global credit freeze that ensued. The CPFF method of short-term funding provided liquidity to U.S. issuers of commercial paper through a special purpose vehicle, aka SPV, which bought unsecured and asset-backed commercial paper for 3-month period from eligible issuers with funds made available by the NY Fed. The commercial paper remained in the custody of the SPV till the CP matured. On maturity, the proceeds from commercial paper and other assets were used to repay the loan that was originally taken from the NY Fed. All purchases of the Commercial Papers by the SPV was done through the New York Fed’s primary dealers. This program lent out a total $738 billion before it was closed. 45 out 81 of the companies participating in this program were foreign firms. Research shows that Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) recipients were twice as likely to participate in the program than other commercial paper issuers who did not take advantage of the TARP bailout. The Fed incurred no losses from the CPFF. This program was created at the same time that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation implemented the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program to increase liquidity in inter-bank lending. === Eligibility === Only \\"Active\\" U.S. issuers of commercial paper (including those with a foreign parent), were eligible to sell commercial paper to the SPV. Active was defined as having at least three consecutive months of commercial paper outstanding during the period starting January 1, 2008 through August 31, 2008. The commercial paper had to be rated at least A-1/P-1/F1 by a major nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) and, if rated by multiple major NRSROs, must have been rated at least A-1/P-1/F1 by two or more major NRSROs. As part of the application process to be eligible for this program issuers had to pay a 10 basis point (0.1%) fee based on their maximum CP balance during the active period mentioned above. ==Second iteration (2020- ) == On 17 March 2020, following a global stock market crash and Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war, and in light of a corporate debt bubble and wider financial turmoil resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Fed announced that they would utilize the CPFF. The U.S. Treasury Department authorized $10 billion to backstop any losses incurred by the Fed using the Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund. ==See also== * Federal Reserve System == References  External links == * Commercial Paper Funding Facility (2008) Category:2008 in economics Category:Federal Reserve System Category:Great Recession in the United States ","title":"Commercial Paper Funding Facility"},{"id":"20146155","text":"John E. Derhak (born 1957) is a Canadian-born, American novelist, writer, and historian. His works of fiction include, , Chill Your Cockles, The Bones of Lazarus, and The Guardian Angel of Death. His first novel, (2007), tells the story of a humble, yet bungling innkeeper, \\"brother John,\\" as he manages a small town inn, the Hotel, in a place called the Lost Kingdom of Moose Harbor, on the coast of rural Maine. The book is noted for its humor, character development, and storytelling. The book was optioned to Signet Entertainment, a division of Signet International Holdings, Inc., in 2007. Chill Your Cockles (2008), his second book, follows a storyline from his first work, and is a collection of mysterious and haunting tales that serve to further the histories, and add layers to, the fantastic legends and characters that inhabit the Lost Kingdom of Moose Harbor, Maine. The Bones of Lazarus (2012), is a supernatural thriller that traces intersecting lives on a war-torn, resource rich, Caribbean island. The plot revolves around the premise that Lazarus of Bethany, the man resurrected by the hand of Christ, became an immortal creature of Judgment, seeking the hearts and souls of the wicked. Other themes explored by Derhak include political and social manipulation, terrorism, arms proliferation, the selling of news as entertainment, greed, plunder of natural resources, and religion. The novel is based on a short work that originally appeared in Chill Your Cockles. The Guardian Angel of Death (2017) is a prequel to Derhak's first novel, Set on Halloween day, 1932, in rural Maine, the novel expands on a story from Tales, told by the fabled baseball-playing, , Porter Gibson 'Digit.'

Much like her award-winning novel, Bastard Out of Carolina, Cavedweller deals with domestic violence, friendship among women, mother- daughter bonds, and poverty in the small-town South. Although the point of view shifts throughout the novel, the story is told primarily from the perspective of Delia Byrd. ==Plot== Delia Byrd is a native of Cayro, Georgia and a recovering alcoholic who lives in Los Angeles with her surly ten-year- old daughter, Cissy. The former lead singer of the obscure blues-rock band Mud Dog, Delia is supported primarily by Randall Pritchard, Cissy's father and a member of Mud Dog. The novel opens with Randall being killed in a motorcycle accident. Grief-stricken, nearly penniless, and desperate to reconcile with the daughters she left behind in Georgia, Delia packs up her daughter and drives nearly non-stop cross-country. When she arrives in Cayro, she is confronted by townspeople who think she is a \\"hussy\\" for having left her two daughters despite being aware of the fact that Delia's husband was often abusive toward her. After a disappointing reunion with the grandfather who raised her, Delia enrolls Cissy at the local school, gets a job as a cleaning woman and sinks into a deep depression. After emerging from the depression, Delia embarks on a quest to regain custody of her now-pubescent daughters, Amanda and Dede, from their hateful and puritanical paternal grandmother. She enlists the aid of the preacher at her mother-in-law's church. Despite the fact that the minister is able to convince the grandmother to consent to visits, Grandma Windsor does not keep her side of the bargain. Desperate, Delia approaches the girls' father, Clint, and makes a deal with him. Clint, who is gravely ill with cancer, agrees to transfer legal custody of the girls to Delia if she moves into his house and cares for him as he is unwilling to spend his last days in a hospital. After thoroughly cleaning the house, Delia moves all three girls in. Things between Delia and her daughters are tense at first. Fourteen-year-old Amanda is as rigid and religion obsessed as her grandmother, frequently telling Cissy that she is going to hell. Dede is a sexually precocious twelve-year-old who likes to smoke cigarettes. They initially ignore their younger sister and her mother. The two older girls also hate their father, remembering the times that he assaulted his parents. Cissy, unable to get along with any of her female relatives, takes pity on the bedridden Clint. She begins reading to him. Eventually, Clint begins to tell her about the early days of his marriage to Delia, expressing remorse about the violence he subjected her to. After Clint dies, Cissy and Dede form a tight bond. However, Amanda remains intractable, frequently arguing with her mother and sisters. Amanda goes on to marry an aspiring preacher and gives birth to two sons in short order. After undergoing a procedure to remove gallstones, Amanda suffers a minor nervous collapse and begins rethinking her previous religiosity. Cissy, who has had problems fitting in at school, develops an abiding friendship with Nolan, a classmate who shares her passion for science fiction novels. Nolan eventually introduces Cissy to spelunking and falls madly in love with Dede, who scorns his advances. Dede, who has several brushes with the law and briefly battles drug addiction, eventually gets a job managing the convenience store. After Nolan rescues Dede from a gun-toting ex-boyfriend, the two embark on a passionate love affair. Cissy begins making plans to return to Los Angeles to study at UCLA. This leaves the forty-something Delia at loose ends as the two older girls have already left home. She has broken up with Cayro's deputy sheriff and has no romantic prospects.

The New York Times wrote, \\"This is not a novel interested in formal invention, in ironic distance or even in elegant prose...It is clear-eyed about the economic forces that shape these women's lives, but it is also unabashedly emotional and hopeful about their futures. It reaches back to the conventions of straightforward storytelling and pays close attention to the way women get by, the way they come to forgive one another, the way they choose who they will be.\\" https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/15/reviews/980315.15sayrest.html Time Magazine noted that \\"the central story of mother and daughter runs true, both on and beneath the surface.\\" http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,988130,00.html The book made the Los Angeles Times Bestsellers List in 1998. ==Bibliography== Allison, Dorothy.

The bridge is located in Lockport Township. The road to get to the bridge borders on the east line of Lockport and Nottawa townships. The bridge crosses the St. Joseph River. The current bridge and causeway opened in 1887. The bridge and causeway make up Covered Bridge Road. ==History== The bridge is not the first bridge to span this section of the St. Joseph River. In 1887 a swollen St. Joseph River swept away that bridge that was about two blocks from the current bridge location. The current bridge was constructed in 1887 by nearby Parkville builder Pierce Bodmer. Both Lockport and Nottawa Township commissioned the bridge which cost about $3,000. The bridge is named for Thomas W. Langley and family, pioneers who helped establish the village of Centreville in the mid-19th century. In fact, Langley was the very first settler in Centreville. ===Restoration work=== In the 1940s, as motor vehicle traffic started to replace the horse and buggy and foot traffic, the added weight and vibration started to cause damage to the bridge and abutments and required repair. \\"The road commission was flooded with requests from all parts of the state and surrounding states to do everything possible to keep the covered bridge intact.\\" The Elkhart Bridge and Iron Works was awarded the contract to fix the bridge. The 1950-51 project was to give the bridge a new under structure at a cost of $35,885. In September 1950 the bridge was closed to traffic so work could begin and did not reopen till August 1951. During the closure \\"All the load carrying elements of the bridge were changed from wood to steel or concrete. The old flooring was replaced with two by fours creosoted.\\" When the bridge was again in need of major repair, the St. Joseph County Road Commission hired Anlaan Corporation to perform the restoration work. All of the siding was removed from the bridge and the roof was replaced. The asphalt that had been added to road decking was removed and returned to wood planking. The cost of the 2008-09 repair was almost $1 million. During this Restoration project two Height Restrictor portal frames and signs were added. ===Replacement=== In 1964 the bridge became the center of controversy when the then county road official wanted to widen the road between Centreville and Vicksburg. ==Tourism== Many of the covered bridges in Michigan and other states no longer exist, and therefore the structure is a historic For almost 130 years the covered bridge has been a scenic point for travelers, artist photographers hoping to capture the changing shadows of the bridge. The bridge draws history and bridge buffs see the longest covered bridge in Michigan. Another reason people come to the bridge is to fish from inside the bridge. ==Facts and figures== The bridge spans across the river, it is made up of three spans and is made of the Howe truss construction. Its frame and timbers are constructed of White pine. The original bridge section are made from three sections which are joined together to form the length of the bridge. They measure wide by high. The original bridge's planking and decking rests on 40 beams that measure by by long. It is estimated on average that 1,700 vehicles a day use the bridge. During the 2008–09 project on the bridge, two Heigh restrictor portal frames and signs were add at the cost of $20,000 each for a total $40,000 to help protect the bridge. When the Sturgis Dam was installed the bridge had to be raised . In a two-year period, 1950–51, the St. Joseph County Road commission undertook work to help preserve the bridge for use by future generations. To accomplish this the old foundation timbers had to be replaced by wood reinforced with steel beams. The cost of the repair was almost $36,000 (equivalent to $ in ). There are three main restrictions on the bridge. There is a weight limitation, a height restriction, and there is a limit on how wide vehicles can be. There are many warning signs leading up to the bridge to warn of the restrictions. The Saint Joseph County Road Commission has attempted some creative ways to stop people from damaging the bridge. Despite the signs, people have hit the metal sign and damaged it beyond repair in 2016. The sign was replaced. ==Other events== The bridge has been a very important symbol for the village of Centreville for almost 100 years. Since 1975 the village's annual summer festival is called Covered Bridge Days. A local newspaper that operated in 1960 used the sketch of the bridge as its logo at different times. The Three Rivers Chamber of Commerce hosted what was billed a once-in-a- lifetime event, where the bridge was closed to host a charity dinner. The event was done in coordination with the county road commission that had some planned deck work on the bridge. ==Photo gallery== File:2016-09-12 Centreville Mich Covered Bridge From Air.jpg  Aerial photo taken from drone File: 2016-09-12 Centreville Mich Covered Bridge South.jpg  Aerial photo taken from drone of sign protecting bridge from oversize vehicles File: 2016-09-12 Langley Covered Bridge Inside.jpgA picture showing the inside of the covered bridge from an angle to show decking and road bed File: 2016-09-12 Langley Bridge Howe Truss.jpgA view of the Howe Truss System spanning the of the bridge File: 2016-09-12 Centreville Mich Covered Bridge MHS Plaque.jpgA photo of the Michigan Historical Marker placed on the bridge ==See also== * * * ==References * Category:Buildings and structures in St. Joseph County, Michigan Category:Bridges completed in 1887 Category:Covered bridges in Michigan Category:Wooden bridges in Michigan Category:Tourist attractions in St. Joseph County, Michigan Category:Howe truss bridges in the United States Category:Road bridges in Michigan ","title":"Langley Covered Bridge"},{"id":"20146276","text":"Stanley Kerin Amour (2 April 1900 – 29 November 1979) was an Australian politician.

Yuan Haowen was the outstanding literary figure of his period, in northern China, excelling at various genres of both prose and poetry:Davis, xxviii his ci poetry is said to be some of the best of the Jin period writers. Just a few of his sanqu lyrics have survived. Yuan Haowen was born in the territory of the Jurchen Jin dynasty, in what is now northern China, and which was co-existent with the Chinese Southern Song Dynasty. ==Biography== Yuan Haowen's ancestors were of non-Chinese origins who changed their surname to Yuan. His father experienced disappointments in life and later led a secluded existence. However he passed on his taste for literature to his son. An uncle who was a government official took the young Yuan along on his official journeys, thus introducing him to some well known places and scenery. He could compose poetry by the age of seven leading people to refer to him as a child prodigy. His uncle also saw to it that he studied with the best teachers. He prospered. Born at the height of the Jin dynasty (1115–1234), he experienced the social unrest and war at the decline of the dynasty. He fled to Henan with his mother when the Jin regime moved their capital. He had served the Jin in a variety of posts, but when the Jin dynasty gave way in favor of the Mongol Yuan Dynasty he no longer sought official appointments and went into retirement.

The company was established by Jeff Bartel, snowboarding photographer Trevor Graves, and Chris Hotz in 1999, after they were laid off at Morrow Snowboards following its acquisition by K2 Skis. Bartel, formerly Morrow's art director, is a longtime graphic designer for snowboards. The trio named the company \\"Nemo\\", which means \\"no one\\" in Latin, because they wanted a more collective culture and thought using their surnames would give the unwanted impression of a law firm. According to Transworld Skateboarding, \\"[Nemo's] curiosity and desire to create has pushed them to bridge the gap between print, product graphics, consulting, packaging, motion graphics, photography, and web design.\\" The company has been located at 1875 Southeast Belmont Street, in Portland's Buckman neighborhood, since c. 2004. In 2008, the agency brought on Mark Lewman as a partner and creative director. Hotz left Nemo in the early 2010s, leaving Bartel, Graves, and Lewman as the three principals. Bartel and Graves continue to serve as executive art director and president, respectively.

He was an Australian Labor Party member of the Australian Senate for New South Wales from 1940 to 1967. Arnold was born at Wallaroo Mines in South Australia and was educated at St Joseph's School in Kadina and Christian Brothers College in Adelaide. He worked as private secretary to the managing director of an insurance company and then for a motor firm. Arnold then moved to Sydney 1928 to become a probationary firefighter, later moving to Newcastle 1930, where he was assigned to the Newcastle East Fire Brigade. He studied accountancy alongside his work there, and qualified as an accountant in 1937, but remained a firefighter until his election to parliament. Arnold was president of the Newcastle Fire Brigades Association, a delegate to the Newcastle Trade Hall Council, secretary of the Newcastle Workers' Educational Association, a member of the Newcastle School of Arts Committee, secretary of the Newcastle branch of the Labor Party, president of the party's Newcastle state assembly and secretary of its Newcastle regional assembly. He was a fellow of the Federal Institute of Accounts and the Chartered Institute of Secretaries. Arnold was elected to the Senate at the 1940 federal election, and was re-elected four times. He was temporary chairman of committees from 1941 to 1951, was an assistant to Minister for the Navy and Munitions Norman Makin during World War II and after the war was deputy chairman of the Australian Shipbuilding Board and the parliamentary representative on the Commonwealth Council of National Fitness. In 1957, he was in hospital recovering from surgery when the Menzies government refused him a pair on controversial proposed banking legislation; with his vote critical in a tightly-divided Senate, Arnold was brought to Parliament House in an ambulance and had to attend Senate proceedings in a wheelchair and hospital garb in order to defeat the bill. He lost Labor preselection to Les Haylen for the 1964 Senate-only election, and left office when his term expired in 1965. Arnold died in October 1967 at Royal Newcastle Hospital and was cremated at what is now the Newcastle Memorial Park. He married Ida Isabelle Brent on 6 August 1935; they had four children. ==References== Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Australian Senate for New South Wales Category:Members of the Australian Senate Category:1902 births Category:1967 deaths Category:20th-century Australian politicians ","title":"James Arnold (Australian politician)"},{"id":"20146560","text":"Benito Juárez is a village in the Mexican state of Veracruz.

Sasha Fierce (2008). Originally titled \\"Beautiful Nightmare\\", it leaked online in March 2008. The song was written and produced by Beyoncé, James Scheffer, Wayne Wilkins, and Rico Love. Columbia Records released \\"Sweet Dreams\\", the album's sixth single, to mainstream radio and rhythmic contemporary radio playlists in the United States on June 2, 2009, and elsewhere on July 13. It is an electropop song whose instrumentation includes synthesizers, a keyboard, and snare drums. Knowles employs slinky vocals to sing the haunting lyrics, which describe a romantic relationship that the female protagonist believes could be a dream. \\"Sweet Dreams\\" was acclaimed by contemporary music critics, who praised its beats, synthpop sound Knowles' vocals. Some critics noted that the sliding bassline gave the song a dark quality and resembles the one used in some of Michael Jackson's songs on Thriller (1982). \\"Sweet Dreams\\" gained popularity for its electro music style, which contrasts Knowles' earlier R&B;, urban, and funk-tinged releases. The song was nominated for the Viewers Choice Award at the 2010 BET Awards. It topped the New Zealand Singles Chart, peaked at number ten on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, and reached the top five on singles charts in Australia, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Slovakia, and the United Kingdom among others. \\"Sweet Dreams\\" was certified platinum in Australia, New Zealand and the US. The song's accompanying music video was directed by Adria Petty, and was filmed in Brooklyn, New York. It mainly uses a green screen and computer-generated effects, making the clip minimal and performance-based. The video sees Knowles wearing a golden robot suit designed by French fashion designer Thierry Mugler. The video received favorable reviews from critics, who described it as high-fashion and noted that Knowles reprised part of the choreography from her 2008 video for \\"Single Ladies\\". Knowles promoted the song by performing it live at the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards and occasionally during the I Am... World Tour (2009–10). \\"Sweet Dreams\\" was recognized as one of the most performed songs of 2009 at the 27th American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) Pop Music Awards. It was used in a Cryster Geyser Water Japanese advertisement that featured Knowles. ==Production and recording== Initially titled \\"Beautiful Nightmare\\", \\"Sweet Dreams\\" became one of the first songs composed for the 2008 double album I Am... Sasha Fierce. Record producer Rico Love regards writing \\"Sweet Dreams\\" with Knowles as \\"the experience of a lifetime\\". When Knowles went to the South Beat Studios in Miami Beach, Florida, she was not prepared to record and had to attend the opening concert of her husband Jay-Z's tour. However, when she heard a demo of \\"Sweet Dreams\\", she was impressed and wanted to record the song immediately. Knowles, Wayne Wilkins and Jim Jonsin did some additional writing and produced the song alongside Love at the same studio. Knowles and Love worked on the vocal arrangements; Knowles appreciated Love's background vocals in the hook and retained them. Jim Caruana assisted in recording the music. Love then recorded Knowles' vocals; the recording session lasted for an hour. Lastly, Wilkins mixed the track. \\"Sweet Dreams\\" appears on the Sasha Fierce disc of I Am... Sasha Fierce as it allows Knowles to portray her alter ego Sasha Fierce, whom Knowles described as \\"[her] fun, more sensual, more aggressive, more outspoken side and more glamorous side\\". ==Leak and release== \\"Sweet Dreams\\" was leaked under its original title the day after it was recorded in March 2008, eight months before the album's release. It was the first time that a single by Knowles was leaked before its inclusion on an upcoming album. She responded to the leak on her official website, thanking her fans for the positive response towards the song, before clarifying that it was just a work in progress and that she did not intend to release new material in the near future. About the leak, Love told MTV News: > I was more concerned that [Beyoncé] would feel that we did it. A lot of > times producers or songwriters leak records because they feel if you put the > song out there it would go [on to become a hit]. Usually a leak that far in > advance of an album release puts the song in serious jeopardy of being > excluded from the final track list. It was frustrating. I felt like you work > hard to get in the studio to work with Beyoncé. [But] I was blessed ... that > song turned out [to] have nine lives. Under the song's original title \\"Beautiful Nightmare\\", \\"Sweet Dreams\\" gained some attention in the United States, where it amassed enough airplay to chart at number forty-five on Hot Dance Club Songs chart and at number fifty-seven on Pop 100 Airplay chart. \\"Broken-Hearted Girl\\" was initially intended as the sixth US and fourth international single alongside the stateside-only single \\"Ego\\" (2009). However, its release was scrapped at the last minute, and replaced by \\"Sweet Dreams\\", which Knowles selected for a summer single release because she wanted an uptempo song that would keep people dancing. She added, \\"It's very rare to find an uptempo song that means something ... that's not just about going to a club or partying or being a sexy girl.\\" \\"Sweet Dreams\\" was added to US contemporary hit radio and rhythmic contemporary radio playlists on June 2, 2009. Dance remixes of the song alongside the album version of \\"Ego\\" and its remixes were later released on the same digital EP on August 17, 2009, in the US. In Germany, the album version of \\"Sweet Dreams\\" and a radio edit of a remix produced by Steve Pitron and Max Sanna were made available as a digital download and as a CD single on July 13, and July 17, 2009. A different digital EP containing remixes and the music video of the song was released in the same country on July 31, 2011. On July 16, 2009, the album version and the radio edit of \\"Sweet Dreams\\" was serviced as a two-track digital single in Oceania and Europe,\\"Beyoncé – Sweet Dreams – single\\". iTunes Store (New Zealand).

Retrieved February 19, 2012. excluding France, where it was made available on the same format the following day. In the UK, the song was released on CD and as a stand-alone digital single on August 10, 2009. A different digital EP containing four remixes and the album version of \\"Sweet Dreams\\" was also released. On the same date, the song was released as a two-sided digital EP in mainland Europe; it contained ten remixes of \\"Sweet Dreams\\". ==Composition and lyrical interpretation== \\"Sweet Dreams\\" is an electropop song that incorporates elements of rock and old-school funk music. The song is built on undulating electro rhythms and a thumping beat; its groove fits into hip hop phrasing. Alt URL It is essentially driven by a keyboard and also has guitar, piano, synthesizer, snare drum and bass instrumentation. Many music critics noted that several components of \\"Sweet Dreams\\" are reminiscent of the songs on Michael Jackson's 1982 album Thriller. James Montgomery of MTV News said that the \\"gnarly low end\\" sounds like Jackson's song \\"Beat It\\" (1983). Nick Levine of Digital Spy noted that the electronic bassline is similar to those used in Jackson's songs \\"Thriller\\" (1983) and \\"Bad\\" (1987). Arielle Castillo of the Miami New Times noted that Jackson could use the beat of \\"Sweet Dreams\\" to bring up to date his Thriller-era style. The lyrics of \\"Sweet Dreams\\" are about a female protagonist who has some insecurities about her new romantic relationship; she is confused about whether her relationship with her partner is a \\"sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare\\". The song starts with a bassline, which is occasionally interrupted by spare snare kicks, drum fills and Knowles' chanting, \\"Turn the lights on.\\" She then adopts slinky vocals to begin the first verse. The \\"expansive-yet-molecular\\" chorus then starts with the line, \\"You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare / Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you.\\" The song is written in the key of Eminor with a tempo of 122 beats per minute. Beyoncé's vocals span from D4 to F5 in the song. ==Critical reception Reviews === \\"Sweet Dreams\\" was acclaimed by critics, some of whom praised its dark tone and electropop sound that is different from Knowles' previous work. James Montgomery of MTV News wrote that Knowles' vocals, which he called, \\"icy and cool, slippery like mercury [and] nothing to scoff at either\\", help make the song an \\"undeniable smash\\" that is unique compared to the work of other artists. Jennifer Vineyard of the same publication argued that the rock elements and smooth vocals contribute to Knowles' \\"fierce\\" alter ego, who \\"dares the listener to dream of her, warning that it might be a 'beautiful nightmare'.\\" Arielle Castillo of Miami New Times noted that \\"Sweet Dreams\\" is another one of Jim Jonsin's productions with a keyboard-propelled arrangement, but unlike the material Jonsin crafted for Soulja Boy, the song is \\"swirling, and darker\\". Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle and Gary Trust of Billboard magazine agreed that the song is one of Knowles' purest dance songs and is \\"an irresistible call to the dance floor\\". Describing \\"Sweet Dreams\\" as a \\"cool dance track\\", Dennis Amith of J!-ENT complimented its arrangement, calling it \\"experimental\\" with \\"cool transitions\\". Adam Mazmanian of The Washington Times described the song as \\"a gritty slow grind with a salacious bassline\\" and noted that Knowles \\"delivers a near parody of a good-girl voice\\" while singing the chorus. Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork Media wrote that \\"Sweet Dreams\\" sounds like a song Rihanna would sing. Echoing Dombal's sentiments, Nick Levine of Digital Spy wrote that the best song on the Sasha Fierce disc is a \\"dark[ish] electropop track called 'Sweet Dreams', [which] actually sounds like the cousin of Rihanna's 'Disturbia'\\". On a separate review for the single, Levine awarded \\"Sweet Dreams\\" a rating of four stars out of five, and commented that the song seduces listeners with its catchy chorus hook, and thereafter keeps them intrigued by \\"placing a hint of darkness just beneath the shiny, synthy surface\\". Spence D. of IGN Music wrote that though \\"Sweet Dreams\\" is not a \\"stellar track\\", it is superior to other album tracks, including \\"Diva\\" and \\"Radio\\". Similarly, Vicki Lutas of BBC Music wrote that even though \\"Sweet Dreams\\" appears to lack something, it is undeniably a good song overall. She added that \\"Sweet Dreams\\" may not be Knowles' finest or most memorable work, but it remains her best offering since her 2003 song \\"Crazy in Love\\". Lutas also commended Knowles' vocal delivery, which he described as \\"beautiful and soft, yet strong and powerful\\". Talia Kraines of the same publication wrote that \\"Sweet Dreams\\" is one of the standout tracks on the Sasha Fierce disc though Knowles does not get as experimental as she did on her 2006 song \\"Ring the Alarm\\". ===Recognition and accolades=== \\"Sweet Dreams\\" earned Knowles the Best Female Vocal accolade at the 2009 Music MP3 Awards. It was nominated for Best R&B;/Urban Dance Track at the 25th Annual International Dance Music Awards, but lost to The Black Eyed Peas's 2009 song \\"I Gotta Feeling\\". It was also nominated for the Viewers Choice Award at the 2010 BET Awards. The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) recognized \\"Sweet Dreams\\" as one of the most performed songs of 2009 at the 27th ASCAP Pop Music Awards. On the occasion of Knowles' thirtieth birthday, Erika Ramirez and Jason Lipshutz of Billboard magazine ranked the song at number 21 on their list of Knowles' 30 biggest Billboard hits, and noted that its electropop sound, which was in contrast to Knowles' previous singles, showcased her range of talent. On The Village Voices 2009 Pazz & Jop singles list, \\"Sweet Dreams\\" was ranked at number 114. In 2013, John Boone and Jennifer Cady of E! Online placed the song at number five on their list of ten best Knowles' songs, writing that Knowles \\"stepped away from R&B; roots with this surreal electropop tune, which features these standout lyrics: 'My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere / As long as you're here, I'll be floating on air' (which, from Bey's mouth, sounds like the greatest threat ever).\\" ==Chart performance== \\"Sweet Dreams\\" debuted at number seventy-two on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart issue dated August 9, 2009. It peaked at number ten for two non- consecutive weeks on the charts issued dated November 7, and November 21, 2009. The song became Knowles' thirteenth top ten Hot 100 single as a solo artist during 2001–10, and tied her with Ludacris and T-Pain for second-most top tens on the chart since 2000; Knowles' husband Jay-Z leads with fourteen in that period. Knowles' is the third song titled \\"Sweet Dreams\\" to reach the top ten of the Hot 100 chart, following \\"Sweet Dreams\\" by Air Supply in 1982 and \\"Sweet Dreams\\" by Eurythmics in 1983. \\"Sweet Dreams\\" peaked at number forty-eight on the US Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart, making I Am... Sasha Fierce the first album of the 21st century to have seven entries on that chart.

Sasha Fierce to top that chart. \\"Sweet Dreams\\" tied Knowles with Kristine W for second-most number one songs on the Hot Dance Club Songs during 2001–10. The song peaked at number five for three consecutive weeks on the US Pop Songs chart in November 2009. \\"Sweet Dreams\\" was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting sales of two million digital copies. As of October 2012, it had sold 2,091,000 digital downloads in the US. \\"Sweet Dreams\\" also performed well outside the US. In the UK, the song initially entered the UK Singles Chart more than a month before its physical release, on July 5, 2009, at number one hundred and eighty-nine. The following week, it rose to number fifty-two, and thereafter continuously ascended the chart; it peaked at number five on August 9, 2009, and became Knowles' sixth top five single in the UK as a solo artist. The song was last seen on the UK Singles Chart on January 17, 2010, after spending 26 weeks in the top 100. On July 16, 2009, \\"Sweet Dreams\\" debuted at number seventeen on the Irish Singles Chart and climbed to its peak position at number four in its fourth charting week. The single stayed in top ten for eight weeks and left the chart after spending nineteen consecutive weeks on it. For the week ending June 18, 2009, \\"Sweet Dreams\\" was the most added song on Australian radio stations. On August 9, 2009, it peaked at number two on the Australian Singles Chart, and became the highest charting single from I Am... Sasha Fierce in Australia.

The song was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ), representing shipment of 15,000 copies. ==Music videoBackground and concept=== alt=A woman wearing a golden metallic corset and a pair of sleeves of the same material, is standing and looking forward. The accompanying music video for \\"Sweet Dreams\\" was directed by Adria Petty, whom Knowles chose because of her intelligence and beautiful visual references. After Knowles learned the choreography in Los Angeles, the video was shot in a studio in Brooklyn, New York City. It was the seventh video released from I Am... Sasha Fierce, and the second to have complete color throughout; \\"Halo\\" was the first. Knowles described it as more \\"graphic\\" when compared to the previous six videos; its motive was to \\"take Sasha [Fierce] to the next level\\". In the video, Knowles' alter ego is symbolized by the golden robot suit she wears; it was designed by French fashion designer Thierry Mugler. A green-screen and computer-generated effects were used for the video to create a minimal and performance-based clip. The computer-generated imagery (CGI) was employed to create a context-less void; the CGI effects were used to delete the background and setting before creating a void-like digital canvas for the dance routine that is executed by Knowles and her dancers Saidah Nairobi and Ashley Everett, who all sport numerous flashy and symmetrical costumes throughout the video. Accordingly, there were no concerns of cutting; the images were easily merged into one another using computers. A high number of camera lens glare effects was used in the video, part of which was inspired by British designer Gareth Pugh's Autumn/Winter 2009 video presentation. Knowles further explained that the fashion and choreography were the main elements of the music video: > The fashion was extremely important in this video because everything was so > minimal ... With the choreography, we really focused on hitting all of the > accents in the drum beat. What makes this choreography so interesting is > that in one instance, it is very staccato and hard... And the next instance; > the movement is very smooth and there are lots of melts with inter-kit > movement in the fingers and hands. On June 12, 2009, a behind-the-scenes video, which Knowles dance rehearsal, was released; Knowles was dressed in golden costumes and was performing some robotic movements The music video of \\"Sweet Dreams\\" was not included on the remixes and video album Above and Beyoncé – Video Collection & Dance Mixes as it was not finished when the CD/DVD collection was made; instead, a Making of Sweet Dreams video was included. A 30-second clip from the video was posted online on July 8, 2009; it showed Knowles alongside her two female back-up dancers in a virtual desert. The following day, the full video was leaked online but was soon deleted after Knowles' label issued warnings to infringing websites. The video for \\"Sweet Dreams\\" premiered on MTV later the same day. ===Synopsis and analysis=== The video opens with Knowles tossing and turning in her bed; her idea was to make the opening shot look like \\"a dark fairy tale \\". As she tries to sleep, Brahms's Lullaby plays softly in the background.. Listening to heartbeat before Beyoncé breathing at visual effects. She then levitates off her bed using her stomach muscles to move the top half of her body. Knowles said that the levitation shot was the hardest one as she had difficulties making her neck look straight. She added that the scene represents the nightmare and the white bird flying above her takes her into her dream, which unfolds after the screech of an electric guitar. Knowles is transported to a desert and several clouds are present in the background. She wears a black Roberto Cavalli dress and boots; as the music begins, her two backup dancers wearing Gareth Pugh pieces appear. The scene changes into a computer-generated sci-fi landscape where Knowles is inscribed with a circle and square in a similar fashion to Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man. The first chorus is brought in by a subtle glass-breaking sound effect as the sci- fi special effects disappear and Knowles appears in a silver one-shouldered mini dress on a white background. Accompanied by her backup dancers, she performs sophisticated, street and hip-busting dance moves. The second chorus shows Knowles wearing a silver lined body suit while smashing mirrors. During the bridge, the video fades to black and white and Knowles appears wearing the gold robot suit, and gold and diamond nail rings valued at $36,000 and designed by Bijules designer Jules Kim. She executes some robotic movements. As the chorus begins to play for the third and final time, digital doubling and mirroring are used to create a collection of dance moves and multiple images Knowles arching her back. The gold outfit is then reused, this time in color. Knowles performs another dance routine with her two backup dancers, then says, \\"Turn the lights out\\", and the video ends. ===Reception=== James Montgomery of MTV News wrote that the video is \\"an eye-popping, herky-jerky, high-fashion\\" one. He praised the way Knowles \\"[pops] her pelvis in ways never imagined\\", and the wardrobe changes in the clip, before concluding: \\"She expands on her burgeoning robot fetish, flashes the crazy eyes and contorts her body in downright unsettling ways. All of which is to say that 'Sweet Dreams' is just like every amazingly crazy Beyoncé video from the past three years, which — to extend the point — also means that it's pretty great.\\" Olivia Smith of Daily News noted that in the video, Knowles references Jane Fonda in the movie Barbarella (1968), Tin Woodman and Pamela Anderson through the different costumes she wears. Smith further compared the video with the one for \\"Single Ladies\\", writing that Knowles reprises some of the moves as she \\"can only swivel those hips in so many ways\\". Brandon Soderberg of Slant Magazine described the introductory part of the video as a David Lynch-like mixture of eroticism and symbolism. He wrote that the video was \\"one part Victoria's Secret commercial, another part dream logic anti-narrative, and a CGI-assisted freakout all around\\". Soderberg commended the video for being \\"an excess of body and action, not filmic techniques\\", adding that the dancing in the video \\"blow[s] our minds anew\\". Rolling Stone found similarities between the video for \\"Sweet Dreams\\", Kanye West's video for \\"Paranoid\\" (2009) and the cover artworks of English rock band Yes. Canadian magazine Dose also compared the video with \\"Paranoid\\" due to their similar dream sequences. Vicki Lutas of the BBC did not appreciate the first 30 seconds of the video, writing that \\"the dark, horror-type music, the pumping heartbeat, the equally spooky lullaby, the screech of an electric guitar\\", gave her the impression that she was watching \\"some [19]80s magician, with a Knowles soundtrack\\". However, she complimented the rest of the video writing that \\"things (thankfully) move away from the Hallowe'en cheese and into familiar Beyoncé territory (right from the fact it's proper [19]80s pop through to the video essentially being 'Single Ladies' with Beyoncé and 2 dancers)\\". Lutas concluded that the video might not be remembered for long or hailed as Beyoncé's finest and more memorable work, but it remains one of the best music videos from Knowles she has seen since \\"Crazy in Love\\". Nick Levine of Digital Spy compared the dancing moves in the video with those in \\"Single Ladies\\". The video stayed at number one for several weeks on the UK TV Airplay Chart in August and September 2009. It was ranked at number 13 on BET's Notarized: Top 100 Videos of 2009 countdown. Tamar Anitai of MTV placed the video at number three on his list of the best five videos of 2009, wrote that it \\"isn't just another high-fashion look at Beyoncé ... \\" and continued, \\"It's the dark yin to the brighter, lighter fare of 'Single Ladies.' This is a 360-degree look at Beyoncé's life: Beyoncé the woman, Sasha Fierce the performer, and the powerful force that occupies the spaces in between.\\" In 2013, John Boone and Jennifer Cady of E! Online placed the video at number ten on their list of Knowles' ten best music videos, praising Knowles' sexy robotic look. ==Promotion== Beyoncé performing \\"Sweet Dreams\\" during I Am... World Tour. Knowles was due to perform \\"Sweet Dreams\\" at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards on September 13. However, last minute changes were brought to her performance that night; wearing a leotard and a silver glove, Knowles sang a short drum-led remix of \\"Sweet Dreams\\" before switching to \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\", accompanied by two female backup dancers. Wearing a red Agent Provocateur corset, stockings and long satin gloves, Knowles sang \\"Sweet Dreams\\" at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2009 on November 5. Charly Wilder of Spin magazine commented that Knowles overshadowed American singer Katy Perry's \\"tweaked-out pinup shtick with her mesmerizing, sexed-up rendition\\" of \\"Sweet Dreams\\". \\"Sweet Dreams\\" was not regularly performed on the I Am... World Tour, a 2009–10 world tour in support of I Am... Sasha Fierce, but a video interlude featuring the song was included. Knowles sang an acoustic and downtempo rendition of the song live during the revue I Am... Yours that was held at the Encore Theater in Las Vegas on August 2, 2009. She blended it into a romantic medley that also included her 2003 song \\"Dangerously in Love\\" and Anita Baker's 1986 song \\"Sweet Love\\".(2009) Album notes for I Am... Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas by Beyoncé Knowles. Music World Entertainment/Columbia Records. The performance was subsequently included on her 2009 CD/DVD live album I Am... Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas. Knowles performed \\"Sweet Dreams\\" live at the Glastonbury Festival on June 26, 2011; she mixed it with the 1983 song \\"Sweet Dreams\\", originally performed by the British pop music duo Eurythmics. \\"Sweet Dreams\\" was used in a commercial for Crystal Geyser bottled water in which Knowles appeared; she dances and drinks water while the song is played in the background. Although acclaimed and with high peaks reached at the charts, Knowles performed the whole song live only on 5 first concerts in I Am... World Tour as show opening, later halving or mixing it with covers or other songs of hers. ==Cover versions== An unofficial remix, featuring American rappers Lil Wayne and Nicki Minaj, was leaked on some websites on March 9, 2010, and was included on Wayne's 2009 mixtape No Ceilings. The Big Pink, an English electro-rock duo consisting multi- instrumentalists Robbie Furze and Milo Cordell, covered \\"Sweet Dreams\\" in a live session for BBC Radio 1 on November 7, 2009. They also performed the song live on at the 2010 Isle of Wight Festival on June 13, 2010. The cover later became a B-side to their 2010 single \\"Tonight\\". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times commented that The Big Pink's version of \\"Sweet Dreams\\" had a \\"disarmingly flat affect, delivering it as the ramble of a neurotic\\" when compared to the original recording sung by Knowles. Likewise, Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombal felt that their cover \\"obliterates the original's Hi-NRG pulse, turning it into something a lot moodier and creepier\\". On November 1, 2010, American professional basketball player, Shaquille O'Neal, dressed as his female alter ego Shaquita for Halloween, and gave a lip-synching performance of Knowles' \\"Sweet Dreams\\". In September 2011, Jade Collins covered \\"Sweet Dreams\\" during an episode of the ninth series of The X Factor. On October 27, 2012, boy band Union J covered the song during the same season of the show and released the cover through the iTunes Store as a single the same day. ===Jessica Sanchez cover=== On March 28, 2012, Jessica Sanchez, a contestant of the eleventh season of American Idol, covered \\"Sweet Dreams\\" performing a slow-tempo ballad version of the song accompanied at the beginning by harps. Her performance received favorable comments and a standing ovation from the judges of the show. Jennifer Lopez commented, \\"You did a beautiful job on it ... If I was Beyoncé and I was home and I heard that, I'd be like 'I got to do that in my next concert, slow that one down.'\\" Steven Tyler described Sanchez's performance as \\"great\\" while Randy Jackson noted that it was \\"unbelievable, sensational\\". James Montgomery of MTV News graded her performance with a B, and called the cover \\"a bit of an odd choice, and yet also a supremely confident one\\". He added, \\"For once, she pulled things back, and maybe suffered a bit for doing so, but there were still plenty of subtly great moments, particularly in the verses. Might not have been her best—it definitely lacked in vocal fireworks ... And really, it was good enough\\". Mellisa Locker of Rolling Stone praised Sanchez's performance, calling it a \\"brilliant job\\" and adding that \\"it's risky, but Beyoncé has done it, and if anyone can pull off a dazzling repeat performance, it's Jessica\\". She further compared the performance with the dream sequence from the 1945 film Spellbound but noted that it was \\"slightly weirder\\" Jim Farber of the Daily News commented that \\"her take on a song by her clear role model, Beyoncé, showed too much similarity in their timbres and phrasing, making Sanchez's voice seem redundant ... despite the fact she switched up the arrangement of the bootylicious song she chose, 'Sweet Dreams.'\\" Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"Sanchez gave yet another perfectly calibrated performance with Beyoncé's 'Sweet Dreams,' balancing restraint and power. Everything from her voice to her dress to the red door she walked through seemed polished and tour-ready.\\" The Arizona Republics Randy Cordova praised the performance, saying that the slow-tempo version allowed Sanchez \\"to really delve into the song's emotional core\\". The Hollywood Reporters Erin Carlson praised the tonned-down theatrical stage during the performance and Sanchez's vibrato voice, further describing the performance as a \\"near-perfection\\". ==Formats and track listings== *US Ego/Sweet Dreams Singles and Dance Mixes\\"Beyoncé – Ego / Sweet Dreams Singles & Dance Mixes\\". iTunes Store (US).

In contrast to the decor, the cuisine is predominantly Filipino with a smidgen of Western and Chinese foods. The award- winning restaurant is also popularly known as The Sisig King for its recent achievements in a food feast celebrating the favorite Filipino dish. The chain has plans to build stores overseas, especially in the United States. ==History== Congo Grille at SM City Clark in Angeles City. Congo Grille was established in 1999 by Kenneth Sytin and his brothers. That year, the business had as many as 13,000 customers a month and was dubbed \\"the fastest growing grill in town.\\" In 2006, Congo Grill participated in the Annual Sisig Festival held in Angeles City, Pampanga. Their pork sisig and two other sisig dishes won first prizes in the major categories.dbmedia (2007-08-23). \\"Congo Grille Opens at Trimona\\". DBMedia. Retrieved on 2010-12-26. The restaurant operates based on three concepts; a Philippine restaurant in an air conditioned environment, food without monosodium glutamate, and a mascot (an ape in a safari outfit) for entertaining youngsters. Congo Grille was opened for franchising in 2008. The first franchised-operated store opened at the Araneta Center in 2009. == Charities == A common meal of sisig, rice and iced tea In 2007, Congo Grille, along with other companies, organized a party to feed 407 children of low-income families in the city of Valenzuela. This was part of a program dealing with nationwide hunger. Two years later, they teamed up with local television network GMA 7 in feeding low-income individuals. Workers of the restaurant chain offered meals to 300 people in Quezon City, its birthplace.

Roche was the ninth Roman Catholic Bishop of Leeds from 2004 to 2012, having served previously as Coadjutor Bishop of Leeds and before that as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Westminster. ==Early life and ministry== Arthur Roche was born in Batley Carr, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England, to Arthur and Frances Roche. He attended St Joseph's Primary School, St John Fisher High School and Christleton Hall. From 1969 to 1975, he studied at St Alban's College in Valladolid, Spain, where he obtained a degree in theology from the Comillas Pontifical University. Upon his return to England, he was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop William Wheeler for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Leeds on 19 July 1975. Roche's first appointment in the diocese was as assistant priest at Holy Rood Church in Barnsley until 1978, when he became private secretary to Bishop William Gordon Wheeler. He was appointed Vice- Chancellor of the diocese in 1979. From 1982 to 1989, he served on the staff of St Anne's Cathedral in Leeds, and helped to organise the visit of Pope John Paul II to York in May 1982. Roche was the diocesan Financial Secretary from 1986 to 1991 and parish priest at St Wilfrid's Church from 1989 to 1991. In 1991, he studied at the Pontifical Gregorian University, earning a Licence in Theology (STL). He then became spiritual director of the Venerable English College. He was appointed General Secretary of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales in April 1996 and given the title of Monsignor. ==Episcopal career== On 12 April 2001, Pope John Paul II named Roche an auxiliary bishop of Westminster and titular bishop of Rusticiana. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 10 May in Westminster Cathedral from Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, with Bishops David Konstant and Victor Guazzelli serving as co-consecrators. ===Bishop of Leeds=== Roche was named Coadjutor Bishop of the Diocese of Leeds on 16 July 2002 and became the ninth Bishop of Leeds when Pope John Paul accepted David Konstant's resignation on 7 April 2004. In July 2002, he was elected chairman of the International Commission on English in the Liturgy, which oversees the translation of the Mass into English. The Commission had failed to win Vatican approval of its 1998 translation of the Mass, and Roche's appointment was part of an overhaul to end the stalemate and produce the more literal translation that Rome wanted. In 2008, his plans to close seven parishes produced protests, especially on the part of a parish in Allerton Bywater that offers a Mass in Latin. Roche had been mentioned as a possible successor to Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor as Archbishop of Westminster, leader of the Church in England and Wales. He was even said to be the cardinal's favoured candidate. His name had also been mentioned as a possible successor to Archbishop Kevin McDonald as Archbishop of Southwark. As the chairman of the International Commission on English in the Liturgy, Roche announced that the new translation of the Mass into English was ready. This new translation of the Roman Missal was introduced into Catholic parishes in the United Kingdom in September 2011. === Congregation for Divine Worship === On 26 June 2012, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Roche Secretary of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments CDW and raised him to the rank of archbishop. As Secretary, he has maintained the low profile typical of his curial rank, signing statements and doing press relations in tandem with his superiors, until 2014 Cardinal Antonio Cañizares Llovera and then Cardinal Robert Sarah, Prefect of the Congregation. He played a larger role when Pope Francis asked him in December 2016 to chair a commission to determine who should have responsibility for translating liturgical texts into the vernacular, apparently because Sarah was not in synch with Francis' views. In September 2017, when Francis released his letter Magnum principium giving regional and national bishops' synods the dominant role and constraining the authority of the CDW, Roche provided the commentary and Sarah played no role. On 29 March 2014 Pope Francis named Roche a member of the Pontifical Council for Culture. ==NotesReferences*Catholic-Hierarchy website: Archbishop Arthur Roche Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:People from Batley Category:Comillas Pontifical University alumni Category:20th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:21st-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:British Roman Catholic archbishops Category:Pontifical Gregorian University alumni Category:Officials of the Roman Curia Category:People associated with Leeds Trinity University Category:Roman Catholic Bishops of Leeds ","title":"Arthur Roche"},{"id":"20146636","text":"The gentleman detective, less commonly lady detective, is a type of fictional character. He (or she) has long been a staple of crime fiction, particularly in detective novels and short stories set in Britain in the Golden Age. The heroes of these adventures are typically both gentlemen by conduct and also members of the British gentry. The literary heroes being in opposition to professional police force detectives from the working classes. Gentlemen detectives include amateurs, private detectives and professional policemen. They are always well educated, frequently have unusual or eccentric hobbies, and are commonly found in their natural environment, an English country house. This archetype of British detective contrasts with the more \\"hardboiled\\" counterpart in American crime fiction. == Early examples == Gentlemen detectives appeared early in modern detective fiction, which began in the late 19th century. C. Auguste Dupin, created by Edgar Allan Poe, is widely considered to be the first fictional detective in English literature. He appeared in three short stories written in the 1840s: \\"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\\" (1841), \\"The Mystery of Marie Rogêt\\" (1842) and \\"The Purloined Letter\\" (1844). Poe created Dupin before the word detective had been coined, but began many common elements of detective fiction: Dupin shares some features with the later gentleman detective. He was \\"…the first fictional detective of importance and the model for virtually every cerebral crime solver who followed.\\"C. Steinbrunner & O. Penzler (editors-in-chief). Encyclopedia of mystery and detection, 1976. New York: Prentice-Hall: p137 More specifically, Dorothy L. Sayers noted that \\"Sherlock Holmes modelled himself to a large extent upon (Poe's) Dupin, substituting cocaine for candlelight, with accompaniments of shag and fiddle-playing.\\" Dorothy L. Sayers (1929). Introduction (edited) to The omnibus of crime in Robin W. Winks (editor) (1980). Detective fiction: a collection of critical essays. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall: p58 Dupin is French, not English, but is probably a gentleman. He comes from a once wealthy family but has been reduced \\"by a variety of untoward events\\" to more humble circumstances. He is entirely amateur and contents himself only with the basic necessities of life.Stashower, Daniel. The Beautiful Cigar Girl. New York: PenguinBooks, 2006: 20. He lives in Paris with his close friend, the anonymous narrator of the stories. Like the much later Lord Peter Wimsey (see below), Dupin is a bibliophile, and met his narrator friend while both were searching for \\"the same rare and very remarkable volume\\" in an obscure library.Krutch, Joseph Wood. Edgar Allan Poe: A Study in Genius. Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 1926: 108. For hobbies, Dupin is \\"fond\\" of enigmas, conundrums, and hieroglyphics.Rosenheim, Shawn James. The Cryptographic Imagination: Secret Writing from Edgar Poe to the Internet. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1997: 21. Dupin also bears the French title Chevalier, meaning that he is a knight in the Légion d'honneur. The classic British gentleman detective appears soon after Poe's Dupin. A gentleman amateur is the ultimate hero of The Moonstone (1868), a famous epistolary novel widely considered the first true detective novel in English. Its author, Wilkie Collins was a lawyer, and a close friend of Charles Dickens. Collins also used gifted amateurs in his earlier mystery novel, The Woman in White (1859). In The Moonstone, Rachel Verinder is the only child of a rich, aristocratic widow. On her eighteenth birthday, she is bequeathed an enormous diamond; that night, this 'moonstone' is stolen from the country house of her mother, Lady Verinder. After local police are baffled, a Bow Street Runner called Sergeant Cuff is called in. Sergeant Cuff is honourable and skilful, but he is not a gentleman, and is unable to break Rachel's reticence about what is clearly an inside job. The mystery is eventually solved by Franklin Blake, who is a gifted amateur—and definitely a member of the gentry. The social difference between Collins' two detectives is nicely shown by their relationships with the Verinder family: Sergeant Cuff becomes a great friend of Lady Verinder's steward (chief servant), whereas Franklin Blake eventually marries Rachel, her daughter. === Sherlock Holmes === Sherlock Holmes (right) and Dr Watson, by Sidney Paget (1901) The most famous of all fictional detectives, Sherlock Holmes, may also be considered a gentleman, at least by background. Holmes was the creation of Scottish author and physician Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. He appeared in four novels and fifty-six short stories, all but four stories narrated by his associate, the notable Dr Watson. These works cover in fiction a period from around 1878 up to 1907, with a final case in 1914. Both characters also appear in many pastiches. Holmes is a brilliant London-based and self-styled consulting detective. In their debut (the 1887 novel, A Study in Scarlet), he tells Watson that this occupation is unique (which at that date it was). As a retired army doctor, Dr Watson is far closer to the stereotypic English gentleman than Holmes, yet has no social reservations about beginning his long association with the detective. In the best traditions of the gentry, Holmes proves to be physically brave, and competent with fists, sword and pistol. Like the earlier Dupin and the later Lord Peter Wimsey (see below), Holmes is also a competent cryptanalyst (for instance, The Dancing Men, 1903). Conan Doyle never gave much background about Holmes' family, but his hero was apparently born in 1854 (estimated from His Last Bow, 1917). He also has an eccentric older brother, Mycroft Holmes, a senior public servant and member of the Diogenes Club. As further indirect evidence that Holmes is an educated gentleman, Conan Doyle indicates that Holmes is fluent in Latin (A Study in Scarlet, 1887), and as the series continues his speech is replete with references to the Bible, Shakespeare, and even Goethe. Holmes had earlier attended university, where he began his detecting as an amateur (The Gloria Scott, 1893, and The Musgrave Ritual, 1893). A violinist himself, Holmes loves music (The Red-Headed League, 1890), sometimes to the point of eccentricity; in The Bruce-Partington Plans (1912), Watson reports that \\"Holmes lost himself in a monograph which he had undertaken upon the Polyphonic Motets of Lassus.\\" Holmes and Watson were often depicted wearing traditional gentleman's attire in illustrations set in London by Sidney Paget, whose illustrations accompanied Sherlock Holmes stories in The Strand Magazine. While Paget is credited with depicting Holmes wearing a deerstalker hat and Inverness cape, Paget only depicted Holmes wearing these garments in situations that would have been considered appropriate at the time, such as when Holmes was working in a rural setting or travelling to the countryside. == Golden Age examples == The renowned crime writers of the Golden Age of Detective Fiction were mostly British and mostly women, including the four \\"Queens of Crime\\" (Margery Allingham, Agatha Christie, Ngaio Marsh and Dorothy L. Sayers). They all produced at least one gentleman detective. Their books featuring these characters are still generally in print. *Hercule Poirot first appeared in 1920, in Agatha Christie's first book, The Mysterious Affair at Styles. He was immensely popular during the \\"Golden Age\\", becoming the most famous detective since Sherlock Holmes. He appeared in 33 novels, one play, and more than 50 short stories published between 1920 and 1975 and set in the same era. Poirot was formerly Chief of Police of Brussels, until \\"the Great War\\" (WWI) forced him to leave for England. It was there that he met his longtime friend Arthur Hastings, who accompanied him on many cases. Throughout his career, he solved many cases across Europe, occasionally undertaking cases for the British government and Secret Service, including foiling the attempted abduction of the British Prime Minister. Poirot operates as a fairly conventional detective, depending on logic, which is represented by two common phrases he uses: his use of \\"the little grey cells\\" and \\"order and method\\". Poirot is occasionally assisted by his secretary, Miss Felicity Lemon, and friend Chief Inspector Japp, of Scotland Yard. Poirot's appearance is of a short, dignified man. His head is exactly the shape of an egg, with a stiff and military-like moustache. His attire consists of a three-piece suit, accompanied by a pocketwatch, spats, patent leather shoes and a pair of pince-nez. He also wears a \\"Tussie-mussie\\" lapel pin he received as a gift in The Mysterious Affair at Styles. *Lord Peter Wimsey was the creation of Dorothy L. Sayers. Wimsey is an archetype for British gentlemen detectives. Reputedly born in 1890, he first appeared in Whose Body? (1923), the first of 11 chronological novels and several collections of short stories. Wimsey is a purely amateur sleuth, and is unquestionably an English gentleman. He is polished, aristocratic, wealthy, and the younger brother of a duke. Wimsey is extremely clever, though he usually tries to hide it. As shown in Have His Carcase (1932), Wimsey is a competent cryptanalyst, like both the earlier Dupin and Sherlock Holmes. Again like Holmes, Wimsey is physically brave (despite being physically small), and is competent with his fists (Clouds of Witness, 1926). Wimsey is notably eccentric in manner; this is most evident in the first five novels. As Sayers' work progress and as Wimsey ages, he rounds out and mellows greatly. At age 45 he marries Harriet Vane, a crime writer. According to Barbara Reynolds, her friend and biographer, Sayers remarked that Lord Peter began as a mixture of Fred Astaire and Bertie Wooster. She claimed that she had developed the \\"husky voiced, dark-eyed\\" Harriet to put an end to Lord Peter via matrimony. Vane features in two further novels (Have His Carcase, 1932, & Gaudy Night, 1935) before agreeing to marry Wimsey. In the course of writing these novels, Sayers gave Lord Peter and Harriet so much life that she was never able to, as she put it, \\"see Lord Peter exit the stage.\\" In an essay by one of her \\"Golden Age\\" rivals, Ngaio Marsh (see below), Sayers is accused of having \\"fallen in love\\" with Wimsey. *Albert Campion first appeared in 1929, and was created by Margery Allingham as a parody of Lord Peter Wimsey.\\"The Great Detectives: Albert Campion\\" by Mike Ripley, Strand Magazine Albert Campion is supposedly the pseudonym used by a man who was born in 1900 into a prominent British aristocratic family. He was educated at Totham School and the (fictitious) St. Ignatius' College, Cambridge (according to a mini- biography included in Sweet Danger, 1933). Ingenious, resourceful and well- educated, in his 20s he assumed the name Campion and began a life as an adventurer and detective. As Allingham's work progressed, Campion established his own identity. He first appeared as a supporting character in The Crime at Black Dudley (1929), an adventure story involving a ring of criminals, and would go on to feature in another 17 novels and over 20 short stories. *Roderick Alleyn first appeared in 1934, (Fontana, 1960, edition) the creation of New Zealander, Ngaio Marsh, who was then living in London. Alleyn featured in a chronological series of 32 detective novels, which finished as late as 1982. He was apparently born around 1893, schooled at Eton, graduated from Oxford around 1915, served in the army for three years in the First World War, then spent a year (1919-1920) in the British Foreign Service. He finally joined the Metropolitan Police as a constable in about 1920 or 1921. When the series opens, Alleyn is aged about 40 and is already a Chief Detective- Inspector in the CID at Scotland Yard. As the series progresses, Alleyn marries and has a son, and eventually rises to the rank of Chief Superintendent. Alleyn is a thoroughly professional policeman, but socially is very like Wimsey. Both were reputedly educated at Eton and Oxford (being only three or so years apart, they perhaps should have known each other). Both detectives eventually marry a former murder suspect and have children. As depicted by Marsh, Alleyn's family is similar to that created by Sayers for her Wimsey, in that Alleyn has a titled older brother, who however is much less grand (merely a baronet rather than a duke). Like Wimsey, Alleyn's titled brother is less intelligent and more conventional than his more famous younger sibling. Alleyn's mother, Lady Alleyn, closely resembles in manner Wimsey's mother, the Dowager Duchess of Denver. Both ladies are affable, intelligent, and strongly support (and perhaps prefer) their younger sons. One marked difference between the fictional biographies of Alleyn and Wimsey, who are about the same age, is in their supposed military service during the First World War. Alleyn's army service is glossed over and never discussed, whereas Wimsey's distinguished service on the Western Front has mentally scarred him for life. Another difference is that Wimsey deliberately cultivates his aristocratic eccentricities (inter alia, he wears a monocle, delights in his Oxford accent, and collects incunabula), whereas Alleyn is not at all eccentric, and plays down his upper-class background. *Miss Marple is one of the two great detective creations of Agatha Christie, the best known of all the \\"Golden Age\\" writers. Miss Marple is an amiable elderly spinster who first appeared in 1927. Her detective feats are largely based on her profound knowledge of human nature, gained (she maintains) from closely observing life in her small village. The daughter of a clergyman, she is not from the aristocracy or landed gentry, but is quite at home amongst them. Miss Marple would probably have been happy to describe herself as a gentlewoman. Christie had a rather upper-class background herself: she grew up in a large house with servants, with a father rich enough not to work, a private education, and many country house parties before World War 1. In her autobiography, Christie stated that she partly based Miss Marple upon her grandmother and her friends. *Mr. Satterthwaite is one of Christie's lesser known amateur detectives. This charming, elderly gentleman only appears in The Mysterious Mr. Quin (1930) and Three Act Tragedy (1934). He is physically small, highly cultivated, an inveterate snob with a taste for duchesses, and is wealthy besides. By way of contrast, Christie's most famous detective character (Hercule Poirot) is a foreigner, and is thus outside the English class system. Poirot takes full advantage of this subtlety, not least in Three Act Tragedy in which he catches a serial killer with Mr. Satterthwaite's assistance. *Arsène Lupin, the French \\"gentleman thief\\" who debuted in 1905, may just as well be considered a gentleman detective. == Modern examples == Several modern day fictional characters may be considered examples of gentlemen detectives. Like Alleyn but unlike earlier gifted amateurs such as Wimsey, Campion or Miss Marple, several modern \\"gentleman detectives\\" are professional policemen. Adam Dalgliesh, the creation of P. D. James, first appeared in 1962. He flourishes in the Metropolitan Police, despite being definitely gentry where such a background may be a disadvantage. Like the earlier Miss Marple, Dalgliesh is the child of an Anglican clergyman. He is somewhat of a recluse and, more eccentrically, a successful poet. Inspector Morse, the subject of works by Colin Dexter, first appeared in 1975. He works in Oxford and is (or was) upwardly mobile: he won a scholarship to Oxford but subsequently failed. Like Alleyn and Wimsey, Morse served in the British army before joining the police, but unlike them, he served not as a commissioned officer in a prestigious regiment but as a non- commissioned officer in the Royal Military Police. Morse's snobbery is intellectual rather than a question of breeding or social advantage. Detective Inspector Lynley, first introduced in 1988, is another truly aristocratic member of the Police, being an Earl. Much of the plot of the novels by Elizabeth George revolve around his working relationship with Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers, who is of lower-class origins. Both show greater loyalty to each other than to official regulations and accepted attitudes to their relative stations, and both are capable of self-sacrificing actions of noblesse oblige. Carmen Isabella Sandiego, the \\"World's Greatest Thief\\", was first introduced in 1985. She was originally ACME Crimenet's most intelligent and distinguished lady detective with a flawless record in solved cases. She got so bored, she changed careers as a lady thief and became spymaster and CEO of V.I.L.E., all just for the challenge. Professor Layton from the video game series named after him. He first appeared in 2007. He is a professor of archaeology who solves various puzzles with his young apprentice Luke Triton. Persona 5 (2016) from the video game series run by Atlus, Akechi is known as the Detective Prince of Tokyo who seems to solve various crimes and is adored whenever he shows up on TV. Detective Inspector Alexandra \\"Alex\\" Drake (née Price), the well-bred, posh protagonist of Ashes to Ashes (2007–2009, mentioned in Life on Mars in 2006).Awake in 2008, Sam Tyler records his notes onto micro-cassettes and asks a subordinate to post a tape to Psychological Services Branch. He explains that an officer there is studying colleagues like him who have undergone traumatic events, and that talking to her has been very cathartic to him. His transcribed notes are read by Alex's daughter Molly over the opening credits of Ashes to Ashes, whereupon Alex and Molly briefly discuss the books that Alex is writing about psychologically traumatised police officers in general, and Sam Tyler in particular. DI Drake, the orphaned daughter of a solicitor and barrister, was reared from adolescence by her parents' associate after she witnessed their violent deaths and narrowly avoiding being killed with them. She attended good schools and studied psychology before joining the Metropolitan Police and fast-tracking up the ranks. A gunshot to her head in 2007 sends her back in time to 1981, three months before her parents' murders, and places her in the company of comparatively Neanderthal detectives who had transplanted themselves from the North a year earlier. Detective Sergeant Makepeace, Lady Harriet \\"Harry\\" Makepeace, one of the two eponymous characters of Dempsey and Makepeace (1985–1988). The well-schooled daughter of Lord Winfield, Lady Harriet is assigned as an armed detective sergeant in the Metropolitan Police's [fictional] specialised task force, SI 10, and finds herself partnered with (and subordinate to) working-class NYPD Lieutenant James Dempsey who is on extended loan to the Met. Benoit Blanc, a detective depicted in the film Knives Out, described by one of the film's characters as the last gentleman detective. He has a characteristic southern accent, and uses a unique technique of interpreting information he calls Gravity's Rainbow to solve crimes. Despite not being British, encompasses all the characteristics of the traditional gentleman detective. ==See also== *Crime fiction *Gentleman thief ==References * Category:Stock characters Category:Mystery novels Category:Gentry ","title":"Gentleman detective"},{"id":"20146639","text":"The Plaza Monumental de Tijuana (also called \\"Plaza Monumental de Playas de Tijuana\\" after the neighborhood in which it is located), and popularly known in English as the Bullring by the Sea, is a bullring in the city of Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico.

He subsequently returned to Sydney, where he studied arts at the University of New South Wales and then an MBA with the Australian Graduate School of Management. He was a university tutor from 1978 to 1981, the education and research officer for the New South Wales Branch of the Labor Party from 1981 to 1984, a stockbroker from 1984 to 1989, an economist for Legal & General from 1989 to 1994, and a senior adviser to Prime Minister Paul Keating (1994) and government minister Michael Lee (1994 to 1995).

They are charter members of the Southeastern Conference (SEC), and both have competed in the SEC West since 1992. ==Notable games== 1964 Sugar Bowl: In the only meeting in series history played outside of Alabama or Mississippi, #8 Alabama upset #7 Ole Miss 12–7 behind four field goals by kicker Tim Davis. Played at the end of the 1963 season, this game is notable for being the coldest Sugar Bowl in history, as snow plows were used to clear the Tulane Stadium field prior to the game.http://www.allstatesugarbowl.org/site136.php It was the first meeting of the two programs since 1944, and junior quarterback Joe Namath did not play, as he was suspended on December 9 for the remainder of the season. 1969: In what is often erroneously referred to as the first prime time regular season football game in history, #20 Ole Miss traveled to Legion Field in Birmingham to face #15 Alabama. A dazzling offensive shootout ensues, highlighted by the play of Ole Miss quarterback Archie Manning. Despite a 540-yard, 5 touchdown effort from Manning, Alabama emerged victorious 33–32 after a last minute touchdown pass by quarterback Scott Hunter. The game has been referred to as among the greatest in college football history. 1988: Ole Miss stunned #12 Alabama 22–12 in Tuscaloosa, the Rebels' first-ever road victory in the series. This game is known as \\"The Brick Bowl\\", due to a claim made by then- Alabama head coach Bill Curry that a brick was thrown through his office's window following the loss. 1989: Following Ole Miss' upset victory the year before, the Rebels hopped out to a 21–0 lead over #13 Alabama in Jackson, MS. The Crimson Tide then scored 62 unanswered points en route to a 62–27 victory. The 21-point comeback still stands as the largest in Alabama football history. 1998: This was the first overtime game in series history, with Alabama emerging victorious 20–17. It was the first overtime win in Alabama football history, as well as the first overtime loss in Ole Miss football history. 2006: In 2006, Alabama beat the Rebels in an overtime thriller. In overtime, Ole Miss made a 37-yard field goal, but Alabama scored a touchdown on a pass to Le'Ron McClain to win the game 26–23. 2007: Alabama beat Ole Miss in Oxford by scoring 10 unanswered points to win the game 27–24, amidst controversial rulings from the officials. It was Alabama's fifth consecutive victory over the Rebels. 2014: In 2014, #1 Alabama came into Oxford as a 6-point favorite taking on #11 Ole Miss. Alabama led 14–3 at the half, but were held to only 3 points in the second half. Late in the fourth quarter, Ole Miss scored a go- ahead touchdown, but missed the PAT, leaving the score at 23–17. Alabama drove to Ole Miss 32 yard line, before Blake Sims threw an interception to Senquez Golson with 37 seconds left. This was Ole Miss' first victory over Alabama since 2003, snapping a 10-game losing streak in the series. Due to sanctions, this win was vacated in 2019 due to the use of ineligible players. 2015: #2 Alabama sought revenge for the previous season's defeat, but #15 Ole Miss shot out to a 30–10 lead late in the third quarter. Alabama quickly closed the gap to 30–24 less than three minutes into the fourth. Ole Miss then scored 13 unanswered to extend their lead to 43–24, but had to fight off another Crimson Tide rally to secure a 43–37 upset victory. Alabama committed 5 turnovers in this game, the most ever under head coach Nick Saban. It was the first time in school history that Ole Miss had beaten Alabama in consecutive seasons and just the second time that the Rebels had won in Tuscaloosa. This would be the Crimson Tide's only loss that season as they went on to win the College Football Playoff national championship. 2016: #19 Ole Miss seemed to be on track for an unprecedented third-straight win over the top-ranked Crimson Tide, leading 24–3 with less than 2:47 left to play in the first half. Alabama then scored 24 unanswered points to take a 27–24 lead midway through the third quarter. Late in the fourth quarter, the Tide had extended its lead to 48–30 before Ole Miss scored twice in rapid succession to cut the deficit to five points with just under three minutes left. Alabama was able to run out the clock, preserving a wild 48–43 victory and ending the Rebels' school record two game winning streak in the series. The 21-point comeback tied the 1989 Alabama-Ole Miss game for the largest comeback in Alabama football history. ==Game results See also == * List of NCAA college football rivalry games ==References== Category:College football rivalries in the United States Category:Alabama Crimson Tide football Category:Ole Miss Rebels football ","title":"Alabama–Ole Miss football rivalry"},{"id":"20147043","text":"James Anthony \\"Tony\\" Mulvihill (27 April 1919 - 10 December 2000) was an Australian politician.

Common shell could be used against earthworks, buildings and other vehicles and artillery. Shrapnel shell was designed for use against soft targets, such as troops or cavalry, at longer ranges – for soft targets within 400 yards case shot could be used. Palliser shot was designed for use against hard targets, such as enemy ships, where it could penetrate armour plate. Initially, the gun used black powder propellant, but this was changed for Cordite propellant in the 1890s. Similarly, the black powder filling for common shells was changed for the much more powerful Lyddite filling, which increased the effect of the shell. == See also == * List of naval guns == Surviving examples == One of two guns outside the Union Buildings, Pretoria, South Africa * A gun on the deck of HMS Gannet, Chatham, UK. * 2 guns on 40-pounder RML field carriages, outside the Union Buildings, Pretoria, South Africa * Outside the entrance to the Hong Kong Museum of Coastal Defence * No. 479 on Vavasseur mount at Queens Park, Maryborough, Queensland, Australia * A gun on Vavasseur mount at The Esplanade, Cairns, Queensland, Australia == Notes  References  Bibliography == * Text Book of Gunnery, 1887.

Designed as a flour mill, it was built in 1857 on a slope opposite the western city walls of Jerusalem, where three years later the new Jewish neighbourhood of Mishkenot Sha'ananim was erected, both by the efforts of British Jewish banker and philanthropist Moses Montefiore. Jerusalem at the time was part of Ottoman-ruled Palestine. Today the windmill serves as a small museum dedicated to the achievements of Montefiore. It was restored in 2012 with a new cap and sails in the style of the originals. The mill can turn in the wind. ==HistoryOttoman era=== The windmill and the neighbourhood of Mishkenot Sha'ananim were both funded by the British Jewish banker and philanthropist Moses Montefiore, who devoted his life to promoting industry, education and health in the Land of Israel. Montefiore built the windmill with funding from the estate of an American Jew, Judah Touro, who appointed Montefiore executor of his will.Jerusalem Simon Goldhill Montefiore mentions the windmill in his diaries (1875), noting that he had built it 18 years earlier on the estate of Kerem-Moshe-ve-Yehoodit (lit. \\"the orchard of Moses and Judith\\"), and that it had since been joined by two other windmills nearby, owned by Greeks. The project, bearing the hallmarks of nineteenth-century artisan revival, aimed to promote productive enterprise in the yishuv. The mill in 1858 The mill was designed by Messrs Holman Brothers, the Canterbury, Kent millwrights. The stone for the tower was quarried locally. The tower walls were thick at the base and almost high. Parts were shipped to Jaffa, where there were no suitable facilities for landing the heavy machinery. Transport of the machinery to Jerusalem had to be carried out by camel. In its original form, the mill had a Kentish-style cap and four patent sails. It was turned to face into the wind by a fantail. The mill drove two pairs of millstones, flour dressers, wheat cleaners and other machinery. The mill as it appeared with decorative, non-functional sails and bronze cap prior to the 2012 restoration The construction of the mill was part of a broader program to enable the Jews of Palestine to become self-supporting. Montefiore also built a printing press and a textile factory, and helped to finance several agricultural colonies. He attempted to acquire land for Jewish cultivation, but was hampered by Ottoman restrictions on land sale to non-Muslims. The mill was not a success due to a lack of wind. Wind conditions in Jerusalem could not guarantee its continued operation. There were probably no more than 20 days a year with strong enough breezes. Another reason for the mill's failure was technological. The machinery was designed for soft European wheat, which required less wind power than the local wheat. Nevertheless, the mill operated for nearly two decades until the first steam-powered mill was completed in Jerusalem in 1878.Palestine in the Late Ottoman Period, David Kushner In the late 19th century the mill became neglected and abandoned. ===British Mandate=== It was not until the 1930s that the mill was cosmetically restored by British Mandate authorities together with the Pro-Jerusalem Society. During this restoration decorative, non-functional fixed sails were placed at the top of the structure. 1947–48 civil war Blowing up of the windmill by the British in 1948 During the 1948 blockade of Jerusalem the Jewish Haganah fighters built an observation post at the top of the tower. In an attempt to impede their activities, the British authorities ordered the windmill be blown up in an operation mockingly dubbed by the population \\"Operation Don Quixote.\\" By chance however, the unit tasked with destroying the windmill happened to be from Ramsgate, home to Montefiore's long-time residence. When the soldiers observed the name of their hometown next to Montefiore's on a plaque displayed on the building, they \\"re-interpreted\\" their orders and blew up only the observation post at the top of the tower, rather than the entire structure. ===State of Israel=== Over the years the building's condition had deteriorated again and following the reunification of Jerusalem in the Six-Day War another cosmetic restoration was carried out, as part of which a decorative bronze cap was added to the structure. Restoration Cap under construction in Sloten In 2012 the mill was completely restored to full working order using the original 1850s plans (which were located in the British Library) as a guide. The restoration was part of Israel's 60th anniversary celebrations. A Dutch organisation, \\"Christians for Israel\\" () promoted the scheme. A model of Stelling Minnis windmill, built by Tom Holman, was taken to the Netherlands to raise funds for the restoration. None of the original machinery survives. Millwright Willem Dijkstra rebuilt the floors, sails, cap and machinery in his workshop in Sloten in cooperation with Dutch construction company Lont and British millwright Vincent Pargeter. The windshaft was cast and machined at Sanders IJzergieterij en Machinefabriek B.V. (Sanders’ foundry and machines factory) in Goor. The parts were then shipped to Israel and reassembled on site. Dijkstra, his family and employee temporarily moved to Israel to help with the restoration. The cap and sails were lifted into place on July 25, 2012, and the mill was turning for the first time again on August 6. The first bag of flour was ground in May 2013. ==Anecdotes== Two anecdotes about the windmill appear in a 1933 book, which refers to it as the Jaffa Gate Mill. The first is that there was much opposition from among the local millers to the windmill, who looked upon it with the evil eye and sent their head man to curse it. Predictions were made that the mill would be washed away during the rainy season; after it survived intact, it was declared to be the work of Satan. The second is that the Arabs developed a taste for the lubricating oil on the bearings and would lick them, prompting fear the mill would burn down from the resulting friction. The solution was said to be placing a leg of pork in the oil barrel, whereafter the Arabs lost a taste for the oil. ==Montefiore carriage== In a glassed-in room at the windmill is a replica of the famous carriage Sir Moses Montefiore used in his travels. The original carriage was brought to Palestine by Boris Schatz, the founder of the Bezalel Academy of Art, but was destroyed in an arson fire at the site in 1986.

His surname is often misspelled as Liddel, Liddell, or Liddle. ==Early years== Liddil was born to James Milton Liddil and Elizabeth Forsby in Jackson County, Missouri in 1852. In the mid-1870s, Liddil was arrested for horse stealing in Vernon County, Missouri. == His Membership of The James Gang == After being pardoned by the Governor of Missouri, Liddil was introduced to Jesse James in 1879. Liddil joined the James Gang that year and was later described by Frank James as a \\"good industrious young chap.\\" Liddil rode with the James Gang in October 1879 when they raided a depot in Glendale, 15 miles east of Kansas City. After capturing the telegraph operator, the gang signaled a train to stop, stealing the money from the safe in the express car. Liddil later said he received slightly over $1,000 for his part in the raid. According to Liddil's later account, he became engaged to Mattie Collins the day after the Glendale raid. Liddil had met Collins in 1878 while she was on trial for murdering her employer. After Collins was acquitted on grounds of emotional insanity, Liddil introduced himself. By some accounts, Liddil served as the lookout in September 1880 when the James Gang robbed the John Dovey Coal Mine payroll in Mercer County, Kentucky. Liddil reportedly had a love of horses and attended the horse races with Jesse James at Nashville's Blood Horse Race Course in October 1880. Liddil was part of the James Gang during its 1881 robberies of a paymaster delivering money to workers on the Muscle Shoals Canal project in Alabama, and a July 1881 robbery of the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railroad at Winston, Missouri. In November 1881, Liddil and Wood Hite, a first cousin of the James brothers, became engaged in a shootout outside Adairville, Kentucky, though neither man was shot. Liddil and Bob Ford killed Hite later that year, and Liddil was wounded in the fight. After killing Hite, Liddil hid, worrying that Jesse James would seek revenge for the death of his cousin. Liddil recalled later, “I mistrusted [him, and believed] Jesse wanted to kill me.”. In January 1882, Liddil and Robert Ford surrendered to Sheriff James Timberlake at Martha Bolton's residence in Clay County, Missouri, reportedly out of fear of what Jesse James would do to him for killing Hite. Liddil told the law what he knew about the criminal activities of the James Gang, and his capture and confession were kept secret until March 1882. Shortly after Liddil turned himself in, Jesse James was shot by Robert Ford in April 1882. That summer, Liddil was taken to Alabama where he stood trial for the Muscle Shoals robbery. He was found guilty but pardoned, as part of a deal requiring him to testify against Frank James. Despite Liddil's testimony, Frank James was acquitted, reportedly because the jury concluded that Liddil, who had turned on his associates, was not a reliable witness. ==Later years== Liddil co-owned the Bank Saloon with Bob Ford in Las Vegas, New Mexico during the mid-1880s, and later leased the saloon/billiard room at the Las Vegas Plaza Hotel. Liddil returned to Missouri in the 1890s and became a regular on the Midwest racehorse circuit. Liddil worked as a horse trainer at Kentucky's Newport Park from 1896–1901. In 1901, the Cincinnati Post reported that Liddil owned several of the area's finest thoroughbreds and was one of the best-known horsemen in the West. In April 1891, Liddil was arrested for the murder of Wood Hite. The New York Times reported on the arrest as follows: Liddil died of a heart attack while attending the Queen City Races at the race track in the Latonia neighborhood of Covington, Kentucky on July 13, 1901. ==Cultural references== Liddil has been a character in several motion pictures on the James-Younger Gang. *Liddil was portrayed by Paul Schneider in the 2007 film The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. * In the 1986 made-for-television film, The Last Days of Frank and Jesse James, Liddil was portrayed by Andy Stahl. * In 1957's The True Story of Jesse James, the part of Liddil was played by Adam Marshall. * In The Great Missouri Raid (1951), Liddil was portrayed by Alan Wells. ==ReferencesCivil War St. Louis * Category:1852 births Category:1901 deaths Category:People from Jackson County, Missouri Category:Outlaws of the American Old West Category:American people convicted of murder Category:James–Younger Gang Category:American outlaws Category:People convicted of murder by Missouri ","title":"Dick Liddil"},{"id":"20147128","text":"Juan \\"Rusty\\" Theron (born 24 July 1985) is an American cricketer.

Commonly called midge orchids or pygmy orchids, they are terrestrial, deciduous, perennial, tuberous herbs found in Australia, New Zealand and New Caledonia. They are similar to orchids in the genus Genoplesium and have been included with them in the past. ==Description== Midge orchids are all terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herbs. A single thin, hollow, cylinder-shaped long surrounds and is fused to the flowering stem with a short, free tip. From a few to up to fifty tiny flowers are crowded along a thin flowering stem. As with leek orchids (genus Prasophyllum), the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The sepals and petals are hairy in some species but glabrous in others, and often have a small gland near their tips. The labellum is attached by a small hinge and in some species vibrates in the slightest breeze. ==Taxonomy and naming== In 1888, Robert Fitzgerald formally described Corunastylis apostasioides and published the description in Australian Orchids, the first time the name Corunastylis had been used. In 1889, Mueller changed the name to Prasophyllum apostasioides and in 1989, David Jones and Mark Clements placed it and most other species of Prasophyllum into Genoplesium. In 2002 Jones and Clements moved all the species of Genoplesium back into Corunastylis except for the New South Wales species Genoplesium baueri. Not all authorities have accepted the move from Genoplesium to Corunastylis, including the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families maintained by Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. The genus name Corunastylis is derived from Greek words meaning \\"a thick stick\\" and \\"a style\\". ==Distribution and habitat== Midge orchids are mainly endemic to eastern Australia, but two (C. nuda and C. pumila) occur in New Zealand and one (Corunastylis caloptera) is endemic to New Caledonia. They often grow in moist places with rushes or sedges, making tham difficult to see. ==Ecology== Most species of Corunastylis are pollinated by small vinegar flies attracted by the scent produced by glands on the flowers, but a few are self-pollinating. ==Species list== Although the name Corunastylis is not accepted by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families, it is used by Australian authorities. The following is a list of Corunastylis species as recognised in Australia. Common names are those used by David Jones. *Corunastylis acuminata (R.S.Rogers) D.L.Jones & M.A.Clem. – pointed midge orchid *Corunastylis alticola (D.L.Jones & B.Gray) D.L.Jones & M.A.Clem. – tableland midge orchid *Corunastylis anthracina D.L.Jones – black midge orchid *Corunastylis apostasioides Fitzg. – freak midge orchid *Corunastylis archeri (Hook.f.)

Junos OS allows Juniper Networks engineers to develop software features once and share these features across all product lines simultaneously, thus reducing the training for each product and interoperability in production environments. ==CLI== The Junos OS CLI is a text-based command interface for configuring, troubleshooting, and monitoring the Juniper device and network traffic associated with it. It supports two types of command modes. * Operational Mode—Monitors hardware status and displays information about network data that passes through or into the hardware. * Configuration Mode—Configures the Juniper router, switch, or security device, by adding, deleting, or modifying statements in the configuration hierarchy. ==FIPS 140-2 Security Compliance== For advanced network security, a special version of Junos OS called Junos-FIPS 140-2 Security Compliance is available, providing customers with software tools to configure a network of Juniper Networks devices in a Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) environment. ==Juniper Extension Toolkit (JET)== Junos OS offers secure programming interfaces and the Juniper Extension Toolkit (JET) for developing applications that unlock more value from the network. JET is a standard component of Junos OS, and it runs on all Juniper routers, switches, and security devices. JET simplifies the automation of operational, configuration, and management tasks, providing a rich set of open and customizable APIs for control, management, and data planes. It supports standardized programming languages for application development and communication to the Junos OS fast programmable database through standardized and open data exchange formats. It also opens up Trio and Express ASICs via a set of third-party controller-specific adapters, including SAI, OpenFlow, and P4. ==Junos Fusion== Junos fusion helps reduce network complexity and operational expenses by enabling multiple distributed devices to be managed as a single, logical device. Two different Junos Fusion architectures are available, one for provider edge and one for enterprise. ==Junos Node Slicing== Node slicing is a Junos OS feature that enables service providers and large enterprises to create multiple partitions from a single physical MX Series router. Each partition behaves as an independent router, with its own dedicated control plane, data plane, and management plane, allowing it to run multiple services on a single physical router. ==Routing Protocols and Applications== Junos OS supports a variety of routing protocols and applications. It also supports class of service (CoS), Ethernet VPN (EVPN), firewall filters and policers, flow monitoring, and Layer 2 features. It's a flexible routing policy language that is used for controlling route advertisements and path selection. Junos OS generally adheres to industry standards for routing and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS). The Junos OS supports high availability mechanisms that are not standard to Unix, such as graceful restart. ==Secure Boot== Secure boot is a significant system security enhancement based on the UEFI standard. It works by safeguarding the BIOS itself from tampering or modification and then maintaining that protection throughout the boot process. The secure boot process begins with secure flash, which ensures that unauthorized changes cannot be made to the firmware. Authorized releases of Junos OS carry a digital signature produced by either Juniper Networks directly or one of its authorized partners. ==Architecture== Junos OS has several architecture variations: * Juniper's flagship Junos OS is based on the FreeBSD operating system and can run as a guest virtual machine on a Linux VM host. * Juniper's next-generation operating system, Junos OS evolved, runs native Linux and provides direct access to Linux utilities and operations. Both operating systems use the same command-line interface (CLI) user interface, the same applications and features, and the same management and automation tools—but Junos OS evolved infrastructure has been entirely modernized to enable higher availability, accelerated deployment, greater innovation, and improved operational efficiencies. == References  External links == * * Juniper Networks to Use Oracle Berkeley DB in JUNOS Software Category:Computer networking Category:Embedded operating systems Category:FreeBSD Category:Juniper Networks Category:Network operating systems Category:1998 software ","title":"Junos OS"},{"id":"20147280","text":"Kellyville is an unincorporated community in Adair County, Kentucky, United States.

It is located at the junction of Kentucky Route 206 and Kentucky Route 76.TOPOZONE-Neatsville Topo Map in Adair County KY Its elevation is 705 feet (215 m). For unknown reasons, the town's name was spelled as Neetsville from 1876 until 1886, when the town's post office closed. In its early history from around the 1810s to 1900, Neatsville progressively grew to become a well- established, incorporated town. It has been relocated twice through the years, once due to flooding circa 1900–1902, which decimated the town, and once in the 1960s when the Green River was impounded to make way for the Green River Reservoir. ==History== Various sources and accounts have referred to Neatsville as a village, as a postal village, as a hamlet and as a town at different times in its history. The community was settled in the early 1800s by the Neats, with Randolph Neat being the first to acquire land there. As it expanded, the community grew to encompass several stores, a hotel, a doctor's office, mills, a sawmill, distilleries, a saloon, a salt works, a cooper shop, a carding machine, and a Masonic Lodge. It was incorporated as a town on February 23, 1847. Its post office was established on March 13, 1844, and closed in 1886. In 1848 the town's population was estimated to be around 50, and in 1876 the town's population was estimated at 60. The Masonic Lodge was relocated to Pellyton in 1917. ===Relocations=== Sometime circa 1900–1902, a significant flood decimated the town, necessitating its relocation from the north bank to the south bank of the Green River, at which time the former location was abandoned. Erosion had occurred in the foundations of the buildings in the former location due to the flooding. A 1916 local account of the town's former site after the flooding characterized it as \\"nearly obliterated\\" and \\"in ruins\\". Neatsville was later relocated to its present location sometime in the 1960s, when the Green River was impounded to enable the creation of the Green River Reservoir. ==NotesReferences== Category:Unincorporated communities in Adair County, Kentucky Category:Unincorporated communities in Kentucky Category:Populated places established in the 1800s ","title":"Neatsville, Kentucky"},{"id":"20147384","text":"Bruce Kenneth Childs (born 23 August 1934) is a former Australian politician.

Nominees were announced on May 22, 2008, and the award winners in 12 traditional music categories (of 47 nominees) and 23 popular music categories (of 124 nominees) were selected by a panel of 33 judges after four rounds of jury meetings. Initially, there were 10,632 submissions from 185 companies in the music industry, making it the largest submission pool in the Awards' history. Winners for artistic and traditional music categories were announced on June 21, 2008, at Taipei County Hall in a ceremony separate from that for popular music categories. It was the second consecutive year that the ceremony for this category group was held separately, and it did not attract as much media attention as the ceremony for the popular music categories. By contrast, artists from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, and Canada attended the awards ceremony for popular music categories, which was held at the Taipei Arena on July 5, 2008. Actress sisters Barbie and Dee Shu, former news anchor Patty Hou, and actress Matilda Tao hosted this event, whose list of award presenters included Canadian recording artist Daniel Powter and Japanese drama stars Akito Kiriyama, Junta Nakama, and Yuya Takaki. Both events were broadcast on the satellite cable Azio Television channel on June 28 and July 5, respectively.

Having obtained his medical degree from Paris University, Daniel began an international health career in 1971 in the context of emergency humanitarian medical missions to Biafra (Nigeria), and Peru. He was engaged in a movement with Bernard Kouchner which resulted in the foundation of Médecins Sans Frontières, of which he was the first physician working in the field (1973, Burkina Faso). Early in his career, Daniel worked over almost two decades with the World Health Organization on large scale international health programmes, including the eradication of smallpox from Bangladesh (1974–1978),Joarder AK, Tarantola D and Tulloch J (1979) Smallpox Eradication in Bangladesh (World Health Organization Monograph Series No. 8, South East Asia) World Health Organization Regional Publications, New Delhi childhood disease control programmes (1979–1984), the Expanded Programme on Immunization, the Control of Diarrhoeal Diseases Programme, the Acute Respiratory Infections Programme and as a senior member of the team who designed and started the launching of the WHO Global programme on HIV/AIDS (1987–1990). Having left WHO in 1991, Daniel was over a period of eight years a lecturer in the Department of Population and International Health of the Harvard School of Public Health and a Senior Associate of the Harvard-based François-Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights. With Jonathan Mann, with whom he was closely associated over a period of twelve years, he co-authored and co-edited a number of publications including two volumes of AIDS in the World, in 1992Mann JM, Tarantola D and Netter T (eds) (1992) AIDS in the World: the Global AIDS Policy Coalition Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass and 1996,Mann JM and Tarantola D (eds) (1996) AIDS in the World II: Global Dimensions, Social Roots and Responses Oxford University Press, New York [English, Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese] respectively. While Mann is the person most associated with the movement that seeks to integrate public health and human rights by conceptualizing them as interdependent, it is fair to say that in a less public manner Tarantola played (and continues to play) an equally key role in working to establish 'health and human rights' as integral to the on-the- ground work of IGOs, states, and NGOs. From 1998–2004, Daniel rejoined the World Health Organization headquarters in Geneva as a Senior Policy Adviser to the Director General with a specific focus on health and human rights, HIV/AIDS and communicable diseases, and family health. Additionally during the latter part of this period, Daniel occupied the function of Director of the WHO Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals. In 2005, upon retiring from the WHO, Daniel took up a professorship at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, leading a cross-Faculty research initiative on Health and Human Rights involving the Faculties of Medicine, Law and Arts and Social Sciences. In 2010, Daniel relocated to his own country, France. His current work aims at exploring the interface and synergies between health, development and human rights as they relate, among other topics, to: HIV, Hepatitis C, poverty and human development, climate change, indigenous populations, migration, refugees and post-disaster impact mitigation. He continues to be very active in the field of immunization for which he chairs a number of programme evaluations and strategic planning. ==References== Category:Australian academics Category:1942 births Category:University of Paris alumni Category:Harvard School of Public Health faculty Category:Living people ","title":"Daniel Tarantola"},{"id":"20147444","text":"John Joseph Morris (12 June 1936 – 8 February 2013) was an Australian politician.

During the opening run of 7 performances [March - May 1916], the role of Aurelius Galba was sung on two occasions, and that of Der Hirt on four occasions, by Richard Tauber. [Ref.

A review by Michael Oliver in The Gramophone enlarges upon this: \\"The plot, set in Jerusalem on the first Palm Sunday, concerns the beautiful Myrtocle, blind since birth, who longs for sight mainly so that she may see her deeply loved husband Arcesius, whom she believes to be as handsome as Apollo. She is given her sight by Christ who (his single, off-stage line) predicts that before the sun sets she will curse him. A man as handsome as Apollo indeed appears, and Myrtocle falls into his arms: it is Galba, her husband's friend, who has loved her for years. Arcesius kills him and Myrtocle, realising his love and his suffering, blinds herself again by staring at the sun. The action is framed by a Prologue and Epilogue in which a Shepherd goes in search of a lost lamb and, in the Epilogue, finds it.\\" (http://www.gramophone.co.uk/review/dalbert-die-toten-augen) ==Recordings== *d'Albert: Die Toten Augen - Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra, Dresden Philharmonic Choir *Conductor: Ralf Weikert *Principal singers: Dagmar Schellenberger, Norbert Orth, Hartmut Welker, Olaf Bär *Recording date: March, 1997 *Label: CPO - B000042OED (CD) There is another recording, deriving from a 1951 Stuttgart radio production, on Cantus Classics CACD 5.00231 F.

Tim League, founder and CEO of the Alamo Drafthouse told Jeff Mahler (a longtime BNAT attendee whose love for Teen Wolf inspired its unsuccessful inclusion in the festival each year) that the film would be screened at BNAT13WOLF, but that due to scheduling demands the pristine 35mm print film they had found had to be cut into \\"literally thousands of pieces\\" and edited into the program whenever time was available. Clips that highlighted the entirety of Teen Wolf were then inserted into the sequences of themed trailers that preceded all of the feature films. The actual clips were in extremely small segments of less than two seconds each. Most often they were only a few frames in length - a hilarious image from the movie popping up and disappearing in a flash. * Video message from Eric Vespe, Peter Jackson, Orlando Bloom, Ian McKellen and other cast and crew members of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey * Stunt Rock * Mini Teen Wolf clip * Teen Wolf Too * An American Werewolf in London * Hugo * Le Voyage dans la lune (aka A Trip to the Moon) (with live organ accompaniment by Graham Reynolds.) * Mini Teen Wolf clip * Nightflyers * The Apple * Mini Teen Wolf clip * The War Between the Planets (aka Il pianeta errante) * Just Imagine * The Killer Elite * Mini Teen Wolf clip * The Spy Who Came in from the Cold * Mini Teen Wolf clip * Top Secret * Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, preceded by video introduction by Director Tomas Alfredson and star Gary Oldman. * 35 Movies in Two Minutes * The Cheap Detective * Less Than Zero * Mini Teen Wolf clip * Young Sherlock Holmes * Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, preceded by video intro by director Guy Ritchie. * The TRON Holiday Special * The Hand * The Devil's Hand * Mini Teen Wolf clip * The Beast with Five Fingers * The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (3 times) [Originally intended to be shown first, delayed due to technical issues] * The Fabulous World of Jules Verne * Popeye * G.I.

Stan fears that Wendy Testaburger is becoming close with a popular third-grader named Bridon Gueermo (voiced by Trey Parker), because they tend to share lead roles in the musical routines. Stan talks to Bridon in hopes of directing him away from Wendy, and finds out Bridon would prefer to play basketball instead of singing. It is revealed that Bridon only sings and dances because his theater-crazed, flamboyant metrosexual father (also voiced by Parker) forces him to do it. Stan pressures him to try out with the basketball team anyway. Although Mr. Gueermo is shown to be abusive to his family (though only capable of light, effeminate slaps) Bridon eventually stands up for himself (punching his father in the face), and joins the team. Meanwhile, unhappy at becoming an outcast in school, Stan decides to join the trend and studies the High School Musical series intensively, despite having vowed against it. He convinces Kyle, Cartman and Kenny that the world has changed, and they cannot go against the tide anymore. The next day at school, the four boys perform a song along with an equally elaborate dance routine about the importance of following one's dreams. However, upon learning that Bridon has joined the basketball team, everyone else is uninterested and leaves during the boys' performance to watch Bridon play basketball instead. The four kids learn that the rest of the school just liked Bridon for his looks and charisma and not the fad itself. ==Production== \\"Elementary School Musical\\" was one of dozens of South Park episodes developed the Thursday before broadcast during a writer's meeting. High School Musical 3: Senior Year had opened in theaters several weeks before and was a national hot topic; the team had previously mentioned the series as a target for satire. The initial idea the episode was based on was that everyone in South Park is singing High School Musical-style numbers, except for the four main boys. Series co-creator Trey Parker joked during the meeting that his objective for the next week would be to write a full-blown musical. The writers returned to the idea not long afterward, and the episode was put into production. Parker and Stone watched the High School Musical movies during the development of the show. The previous episode of the series, \\"About Last Night...\\", had required the duo to view the Oceans Eleven series in preparation, which they later remarked was an easier, more enjoyable task. Upon the realization that the songs in the High School Musical series appear disconnected from the plot, Parker found it easier to write fodder songs in one week. Stone commented that the episode's story structure is unique in that characters are set up to make a decision, but the audience does not see that decision being made, and the story rather cuts to the aftermath of the decision. This is particularly evident in the episode's final moments, in which the audience never sees the boys preparing their musical number, but are surprised with it at the end. Parker and Stone noted that this structure was further explored in the next episode of the season, The Ungroundable. Stone noted that the children depicted in South Park are fourth graders, the target audience for the Disney films. He spoke in the episode's DVD commentary on how kids at that age tend to watch television in which characters are older and often adolescents. Parker and Stone both admitted their favorite part of the episode were scenes in which Bridon Gueermo's father commands the lead, as they found his character, with his slapping abuse, very amusing. ==Cultural references== The episode is a satire of the High School Musical series; when the boys watch the film in an attempt to understand the phenomenon, a song from the original film \\"Stick to the Status Quo,\\" is heard. When asked where the boys have been to be unaware of the High School Musical craze, Craig responds \\"Peru\\"; this is a reference to episodes from earlier in season, \\"Pandemic\\" and \\"Pandemic 2: The Startling,\\" in which the boys travel to the country of Peru. During Bridon's basketball game, his father is swayed by the \\"jock jam\\" music played over the loud speakers, which includes the music of Queen and Gary Glitter. When Stan is pressured to sing a song in the episode, he turns to the only songs he knows: the standards \\"Someone's In The Kitchen With Dinah\\", \\"Go Tell Aunt Rhody\\" and \\"Happy Birthday\\". At the end of the show, Kenny is seen wearing a Rolling Stones shirt. ==Reception== Travis Fickett of IGN commented that the episode \\"doesn't make as much of the idea as it could\\" and rated the episode at 7.5 out of 10. 411mania's DC Perry rated it at 7.4 out of 10 compared it favorably to other episodes of the season, but wrote that \\"[b]eing one of the best episodes of this season isn't really an accomplishment ... It just feels like they're running out of ideas.\\" Sean O'Neal of The A.V. Club gave the episode a 'B+' rating, describing it as a \\"silly-smart episode that nevertheless ranks as one of the standouts from what's proven to be a very hit-or-miss season\\". ==Home release== \\"Elementary School Musical\\", along with the thirteen other episodes from South Park's twelfth season, were released on a three-disc DVD set and two-disc Blu-ray set in the United States on March 10, 2009. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode, a collection of deleted scenes, and two special mini-features, The Making of 'Major Boobage and Six Days to South Park. ==References * \\"Elementary School Musical\\" Full episode at South Park Studios * \\"Elementary School Musical\\" Episode guide at South Park Studios * * Category:South Park (season 12) episodes Category:High School Musical Category:Musical television episodes Category:Television episodes about child abuse Category:Television episodes about domestic violence simple:Elementary School Musical ","title":"Elementary School Musical (South Park)"},{"id":"20147529","text":"This is a list of roads designated A16.

He introduced a large amount of music to American audiences, including the world premiere of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1, which he conducted in Boston in 1875. ==Biography== Benjamin Johnson Lang was born in Salem, Massachusetts, the son of a piano maker, music teacher and organist. By the age of 12 he was showing sufficient promise as a pianist to play Chopin's Ballade No. 3 in A flat.Margaret Ruthven Lang & Family He began organ lessons at 12, and by 18 he was the organist of the largest instrument in Boston, the First Baptist Church on Somerset Street. He excelled in improvisation. In 1852, he took over his father’s organ teaching business. In 1855 he went to Europe to study in Berlin and elsewhere. He studied mainly under Alfred Jaëll, but also had some instruction from Franz Liszt. He had a lasting friendship with both Liszt and his daughter Cosima. He made his first public appearance as a pianist 1858, in Boston, where he spent the remainder of his life. That year he played the piano in the first Boston performance of Beethoven's Piano Trio in C minor, Op. 1, No. 3, with the Mendelssohn Quintette Club. From 1860 to 1870, Lang built a piano and organ teaching career of great success; he was considered a very thorough teacher and his pupils included Arthur Foote, Ethelbert Nevin, William F. Apthorp, and his own children, Margaret and Malcolm. His debut as a conductor was on May 3, 1862, when he gave Boston's first performance with orchestra of Mendelssohn's Die erste Walpurgisnacht, which he presented twice in the same concert.He had previously introduced the work to Boston in January 1862 at Old South Church, but with only organ accompaniment. Louis Moreau Gottschalk was so impressed with Lang's piano playing that he hired him as a collaborator for a series of twenty concerts in which compositions for two pianos were featured. On January 1, 1863, along with Carl Zerrahn, he conducted the jubilee concert in honour of Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation. The concert was attended by Ralph Waldo Emerson, who read one of his poems. From then on he appeared in public more often as a conductor than as a pianist. He was the founding conductor the Apollo Club, a men's singing society, from 1871 to 1901. He was also the conductor of Caecilia, a mixed voice choir, and of the Handel and Haydn Society from 1895 to 97. Lang visited Richard Wagner (who was now married to Liszt's daughter Cosima) at Tribschen and Bayreuth in 1871 and offered his assistance in publicizing the Bayreuth Festival in America. In 1876 he and his wife were honored guests at the first performance of the Ring Cycle in Bayreuth. He later introduced many of Wagner’s works to America. He is perhaps best remembered now for being the conductor of the world premiere of the original version of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1, with Hans von Bülow (Cosima's former husband) as soloist, on October 25, 1875. Bülow had initially engaged a different conductor, but quarrelled with him, and Lang was brought in at short notice. George Whitefield Chadwick, who attended the performance, recalled in a memoir years later: \\"They had not rehearsed much and the trombones got in wrong in the ‘tutti’ in the middle of the first movement, whereupon Bülow sang out in a perfectly audible voice, The brass may go to hell\\".Steven Ledbetter, notes for Colorado Symphony Orchestra Lang himself appeared as soloist in a performance of the concerto with the Boston Symphony Orchestra on February 20, 1885. Other first performances he conducted were: * On the William Shakespeare tercentennial, April 23, 1864, Lang conducted the first Boston performance of Mendelssohn's complete music to A Midsummer Night's Dream, and, soon after, the first complete Boston performance of Haydn's The Seasons. * The first U.S. performance of Brahms's German Requiem, with the Caecilia Society (December 3, 1888The Canticle of the Sun * The first U.S. performance of Samuel Coleridge- Taylor's Hiawatha's Wedding Feast (1900)The Arts Fuse * With the Apollo Club he gave the first Boston performances of (among others) Brahms' Rinaldo, Grieg's Discovery, Mendelssohn's Sons of Art, Antigone, and Oedipus, and several premieres by the Boston composers Chadwick, Foote (Farewell of Hiawatha), Thayer, and Whiting (March of the Monks of Bangor, Free Lances, and Henry of Navarre) * the first Boston performance of Niels Gade's Crusaders (January 11, 1877). With his experience and credentials, it surprised many that Lang was not named conductor of the newly formed Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO). However, Lang appeared as a pianist in twelve concerts during the first years of the orchestra. On December 9, 1876 he was the soloist in the first U.S. performance of Saint-Saëns' Piano Concerto No. 2 in G minor with Leopold Damrosch conducting. With the Harvard Musical Association, he played \\"all the great concertos, many of them for the first time in Boston\\". In 1888 Lang became organist of King's Chapel, and remained there until his death in 1909. It was Lang who in 1888 encouraged Edward MacDowell to resettle in Boston, then the centre of concert life in America.answers.com The Lang home entertained prominent guests such as Antonín Dvořák and Ignacy Jan Paderewski.Library of Congress In 1891, at great personal expense he brought the entire New York Metropolitan Opera House Orchestra to Boston to present the first performance in Boston of Wagner's Parsifal, conducted by Anton Seidl, who had assisted Wagner in the first complete performance of the Ring in 1876 and who in 1889 he led the first complete Ring in America. His compositions included symphonies, overtures, an oratorio David, chamber pieces, piano pieces and songs. Most of these were performed, however the only published work was by Chadwick who used a \\"melodic motive\\" of Lang's in the first of his \\"Drei Walzer fur das Pianoforte.\\" He destroyed all his other manuscripts. In 1903, Yale University conferred on him the degree of Master of Arts. His last appearance as a conductor was on February 12, 1909, when he conducted the BSO and a chorus for a commemoration of the centenary of the birth of Abraham Lincoln. He presented Mendelssohn’s Lobgesang (\\"Hymn of Praise\\"), which he had also conducted at the Emancipation Jubilee concert in 1862. He died only a few weeks later, on April 3 or 4, in Boston. His estate was valued at over $600,000, an enormous amount for that time. His bequests included a silver box containing Liszt's hair, which he left to his daughter Margaret. ==Family life== In 1861 he married Frances Morse Burrage (1839–1934). Although she never became a professional, she was well regarded as a singer. Their three children inherited their musical aptitudes: Margaret Ruthven Lang (1867–1972), a composer; Rosamond (1878–1971), a pianist; and Malcolm (1881–1972), a pianist and organist. Many of Margaret's works were presented at concerts under her father's baton. Her Dramatic Overture, Op. 12, was the first work by a woman played by a major American symphony orchestra (BSO, 1893, Arthur Nikisch). ==NotesSources== * Louis Charles Elson, The History of American Music * Richard Aldrich, Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed,. 1954 (Eric Blom, ed.)

The match was played on 23 May 2009 at Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh; this was the second time that the Heineken Cup final had been held at Murrayfield after the 2005 final, when Toulouse beat Stade Français 18–12 after extra time. The match was contested by Leicester Tigers of England and Leinster of Ireland. While Leinster were making their first appearance in the Heineken Cup final, Leicester were playing in their fifth, having won the competition twice, though not since 2002; they did, however, finish as runners-up in 2007. Leinster won the match 19–16; Leinster took the lead via an early drop goal from Brian O'Driscoll, only for Julien Dupuy to equalise with a penalty a couple of minutes later. Leinster then moved 9–3 ahead with a drop goal from the halfway line and a penalty from Jonathan Sexton. However, after Stan Wright was sin-binned on the half-hour mark for an off-the-ball challenge on Sam Vesty, Leicester reduced the deficit to three points with another Dupuy penalty, before taking a 13–9 half-time lead via a converted try from Ben Woods. Dupuy increased Leicester's lead to seven points with a third penalty goal just after the interval, but a converted try from Jamie Heaslip brought the teams level with half an hour left to play. Then, with ten minutes left on the clock, Jonathan Sexton squeezed a penalty inside the right-hand upright to win the match for Leinster. ==Background== Murrayfield Stadium was chosen as the venue for the 2009 Heineken Cup Final on 19 May 2008. The 2009 final was the second Heineken Cup final to be hosted by the 67,778-capacity stadium, following the 2005 final, when Toulouse beat Stade Français 18–12 after extra time in front of 51,000 spectators. The 2009 final was Leinster's first Heineken Cup final, although they had reached the semi-final stage on three other occasions: in 1995–96, 2002–03 and 2005–06, when they were knocked out by Cardiff RFC, Perpignan and Munster respectively. Leicester, however, had reached the final on four other occasions: 1997, 2001, 2002 and 2007; they won the competition in 2001 and 2002, beating Stade Français and Munster, but lost out to Brive in 1997 and London Wasps in 2007. Nigel Owens of Wales was named as the match referee for the 2009 final on 13 May 2009, making him the second official to referee consecutive Heineken Cup finals after England's Chris White. Frenchman Christophe Berdos was appointed as fourth official. ==Route to the finalLeinster=== For the pool stage draw, the 24 entrants were divided up into four tiers based on their European Rugby Club ranking; each group would consist of one team from each tier, and no country could have more than one team in the same group – with the exception of France, which would have two teams in one group. Leinster was placed in Tier 2, which would mean that they would avoid being drawn with teams like Gloucester, Sale Sharks and the Scarlets, but they could still be drawn with Toulouse, Stade Français, the Ospreys and the Cardiff Blues. They ended up being drawn in Pool 2 alongside London Wasps, Castres and Edinburgh. Leinster won four of their pool stage matches, but a Matchday 5 defeat to Wasps meant that they had to equal or better the London side's result on the final matchday to be guaranteed a place in the knockout stage as group winners. In the end, Leinster's 12–3 win over Edinburgh was sufficient as Wasps were defeated in Castres and Leinster qualified as the sixth seeds for the quarter-finals, meaning that they would have to play away to third seeds Harlequins in the quarter-finals. Leinster's quarter-final against Harlequins was the last of the quarter-finals to be played, and also the lowest-scoring: Harlequins responded to two first-half penalties from Felipe Contepomi with a 65th-minute try from Mike Brown; Chris Malone had the chance to give Harlequins the lead, but his conversion attempt went wide of the far post. Brown also missed with a long-range penalty, while an injured Nick Evans, who had come on as a blood replacement under dubious circumstances, sent a last-minute drop goal attempt wide to give Leinster a 6–5 win. The draw for the semi-finals was also made in January 2009, with the winners of Leinster's quarter-final due to play against either Munster or the Ospreys. Munster came through their quarter-final comfortably, beating the Ospreys 43–9 to set up an all-Irish semi-final. As Heineken Cup holders and newly crowned champions of the Celtic League, Munster went into the game as favourites, but Leinster drew first blood with an early drop goal from fly- half Felipe Contepomi. Ronan O'Gara equalised with a penalty shortly after. Several minutes later, Leinster suffered a major blow when Contepomi went down with what proved to be a cruciate ligament injury. A penalty from Contepomi's replacement, Jonathan Sexton, and an unconverted try from Gordon D'Arcy gave Leinster an 11–3 lead; a second penalty from O'Gara reduced Leinster's half- time lead to 11–6. Another try for Leinster, this time from Luke Fitzgerald, just after the interval put them two scores ahead, before Brian O'Driscoll intercepted a pass from Ronan O'Gara to score under the posts and round off a 25–6 win for Leinster. The match marked the first time that a club rugby match had been played at Croke Park, and the 82,208 attendance for the match set a new world record in club Rugby Union. ===Leicester Tigers=== Based on their European Club Rugby ranking, Leicester Tigers were placed in Tier 1 for the pool stage draw, meaning that they would avoid being drawn with Toulouse, Stade Français and holders Munster. They were eventually drawn into Pool 3 with Perpignan, the Ospreys and Benetton Treviso. Four wins in their first five matches meant that Leicester went into their final pool match against the Ospreys needing only a point to reach the knockout stage. Within 15 minutes of the match kicking off, they were already 6–3 down; the score remained that way until half-time, after which the two teams continued to trade penalties, resulting in a final score of 15–9 to the Ospreys. The six-point margin gave the Tigers the losing bonus point they needed and they qualified for the quarter-finals as pool winners. Their pool record meant that they were given the fourth seed for the quarter-finals, meaning that they would face a home match against the fifth seeds, Bath. Leicester went into the quarter-finals as the joint-top try scorers from the pool stage, while Bath had the second- lowest number of tries. Nevertheless, it was Bath substitute Shaun Berne who scored the first try of the quarter-final, going 7–6 up after Sam Vesty had scored two penalties in the first quarter of the game. After half-time, the two teams traded penalties before Joe Maddock crossed for Bath's second try in the 64th minute. Vesty levelled the scores at 15–15 soon after, but just as the match looked like it was heading to extra time, Leicester's replacement scrum-half Julien Dupuy feinted to pass back to Vesty in the pocket for a match-winning drop goal before scurrying through a gap at the base of the ruck on the edge of Bath's 22-metre line to score a try. Leicester's 20–15 win secured them a place in the semi-finals, where they would play the Cardiff Blues, who had beaten Toulouse 9–6 earlier that day. The Blues were the only team to come through the pool stage unbeaten and, going into the quarter- finals, they were the joint-top try scorers in the competition, along with Leicester themselves. Ben Blair gave Cardiff the lead with a penalty before the 15-minute mark, but Leicester responded with a converted try from Scott Hamilton and a Julien Dupuy penalty to take the score to 10–3. Cardiff hit back with three penalties of their own before Dupuy slotted over to give Leicester a 13–12 half-time lead. After half-time, Leicester increased their lead with a converted try from Geordan Murphy and two more penalties from Dupuy; however, only a few minutes later, the Tigers were hit with two quick- fire sin-binnings, and the Blues took full advantage by scoring two converted tries from Jamie Roberts and Tom James to tie the scores at 26–26 and send the game into extra time. Aside from two missed drop goal attempts from Johne Murphy and Aaron Mauger, extra time was largely uneventful and the match went to the first penalty shootout in Heineken Cup history. The first seven kicks in the shootout were all successful, giving Cardiff a 4–3 lead before Johne Murphy stepped up; however, the Irish winger missed the target, giving Tom James a chance to win the shootout for the Blues, only for the Welshman to miss his kick, allowing Scott Hamilton to convert and take the shootout to sudden death. Both teams successfully converted two more kicks before Martyn Williams wildly hooked his attempt wide and Jordan Crane slotted over to send Leicester into the final. ==Match== Leinster beat Leicester 19–16. They led Leicester 9–3 within 30 minutes following drop goals by Brian O'Driscoll and Johnny Sexton and a penalty by Sexton. They then had Stan Wright sin-binned, with Leicester moving into a 13–9 lead at half-time thanks to a Ben Woods try. Leinster's Jamie Heaslip scored a try to level the scores in the second half, with Sexton scoring another penalty to win the match ten minutes before the end. ===Match details=== { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" - FB 15 Geordan Murphy (c) - RW 14 Scott Hamilton - OC 13 Ayoola Erinle - IC 12 Dan Hipkiss - LW 11 Alesana Tuilagi - FH 10 Sam Vesty - SH 9  Julien Dupuy - N8 8  Jordan Crane - OF 7  Ben Woods - BF 6  Craig Newby - RL 5  Ben Kay - LL 4  Tom Croft - TP 3  Martin Castrogiovanni - HK 2  George Chuter - LP 1  Marcos Ayerza - colspan=3Substitutions: - HK 16 Benjamin Kayser - PR 17 Julian White - LK 18 Louis Deacon - FL 19 Lewis Moody - SH 20 Harry Ellis - CE 21 Ollie Smith - FH 22 Johne Murphy - - colspan=\\"3\\"Coach: - colspan=\\"4\\" Richard Cockerill } valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" - FB 15 Isa Nacewa - RW 14 Shane Horgan - OC 13 Brian O'Driscoll - IC 12 Gordon D'Arcy - LW 11 Luke Fitzgerald - FH 10 Jonathan Sexton - SH 9  Chris Whitaker - N8 8  Jamie Heaslip - OF 7  Shane Jennings - BF 6  Rocky Elsom - RL 5  Malcolm O'Kelly - LL 4  Leo Cullen (c) - TP 3  Stan Wright - HK 2  Bernard Jackman - LP 1  Cian Healy - colspan=3Substitutions: - HK 16 John Fogarty - PR 17 Ronan McCormack - LK 18 Devin Toner - FL 19 Seán O'Brien - SH 20 Simon Keogh - FB 21 Rob Kearney - FB 22 Girvan Dempsey - colspan=\\"3\\"Coach: - colspan=\\"4\\" Michael Cheika - } } == Reaction == Ireland's Taoiseach Brian Cowen attended the match and said he was \\"absolutely delighted\\" and that it was a \\"real pleasure\\" to be present at a \\"hugely exciting match\\".

By sending multiple public health intervention teams in villages, Jamot's team considerably reduced the incidence of trypanosomiasis, and thus, its transmission, in Cameroun and hence the disease.

Interrelations between Resource, Labour and Capital Productivity, 8 pages or social and ecological market economy,http://www.kas.de/wf/doc/kas_18570-1522-4-30.pdf?100414191737 aims at balancing free market economics, the strive for social fairness and the sustainable use and protection of the natural resources. It was developed by Austrian politician Josef Riegler during the 1980s, expanding on the original concept of the social market economy, an economic model first advocated by Konrad Adenauer, and is considered the economic format which the majority of nations in Europe follow. == Definition and aims == The eco-social market economy is a holistic model based on a strong and innovative market economy. The eco-social market economy requires that the protection of the environment and social fairness are vital criteria for all economic activity. The protection of the ecology and habitat for future generations are central issues for eco-social market economies. Its supporters maintain that free markets alone are not able or interested to protect the environment, hence government action is necessary. The creation of higher social and environmental standards, especially in developing countries, is seen as a vital step to world peace in the future.http://www.oekosozial.at/osf?cid=13486 The eco-social market economy aims at \\"higher chances for the brave, more solidarity and more responsibility for natural habitats\\".http://www.seri.at/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=708&Itemid;=394 == Proposed measures == Frameworks and Guidelines for fair competition must be implemented, not only in the EU, but on a global level. It is a foremost demand to politics to create such a political landscape of global connectivity and cooperation. Eco-social market economists support the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals and the Kyoto Protocol, and demand a stronger cooperation between the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund and the International Labour Organization to create the said framework.http://files.globalmarshallplan.org/josef_riegler.pdf On a national level, it favours higher taxes on fossil-fuel energy sources (environmental taxes), while at the same time lowering income taxes. Public subsidies must, in their opinion, only be paid to promote sustainability. Environmental pollution and resource use must be included in the calculation of product processes and in product prices. A strong emphasis in education about issues on environmental protection are seen as being absolutely necessary to create awareness.market == Global Marshall Plan initiative == The idea of a global marshall plan, first brought forward by Al Gore in the 1990s, is a main part of eco-social thinking. The idea of a Global Marshall Plan is based on two pillars: # Innovative additional fundraising required for the actual realisation of the UN Millennium Development Goals on the basis of partnerships, co-responsibility and good governance. # The achievement of a global eco-social market economy by means of implementing the same ecological and social standards in all institutes and agreements on a global scale. The funding of these development measures are a levy on financial transactions, a kerosene tax or special drawing rights with the IMF. The big challenge is finding an effective way of translating money into development without losing to corruption worldwide. Among the prominent supporters of the initiative are Muhammad Yunus, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker and Jane Goodall. == See also == * Carbon fee and dividend == References  External links == * European Eco-social Forum * Global Marshall Plan Initiative Category:Free market Category:Environmental economics ","title":"Eco-social market economy"},{"id":"20148130","text":"The Donnelly River is a river in the South West of Western Australia. Its main tributaries are Barlee Brook and Carey Brook. The river runs primarily through state forest reserves, although 25 private landholdings are situated along the length of the river. Clearing of the catchment area is estimated at 20% with the land mostly being used for viticulture, horticulture, dairy, grazing and tourism. == History== The first European to sight the river was Lieutenant William Preston in 1831. The river was named by James Stirling, the Governor of Western Australia, in the 1830s after Admiral Sir Ross Donnelly, a friend of Stirling's father-in-law James Mangles MP. Bannister had stood in for Mangles at Stirling's wedding to Ellen Mangles. == Fauna == The Donnelly is one of the few catchments left in the state that contains all of the region's endemic freshwater fishes. Native freshwater species include salamanderfish (Lepidogalaxias salamandroides), freshwater cobbler (Tandanus bostocki), western minnow (Galaxias occidentalis), western mud minnow (Galaxiella munda), black-stripe minnow (Galaxiella nigrostriata), western pygmy perch (Nannoperca vittata), Balston's pygmy perch (Nannatherina balstoni), nightfish (Bostockia porosa), and pouched lamprey (Geotria australis). Many estuarine fish are found close to the mouth of the river, these include black bream (Acanthopagrus butcheri), flathead mullet (Mugil cephalus), yellow-eye mullet (Aldrichetta forsteri), Australian herring (Arripis georgianus), and freshwater cobbler (Tandanus bostocki). Several species have been introduced into the river, including eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), European perch (Perca fluviatilis), and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The latter is the most common, being specifically introduced for angling purposes, with over 500,000 being stocked into the system between 1999 and 2004. == Flora == Donnelly River, approximately 6km from mouth of river The river originates in an area of open jarrah-marri forest east of Yornup, between Bridgetown and Manjimup. The area contains an understorey composed of such species as bull banksia (Banksia grandis), sheoak (Allocasuarina fraseriana), snottygobble (Persoonia longifolia), prickly moses (Acacia pulchella), zamia palm (Macrozamia reidlei), balga (Xanthorrhoea preissii), and graceful grass tree (Xanthorrhoea gracilis). The river then flows through a large area of tall karri forests. The understorey includes karri sheoak (Allocasuarina decussata), oakleaf thomasia (Thomasia quercifolia) and Western Australian peppermint (Agonis flexuosa). Toward the coast the floral composition changes as the soils change to swampy flats and consolidated dunes. Species such as stout paperbark (Melaleuca preissiana), swamp paperbark (Melaleuca rhaphiophylla), yate (Eucalyptus cornuta), Warren River cedar (Taxandria juniperina), wonnich (Callistachys lanceolata), and various banksias start to dominate. ==References== Category:Rivers of Western Australia Category:South West (Western Australia) Category:South coast of Western Australia ","title":"Donnelly River (Western Australia)"},{"id":"20148133","text":"Sovannahong (, en.

Then Tani served as information chief and also, foreign minister in the cabinet of Hideki Tōjō. He was appointed foreign minister on 17 September 1942. During his tenure, Japan continued to encourage a separate peace between Germany and the Soviet Union. However, his term was short. Since bureaucrats in the ministry of foreign affairs resented Tani, on 21 April 1943, he was replaced by Mamoru Shigemitsu. After that, he received Shigemitsu's former post of Japanese ambassador in Nanjing to the Reorganized National Government of China. After World War II, Tani was detained as a suspect of war crimes until December 1948. However, he was not convicted.

The usual name references Queen Margherita of Savoy, who lived there from 1900 to 1926. It now contains a U.S. embassy. In 1885, the Boncompagni- Ludovisi family chose to sell their ancestral family home in response to a severe financial crisis. The Villa Ludovisi and most of its extensive grounds were sold in 1883 to a property developer, the Società Generale Immobiliare, which in 1885 divided the property into luxury building lots. The family retained a small portion of the original estate around the Casino di Villa Boncompagni Ludovisi (Villa Aurora), the only building from the original holdings that was not demolished. However, the Casino was not designed to be the primary family home of a noble family. The Palazzo Piombino was built from 1886 to 1890 by Gaetano Koch for Rodolfo Boncompagni Ludovisi, titular Prince of Piombino, as a new palace for the Boncompagni-Ludovisi family. It occupied one of the new developer lots at a prominent location along the Via Veneto, the new main road that developers had built through the former Villa property. The Boncompagni-Ludovisi family occupied the house for barely a decade before being forced to sell it in 1900 due to further economic difficulties, including some due to the high cost of the new palazzo itself. After the assassination of King Umberto I in Monza in 1900, his son and successor King Victor Emmanuel III purchased the palazzo from the family as a suitable residence for the newly widowed Queen Margherita, who took up residence in the palazzo on Christmas Day, 1900 for the remaining 26 years of her life. She remained active in public life in her roles as queen dowager and queen mother, and the building in which she lived become known as Palazzo Margherita. After her death, the building was divided into offices for the Mussolini government. In 1946, the US government purchased the palazzo from the Italian government, and it now houses the United States Embassy in Italy. The palazzo was extensively renovated between 1949 and 1952 to restore rooms to their earlier appearance, while also modernizing plumbing and heating systems and increasing office space. The palazzo is now protected both by Italian law for cultural heritage and by listing on the U.S. Department of State Register of Culturally Significant Property. ==References== Part of this article originated from the corresponding Italian-language article * * == Additional Images == Margherita Rome United States Category:Register of Culturally Significant Property Category:Ambassadorial residences Category:Residential buildings completed in 1890 Category:Italy–United States relations Margherita ","title":"Palazzo Margherita"},{"id":"20148252","text":"Forbidden Floor () is a 2006 South Korean film and the second installment of the 4 Horror Tales film series.

It is the oldest existing library in China. Founded in 1561 by Fan Qin during the Ming dynasty. In its heyday, it boasted a collection of 70,000 volume of antique books. The name Tian Yi refers to the concept of cosmic unity first described in a Han dynasty commentary to the Book of Changes. In Chinese alchemy Tianyi is linked to the element of water, thus it was believed by providing a watery name would protect the library against fire damage. The Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty visited Tianyi Ge, and ordered officials to draw schematics of Tianyi Ge's building plan and book cases as prototype to build several imperial libraries including Wenyuan Ge in the Forbidden City, and Wenjin Ge in the Chengde Mountain Resort to house the Siku Quanshu encyclopedia. After the Second Opium War, the British took many books from the libraries collection of geography and history texts. These losses were followed by further thefts by local thieves. By 1940, the collection dwindled to less than 20,000 volumes. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, due to governmental effort and donations by private collectors, the collection recovered somewhat to about 30,000 volumes, mostly rare antique Ming dynasty printed and hand copied volumes. In 1982, Tianyi Ge was established by the Chinese authorities as a National Heritage Site. The Qin Family Drama Stage is also located in the complex. The walls were specially constructed to prevent fire. == Background == Bamboo forest in Tianyi Pavilion === Technical improvements in paper production === Cheap bamboo papermaking. The bamboo paper is made from pulpy bamboo shoots (Phyllostachys aurea), a widely planted plant in China that has been a major source of papermaking fibers since the 8th century. Paper is traditionally made using natural materials, hand tools, utensils and naturally occurring reagents. This technology had further improved in the Ming Dynasty. Song Yingxing (1587-1666 AD) documented the work rolled up by the gradual process of this manufacture in his book,“Tian Gung Kai Wu (The Exploitation of the Works of Nature)” Tang, & Smith. (2014). A note on Chinese Bamboo paper: The impact of modern manufacturing processes on its photostability. Journal of Cultural Heritage, 15(3), 331-335. === Woodblock printing (wood engraving) === Since the typography invention of movable type printing in the Song Dynasty of China, printing technology had continued to develop. In the late Yuan Dynasty, Wang Zhen invented wooden printing. Compared with muddy characters, the resistance of wood type to external forces was better.Needham, Joseph. The Shorter Science and Civilisation in China 4. Cambridge University Press. 1994: 14. . Bi Sheng... who first devised, about 1045, the art of printing with movable type By the Ming dynasty, printing technology reached another peak. Chinese printers were able to produce illustrations of various colors, displaying various shades of colors and contrasting colors, imitating the hands of Chinese masters of calligraphy and painting. At the time, the artists' printers discovered and developed this technology, adding a strong color to their books Lin, H. (2015). Coloring the Book in Ming-Qing China: Polychrome Woodblock Printing, ca. 1600-1900 1. Quarterly Journal of Chinese Studies, 3(3), 33-49. Palace Examination === Cultural expansion and social transformation in the 15th century === The development of urbanization that began gradually in the Song Dynasty has begun to take shape in the Ming Dynasty, and commercialization and the sprouting of capitalism also appeared in the Ming Dynasty.Van Zanden, Jan Luiten. (2015). Urbanization in China, ca. 1100–1900. 0063. At the same time, the literacy rate and educational development have also been further improved during the Ming dynasty. The increasing availability and low cost of books had promoted the popularity of literacy. The examination exam had been canceled since the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368 AD) and had ushered in a new climax in the Ming Dynasty. The examination scale was increasing.Yu, L., & Walker, Galal. (2003). A History of Reading in Late Imperial China, 1000–1800, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. Publishers responded to the growing number of examination candidates to print brochures. Successful model exams were popular and widely available. A wide variety of books, ranging from cheap versions of popular novels to expensive reprints of classics have a wealth of content. The novels of the Ming and Qing dynasties represented the pinnacle of Chinese classical novels. Three of the four famous novels in China were completed and widely circulated in the Ming Dynasty. From another perspective, it also illustrated the importance and prosperity of culture and books received in the Ming Dynasty.Andrew H. Plaks, Four Masterworks of the Ming Novel (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1987), esp. pp. 497–98. The possession of books increasingly tended to define social status. Collection books had also gained a powerful boost from publishing. As the books became cheaper, the number and scale of private libraries grew during the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. A collection of serval thousand juan (bound chapters or volumes) were considered worthy of respect, and 10,000 juan (equivalent to one thousand titles) were significant. Libraries with about 30,000 juan were not uncommon. On Fan Qin's death (1585 AD), Tianyi Pavilion contained over 70 thousand juan, with several thousand titles.Rossabi, M. (2016). Imperial China, 1350-1900. Choice, 54(1), 99. == Introduction  Position and the spatial distribution === Tianyi Pavilion Historic District is located in the middle and western part of the historical street of Yuehu West Street in the old city of Ningbo. In the cultural undertakings of the feudal Chinese in the Ming Dynasty, Wen Yuan's \\"Tiangong Parterre\\" has been incorporated into Tianyi Pavilion and transformed into \\"East Garden\\" as part of the garden. Tianyi Pavilion is part of the residential area of the Fan Family and the entire area of the traditional structure of the street and the alley has disappeared. It consists of three parts: West Park, South Park and East Park. Tianyi Ge Garden Since 1989, the ancestral halls along the roads such as Qinjiatang, Wen's family temple, Chen family museum, and some factory buildings have been incorporated into Tianyi Pavilion and have become a showcase of traditional culture. The area of Tianyi Pavilion has reached the peak including the main body of the museum (library), the garden and the traditional architecture.Yan, Wei; Dong, Wei (2015) Context”Thinking of Contemporary Urban History Space under the Basis of Enlightenment of Chinese Traditional Cultural Philology: Taking West Expansion Plan of Tianyi Pavilion as An Example». International Journal of Social, Behavioral, Educational, Economic, Business and Industrial Engineering, 9(3): 925-931 === Fire prevention === Non-combustible materials were introduced into some key building components. For instance, using clay to wrap wood structures. Non-combustible masonry could be used to create partitions between two adjacent buildings and set fire doors in certain key locations. In addition, the pool in the library could serve as a fire tank for fire protection.Grace Cheng, W.Y., Lo, S.M., Fang, Z. & Cheng, C.X. (2004) A view on the means of fire prevention of ancient Chinese buildings – from religious belief to practice. Structural Survey, Vol. 22 Issue: 4, pp.201-209 === Inheritance and development === Huang ZongxiIn 1676, Fan Qin's descendants passed out more than one hundred kinds of books to scholars for reading. He approved the famous scholar Huang Zongxi to go upstairs to read the Tianyige library books. Huang Zongxi became the first foreigner to enter Tianyi Pavilion. Huang Zongxi prepared a bibliography for Tianyi Pavilion and writes \\"Records of the collection in Tianyi Pavilion\\". Documented in the book of Huang Zongxi that: Fan Qin divided his family property into two parts prior, the collection of books and other family production. The eldest son volunteered to abandon the inheritance rights of other family property, and inherited more than 70,000 volumes of books collected by his father. While the Fan's descendants maintained and supplemented the Tianyige collection, they also established ethnic rules that maintain the Tianyige collection, which stipulates that the books are shared by children and grandchildren. Tianyi Pavilion thus increased its visibility among scholars. Since then, Tianyi Pavilion had gradually ended its external closure and is open to famous scholars, although there were not many scholars who had obtained this opportunity. === Update and preservation === 1933-1934: Tianyi Pavilion was restored and refurbished, and the front and back yards of the library were added. 1982: Newly built a room for stacking cargo. Tianyi Pavilion experienced a new period of expansion. It is considered as a cultural heritage site that has been under national protection. ==Gallery== Image:Tian Yi Chamber Library.jpgTianyi Chamber library File:Zunjing Chamber.JPGThe Zunjing Hall located within the Tianyi Chamber Image:Fan Qin.JPGStatue of Fan Qin, the founder of the chamber File:Ming Dynasty wood carving books in Tian Yi Chamber colllection.JPGMing dynasty antique books in Tianyi Chamber collection Image:Tian Yi Chamber book case.JPGTianyi Chamber book case Image:Qinshi xilou.jpgQin family Drama Stage Image:Majiong museum.JPGMajong Museum display Image:Wen Yuan Chamber.JPGWenyuan Chamber Imperial Library in the Forbidden City, modeled after the Tianyi Chamber ==See also== *List of Chinese gardens ==References== Category:Libraries in Zhejiang Category:Buildings and structures in Ningbo Category:Major National Historical and Cultural Sites in Zhejiang Category:1561 establishments in China Category:Ming dynasty architecture ","title":"Tianyi Ge"},{"id":"20148288","text":"Robert Aubrey Miller (October 22, 1854 – October 8, 1941) was an American attorney and Democratic Party politician in the state of Oregon.

Local Football Facility Plans (LFFP) are being created to identify priority projects where demand is greatest, and the impact will be strongest and help stimulate the action required to deliver them. == Ambassadors == * Georgie Bingham * Dion Dublin * Graeme Le Saux * Gary Neville * John Scales * Ben Shephard * Gareth Southgate * Graham Taylor OBE * Dan Walker * Faye White * Lawrie McMenemy * Nigel Adkins * James Beattie * Chris Powell * Hayley McQueen * Duncan Watmore ==References * Category:Charities based in the United Kingdom Category:English football organisations Category:Organisations based in the London Borough of Camden Category:Sports charities Category:Sport in the London Borough of Camden Category:Organizations established in 2000 ","title":"Football Foundation"},{"id":"20148314","text":"The Right Reverend Stephen McGill PSS (4 January 1912 – 9 November 2005) was the sixth Bishop of Argyll and the Isles and second Bishop of Paisley. ==Early life== Stephen McGill was born on 4 January 1912 to Peter McGill and Charlotte Connolly in Glasgow, Scotland where he was educated at Holy Cross primary school and St Aloysius' College before entering the national junior seminary at St Mary's College, Blairs, Aberdeen. ==Priesthood== In October 1931 he entered Le Grand Séminaire at Coutances in France and was ordained priest of the Archdiocese of Glasgow at St Andrew's Cathedral, Glasgow by Bishop Henry Grey Graham on 29 June 1936. Following his ordination he returned to France where he entered the novitiate of the Sulpicians at Issy-les-Moulineaux, Paris and was incardinated priest of St Sulpice (PSS) in July of the following year. Further studies were undertaken at the Institut Catholique in Paris where he gained his licentiate in sacred theology (STL) in 1939. Thereafter he was appointed to the staff of Le Grand Séminaire at Bordeaux in October 1939 and transferred to Le Grand Séminaire at Aix-en-Provence in January 1940. At this point the Second World War was under way in Europe so, following the fall of France to the Germans in June 1940, Father McGill, as a British citizen, had to make his escape via Marseille and Spain to avoid internment as an enemy alien. On his return to Scotland he was appointed to the staff of St Mary's in Blairs where he remained as spiritual director until he was appointed rector in 1951. In 1952 he was made an honorary canon of the Glasgow cathedral chapter. ==Episcopate== When Bishop Kenneth Grant of Argyll and the Isles died suddenly in 1959 Canon McGill was appointed to succeed him by Pope John XXIII and was consecrated bishop in St Columba's Cathedral, Oban on 22 June 1960. During his time in Argyll and the Isles Bishop McGill attended sessions of the Second Vatican Council (1962 - 1965) and oversaw translation of the liturgy into Gaelic. On the death of Bishop James Black in March 1968 Bishop McGill was translated by Pope Paul VI to the see of Paisley as his successor. There he remained until his retirement in March 1988. ==Final years== In retirement Stephen McGill maintained his interest in priestly formation and was a prolific letter writer. He died peacefully in his ninety fourth year on 9 November 2005 at Nazareth House, Cardonald, Glasgow. His motto was, in Latin, Per Tuas Semitas (\\"By Your Ways\\") taken from the hymn 'Panis angelicus' by St Thomas Aquinas. ==References== * Paisley Daily Express ==Sources== * The Catholic Directory for Scotland 2006 (Glasgow, 2006) Category:People from Glasgow Category:Post-Reformation Roman Catholic bishops in Scotland Category:Bishops of Paisley Category:Scottish Roman Catholic bishops Category:Scottish Roman Catholic priests Category:Scottish Roman Catholics Category:People from Renfrewshire Category:1912 births Category:2005 deaths Category:People educated at St Aloysius' College, Glasgow Category:20th- century Roman Catholic bishops ","title":"Stephen McGill"},{"id":"20148322","text":"Bryce Canyon in 2000. Ulrike Arnold (born 1950 in Düsseldorf) is a German artist. == Biography == Ulrike Arnold studied music and art between 1968 and 1971, afterwards she worked as a teacher. From 1979 until 1986 she studied fine arts at the Düsseldorf academy in Professor Klaus Rinke'shttp://www.klausrinke.com/masters class. She was granted the Eduard von der Heydt apprenticeship of Wuppertal in 1988. Since 1980 the artist travels through all five continents to work although Ulrike Arnold mainly lives and works in Düsseldorf and in Flagstaff, Arizona. ==Work as artistEarth paintings=== Earth paintings are typical of Arnold's art as she uses a unique material. She paints pictures with sorts of soil, minerals and stones on nettle fabric and on stone. She collects her colours in form of minerals which she then grinds to a paste for painting. The titles of her pictures correspond to the places across the world where she has found her ingredients, like Flagstaff, Arizona or Bryce Canyon in Utah. The structures, forms and colours of those paintings mirror the quality of the landscape where they are created on site. There they are exposed to the natural conditions of the place which even enhance their intensity. ===Comet pictures=== Since 2004 Ulrike Arnold is continuously expanding her repertoire of resources. She is the first artist worldwide to use particles of meteorites (nickel, iron and chondrules) which she purchases from research facilities.http://www.ulrikearnold.com/ua_3_meteorits.html%20laboratoires%20de%20recherches Those valuable substances originate from asteroids and comets. Their dark dust bears witness to the early universe. With it, Ulrike Arnold goes beyond the use of terrestric materials to create cosmological pictures. ===Collections=== Her art work can be found at many public museums and private collections, such as the North Rhine-Westphalian State Chancellery at Düsseldorf, the Düsseldorf museum of arts, the Ernst & Young collection, also Düsseldorf, at Deutsche Bank, Cologne, GLS bank, Bochum, Dennis Hopper's private collection at Venice, Los Angeles, California, Langen Foundation's collection at Neuss, Center for Art and Environment, Nevada Museum of Art Reno, Nevada or the Vollstedt private collection, the Museum of Northern Arizona, Flagstaff, and the Collection of Marvin and Kitty Killgore Southwest Meteorite Lab, Payson Arizona. == Single Exhibitions == * 1987 Cologne, Gerstman Abdallah Fine Art; Sydney: Institut Goethe, * 1987 Melbourne, Australia, Gerstman Abdallah Fine Art * 1989 Wuppertal Kunstverein * 1991 Leverkusen, Museum Morsbroich, Earth Art, Studiogalerie * 1992 Cologne, Galerie Nawrocki * 1994 San Francisco USA, Brian Gross Gallery * 1994 Frankfurt, City Hall; Essen, Museum Folkwang * 1995 Berlin, Galerie Körnerpark * 1997 Cologne, Anoniterkirche, International Earth Day, Kassel, Alte Brüderkirche; Essen, Galerie Ricarda Fox * 1999 Düsseldorf, Booz, Allen & Hamilton * 2000 University of Arizona, Tucson Arizona USA, Joseph Gross Gallery; Düsseldorf, Galerie Beethovenstrasse * 2001 Grand Canyon, Arizona USA, Kolbstudio * 2001 Kyoto, Japan Art in Machiya * 2003 Fürstenfeldbruck, Earth Paintings, Gallery Angie Schäfer; Galerie Beethovenstrasse, Düsseldorf * 2004 Wuppertal, Exhibition space Wischerstraße * 2005 Cologne, Deutsche Bank AG: erdnah - sternenfern * 2006 Mönchengladbach, Altes Museum: Erdgestein und Sternenstaub * 2007 Santa Fe, William Siegal Gallery * 2009 Berlin, Musee des sciences naturelles: Sternenstaub und Erdgestein * 2010 Paris, Cité des Sciences et de l'industrie Paris, 400 ans après Galilée * 2011 Seedorf, Herzogtum Lauenburg, Schaalsee-Galerie * Group exhibitions == Bibliography == * 1991 Rolf Wedewer, Helen Koriath: catalogue, EARTH, Studiogalerie Museum Morsbroich Leverkusen. * 1994 Gerhard Finckh, Ulrike Stottrop, Ulrike Arnold: catalog, Ulrike Arnold, Erdbilder aus fünf Kontinenten, Frankfurt 1994, Essen 1994, Berlin 1995, Kassel 1997. * 1997 Klaus Flemming, Künstlerische Zeitspuren: catalogue, Ulrike Arnold, Fels- und Höhlenmalerei, Rheinbraun Cologne. * 1999 Engelbert Broich: catalogue, Erdbilder aus fünf Kontinenten, Booz, Allen & Hamilton, Düsseldorf 1999. * 1999 David Galloway, Polemics and Poetry of Environmental Art, in: catalogue, Natural Reality positionnement artistique entre la nature et la culture, 1999, Ludwigforum für Internationale Kunst Aachen/Aix-La-Chapelle. * 1999 L.

SDUB) is a library network in Denmark. It acts as a knowledge center for the entire region of Southern Denmark, with departments in six cities. Researchers and students at the University of Southern Denmark are its primary users, but companies, organizations and educational institutions, such as upper secondary schools, are also among its users. ==History== In 1999, Odense University, the Southern Denmark School of Business and Engineering and the South Jutland University Centre were merged to form the University of Southern Denmark (SDU). The research libraries belonging to these institutions were merged to form the University Library of Southern Denmark. In 2006, the Odense University College of Engineering was merged into SDU. At the same time, the Odense Technical Library became a part of SDUB. In 2007, the Business School Centre in Slagelse and the National Institute of Public Health and their libraries were also incorporated in the University of Southern Denmark. During the last few years, some of the Library departments have been renovated. This has happened at the main library at Campusvej and in Kolding. The Technical Library will move to Campusvej in the summer of 2015. ==Libraries== University Library of Southern Denmark - Odense The University Library has several specialised sub-libraries and also collaborates with Odense University Hospital (OUH). In Odense, there are the Mathematical Library, the Medical Research Library at OUH and the Music Department at the Carl Nielsen Academy of Music. The Music Department takes care of the jazz collection of the University Library of Southern Denmark, which is just one of the library's many special collections. ==Collection== The University Library of Southern Denmark provides access to books, journals, newspapers, maps, musical scores, microfilms, and a wide variety of electronic resources. The library has about 1.6 million printed volumes and gives access to about 103.500 electronic journals, 427.000 e-books and a large number of online databases, 460 at the moment (all figures are from March 2015).

Furthermore, the library offers e.g. course resources and Libguides, and provides many courses for users on information searching and academic conduct in various connections. The library, together with a number of other units and academic milieus at SDU, has also established a Learning Commons, where students can get help with generic academic competences. ==Collaboration== The University Library of Southern Denmark participates in the national library collaboration of libraries, and therefore we can get books from all public libraries and research libraries in Denmark. The library also collaborates with partners in other countries on giving access to books and journals, both in printed and digital formats. The Library collaborates with various external institutions, e.g. Denmark’s Electronic Research Library (DEFF), on providing services for researchers and students. This has resulted in the development of a number of online resources on plagiarism (Stopplagiat.nu), academic information management (the UB-test), and information literacy (BINKO 2.0). This last is an open source tool, and can be freely used by educational establishments who can customize it for their own students.

He was an illegitimate son of William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke (1423–1469), and Maud ap Howell Graunt, a daughter of Adam ap Howell Graunt (Gwynn). Richard had a full brother named George. Richard Herbert of Ewyas should not be confused with his uncle, Sir Richard Herbert of Coldbrook. ==Herbert legacy== The titles and estates of the Earl of Pembroke descended to Herbert's younger, legitimate half-brother William, but he achieved notability through his own merit and through his descendants: \\"Sir Richard Herbert, of Ewyas, who, though illegitimate, is ancestor of the men who have really, in modern times, rendered the name of Herbert illustrious.\\" In 1465, Richard Herbert was granted Westminster, manors of Grove, Radnore, Mookas, Brutescourt, Throuckeston, Westhide, Egelton, Redehire, Howton and Wormeton Tirell, in Herefordshire. He was successful as a Gentleman Usher to King Henry VII and was appointed Constable and Porter of Abergavenny Castle on 22 July 1509. While Herbert is most often named as \\"Sir Richard Herbert,\\" there is uncertainty as to whether he was knighted. In \\"The Knights of England\\", there is a record of a Richard Herbert being knighted in 1513, but that was three years after this man's death. According to Sil, Richard was never knighted, but was an Esquire. Richard is entitled Esquire in 1465, when he was granted manors and lands. However, other sources call him \\"Sir Richard Herbert\\", and an article entitled \\"The Family of Herbert\\" in The Gentleman's Magazine states that he was knighted by King Henry VIII, in which case as he died in 1510 he would have been knighted in the last year of his life, and the first year of Henry VIII's reign, which began in 1509. ==Marriage== Richard married Margaret, a daughter of Sir Matthew Cradock of Swansea and of Alice (or Jane) Mancell, widow of John Malefant. Sir Matthew Cradock was receiver of Glamorgan, through whom Castleston Castle passed to his daughter Margaret and Richard Herbert. ==Issue== Richard and Margaret Herbert had three surviving sons, one of whom was William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke (1501–1570), who was created Earl of Pembroke (of the second creation) on 11 October 1551. Later Earls of Pembroke and Montgomery, and of Carnarvon, and the Dukes of Powis, of Pool Castle (extinct 1747), descend from Sir Richard Herbert. Through a female line the Marquis of Bute derives his Glamorganshire estates. Herbert's son William married Anne Parr, sister of Queen Catherine Parr, the sixth and last wife of Henry VIII. William served Henry VIII in many capacities, including Chief Gentleman of the Privy Chamber, Privy Councillor, and Receiver of the King's revenues. He was knighted in 1544 and later appointed a Knight of the Garter. Another son was Sir George Herbert of Swansea, who was ancestor of the Herberts of Swansea, Cogan, Cookham, and the White Friars, who became extinct in 1739. Candleston Castle passed from Richard and Margaret to their son George. Richard was also the father of the illegitimate Herberts of Dinas Powis and Hengastell. ==Death== Richard Herbert died between 2 and 12 September 1510 and was buried in Abergavenny Church; his tomb has a lavishly decorated wall arch and an alabaster effigy. ==References== Category:15th-century births Category:Year of birth missing Category:1510 deaths Richard Category:People from Abergavenny Category:People from Herefordshire Category:Ceremonial officers in the United Kingdom Category:16th-century English people ","title":"Richard Herbert (died 1510)"},{"id":"20148363","text":"Roommates () is a 2006 South Korean film and the third installment of the 4 Horror Tales film series, all with different directors but with the same producer; Ahn Byeong-ki. ==Plot== Roommates Yoo-jin, Eun-soo, Bo-ram, and Da- young are cramming for a college entrance exam.

The team was led by head coach Chip Kelly in his first season as a head coach at the Division I FBS level. Kelly was only the third Ducks head coach since 1977 and led the Ducks to a Pac-10 Championship and was named Pac-10 Coach of the Year. He took over for Mike Bellotti. The Ducks finished the season 10–3, 8–1 in Pac-10 to claim the Pac-10 championship and earn the conference's automatic BCS berth where they were invited to the Rose Bowl, the school's fifth Rose Bowl and first since the 1994 season. They were defeated by Ohio State 26–17. ==Previous season== The 2008 Oregon Ducks football team entered the season ranked 21st in the AP Poll, after finishing the 2007 season ranked 23rd. The major question going into the season concerned the position of quarterback. Oregon's top two quarterbacks, Dennis Dixon and Brady Leaf, had graduated the year before, with Dixon being drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the fifth round of the 2008 NFL Draft. Sophomore Justin Roper was named the starter after Nate Costa suffered a season-ending injury before the season began. As a freshman, Roper had led the Ducks to a Sun Bowl win over South Florida in 2007. He was injured in the third game at Purdue, and was replaced by junior college transfer Jeremiah Masoli. Masoli had led his junior college team to a national championship the year before. Masoli was inconsistent in his first few games, as he put up good rushing numbers but shaky passing stats. But he came on strong the last three games of the regular season and led the Ducks to a 9–3 regular season record and a victory over the Oklahoma State Cowboys in the Holiday Bowl. Senior Jeremiah Johnson led Oregon in rushing with 1,201 yards while LeGarrette Blount record 1,002 yards and set a school record with 17 rushing touchdowns. Oregon scored over 500 points for the second straight season, and finished the season being ranked 10th in the AP Poll. ==Pre- season== July 29 – Senior Ed Dickson is named to the Mackey Award watchlist, given out to the nation's best tight end. August 4 – Junior Jeremiah Masoli is named to the watch list for the Davey O'Brien Award. August 8 – Senior LeGarrette Blount is named to the watch list for the Walter Camp Award. ===Pre-season departures=== Quarterback and wide receiver Chris Harper, quarterback Justin Roper, and wide receiver Aaron Pflugrad all decided to transfer from the team before the 2009 season. ===Recruiting=Schedule== University of Oregon official schedule ==Game summariesBoise State=== 2nd Meeting. 0–1 All Time. Last Meeting Boise State 37, Oregon 32 Uniform combination: white helmet, white jerseys, white pants Oregon's offense was completely shut down in the first half and was unable to gain a single first down. They allowed the Broncos to get into their red zone multiple times, but Oregon's defense held them twice. Both times resulted in Boise State attempting field goals after having a first and goal situation. Both field goals in the first quarter were missed by kicker Kyle Brotzman (29 and 47). In the second quarter, the Broncos scored on a TD pass from quarterback Kellen Moore to wide receiver Austin Pettis. Michael Choate ran in the two-point conversion. Billy Winn added to Boise State's first half score by tackling running back LeGarrette Blount for a safety. At the end of the first half, Kyle Brotzman booted in a 45-yard field goal to make the score 13–0. A low- scoring second half did not stop the Ducks from scoring a touchdown along with a two-point conversion. The rest of the game was back and forth until the clock expired, Boise State winning by 11. After the game, Blount, who earlier in the week was quoted as saying, \\"We owe that team an ass-whuppin,\\" punched Bronco DE Byron Hout in the chin after Hout had taunted him in front of Boise State head coach Chris Petersen. Blount then went after fans in the front row of the south end zone before being restrained and escorted off the field by security, police, and Oregon coaches. The next day, Oregon suspended Blount for the rest of the season, seemingly ending his career. However, in October, Kelly announced that Blount could return as early as November provided he meets certain academic and behavioral benchmarks.Hunt, John. Oregon's Chip Kelly defends change of heart; LeGarrette Blount could play by Stanford game. The Oregonian, October 2, 2009. ===Purdue=== Uniform combination: green helmets, green jerseys, green pants The Ducks evened their 2009 record at 1–1 with a thrilling 38–36 win over Purdue in their first visit to Eugene. Jeremiah Masoli rushed for 84 yards and a touchdown and LaMichael James rushed for 56 yards. Walter Thurmond III returned an interception for a touchdown in the first half and Javes Lewis returned a fumble for a touchdown in the third quarter. With a minute and one second left to play Purdue failed on a two- point conversion that would have tied the game. Oregon recovered the onsides kick attempt and ran out the clock. Jamere Holland had 72 yards on 4 receptions but dropped a sure touchdown pass in the fourth quarter. ===Utah=== Uniform combination: white helmet, green jerseys, silver pants Utah brought the Nation's longest winning streak of 16 into Autzen Stadium this year. This was the first meeting between the schools since a 17–13 Utah win at Salt Lake City in 2003. The Utes last trek to Autzen Stadium was in early September 2001, when Joey Harrington and the Ducks handled Utah 24–10 on their way to an 11–1 record and No. 2 in the Nation finish. ===California=== Uniform combination: throwback uniforms, yellow helmet, green jerseys, yellow pantsUniform combination: white helmet, green jerseys, silver pants Cal has run off three in a row against the Ducks, more than any other Pac-10 school against Oregon. The Golden Bears streak is their longest versus Oregon since the 1970s. Cal won a waterlogged game at Berkeley last year, 26–16. The Oregon Ducks quarterback Jeremiah Masoli struggled in previous games but had a major breakthrough against Cal, throwing 253 yards with 21 completions out of 25 attempts, three for touchdowns. Oregon tight end Ed Dickson had a career day with 11 catches for 148 yards and three touchdowns. The Oregon defense played very well, holding Jahvid Best who tied a Pac-10 record for rushing touchdowns the week prior, to just 55 yards on 16 carries. Before the game, Best was quoted as saying Autzen Stadium was the only venue where the crowd noise troubled him. The Ducks had a rough start to the game when Walter Thurmond fumbled the opening kickoff reception. Thurmond was hit in the knee on the return and was later diagnosed with a torn ACL and ended up missing the rest of the season. Cal took possession and, on a drive that went for negative eight yards, scored a field goal, their only points in the game. The two teams went back and forth on several miscues. In the first quarter on the Ducks' first scoring drive, running back LaMichael James fumbled the ball and was picked up by Cal's defensive back Josh Hill. During his run back, Hill fumbled the ball again which was recovered by Oregon. In the second quarter, Cal recovered a fumble by Oregon, only to fumble the ball back on the very next play. Later that quarter, Oregon punter Jackson Rice kicked the ball off the side of his foot for a 5-yard punt. After a quick three-and-out by Cal, Brian Anger, Cal's punter, booted the ball off the side of his foot for another 5-yard punt. Masoli's first touchdown pass of the season occurred in the first few seconds of the second quarter, a 26-yard completion to Ed Dickson. Since Cal's first field goal, the Ducks went on to score 42 unanswered points to win the game. It was Cal's worst loss with Jeff Tedford as the head coach. ===Washington State=== Uniform combination: black helmet, yellow jersey, black pants Oregon has won two in a row, and four of the last five against Washington State. The last two games have resulted in 63–14 and 53–7 victories by the Ducks. The Cougars have not won at Autzen since 2003 when they defeated Oregon 55–16. ===UCLA=== Uniform combination: green helmet, white jersey, green pants Oregon won last year's match-up with UCLA 31–21 in Eugene. The Ducks last trip to the Rose Bowl in 2007 was a humbling experience, as they were shut out for the first time since 1985 by a score of 16–0. That game however was played the week after they had lost star QB Dennis Dixon to injury for the season. At game time, current Bruins head coach Rick Neuheisel was 4–2 against the Ducks going back to the days he coached the Colorado Buffaloes and the Washington Huskies. Since the first game in 1928, UCLA was leading the series 39–23. With a solid performance in the first half and taking a field goal lead into the locker room, the Bruins gave up three quick touchdowns within few minutes of the third quarter to give the Ducks their fifth win of the season. The Ducks scored on Kenjon Barner's 100-yard kickoff return, on Talmadge Jackson's 31-yard interception, and on Nate Costa's 20-yard pass to Jeff Maehl, which was resulted from a UCLA fumble. The Bruins scored their only touchdown when Akeem Ayers intercepted a Costa pass in the back of the Rose Bowl north end zone by keeping his feet in bound. Kai Forbath kicked a 52-yard field goal to give UCLA the early lead. Oregon’s Rob Beard attempted a 51-yard field goal, which was blocked by Jerzy Siewierski. Mogan Flint kicked a 33-yard field goals for the Ducks in the fourth quarter.Final Stats – No. 13 Oregon at UCLA , GoDucks.com, October 10, 2009 ===Washington=== Oregon has won a school record five in a row over their hated rivals to the north, all by 20 or more points. Washington's last win over the Ducks came at Husky Stadium in 2003. Uniform combination: black helmet, white jersey with silver numbers, black pants After Erik Folk's 33-yard field goal in the first quarter for Washington, Oregon blocked a punt and recovered the ball in the endzone in the second quarter to give the Ducks their first lead. Javes Lewis intercepted Jake Locker's pass in the end zone to give the ball back to Oregon, which resulted in Jeremiah Masoli's 1-yard touchdown. With a second left, Folk kicked a 48-yard field goal to end the half, which was aided by a personal foul on Oregon. With good field position at their own 47-yard line, the Ducks scored their third touchdown on Masoli's 3-yard run in the top of the third quarter. ===USC=== USC had not won a game in the state of Oregon for the past three years, a streak that the Ducks kept alive.Gary Klein, It's a big game for Trojans – and Pete Carroll, Los Angeles Times, October 30, 2009 USC beat Oregon in the Los Angeles Coliseum last year, 44–10. Uniform combination: green helmet, green jersey, black pants The tenth ranked Ducks handed the Trojans their worst loss since 1997 and Pete Carroll the worst loss in his tenure at USC. Ducks quarterback Jeremiah Masoli passed for 222 yards, and a score, and ran for 164 more, including a touchdown, while LaMichael James ran for 183 yards. ===Stanford=== The Ducks will go for their 8th straight win against Stanford this season. It is their longest current win streak against any Pac-10 school. The seven straight wins also ties the longest stretch of dominance in school history over the Cardinal (1957–63). Oregon came from behind and won last year in Eugene on a last minute touchdown, 35–28. Stanford's last win against Oregon came in Eugene in 2001. That was the Ducks only loss that season, on their way to an 11–1 finish and No. 2 final ranking. Uniform combination: green helmet, white jersey, white pants Oregon's undefeated conference season came to an end at Stanford, 51–42. Both teams have five victories in the Pac-10 championship race. ===Arizona State=== Oregon has won four straight over the Sun Devils by an average of 23.8 ppg, including last year's 54–20 win in Tempe. Uniform combination: black helmet, black jersey, black pants ===Arizona=== Uniform combination: green helmet, white jersey with silver numbers, black pants The previous trip the Ducks took to Tucson in 2007 was a crushing one as the Ducks saw their BCS National Championship Game hopes fade as their star quarterback Dennis Dixon tore his ACL in the first half of the game. The 2009 game was also important, as it involved the only two teams that week in the Pac-10 who were able to control their path to earn an outright Pac-10 Championship. It was a hotly contested game as neither team led by more than 10 points after Arizona's first touchdown in the second quarter. Ducks quarterback Jeremiah Masoli started with a sluggish game with two recovered fumbles and an interception to set up Arizona's first touchdown. Late in the game, however, he led the Ducks to a narrow victory with two key touchdown passes and a rushing touchdown of his own. After Arizona scored a touchdown in the only score of the third quarter to put them up by 3, the game turned into a frantic sprint with numerous close calls. Morgan Flint attempted a 43-yard field goal for the Ducks that bounced in after hitting the crossbar, tying the game. With three minutes left in the game and Arizona ahead by a touchdown, Talmadge Jackson intercepted Arizona quarterback Nick Foles's pass in the end zone on a 3rd and 16 play at Oregon's 40-yard line. As Oregon drove down the field in the remaining minutes, the student section poured into the Arizona sideline as they prepared to rush the field. However, the drive ended with a touchdown pass from Masoli to Dickson. The Ducks tied the game as Oregon backup quarterback Nate Costa corralled an errant snap for the extra point kicked by Flint. The Arizona student section made their way back to the stands as overtime began. The two teams traded a pair of touchdowns in the first overtime but in the second overtime, Arizona settled for a field goal and Oregon scored a touchdown to win the game. After the conclusion, the Arizona section at one end of the stadium next to the visiting section began to throw debris at the Oregon players. An Oregon cheerleader, Katelynn Johnson, was struck in the head with a full water bottle, giving her a concussion. ===Oregon State=== Uniform combination: yellow helmet, throwback green jersey, white pants The Ducks crushed the Beavers' Rose Bowl aspirations for the second year in a row and managed to secure their own with a 37–33 home victory over the Beavers at Autzen Stadium. Quarterback Jeremiah Masoli ran over safety Lance Mitchell in order to reach a first down much like his performance against UCLA and Oklahoma State last year where he ran over other players. Suspended running back LeGarrette Blount saw his first action since the Boise State loss and took out his frustration this time in a sportsman like way by running over Oregon State linebacker Keaton Kristick who was regarded as the most feared player in the Pac-10. Blount also stiffarmed and threw Stephen Paea to the ground who was regarded as the best defensive tackle in the Pac-10. When Oregon was down 30 to 21 Blount broke free and rushed for a 12-yard touchdown to bring the game closer before Lamichael James broke free for 52 on a touchdown run. In total Blount rushed for 7 times for 51 yards and a touchdown. ===Ohio State (Rose Bowl)=== Uniform combination: white helmet, green jersey, white pants Oregon returns to the Rose Bowl for the fifth time and first since the 1994 season. That year the Ducks lost to No. 2 ranked and undefeated Penn State, 38–20. Oregon has never beaten Ohio State in their seven previous meetings. Their most recent meeting occurred in Columbus in 1987, with the Ducks losing 24–14. Oregon and Ohio State have played in the Rose Bowl once before. The 1958 Rose Bowl game turned out to be a defensive struggle as the Ducks eventually lost to the heavily favored Buckeyes 10–7. Ohio State would go on to share the National Title that year, the Ducks would have to wait 37 more years to return to Pasadena. Ducks QB Jack Crabtree was named MVP of the game that year, the last and only second time ever that a person from the losing team had been bestowed that honor. This time the Ducks will try to win the Rose Bowl for the first time since 1917, a 14–0 victory over Pennsylvania. The Oregon Ducks lost to the Ohio State Buckeyes in the Rose Bowl in 2010, 26–17.2010 Tournament Times, A Publication of the Tournament of Roses Association, 121st Edition, Winter 2009 1st quarter * 11:38 OSU Saine 13-yard pass from Pryor (Pettrey kick) 7–0 OSU * 0:34 OSU Barclay 19-yard field goal 10–0 OSU 2nd quarter * 14:24 ORE Flint 24-yard field goal 10–3 OSU * 9:05 ORE Blount 3-yard run (Flint kick) 10–10 * 1:05 OSU Barclay 30-yard field goal 13–10 OSU * 0:00 OSU Pettrey 45-yard field goal 16–10 OSU 3rd quarter * 11:03 ORE Masoli 1-yard run (Flint kick) 17–16 ORE * 6:36 OSU Barclay 38-yard field goal 19–17 OSU 4th quarter * 7:02 OSU Posey 17-yard pass from Pryor (Pettrey kick) 26–17 OSU ==Roster== { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"text-align: left;\\" -  colspan=\\"9\\" style=\\"color:#fc0; background:#066; text-align:center;\\" 2009 Oregon Ducks - valign=\\"top\\" Cornerbacks *6 Walter Thurmond III *8 Brian Butterfield *13 Tyrone Radford *14 Javes Lewis *17 Willie Glasper *18 Anthony Gildon *36 Will Wallace *37 Talmadge Jackson III *N/A Cliff Harris Defensive backs *12 Brian Jackson *28 Scott Grady *34 Pono Kam Defensive Ends *33 Tyrell Irvin *39 Will Tukuafu *41 Matt Simms *45 Terrell Turner *66 Taylor Hart *86 Chris DiVincenzo *89 Mike DiVincenzo *94 Keaton Arden *99 Zac Clark Defensive Tackles *50 Simi Toeaina *59 Terrance Montgomery *88 Brandon Bair *90 Blake Ferras *92 Wade Keliikipi *93 Anthony Anderson *96 Andrew Iupati width=\\"25\\" valign=\\"top\\" Linebackers *11 Eddie Pleasant *25 Bo Lokombo *35 Spencer Paysinger *38 Tyler Briffett *40 Blake Thompson *43 Bryson Littlejohn *44 Brandon Hanna *46 Michael Clay *47 Kiko Alonso *53 Dewitt Stuckey *54 Riley Showalter *55 Casey Matthews *56 Josh Kaddu *57 Keloni Kamalani *58 Kenny Rowe *64 Jennings Stewart Long Snappers *51 Steven Patterson *59 Jeff Palmer Offensive Linemen *52 NaDerris Ward *54 Jordan Holmes *57 Trevor Fox *61 Nick Cody *62 Rhein Amacher *63 Mana Greig *64 Max Forer *68 C.E.

The Daai consist of 32 Chin tribes, which have been registered by the Government of Burma since 1890. The recent Military Regime’s census mentions the Daai tribe as the 62nd of 135 tribes of Burma. Researchers refer to them as the Daai group in the ethnic survey book of Burma. The Daai Chin appear to be of Mongolian, Indo- Chinese, and Tibeto-Burman descent. The Daai people live in the Mindat, Paletwa, Matupi and Kanpetlet townships of Southern Chin State in Burma. There are more than 180 Daai villages with a total population of somewhere between 40,000 and 50,000. Their population makes the Daai-Chin the majority tribe of the Southern Chin Hills. == Daai History== The Daai land was an independent country until the British expedition in 1890, and later annexation in 1897 by the British Empire. The Daai language varies slightly between sub tribes. Their ethnic tribal symbol is the khuum (rocket tail dragon). The ling leih (Bulbophyllum refractum, one of orchid species) is their royal flower. About 99% of Daai are Christians. ==Location== Dailand Map The Daai Chin inhabit a part of the Southern Chin State of Myanmar, located on the mainland of Southeast Asia. It is surrounded by China to the north and northeast, Laos to the east, Thailand to the east and southeast, India to the northwest, Bangladesh to the west and the Andaman Sea to the south. The country is divided into four topographical zones. The Eastern Shan Plateau is a highland region that merges with the Dawna and Tenasserim Yoma mountain ranges. The central belt zone covers the valleys of the Irrawaddy, Chindwin and Sittang rivers as well as a mountainous region to the north and a low lying delta to the south. The third region is the western mountain zone, also known as the Arakan Mountains, a series of ridges that start in the northern mountain area and extend to the southwestern corner. The Arakan coastal zone is a narrow alluvial strip lying between the Arakan Mountains and the Bay of Bengal. The Daai land is situated in the southern part of the Chinland (Chin state) located on the western mountain zone of Myanmar. It is also located between north latitude 20˚ 42' and 21˚ 35', and between east longitude 93˚ 14' and 94˚ 8'. Daai land covers the west of Mindat Township, the northwest of Kanpetlet township, the northeast of Paletwa township and to the southeast of the Matupi township. The longest part of their land is about 120 miles (193 km) and the narrowest part is roughly 60 miles (96 km). The Daai land is mountainous and situated between 800 m–3200 m above sea level. Daai Land has thousands of slope ranges of mountains, brooks, streams and a small river called the Lemro River. The biggest stream is Mone (မုန်းချောင်း). Many natural water courses flow through the mountain ranges running from north to south, forming valleys and gorges. \\" The very word Daai is derived from the word Thai/ Daai, meaning peace, plain and harmony, and its root for adjective form is Do, Dam, and Daai, literally meaning plain or good for Do, valley or plain for Dam, and cool for Daai. Therefore, we can note that the term Dai as plain though the present location is hilly and mountainous. At present the term Daai is a collective name, of the inhabitants of Daai land in the southern Chin state of Myanmar. According to Thang Hleih, the word Daai represents the people who live peacefully, gently lovingly, harmoniously, generously and kindly. The word, therefore, stands for the people who are living inside the most interior part of southern Chin State. The Daai appears to be from Mongoloid stock and from Tibeto-Burman family as the other Chin tribes. At present there are 175 Daai villages with a total population between 40000 and 50000. They have their own particular traditional cultures, way of life, language, practices and traditional beliefs, and societies as other tribes in Myanmar. Daai people can be found in the west of Mindat township, the northwest of Kanpetlet township, the northeast of Paletwa township and the southeast of Matupi township, the southern part of the Chin state in Myanmar very close to Bangladesh and Northeastern India. The entire area is hilly made up of a series of ranges running from north to south which fortunately give sufficient food and rice to the inhabitants and their neighbors. The longest part of its land is about 120 miles (193 km) and the narrowest part is roughly 60 miles (96 km), and the area is far from each township between 60 miles and 90 miles. The Daai land is situated between 800ft to 3200 ft above the sea level. \\" ==Population== The overall Daai population is estimated somewhere between 60,000 and 90,000. 15% of the total population (500,000) of the Chin State are Daai people. Some of the Daai people live in and around Myanmar and all over the world. Daai people are descended from Tibetan, Tibeto - Burma, Kuki - Chin - Naga, Kuki - Chin, Chin - Daai. ==Politics== Daai land is divided into four parts within the southern Chin state: Kanpetlet, Mindat, Matupi and Paletwa townships. Today Daai land encompasses Chin state, Myanmar. The local government separated Daai land into Kanpetlet Daai, Mindat Daai, Matu Daai and Paletwa Daai. ==Education== There are only basic educational institutions, such as middle schools (students from 5 to 14 years of age) in Daai lands. Basic primary school is available in almost all villages. Higher education is available only in a few villages. Today, Daai, and people are receiving further education in various Christian colleges such as in the capital cities of Yangon, Falam, Hakha, Mandalay, Kalay, Maymyo, Kyaukhtu, Pakokku and also America, India, and some others countries. ==Health== There are government clinics and dispensaries in some villages, but there is no medicine in those dispensaries. People go to the nearest Burmese villages and the cities to buy medicine. There are no doctors in Daai land. Sometimes medical staff and nurses visit Daai lands. They occasionally administer government-provided vaccination to the Daai people. ==CultureLanguage=== All Daai tribes speak the Daai Chinhttp://www.ethnologue.com/language code:ISO-639-3/dao language, of the Sino-Tibetan family (not to be confused with the Dai language, belonging to the Tai-Kadai family). There are slightly different styles between the subtribes of Kanpetlet township and Matupi township. Despite this, the different dialects are usually mutually intelligible. ===Villages=== There are more than 180 villages in Daailand. Daai villages make up 13% of the 1,355 total villages in the Chin State. Villages range from 10 to 140 houses, the largest and most populated village in Daai land is Majar Innu Village in the Kanpetlet township, west of the central part of Daai land. ===Religion=== Approximately thirty years ago, Daai people practised animism. Since then, most Daai people have converted to Christianity within the last two decades. Currently about 99% of the Daai people are Christian. Two hundred years ago, the first American Missionary, Adoniram Judson, went to Myanmar (Burma) and gave his life to the Lord reaching out to Myanmar (Burma). He positioned the lay ministers to lead the believers in Myanmar (Burma) after he died. That was in Rangoon (Yangon), the Capital City of Myanmar (Burma). They could not reach to the Daai area at that time because it was very far and for many other reasons. The gospel reached to the Daai area in around 1970 by other missionaries. That was 156 years after Judson's arrival in Myanmar (Burma). ===Shifting cultivation=== Dai people practise shifting cultivation, known as 'Taungya\\" in Burmese and \\"Lou\\" in the Dai language. Cultivators cut and burn forests and raise agricultural crops for one to two years before moving on to another site, only returning to the original after 10 to 11 years. The Dai people living in western part of Myanmar and southern part of Chin State have rich customs and traditions. Their traditions and rituals are associated with their shifting cultivation in the hills. The practice of shifting cultivation is deeply rooted in Daai culture. Shifting cultivation for the Dais is more than sustenance, it is a way of life, the foundation from which emerged their economic and social traditions. In its early period, shifting cultivation provided food for the Dai. However, these days it serves as the economic mainstay for the Dai, providing money to buy clothes, attend school, and trade with their neighbours. ==Economy== The Daai people cultivate rice, corn, millet, beans, peas, cucumber, pumpkin, gourd, egg plant, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, ginger, sesame and celery in their gardens or farms. Daai farmers cultivate at the beginning of monsoon season (the mid-April to June) and harvest crops in October and November. The cultivation method is dependent on monsoon rains. Generally, Daai land is mostly used for slash-and-burn or shifting cultivation, with the least-developed regions inhabited by the indigenous hill tribes of Myanmar. Daai people earn their livelihood by shifting between cultivation (Taung Ya) and subsistence farming. Farming and gardening are only for their subsistence and personal consumption, transportation systems and markets are not developed in Daailand. ==Daai people in Malaysia== Some Daai people migrate to Malaysia because their lives and political, cultural, and religious freedoms are threatened in Myanmar. There, the parents struggle for their daily bread as undocumented migrants, vulnerable to arrest for immigration offences, and are often subject to detention, prosecution, whipping and deportation for several months. Daai refugees in Malaysia originate from Myanmar, where current conditions do not permit them to return. Daai refugees are scattered throughout Malaysia in places such as Johor Bahru, Ipoh, the Cameron Highlands, Kalang, Kajang, Rawang, and others. There are no refugee camps in Malaysia. Instead, Daai refugees share living spaces in groups of up to 20 people, living in low-cost apartments, urban villages or housing estates near Malaysian homes. Many also live in makeshift camps in jungles near construction sites where they seek employment. == References == * The study of Daai (Daai)people (Southern Chin State, Myanmar) by Dominique Thet Saw * U Min Naing (B.A), National Ethnic Groups of Myanmar.

A 1955 graduate of South Africa's CHIPS University of the Witwatersrand, Lazarus' accomplishments include authoring the first text on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) called Behaviour Therapy and Beyond and 17 other books, over 300 clinical articles, and presidencies of psychological associations; he received numerous awards including the Distinguished Psychologist Award of the Division of Psychotherapy from the American Psychological Association, the Distinguished Service Award from the American Board of Professional Psychology, and three lifetime achievement awards. Lazarus was a leader in the self-help movement beginning in the 1970s writing books on positive mental imagery and avoiding negative thoughts. He spent time teaching at various universities in the United States including Rutgers University, Stanford University, Temple University Medical School, and Yale University, and was executive director of The Lazarus Institute, a mental health services facility focusing on CBT. == Background  Family life === Lazarus was born in South Africa, where he spent his childhood through post secondary education. He is the son of Benjamin and Rachel Lazarus, the youngest of four children to a middle class family. After episodes of being bullied by his brother-in-law, Lazarus took up body building and boxing, leading to a life long interest in health and nutrition.Lazarus, C. N. (2013, October 15).

Topic Towns- Princetion's Weekly Community Newspaper. Retrieved February 27, 2016, from http://www.towntopics.com/wordpress/2013/10/09/obituaries-10-9-13/ === Education and teaching career === Lazarus completed his undergraduate and graduate education at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa. Upon receiving his Ph.D. in 1960, he became a private practitioner in Johannesburg until 1963 when he was invited to Stanford University for a yearlong position as an assistant professor. He then returned to Johannesburg to teach at his alma mater until 1966 when he and his family returned to the United States for his position as the director of the Behavior Therapy Institute in Sausalito, California. He was a professor at Temple University Medical School from 1967-1970 and Yale University from 1970-1972 where he was director of Clinical training. Finally in 1972, Lazarus became a distinguished professor for the Graduate School of Applied Psychology at Rutgers University in New Jersey; Lazarus would remain in this position until 1999. == Clinical work and theories == As a graduate student at Stanford University, Lazarus extended his knowledge beyond the typical psychological views of the time and is credited with coining the term for the growing field of \\"behavioral therapy.\\" Lazarus and his mentor Joseph Wolpe published the book Behavioral Therapy Techniques in 1966 which was the first to show the importance of increasing adaptive behavior and decreasing maladaptive behaviors on mental health. In the process of writing their book, Lazarus and Wolpe came to differ in their stances on use of behavioral therapy. Wolpe favoring an approach centered on applying only therapy techniques and Lazarus favoring the supplementation of other techniques in addition to therapy.Davison, G. C., & Wilson, G. T. (2014). Arnold A. Lazarus (1932–2013). American Psychologist, 69(6), 620-621. Later, in his book Behavior Therapy and Beyond, Lazarus presented his ideas for adding cognitive constructs to behavioral therapy as treatment for anxiety and depression. Lazarus' ideas continued to develop throughout his next few publications as his writings and theories gained popularity throughout the field. In Multimodal Behavioral Therapy (1976) and The Practice of Multimodal Therapy (1981), arguably his most notable works, Lazarus introduced multimodal therapy (MMT). MMT is based on the idea that humans have modalities to their personality that must be addressed separately in order to properly treat a mental disorder. The modalities are referred to with the acronym BASIC ID which stands for Behavior, Affect, Sensation, Imagery, Cognition, Interpersonal Relationships, and Drugs/Biology.Lazarus, Arnold A. \\"Multimodal Applications and Research: A Brief Overview and Update.\\"Elementary School Guidance & Counseling Multimodal Theory, Research, and Practice 24.4 (1990): 243-47. PsycINFO. Web. 17 Apr. 2016. Lazarus is also noted for his advocacy for the expansion of boundaries between patient and therapist. Lazarus advocated for the expansion of relationships beyond scheduled sessions, arguing that a relationship beyond scheduled professional sessions to be beneficial for patients. Lazarus himself would participate in meals, mall trips and weddings in belief that it would strengthen the adaptive abilities of patients.Shaughnessy, M. F. (2002). An interview with arnold A. lazarus. North American Journal of Psychology, 4(2), 171-181. === Lazarus Institute === The Lazarus Institute (TLI) was Lazarus' practice for the rest of his life. Founded in partnership with his son Clifford and daughter-in-law Donna, the mission of TLI was to broaden Cognitive-Behavior CHIPS Therapy; their motto \\"Think Well - Act Well - Feel Well - Be Well\\" reflects their focus on CBT. However, the Lazarus' went further by offering each client an individualized therapy plan to maximize their benefit.

It has been designed and will be built in collaboration between the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and various Indian research institutes. It is planned to be launched in January 2022. Presentation slides available here via Imgur. It is India's first solar mission. ==History== Aditya was conceptualised in January 2008 by the Advisory Committee for Space Research. It was initially envisaged as a small 400 kg, low-Earth orbiting satellite with a coronagraph to study the solar corona. An experimental budget of 3 Crore INR was allocated for the financial year 2016–2017. The scope of the mission has since been expanded and it is now planned to be a comprehensive solar and space environment observatory to be placed at the Lagrangian point L1, so the mission was renamed \\"Aditya-L1\\". , the mission has an allocated cost of ₹378.53 crore excluding launch costs. ==Overview== Lagrangian points in the Sun–Earth system (not to scale) – a small object at any one of the five points will hold its relative position. The Aditya-L1 mission will be inserted in a halo orbit around the L1 point, which is about 1.5 million km from Earth. The 1,500 kg satellite carries seven science payloads with diverse objectives, including but not limited to, the coronal heating, solar wind acceleration, coronal magnetometry, origin and monitoring of near-UV solar radiation (which drives Earth's upper atmospheric dynamics and global climate), coupling of the solar photosphere to chromosphere and corona, in-situ characterisations of the space environment around Earth by measuring energetic particle fluxes and magnetic fields of the solar wind and solar magnetic storms that have adverse effects on space and ground-based technologies. Aditya-L1 will be able to provide observations of Sun's photosphere, chromosphere and corona. In addition, an instrument will study the solar energetic particles' flux reaching the L1 orbit, while a magnetometer payload will measure the variation in magnetic field strength at the halo orbit around L1. These payloads have to be placed outside the interference from the Earth's magnetic field and hence could not have been useful in the low Earth orbit as proposed on the original Aditya mission concept. One of the major unsolved issues in the field of solar physics is that the upper atmosphere of the Sun is hot whereas the lower atmosphere is just . In addition, it is not understood how exactly the Sun's radiation affects the dynamics of the Earth's atmosphere on shorter as well as on longer time scale. The mission will obtain near simultaneous images of the different layers of the Sun's atmosphere, which reveal the ways in which the energy may be channeled and transferred from one layer to another. Thus the Aditya-L1 mission will enable a comprehensive understanding of the dynamical processes of the Sun and address some of the outstanding problems in solar physics and heliophysics. ==Payloads== * Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC): The coronagraph creates an artificial total solar eclipse in space by blocking the sunlight by an occultor. This telescope will have capabilities of spectral imaging of the corona in visible and infra-red wavelengths. The objectives are to study the diagnostic parameters of solar corona and dynamics and origin of coronal mass ejections (using three visible and one infra-red channels); magnetic field measurements of the solar corona down to tens of Gauss. Additional objectives are to determine why the solar atmosphere is so hot, and how the changes in the Sun can affect space weather and Earth's climate. The VELC payload weighs nearly 170 kg. **PI Institute: Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) * Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT): SUIT will observe the Sun between 200-400 nm wavelength range and it will provide full disk images of different layers of the solar atmosphere by making use of 11 filters. The Sun has never been observed from space in this wavelength range. The spacecraft being at the first Lagrangian point, SUIT shall be observing the Sun continuously without interruption. The instrument is being developed under the leadership of A. N.

It may be regarded as one generalization of the matrix singular value decomposition. The HOSVD has applications in computer graphics, machine learning, scientific computing, and signal processing. Some key ingredients of the HOSVD can be traced as far back as F. L. Hitchcock in 1928, but it was L. R. Tucker who developed for third-order tensors the general Tucker decomposition in the 1960s, including the HOSVD. The HOSVD as decomposition in its own right was further advocated by L. De Lathauwer et al. in 2000. Robust and L1-norm-based variants of HOSVD have also been proposed. As the HOSVD was studied in many scientific fields, it is sometimes historically referred to as multilinear singular value decomposition, m-mode SVD, or cube SVD, and sometimes it is incorrectly identified with a Tucker decomposition. == Definition == For the purpose of this article, the abstract tensor \\\\mathcal{A} is assumed to be given in coordinates with respect to some basis as a multidimensional array, also denoted by \\\\mathcal{A}, in F^{n_1 \\\\times n_2 \\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times n_d}, where d is the order of the tensor and F is either \\\\mathbb{R} or \\\\mathbb{C}. Let U_k \\\\in F^{n_k \\\\times n_k}be a unitary matrix containing a basis of the left singular vectors of the standard factor-k flattening \\\\mathcal{A}_{(k)} of \\\\mathcal{A} such that the jth column \\\\mathbf{u}_j^k of U_k corresponds to the jth largest singular value of \\\\mathcal{A}_{(k)}. Observe that the factor matrix U_k does not depend on the particular freedom of choice in the definition of the standard factor-k flattening. By the properties of the multilinear multiplication, we have\\\\begin{array}{rcl} \\\\mathcal{A} &=& (I, I, \\\\ldots, I) \\\\cdot \\\\mathcal{A} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=& (U_1 U_1^H, U_2 U_2^H, \\\\ldots, U_d U_d^H) \\\\cdot \\\\mathcal{A} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=& (U_1, U_2, \\\\ldots, U_d) \\\\cdot \\\\left( (U_1^H, U_2^H, \\\\ldots, U_d^H) \\\\cdot \\\\mathcal{A} \\\\right), \\\\end{array}where \\\\cdot^H denotes the conjugate transpose. The second equality is because the U_k's are unitary matrices. Define now the core tensor\\\\mathcal{S} := (U_1^H, U_2^H, \\\\ldots, U_d^H) \\\\cdot \\\\mathcal{A}.Then, the HOSVD of \\\\mathcal{A} is the decomposition\\\\mathcal{A} = (U_1, U_2, \\\\ldots, U_d) \\\\cdot \\\\mathcal{S}.The above construction shows that every tensor has a HOSVD. == Compact HOSVD == As in the case of the compact singular value decomposition of a matrix, it is also possible to consider a compact HOSVD, which is very useful in applications. Assume that U_k \\\\in F^{n_k \\\\times r_k} is a matrix with unitary columns containing a basis of the left singular vectors corresponding to the nonzero singular values of the standard factor-k flattening \\\\mathcal{A}_{(k)} of \\\\mathcal{A}. Let the columns of U_k be sorted such that the jth column \\\\mathbf{u}_j^k of U_k corresponds to the jth largest nonzero singular value of \\\\mathcal{A}_{(k)}. Since the columns of U_k form a basis for the image of \\\\mathcal{A}_{(k)}, we have\\\\mathcal{A}_{(k)} = U_k U_k^H \\\\mathcal{A}_{(k)} = \\\\bigl( (U_k U_k^H) \\\\cdot_k \\\\mathcal{A} \\\\bigr)_{(k)},where the first equality is due to the properties of orthogonal projections (in the Hermitian inner product) and the last equality is due to the properties of multilinear multiplication. As flattenings are bijective maps and the above formula is valid for all k=1,2,\\\\ldots,d, we find as before that\\\\begin{array}{rcl} \\\\mathcal{A} &=& (U_1 U_1^H, U_2 U_2^H, \\\\ldots, U_d U_d^H) \\\\cdot \\\\mathcal{A} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=& (U_1, U_2, \\\\ldots, U_d) \\\\cdot \\\\left( (U_1^H, U_2^H, \\\\ldots, U_d^H) \\\\cdot \\\\mathcal{A} \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=& (U_1, U_2, \\\\ldots, U_d) \\\\cdot \\\\mathcal{S}, \\\\end{array}where the core tensor \\\\mathcal{S} is now of size r_1 \\\\times r_2 \\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times r_d. == Multilinear rank == The tuple (r_1, r_2, \\\\ldots, r_d) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}^d where r_k := \\\\mathrm{rank}( \\\\mathcal{A}_{(k)} ) is called the multilinear rank of \\\\mathcal{A}. By definition, every tensor has a unique multilinear rank, and its components are bounded by 0 \\\\le r_k \\\\le n_k. Not all tuples in \\\\mathbb{N}^d are multilinear ranks. In particular, it is known that r_k \\\\le \\\\prod_{j e k} r_j must hold. The compact HOSVD is a rank- revealing factorization in the sense that the dimensions of its core tensor correspond with the components of the multilinear rank of the tensor. == Interpretation == The following geometric interpretation is valid for both the full and compact HOSVD. Let (r_1, r_2, \\\\ldots, r_d) be the multilinear rank of the tensor \\\\mathcal{A}. Since \\\\mathcal{S} \\\\in F^{r_1 \\\\times r_2 \\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times r_d} is a multidimensional array, we can expand it as follows\\\\mathcal{S} = \\\\sum_{j_1=1}^{r_1} \\\\sum_{j_2=1}^{r_2} \\\\cdots \\\\sum_{j_d=1}^{r_d} s_{j_1,j_2,\\\\ldots,j_d} \\\\mathbf{e}_{j_1}^1 \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{e}_{j_2}^2 \\\\otimes \\\\cdots \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{e}_{j_d}^d,where \\\\mathbf{e}_j^k is the jth standard basis vector of F^{n_k}. By definition of the multilinear multiplication, it holds that\\\\mathcal{A} = \\\\sum_{j_1=1}^{r_1} \\\\sum_{j_2=1}^{r_2} \\\\cdots \\\\sum_{j_d=1}^{r_d} s_{j_1,j_2,\\\\ldots,j_d} \\\\mathbf{u}_{j_1}^1 \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{u}_{j_2}^2 \\\\otimes \\\\cdots \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{u}_{j_d}^d,where the \\\\mathbf{u}_j^k are the columns of U_k \\\\in F^{n_k \\\\times r_k}. It is easy to verify that B = \\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathbf{u}_{j_1}^1 \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{u}_{j_2}^2 \\\\otimes \\\\cdots \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{u}_{j_d}^d \\\\\\\\}_{j_1,j_2,\\\\ldots,j_d} is an orthonormal set of tensors. This means that the HOSVD can be interpreted as a way to express the tensor \\\\mathcal{A} with respect to a specifically chosen orthonormal basis B with the coefficients given as the multidimensional array \\\\mathcal{S}. == Computation == Let \\\\mathcal{A} \\\\in F^{n_1 \\\\times n_2 \\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times n_d}, where F is either \\\\mathbb{R} or \\\\mathbb{C}, be a tensor of multilinear rank (r_1, r_2, \\\\ldots, r_d). === Classic computation === The classic strategy for computing a compact HOSVD was introduced in 1966 by L. R. Tucker and further advocated by L. De Lathauwer et al.; it is based on the definition of the decomposition. The next three steps are to be performed: * For k=1,2,\\\\ldots,d, do the following: # Construct the standard factor-k flattening \\\\mathcal{A}_{(k)}; # Compute the (compact) singular value decomposition \\\\mathcal{A}_{(k)} = U_k \\\\Sigma_k V^T_k , and store the left singular vectors U_k \\\\in F^{n_k \\\\times r_k}; # Compute the core tensor \\\\mathcal{S} via the multilinear multiplication \\\\mathcal{S} = (U_1^H, U_2^H, \\\\ldots, U_d^H) \\\\cdot \\\\mathcal{A}. === Interlaced computation === A strategy that is significantly faster when some or all r_k \\\\ll n_k consists of interlacing the computation of the core tensor and the factor matrices, as follows: * Set \\\\mathcal{A}^0 = \\\\mathcal{A}; * For k = 1,2, \\\\ldots, d perform the following: *# Construct the standard factor-k flattening \\\\mathcal{A}_{(k)}^{k-1}; *# Compute the (compact) singular value decomposition \\\\mathcal{A}_{(k)}^{k-1} = U_k \\\\Sigma_k V^T_k , and store the left singular vectors U_k \\\\in F^{n_k \\\\times r_k}; *# Set \\\\mathcal{A}^k = U_k^H \\\\cdot_k \\\\mathcal{A}^{k-1} , or, equivalently, \\\\mathcal{A}^k_{(k)} = \\\\Sigma_k V_k^T . == Approximation == In applications, such as those mentioned below, a common problem consists of approximating a given tensor \\\\mathcal{A} \\\\in F^{n_1 \\\\times n_2 \\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times n_d} by one of low multilinear rank. Formally, if \\\\mathrm{mlrank}(\\\\mathcal{A}) denotes the multilinear rank of \\\\mathcal{A} , then the nonlinear non-convex \\\\ell_2 -optimization problem is\\\\min_{\\\\mathcal{B}\\\\in F^{n_1 \\\\times n_2 \\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times n_d}} \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \\\\mathcal{A} - \\\\mathcal{B} \\\\_F^2 \\\\quad\\\\text{s.t.}\\\\quad \\\\mathrm{mlrank}(\\\\mathcal{B}) = (s_1, s_2, \\\\ldots, s_d), where (s_1, s_2, \\\\ldots, s_d) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}^d with 0 \\\\le s_k \\\\le n_k , is a target multilinear rank that is assumed to be given, and where the norm is the Frobenius norm. Based on the foregoing algorithms for computing a compact HOSVD, a natural idea for trying to solve this optimization problem is to truncate the (compact) SVD in step 2 of either the classic or the interlaced computation. A classically truncated HOSVD is obtained by replacing step 2 in the classic computation by * Compute a rank-s_k truncated SVD \\\\mathcal{A}_{(k)} \\\\approx U_k \\\\Sigma_k V^T_k , and store the top s_k left singular vectors U_k \\\\in F^{n_k \\\\times s_k}; while a sequentially truncated HOSVD (or successively truncated HOSVD) is obtained by replacing step 2 in the interlaced computation by * Compute a rank-s_k truncated SVD \\\\mathcal{A}_{(k)}^{k-1} \\\\approx U_k \\\\Sigma_k V^T_k , and store the top s_k left singular vectors U_k \\\\in F^{n_k \\\\times s_k}; Unfortunately, neither of these strategies results in an optimal solution of the best low multilinear rank optimization problem, contrary to the matrix case where the Eckart-Young theorem holds. However, both the classically and sequentially truncated HOSVD result in a quasi-optimal solution: if \\\\mathcal{B}_t denotes the classically or sequentially truncated HOSVD and \\\\mathcal{B}^* denotes the optimal solution to the best low multilinear rank approximation problem, then\\\\ \\\\mathcal{A} - \\\\mathcal{B}_t \\\\_F \\\\le \\\\sqrt{d} \\\\ \\\\mathcal{A} - \\\\mathcal{B}^* \\\\_F; in practice this means that if there exists an optimal solution with a small error, then a truncated HOSVD will for many intended purposes also yield a sufficiently good solution. == Applications == The HOSVD is most commonly applied to the extraction of relevant information from multi-way arrays. Circa 2001, Vasilescu reframed the data analysis, recognition and synthesis problems as multilinear tensor problems based on the insight that most observed data are the result of several causal factors of data formation, and are well suited for multi-modal data tensor analysis. The power of the tensor framework was showcased in a visually and mathematically compelling manner by decomposing and representing an image in terms of its causal factors of data formation, in the context of Human Motion Signatures,M.

The HOSVD has been successfully applied to signal processing and big data, e.g., in genomic signal processing. These applications also inspired a higher-order GSVD (HO GSVD) and a tensor GSVD. A combination of HOSVD and SVD also has been applied for real-time event detection from complex data streams (multivariate data with space and time dimensions) in disease surveillance. It is also used in tensor product model transformation-based controller design. In multilinear subspace learning,Haiping Lu, K.N. Plataniotis and A.N.

The concept of HOSVD was carried over to functions by Baranyi and Yam via the TP model transformation. This extension led to the definition of the HOSVD-based canonical form of tensor product functions and Linear Parameter Varying system models and to convex hull manipulation based control optimization theory, see TP model transformation in control theories. HOSVD was proposed to be applied to multi-view data analysis and was successfully applied to in silico drug discovery from gene expression. == Robust L1-norm variant == L1-Tucker is the L1-norm-based, robust variant of Tucker decomposition.

It was founded in 1994. Its editor-in-chief is Aram Abrahamyan. ==History and political alignment== Sources differ on who founded the newspaper. Some hold it was the newspaper's long-time editor Aram Abrahamyan, others believe it was the controversial Interior Minister Vano Siradeghyan, while still others refer to a general \\"editorial staff\\". Its first issue was published on August 2, 1994. At the time its editor-in-chief was Ignat Mamyan. Aram Abrahamyan replaced him in December 1994. { class=\\" floatleft\\" ! Year ! Circulation -  1999  6,000 -  2003  5,000+ -  2009  3,000 -  2011  2,293 } Sources generally agree that Aravot was supportive of President Levon Ter-Petrosyan (1991-1998) and his liberal party Pan-Armenian National Movement (HHSh), although it gave space to different points of view. Abrahamyan denied that he was close to Ter-Petrosyan and his government in a 2004 interview and added: \\"Go and ask the former government what they think about Aravot. You'll realize that their attitude is anything but positive.\\" The newspaper was highly critical of the government of President Robert Kocharyan (1998-2008). During the 2003 presidential election Aravot \\"allocated 37% of its coverage to the incumbent [President Kocharyan], with an overwhelmingly negative tone.\\" Following the deadly 2008 presidential election protests Aravot was prevented by security forces from being published according to a March 1 state of emergency decree signed by outgoing President Kocharyan. It was not until March 21 when the de facto media blackout was lifted along with the state of emergency that Aravot resumed publication. In addition, the newspaper's website (aravot.am) was blocked during that period. Aravot has been critical of President Serzh Sargsyan, who came to power in the disputed 2008 election. During the 2013 presidential election the newspaper's editor-in-chief Aram Abrahamyan publicly endorsed the liberal former Prime Minister Hrant Bagratyan, but stated that it's only his personal opinion and not that of the newspaper. In a 2014 interview Abrahamyan stated that the newspaper's ultimate goal is to create a \\"mild and tolerant\\" atmosphere in the Armenian society. According to a research conducted in October–November 2014 by the Yerevan- based Region Research Center, in their reporting Aravot.am had the second highest number of negative descriptions of Russia at 40%, but also the highest in terms of positive descriptions at 19%. ==ReceptionAcclaim=== According to a 2012 study Aravot was the \\"more neutral and objective\\" of all Armenian newspapers. Military analyst Vahram Mirakyan praised Aravot for being more balanced in their articles about the Armenian Army than other independent or opposition newspapers. Although the majority of articles were negative in their content, they were largely devoid of \\"libels\\" and had more neutral and positive articles than the other newspaper monitored in the study. In 2014 Raffi Hovannisian praised Aravot for its professionalism and unbiased reporting. ===Criticism=== In 2005 Liana Sayadyan of Hetq Online wrote that Aravot is not an independent newspaper since it was established by former Interior Minister Vano Siradeghyan. She also suggested that Abrahamyan \\"does not hide his admiration for the former government. Hence, Aravot has not been independent from the start, and Vano Siradeghyan himself confessed on more than one occasion that by publishing Aravot he hoped to reestablish the popularity\\" of HHSh. ==See also== *List of newspapers in Armenia * Media of Armenia == References == Category:Newspapers published in Armenia Category:Armenian-language newspapers Category:1994 establishments in Armenia ","title":"Aravot"},{"id":"20148940","text":"The acronym VITAL may refer to: * the VITAL trial, also known as the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial * the charity, VITAL for Children ==Technology== * VHDL- VITAL, VHDL Initiative Towards ASIC Libraries. * VITAL (machine learning software) * VITAL (software), A software suite of digital asset management products by VTLS based on the open source Fedora architecture. * VITAL (ventilator), NASA ventilator developed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the case, Denning LJDenning was sitting as a Lord Justice of Appeal; he became Master of the Rolls 11 years later delivered a dissenting judgment, arguing that a duty of care arose when making negligent statements. His dissenting judgment was later upheld by the House of Lords in Hedley Byrne v Heller 1963.Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd [1963] 2 All ER 575 ==Facts== Donald Ogilvie was the director of a company called Trevaunance Hydraulic Tin Mines Ltd, which mined tin in Cornwall. He needed more capital, so he placed an advertisement in The Times on 8 July 1946 which read, > \\"£10,000. Established Tin Mine (low capitalisation) in Cornwall seeks > further capital. Install additional milling plant. Directorship and active > participation open to suitable applicant - Apply\\" Candler responded, saying he was interested in investing £2000, provided he was shown the company's accounts. Ogilvie instructed Crane, Christmas & Co, a firm of auditors, to prepare the company’s accounts and balance sheet. The draft accounts were shown to Candler in the presence of the auditor's clerk, a Mr Fraser. Candler relied on their accuracy and subscribed for £2,000 worth of shares in the company; but the company was actually in a very poor state. Ogilvie used the £2,000 on himself and then went bankrupt. Candler lost all the money he invested and brought an action against the accountants, Crane, Christmas & Co. for negligently misrepresenting the state of the company. As there was no contractual relationship between the parties, no case arose in misrepresentation,Misrepresentation occurs when an untrue or misleading statement induces a person into a contract. and so the action was brought in tort for pure economic loss. ==Judgment== The majority of the Court of Appeal (Cohen LJ and Asquith LJ) relied on the case of Derry v Peek to refuse a remedy to the plaintiff, holding that loss resulting from negligent misstatement was not actionable in the absence of any contractual or fiduciary relationship between the parties. Denning LJ (as the future Master of the Rolls then was) delivered a dissent, in which he argued that any person in the reasonable contemplation of someone making a statement who might rely on that statement is owed a duty of care in tort.at pp.174-185 He was asked to read his decision first. ==See also== *Cann v Willson (1888) 39 Ch.D 39, a valuer instructed by a mortgagor sent his report to the mortgagee who made an advance in reliance on the valuation.

The search certificate prepared by the clerk negligently failed to record a charge of £1,828 11s. 5d. in favour of the Ministry. Lord Denning MR, 268, rejected that a duty of care only arose when there was a voluntary assumption of responsibility, rather \\"from the fact that the person making it knows, or ought to know, that others, being his neighbours in this regard, would act on the faith of the statement being accurate.\\" *Smith v Eric S.

This type of conversion is obscure. Its only obvious use, and the origin of the term, lies with NASA around 1970. ASDTIC were used in the control of DC-DC converters. For use in space-rated systems, reliable hybrid circuits were developed to implement the ASDTIC function. == Operation == The DC-DC converters under study in this workResearch contract NAS12-2017, December 1969 – October 1970, TRW for NASA Lewis Research Center had a similar form as a DC chopper or switching regulator. A bipolar transistor switches current flowing into an L-C network of an inductor and capacitor. To reduce switching losses, the transistor is always turned either fully off or fully on. Control of this transistor is derived from a control circuit that supplies a series of pulses. In the circuits studied here, the pulses are all of equal length. The overall ON time or mark/space ratio of the pulse train (and thus the output power delivered) is controlled by varying the interval between pulses. Closely spaced pulses increase output. This control signal is derived by use of an ASDTIC circuit. The ASDTIC circuit used is based around an integrator and a threshold detector. The incoming signal is integrated over time and when it exceeds a threshold, a control pulse is generated by the ASDTIC. Within the converter control circuit outside the ASDTIC, a One-Shot Pulse Generator then generates a pulse of constant length to drive the switching transistor. The ASDTIC approach was taken in an attempt to improve the regulation and stability of previous switching regulators with linear control systems. These used an error signal derived from the converter's DC output voltage and had a tendency to behave as underdamped second-order systems which were prone to oscillations in their output. The ASDTIC control system of Schoenfeld & Yu was an attempt to improve this dynamic performance. An additional AC component was measured, from the voltage across the output inductor, and this new AC loop signal was also supplied to the integrator within the ASDTIC. Such a second AC loop went beyond the claims of the original Schwartz ASDTIC patent Performance of the new control technique was good: converter stability was enhanced, and its dynamic performance characteristics greatly improved. == References == Category:Power supplies Category:Analog circuits ","title":"Analog signal to discrete time interval converter"},{"id":"20149025","text":"Elections for local government were held in Northern Ireland on 19 May 1993. ==Results== Map showing the party that received the most votes by district electoral area. ===Overall=== {  - !

According to many historians and philosophers, he is the first truly Sri Lankan king since the Vijayan invasion, and also the king who ended the conflict between the Sinha clan and the local clans, reorganizing the population. His story is one wrapped in myth and legend. ==Origin== There are three prevailing opinions on his origin. * In the Mahavansa, his mother is Umaddhanie Chithra and father is Deegha Gamini, both of Aryan origin. * Kumarathunga Munidasa's opinion is that his father is Chittharaja. * He has no affiliation to the Aryan dynasty. He is a local hero. * Another not very popular theory, claims he is from the Pandya Kingdom. Vijaya married in Pandya royal family and therefore Pandukabhaya or Pandu Kabhaya was a relative of Vijaya from Pandya Kingdom.Caldwell R. Bishop, History of Tinnevelly - A Political and General History from the Earliest Period to Its Cession to the English in A.D. 1801, p 15 == The exchange of babies == Chithra and Digha- Gamini had been made aware of the prophecy at the time of their marriage and had promised to put to death any son that Chithra gave birth to. However, once Pandukabhaya was born, Chithra was unwilling to kill the infant, and so she decided to exchange babies with another woman who had given birth to a baby girl that same day. Chithra announced to her father and husband that she had given birth to a girl. Only her mother, Baddha-Kacchayana, knew of the secret exchange. The woman who gave up her daughter took Prince Pandukabhaya to a nearby village called Doramadalawa where he would be brought up as a herdsman's son. == The attempts on Pandukabhaya’s life == The first threat to Pandukabhaya's life came while he was being transported to Dvaramandalaka (Doramadalawa). The woman who had exchanged infants with Chitra carried Prince Pandukabhaya to the village in a covered basket. Unfortunately, she ran into nine of Chitra's brothers (the ones who had wanted their sister to be murdered for fear that her child would kill them). They asked her what she had in the basket and she replied that it contained food. Not satisfied with the answer, they asked her to open up the basket and show them its contents. Luckily, two wild boars happened to run past them, and they forgot about the basket in their eagerness to hunt the animals down. The baby was delivered to the herdsman safely. (the two wild boars were commanders of yakka tribe named Chithraraja & Kalawela in disguise to protect the prince) That same year, King Panduvasudeva died and Abhaya became his successor. He was not a great king, but he was certainly a kind one and he was well-loved, especially by the poor. Several years went by and when Pandukabhaya was about seven years old, rumours reached his nine uncles about a boy in Dvaramandalaka who supposedly was a herdsman's son, but who showed all signs of being of royal background. They suspected that this child may be their sister's son, because they had reason to believe that the little girl who was being brought up as a princess in the palace was not Chitra's daughter. They sent out soldiers to kill all boys in the village who were around the same age as their nephew. It was known that all the boys of Dvaramandalaka bathed at a certain pond, and it was planned that they should be killed while they were bathing. The plan was executed and several young children were murdered. Pandukabhaya, however, had been hiding at the time, and so he escaped death. While Pandukabhaya's uncles were satisfied at the time that they had eliminated their nephew, some years later they became suspicious again when they heard stories of a village boy who looked more like a prince than a herdsman's son. They attempted to have him killed again, and the attempt failed once more. When Pandukabhaya was about sixteen years old, Princess Chitra, fearing for her son's safety, arranged to have him live with a Brahman named Pandula. Once he was old enough to become king, Pandukabhaya left Pandula, married his cousin Pali and fought his uncles to claim his right to the throne. Eight of his ten uncles perished in the war, which lasted for seventeen years. Abhaya, who had never fought against Pandukabhaya, and Girikandasiva, who was Pali's father, were not killed. Pandukabhaya was a good king and reigned over Sri Lanka for seventy years, leaving the country in a prosperous state when he died. ==Services== # Established an organized system of governance. # Established a post called \\"Nagara Gutthika\\" to rule the city and named his uncle Abhaya to the post. # Ordered the demarcation of all the villages in the island in his tenth year of reign. He was the first king to do so. # Constructed 3 tanks, namely Abaya Wewa, Gamini Wewa and Jaya Wewa. ==See also== *Aba (film), a 2008 film based on the historical legend of Pandukabhaya *List of Sri Lankan monarchs *History of Sri Lanka ==References * Kings & Rulers of Sri Lanka * Codrington's Short History of Ceylon * King Pandukabhaya in Mahavamsa P Category:367 BC deaths Category:474 BC births P P P P ","title":"Pandukabhaya of Anuradhapura"},{"id":"20149046","text":"Reverse geocoding is the process of back (reverse) coding of a point location (latitude, longitude) to a readable address or place name. This permits the identification of nearby street addresses, places, and/or areal subdivisions such as neighbourhoods, county, state, or country. Combined with geocoding and routing services, reverse geocoding is a critical component of mobile location-based services and Enhanced 911 to convert a coordinate obtained by GPS to a readable street address which is easier to understand by the end user, but not necessarily with a better accuracy. Reverse geocoding can be carried out systematically by services which process a coordinate similarly to the geocoding process. For example, when a GPS coordinate is entered the street address is interpolated from a range assigned to the road segment in a reference dataset that the point is nearest to. If the user provides a coordinate near the midpoint of a segment that starts with address 1 and ends with 100, the returned street address will be somewhere near 50. This approach to reverse geocoding does not return actual addresses, only estimates of what should be there based on the predetermined range. Alternatively, coordinates for reverse geocoding can also be selected on an interactive map, or extracted from static maps by georeferencing them in a GIS with predefined spatial layers to determine the coordinates of a displayed point. Many of the same limitations of geocoding are similar with reverse geocoding. Public reverse geocoding services are becoming increasingly available through APIs and other web services as well as mobile phone applications. These services require manual input of a coordinate, capture from a localisation tool (mostly GPS, but also cell tower signals or WiFi traces), or selection of a point on an interactive map; to look up a street address or neighbouring places. Examples of these services include the GeoNames reverse geocoding web service which has tools to identify nearest street address, place names, Wikipedia articles, country, county subdivisions, neighbourhoods, and other location data from a coordinate. Google has also published a reverse geocoding API which can be adapted for online reverse geocoding tools, which uses the same street reference layer as Google maps.Google Codesource reverse Geocoding API Reverse geocoding is not limited to streets only, but can also be used to identify a ship in a canal or lake; as it makes more sense to describe a ship location using nautical map identities. ==Privacy concerns== Geocoding and reverse geocoding have raised potential privacy concerns, especially regarding the ability to reverse engineer street addresses from published static maps. By digitizing published maps it is possible to georeference them by overlaying with other spatial layers and then extract point locations which can be used to identify individuals or reverse geocoded to obtain a street address of the individual. This has potential implications to determine locations for patients or study participants from maps published in medical literature as well as potentially sensitive information published in other journalistic sources. In one study a map of Hurricane Katrina mortality locations published in a Baton Rouge, Louisiana, paper was examined. Using GPS locations obtained from houses where fatalities occurred, the authors were able to determine the relative error between the true house locations and the location determined by georeferencing the published map. The authors found that approximately 45% of the points extracted from the georeferenced map were within 10 meters of a household's GPS obtained point.Curtis, A. J., Mills, J. W., & Leitner, M. (2006) Spatial confidentiality and GIS: re-engineering mortality locations from published maps about Hurricane Katrina J Health Geogr, 5, 44. Another study found similar results in examining hypothetical low and high-resolution patient address maps similar to what might be found published in medical journals. They found approximately 26% of points obtained from a low- resolution map and 79% from a high-resolution map were matched precisely with the true location.Brownstein, J. S., Cassa, C. A., Kohane, I. S., & Mandl, K. D. (2006) An unsupervised classification method for inferring original case locations from low-resolution disease maps Int J Health Geogr, 5, 56 The findings from these studies raise concerns regarding the potential use of georeferencing and reverse geocoding of published maps to elucidate sensitive or private information on mapped individuals. Guidelines for the display and publication of potentially sensitive information are inconsistently applied and no uniform procedure has been identified. The use of blurring algorithms which shift the location of mapped points have been proposed as a solution. In addition, where direct reference to the geography of the area mapped is not required, it may be possible to use abstract space on which to display spatial patterns. ==Footnotes== Category:Geocodes ","title":"Reverse geocoding"},{"id":"20149057","text":"Simone Aresti (born 15 March 1986) is an Italian footballer from Sardinia who plays as a goalkeeper for Serie A club Cagliari. == Club career  Goalkeeper goleador === During the 2011–12 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione season, the goalkeeper Aresti, while wearing the shirt of Italian club Savona, scored 2 goals.http://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/legapro/?action=read&idnet;=dHV0dG9sZWdhcHJvLmNvbS00MzcyMg On 10 July 2018, Aresti returned at Serie A side Cagliari.

Three seasons later, in his draft year, he was traded to the Moose Jaw Warriors and put up 56 points between the two teams. He was then drafted in the seventh round, 189th overall, by the Boston Bruins in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft. Returning to the Warriors, Knackstedt recorded a team-leading 85 points, seventh overall in league scoring. At the end of the WHL season, he was assigned by Boston to complete 2007–08 with the Providence Bruins of the American Hockey League (AHL). On December 9, 2010, he was traded along with Jeff LoVecchio to the Florida Panthers in exchange for Sean Zimmerman and a conditional seventh round pick in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft. Knackstedt signed a one-year contract with Bolzano-Bozen Foxes (HC Bolzano) as a free agent on 2011. On September 25, 2013, the Bakersfield Condors of the ECHL signed Knackstedt for the 2013–14 season. After a successful season with the Condors, Knackstedt opted to resume a European career in signing a one-year deal with Rubin Tyumen of the Russian second league the VHL, on August 6, 2014. He endured a journeyman 2014–15 season, transferring to fellow VHL club, Saryarka Karaganda before finishing the season in Germany with ESV Kaufbeuren of the DEL2.

Non- receptor tyrosine kinases are a subgroup of protein family tyrosine kinases, enzymes that can transfer the phosphate group from ATP to a tyrosine residue of a protein (phosphorylation). These enzymes regulate many cellular functions by switching on or switching off other enzymes in a cell. Unlike the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), the second subgroup of tyrosine kinases, the non- receptor tyrosine kinases are cytosolic enzymes. Thirty-two non-receptor tyrosine kinases have been identified in human cells (). Non-receptor tyrosine kinases regulate cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, migration and apoptosis, and they are critical components in the regulation of the immune system. == Function == The main function of nRTKs is their involvement in signal transduction in activated T- and B-cells in the immune system. Signaling by many receptors is dependent on nRTKs including T-cell receptors (TCR), B-cell receptors (BCR), IL-2 receptors (IL-2R), Ig receptors, erythropoietin (EpoR) and prolactin receptors. CD4 and CD8 receptors on T lymphocytes require for their signaling the Src family member Lck. When antigen binds to T-cell receptor, Lck becomes autophosphorylated and phosphorylates the zeta chain of the T-cell receptor, subsequently another nRTK, Zap70, binds to this T-cell receptor and then participates in downstream signaling events that mediate transcriptional activation of cytokine genes. Another Src family member Lyn is involved in signaling mediated by B-cell receptor. Lyn is activated by stimulation of B-cell receptor, which leads to the recruitment and phosphorylation of Zap70-related nRTK, Syk. Another nRTK, Btk, is also involved in signaling mediated by the B-cell receptor. Mutations in the Btk gene are responsible for X-linked agammaglobulinemia, a disease characterized by the lack of mature B-cells. == Structure == Unlike receptor tyrosine kinases, nRTKs lack receptor-like features such as an extracellular ligand-binding domain and a transmembrane-spanning region. Most of the nRTKs are localized in the cytoplasm, but some nRTKs are anchored to the cell membrane through amino-terminal modification. These enzymes commonly have a modular construction and individual domains are joined together by flexible linker sequences. One of the important domain of nRTKs is the tyrosine kinase catalytic domain, which is about 275 residues in length. The structure of the catalytic domain can be divided into a small and a large lobe, where ATP binds to the small lobe and the protein substrate binds to the large lobe. Upon the binding of ATP and substrate to nRTKs, catalysis of phosphate transfer occurs in a cleft between these two lobes. It was found that nRTKs have some sequence preference around the target Tyr. For example, the Src preferred sequence is Glu–Glu/Asp–Ile–Tyr–Gly/Glu–Glu–Phe and Abl preferred sequence is Ile/Val–Tyr–Gly–Val–Leu/Val. Different preferred sequences around Tyr in Src and Abl suggest that these two types of nRTKs phosphorylates different targets. Non-receptor tyrosine kinases do not contain only a tyrosine kinase domain, nRTKs also possess domains that mediate protein-protein, protein- lipid, and protein-DNA interactions. One of the protein-protein interaction domains in nRTKs are the Src homology 2 (SH2) and 3 (SH3) domains. The longer SH2 domain (~100 residues) binds phosphotyrosine (P-Tyr) residues in a sequence-specific manner. The P-Tyr interacts with SH domain in a deep cleft, which cannot bind unphosphorylated Tyr. The SH3 domain is smaller (~60 residues) and binds proline-containing sequences capable of forming a polyproline type II helix. Some nRTKs without SH2 and SH3 domains possess some subfamily-specific domains used for protein-protein interactions. For example, specific domains that target enzymes to the cytoplasmic part of cytokine receptors (Jak family) or two domains: an integrin-binding domain and a focal adhesion-binding domain (Fak family). The nRTK Abl possess the SH2 and SH3 domains, but also possesses other domains for interactions: F actin–binding domain and a DNA-binding domain contains a nuclear localization signal and is found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In addition to SH2 and SH3 domains, Btk/Tec subfamily of nRTKs possess another modular domain, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. These PH domains bind to phosphatidylinositol lipids that have been phosphorylated at particular positions on the head group. These enzymes can bind to activated signaling complexes at the membrane through PH domain interactions with phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol lipids. == Regulation == The most common theme in nRTKs and RTK regulation is tyrosine phosphorylation. With few exceptions, phosphorylation of tyrosines in the activation loop of nRTKs leads to an increase in enzymatic activity. Activation loop phosphorylation occurs via trans-autophosphorylation or phosphorylation by different nRTKs. It is possible to negatively regulate kinase activity by the phosphorylation of tyrosines outside of the activation loop. Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) restore nRTKs to their basal state of activity. In some cases PTPs positively regulate nRTKs activity. ===Src and Abl=== Tyrosine kinases of Src family contain the same typical structure: myristoylated terminus, a region of positively charged residues, a short region with low sequence homology, SH3 and SH2 domains, a tyrosine kinase domain, and a short carboxy-terminal tail. There are two important regulatory tyrosine phosphorylation sites. To repress kinase activity it is possible by phosphorylation of Tyr-527 in the carboxy-terminal tail of Src by the nRTK Csk. By the experiment of v-Src, an oncogenic variant of Src, the importance of this phosphorylation site was confirmed. This oncogenic v-Src is a product of the Rous sarcoma virus and as a result of an carboxy-terminal truncation, v-Src lacks the negative regulatory site Tyr-527 leading this enzyme to be constitutively active that in turn causes uncontrolled growth of infected cells. Moreover, substitution of this tyrosine with phenylalanine in c-Src results in activation. A second regulatory phosphorylation site in Src is Tyr-416. This is an autophosphorylation site in the activation loop. It was found that a phosphorylation of Tyr-416 and Tyr-416 can suppressing the transforming ability of the activating Tyr-527→Phe mutation by Tyr-416→Phe mutation leads to maximal stimulation of kinase activity. Both the SH2 and SH3 domains are important for a negative regulation of Src activity. Mutations in the SH2 and SH3 domains that disrupt binding of phosphotyrosine lead to activation of kinase activity. Although the nRTK Abl contains SH3, SH2, and kinase domains in the same linear order as in Src, regulation of Abl is different. Abl lacks the negative regulatory phosphorylation site that is present in the carboxy terminus of Src, so the carboxy terminus of Abl does not have a functional role in the control of kinase activity. In a contrast to Src, mutations in the SH2 domain of Abl that abrogates phosphotyrosine binding do not activate Abl in vivo. For the repression of kinase activity of Abl is important the SH3 domain; mutations in the SH3 domain result in activation of Abl and cellular transformation. ===ZAP70/Syk and JAKs=== The kinase activity of Syk is regulated by the SH2 domains. Binding of the two SH2 domains to the tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif) sequences in the zeta chain of the T-cell receptor is thought to relieve an inhibitory restraint on the kinase domain, leading to stimulation of catalytic activity. Kinase activity of Zap70 can be increased by phosphorylation of Tyr-493 in the activation loop by Src family member Lck. Conversely the phosphorylation of Tyr-492 inhibit the kinase activity of Zap70; the mutation of Tyr-492 to phenylalanine results in Zap70 hyperactivity. Jak family members possess a fully functional tyrosine kinase domain and additionally pseudo- kinase domain in which substitution of several key catalytic residues leads to inactivation of kinase activity. This pseudo-kinase domain is enzymatically nonfunctional, but maybe it plays a role in the regulation of Jak activity. The experiments with a mutant of the Jak family member Tyk2, in which the pseudo-kinase domain is deleted, showed that these mutant enzyme lacks catalytic activity in vitro and is not capable of interferon-mediated signal transduction. In contrast, another mutant of the Jak family Jak2, also lacking the pseudo-kinase domain, was able to mediate growth hormone signaling. The role of the pseudo-kinase domain in Jak regulation is still not fully understood. There are two tyrosine phosphorylation sites within the activation loop. It is known that the autophosphorylation of the first of these tyrosines is important for stimulation of tyrosine kinase activity and biological function, but the role of the second tyrosine is not clear. JAKs are also regulated by SOCS (suppressor of cytokine signaling) proteins. These proteins contain a pseudo-substrate sequence thought to interfere with Jak substrate binding and phosphoryl transfer. In addition to a pseudo-substrate sequence,SOCS proteins possess an SH2 domain that binds to a phosphotyrosine in the Jak activation loop, which may facilitate interaction between the pseudosubstrate sequence and the kinase domain. Binding of the SH2 domain to the activation loop could also block substrate access directly or alter the conformation of the activation loop to repress catalytic activity. == Inhibitors == The mutation in a gene for non-receptor tyrosine kinase can results an aberrant activity of this enzyme. This pathologically increased activity of nRTK may be responsible for growth and progression of cancer cells, the induction of drug-resistance, formation of metastasis and tumor neovascularization. The inhibition of nRTKs could help to a treatment of these tumors. Some of nRTKs inhibitors are already tested as an anti-cancer agents. This targeted therapy blocks intracellular processes involved in the tumor transformation of cells and / or maintenance of malignant phenotype of tumor cells. Usually monoclonal antibodies are used for the targeted blockade of RTK, which block the extracellular domain of the receptor and prevent the binding of a ligand. For the specific blockade of nRTKs, however, low molecular weight substances called Tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKIs) are used, that block the transduction cascade either at the intracytosplasmatic level, or directly block the nRTKs. ==Examples== Examples of non-receptor tyrosine kinases include: * ABL family ** ABL1 ** ARG * ACK family ** ACK1 ** TNK1 * CSK family ** CSK ** MATK * FAK family ** FAK ** PYK2 * FES family ** FES ** FER * FRK family ** FRK ** BRK ** SRMS * JAK family ** JAK1 ** JAK2 ** JAK3 ** TYK2 * SRC family ** SRC ** FGR ** FYN ** YES1 ** BLK ** HCK ** LCK ** LYN * SYK family ** SYK ** ZAP70 * TEC family ** TEC ** BMX ** BTK ** ITK ** TXK ==References== Category:EC 2.7.10 Category:Enzymes of known structure ","title":"Non-receptor tyrosine kinase"},{"id":"20149105","text":"One in a Million is Malaysia's first ever reality singing competition to offer a RM 1 million prize to the winner. The third season, which was aired from 23 January to 1 May 2009, was won by Shah Indrawan Ismail, the first male and first established artiste to do so. ==Auditions== The preliminary auditions for season three of One in a Million were held in the following locations: {class= ! City !! Venue !! Date !! Notes -  Kota Kinabalu, Sabah  Imperial International Hotel  15 November 2008  437 people auditioned. -  Kuching, Sarawak  Merdeka Palace Hotel & Suites  15 November 2008  -  Johor Bahru, Johor  The Puteri Pacific  22 November 2008  -  Georgetown, Penang  Sunway Hotel  22 November 2008  About 200 people auditioned. -  Kuala Lumpur  Berjaya Times Square  29 November 2008  More than 1200 people auditioned. } This time, auditions were open to hopefuls aged 16 to 32, compared to the previous season's 18-30 limit. Besides these, pre-audition road shows were held in these cities (two weeks before their respective auditions), featuring promotions for One in a Million and performances by OIAM alumni from both past seasons. All preliminary auditions were preceded by different judges. Those who qualified from the auditions underwent another audition stage in Berjaya Times Square on 30 November and 1 December, where they met Paul Moss and Syafinaz. The telecast on 8TV began with footage from this stage, unlike in previous seasons which began with the individual preliminary auditions. Not unlike in previous seasons, artistes who still or used to hold recording contracts were still welcome, but this time around, they skipped the preliminary auditions to participate on the main audition on 1 December, in the Gardens Hotel, Mid Valley. Among those who qualified included Norafizah Mohd Yasin, winner of TV3's Mentor; Tomok, lead vocalist of New Boyz; Amylea Azizan, Akademi Fantasia alumnus. ==Central Eliminations== Only eighty have qualified into the Central Eliminations round held in Peninsula Residence, Damansara from 11 till 19 December (aired on 6 and 13 February). A major twist in this season is the Blind Test, in which contestants performed behind a paper screen, only to have their shadows seen by the judges which focused on their voices, brought forward as the first challenge. According to Moss, he and Syafinaz would have found it more effective to sort out the more desirable voices. 20 have been eliminated from this stage. Secondly, came the group singing in which the remaining sixty formed into groups of six or seven, each of which are all of the same gender. The female groups chose between One Step at a Time (Jordin Sparks) and Cinta di Akhir Garisan (Ziana Zain); while the males had Juwita (Citra Terindah) (M. Nasir) or My Girl (The Temptations). Another 20 were sent packing after this test. The remaining forty were divided into the Top 20 and Bottom 20 based on the judges' evaluation, after which each of the Top 20 picked an MP3 player from a table, studies the song in it, and chose a duet partner from the Bottom 20. Paul Moss remarked had he been in the Top 20, he would pick a weaker contestant to gain an edge into the next stage. Having said that, the twenty best finalists were selected not based on being the better in their respective pairs. The Central Eliminations concluded with a one-on-one final evaluation in which each contestant went on stage either alone or in a pair, sang on their own in front of the judges, each contestant was shown their fate immediately after their performance ends. As is of the previous seasons, only 12 make it into the competition rounds. ==Finalists== *Shah Indrawan Ismail (Tomok) **Winner **Immunity (2): 13 March; 27 March 2009 *Elizabeth Applunius Chin (Esther) **1st Runner-up **Immunity (2): 20 February; 20 March 2009 *Nasharul Aweera bin Noriyissham (Weera) *2nd Runner-up **Immunity: 6 March 2009 *Zulqarnain bin Jaafar (Nine) **Eliminated: 24 April 2009 *Amylea binti Azizan (Amy) **Immunity: 27 February 2009 **Eliminated: 17 April 2009 *Simon Christopher Michael (Simon) **Eliminated: 10 April 2009 *Muhammad Ridzuan bin Sharifuddin (Rizu) **Eliminated: 3 April 2009 *Fify Emielia Shazlin binti Ahmad Murshaidi (Fify) **Eliminated: 27 March 2009 *Anith Aqilah binti Sulaiman Lim (Anith) **Eliminated: 20 March 2009 *Norafizah binti Mohamad Yasin (Pija) **Eliminated: 13 March 2009 *Rehana binti Mohd Yunus (Han) **Eliminated: 6 March 2009 *Nur Hidayu binti Md Tekhary (Ayu) **Eliminated: 27 February 2009 ==Performances== The competitive performances are held every Friday, going on-air at 9.30 pm, beginning 20 February 2009, in Sri Pentas 2, Plaza Alam Sentral, Shah Alam. The surprise of the season is, each week from Top 12 till Top 7, an immunity will be granted to the week's best performer as per judges' evaluation, which exempts him/her from the voting sessions, thus guaranteeing him/her a spot in each coming week's performances. As usual, voting lines open only after the show, with which viewers send in SMSes to vote in or out each contestant. The finalist with the lowest votes leaves at the beginning of each coming week's show. ===Top 12 (20 February 2009)=== The Top 12 opened their first night with the song Itu Kamu (originally sung by Estranged). The judges announced the immunity system as their surprise after all 12 performed individually, with Esther being first given the honour to be exempt from the decisive public voting. ===Top 11: Memori Tercipta (27 February 2009)=== *Eliminated: Ayu - Makhluk Tuhan Paling Seksi (Mulan Jameela) The theme of the night was \\"Memori Tercipta\\" (\\"A Memory is Born\\"), songs which remind them of someone). *Guest judge: Salamiah Hassan *Immunity: Amylea ===Top 10 (6 March 2009)=== *Eliminated: Han - I Don't Want to Miss a Thing (Aerosmith). *Guest judge: Jaclyn Victor *Immunity: Weera ===Top 9: Songwriters' Week (13 March 2009)=== *Eliminated: Pija - Satu Harapan (Jaclyn Victor).

The judges announced that no new immunity would be granted for the rest of the competition, thus resting the fate of all six finalists completely in the hands of the voting audience.

Votes from last week's performances were carried forward to the one-hour showdown throughout which viewers could vote for the last time. Each contestant was assigned two SMS lines and one landline in anticipation of a major influx of votes.

In North America it is found from California to Alaska, and in Asia from Hokkaido northwards. At its southern limits, it hybridizes with Mytilus galloprovincialis (the Mediterranean mussel), which has been introduced to the Pacific by human activity.McDonald JH, Seed R, Koehn RK (1991) Allozyme and morphometric characters of three species of Mytilus in the northern and southern hemispheres.

In these regions it often coexists and hybridizes with Mytilus edulis. The entire Baltic Sea is inhabited by a peculiar population of Mytilus trossulus, which shows some genetic introgression from M. edulis and whose mitochondrial DNA has been replaced by M. edulis mtDNA.Vainola R, Strelkov P (2011) Mytilus trossulus in Northern Europe Marine Biology 158: 817-833.

The script is bilingual, featuring seven Japanese performers and seven Australian performers. It follows the adventures of Kelsey Clarke and the warrior doll Nozomi as they journey to the Underground to liberate the monster world from the mysterious Angelica. The show was first performed at the Kijimuna Festival in Okinawa, Japan, and later appeared as a headline act at the OzAsia Festival in Adelaide, South Australia. It was a collaboration between the Kijimuna Festival, Flinders University Drama Centre and Adelaide Festival Centre. ==Synopsis== Kelsey Clarke is very afraid. She is afraid of germs, she is afraid of traffic…even the toaster makes her feel very afraid. Deep in the Underground, the monsters are afraid too. Angelica, the Blue Fairy, has flown into their world. No longer will the monsters be allowed to terrify unsuspecting children, no longer can they drink blood and dance the night away. Powerless to confront Angelica, the Tengu — Lord of the Underground — has no choice but to find the world’s most frightened child and teach her to confront her fear. For timid Kelsey, this means putting on her best cardigan and plunging headlong into the monster kingdom — from murky swamps to haunted Ghost Roads! With an enchanted doll and a vegetarian vampire to guide her, Kelsey touches her darker side. But is becoming her own nightmare any better than cowering alone under blankets? Can Kelsey summon the courage to find her true self, face her demons and stand against the magical Angelica? Or will the sun rise forever on a future where only the fearful survive? ==Intercultural Significance== Kelsey meets Nozomi Director Catherine Fitzgerald claimed in Rip It Up magazine that Once Upon a Midnight has a metaphorical base > \\"It works on many levels. Is it about a young kid with fear who gets > kidnapped by monsters? Or is it something else? Is it about the war on > terror? There are a lot of things layered into the story.\\" The show was written in equal parts English and Japanese, with Australian playwright Alex Vickery-Howe working closely with Japanese translator Ken Yamamura. The combination of languages posed interesting challenges.

She studied literature in Colombes, then at the Sorbonne. Her doctoral thesis was in French literature, discussing the work of Armand Robin. She later wrote another thesis on the work on François-Marie Luzel.« Dérives bretonnantes » , L'Express, 13. Her subsequent works typically fall into five different areas of literature: ==Theatre== Her translation of Eugene O'Neill's Desire Under the Elms led her to translate other dramatic literature, such as John Millington Synge and parts Seán O'Casey. She has also created new translations of Chekhov and Shakespeare in collaboration with André Markowicz. She won the 2006 Molière prize for best theatrical adaptation with André Markowicz for her version of Chekhov's Platonov, directed by Alain Francon. She also creates shows for Breton theatre troupes, notably Le Pain des âmes, D'un Buisson de ronces (Spiritual Bread: of a Thornbush). She also adapted the myth of Sainte Tryphine et le roi Arthur (\\"Saint Tryphine and King Arthur\\") from the writings of Luzel. ==Critical editions== She published editions of the works of Armand Robin, including his manuscripts, which she first published in their full original form, which had previously been truncated. She has also published the prose works of François- Marie Luzel (eighteen volumes) by scrupulously adhering to Luzel's manuscripts, given in facsimile and always giving the original text where they exist in both the French and Breton languages (Tales of Brittany, Rennes University Press). She has also published works by Danielle Collobert, and has contributed over a hundred prefaces, articles and essays to scholarly editions of poetry and literature. She has also published translations of Marie de France and the poems of Sylvia Plath. ==Children's literature== La Gavotte du mille pattes (The thousand footed gavotte) was the first of her books of songs, followed by books of stories La Femme du loup gris (The Woman of the gray wolf), L'École des loisirs (School of recreation) and Lutins et lutines (Elves and goblins). She worked in collaboration with illustrators. ==Folklore== Editing Luzel led her to continue her research in the folklore of the fantastic and supernatural, especially fairies and elves, as in Vie et mœurs des lutins Bretons (Life and manners of Breton elves) and La douce vie des fées des eaux (The sweet life of water-fairies). She considered authentic folk traditions to be an increasingly frail barrier against the commercialization of folklore. She aspired to authenticity by basing her studies on journals giving precise references and citing them specifically in the texts, while including her own form of humour and poetry based on these sources. She has expanded her work in folklore beyond Brittany to France as a whole and initiated the series \\"The Great Collections\\" published by Ouest- France: it has published the folk-story collections of Jean-François Blade (Gascony), of Amélie Bosquet (Normandy) and Henry Carnoy (Picardy). ==Breton regionalism== Françoise Morvan has published a provisional autobiographical memoir, which is subtitled \\"drifting identity and nationalism in Brittany\\". She has published on the same theme an article which was reproduced by the Breton Information Group (Groupe information Bretagne, or GRIB), which she helped to found. She defended linguist François Falc'hun from numerous \\"telephone harassment campaigns\\" by Breton nationalists.Françoise Morvan, Le Monde comme si - Nationalisme et dérive identitaire en Bretagne, Actes Sud, 2002, p 132. Her memoir \\"Le Monde comme si\\" (The world as if) caused controversy in Brittany because of its attacks on the Breton regionalist movement (emsav). She discusses the arguments about the authenticity of Barzaz Breiz, the cultural and political movements in Brittany, their attitude during World War II, the creation of the unified Breton spelling, the Cultural Institute of Brittany, the subsidies given for the Breton language, the Flag of Brittany, among other things. ==Principal publications== * by Armand Robin: ** La Fausse parole, reprint. ** Armand Robin. n° spécial, revue Obsidiane, 1985 ** Écrits oubliés .1, essais critiques - Armand Robin.

Allen, Ian Allan Ltd., 1964 (3rd edition 1974). History of the North Eastern Railway, Chapter XXI) was a joint line which ran from Aire Junction, on the main line of the Hull and Barnsley Railway, near Gowdall to the Great Central and Midland Joint Railway at Braithwell Junction. ==Description== Railway Clearing House diagram showing the Great Central, Hull & Barnsley, and Midland joint line (yellow) The railway consisted of a double track main line ( in length) which branched from the Hull and Barnsley railway at Aire junction near Gowdall.Railway Memories No.12 : The Hull and Barnsley Railway, Compiler: Stephen Chapman, Bellcode books, pp. 6–7, 66–71. The line crossed the Knottingley and Goole Canal (part of the Aire and Calder Navigation) via a rolling bascule lifting bridge.The bridge was never operable – it could be made working if the Canal began to carry ships The River Don was also crossed by a girder truss bridge with approach spans on either side. Path along the former line to Doncaster (York Road) In addition to the main length of the line there were five branches: *From Bullcroft junction at south of Aire junction. ** To Bullcroft Colliery, ** Bentley New Colliery, * To Doncaster (York Road) railway station, * To Sprotborough Junctions with GC (Doncaster Avoiding Line), * To Yorkshire Main Colliery, The line had five passenger stations although never a passenger service. The stations were situated on the edge or between the villages in their titles, even Doncaster (York Road) was well north of the town, beyond the Avoiding Line. ===Laughton to Ravenfield joint line=== Remains of a bridge of the line between Laughton Junction and Ravenfield near Thurcroft :Known as the Great Central, Hull & Barnsley and Midland Joint Railway Committee At the time of the construction of the South Yorkshire Joint Railway a joint line was authorised for the Great Central, Midland and Hull and Barnsley Railways to operate. This line ran from Laughton (where it connected to the end of the Shireoaks, Laughton and Maltby Railway) to Ravenfield where it connected at Laughton West junction to the Great Central and Midland Railway's joint branch serving Silverwood Colliery. It connected to the Hull and Barnsley and Great Central Joint at Braithwell junction and opened in 1909.The Hull and Barnsley Railway, G.D. Parkes, Oakwood Press, p. 11. ==History== Former trackbed of the Hull and Barnsley and Great Central Joint Railway north of Thorpe in Balne The line originally was to be worked by the Hull and Barnsley Railway and the Midland Railway; later in the planning stage the North Eastern Railway was offered running powers which resulted in the opposition of the Great Central. Eventually an act of parliament was passed in 1909 with the line as a joint H&BR; and GC operation. The line opened on 1 May 1916.The Hull and Barnsley Railway, G.D. Parkes, The Oakwood Press, pp. 11–12. The first closure came in 1939 with the south curve at York Road but the first main line closure, that from Bullcroft Junction to Aire Junction, took place in October 1958, however about one mile of this track was reopened in December 1961 and extended to Thorpe Marsh Power Station. This arrangement lasted until September 1970 when a new connection was put in from the WR&GR.; Also in September 1970 the lines from Bullcroft Colliery to Skellow and Bullcroft Junction to Doncaster Junction closed. Warmsworth to Sprotborough closed in February 1969 and Warmsworth to Braithwell in March 1969 although this line had not seen through traffic for over 20 years. In later years the line was used for wagon storage. First in the Second World War the southern section was used for the storage of 'cripples' – wagons repairable but with no time and no facilities to do the work in the war. It continued after the war with the line south of Warmsworth Junction being unavailable for traffic. The development of the coalfield north of Doncaster did not, at that time, materialise and traffic was always 'light'. It was not until the line had been closed that the Selby Coalfield came on stream. ==Notes References Literature=== *\\"Great Central\\" (Vol 3) (Fay sets the pace, 1900–1922), Ian Allan / Locomotive Pub.

He was ordained a priest on 29 June 1968 in Verona, Italy. == Diplomatic career == In 1991 he was appointed Titular Archbishop of Nova Caesaris and Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to Burundi. By 1996 he was Apostolic Nuncio to Bolivia and in 1999 he moved on to Peru. On 8 November 2008, Pope Benedict XVI appointed him Apostolic Nuncio to Portugal. He also served in the Apostolic Nunciature in Australia in the late 1970s and in the United Kingdom under Apostolic Nuncio Barbaroto. === Portugal ===  Criticism  The criticism started shortly after he started his tenure in Portugal and refused to disclose his criteria for the selection of new potential candidates for bishops to the Episcopal Conference of Portugal. Passagiato was accused by the Portuguese catholic clergy of taking \\"deplorable\\" and \\"inhumane\\" decisions regarding the affairs of the Holy See in Portugal. Portuguese bishops and clergy accused Passagiato of favouring bishops candidates who are \\"traditionalists\\" and \\"career oriented\\", and of \\"not listening to people\\". = António Francisco dos Santos case = António Francisco dos Santos was Bishop of Aveiro until 2014. Following the appointment of Manuel Clemente to the Patriarchate of Lisbon, Passigato decided, in a nine month lengthy process, to relocate Bishop dos Santos to Porto in order to substitute Bishop Clemente. The suggestion of Bishop dos Santos, made to Pope, was resisted, in the beginning, by the appointee and shortly before his appointment was made official two priests from Aveiro appealed to Passigato's piety due to the poor heart condition of Bishop dos Santos who himself feared not being capable of heading a bigger diocese. Bishop dos Santos would die 3 years after his appointment to Porto due to heart attack. = João Lavrador case = João Lavrador, current Bishop of Angra, also pleaded Nuncio Passigato for his piety to not be appointed as Bishop at the time in order to be able to assist his bedridden parents. Passigato refused such plead and had Lavrador appointed as Bishop in 2015, shortly after his father died in April 2016 and his mother in January 2017. In this regard Passigato was accused of not taking into consideration catholic family values. == Honours == * 80x80px Grand Cross of the Order of Christ of the Portuguese Republic (11 March 2010).Portuguese Presidency Website, Orders search form : type \\"Joan-Enric Vives i\\" in \\"nome\\", then click \\"Pesquisar\\" *80x80px Grand Cross of the Order of Saint James of the Sword of the Portuguese Republic (6 June 2009). ==References * Archbishop Rino Passigato at Catholic Hierarchy Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:People from Bovolone Category:Italian titular archbishops Category:Apostolic Nuncios to Portugal Category:Apostolic Nuncios to Peru Category:Apostolic Nuncios to Burundi Category:Apostolic Nuncios to Bolivia Category:20th-century Roman Catholics Category:21st-century Roman Catholics ","title":"Rino Passigato"},{"id":"20149365","text":"The Bulgarian Virtual University (BVU) is a partnership of Bulgarian universities collaborating in the development of distance and online education.Bulgarian Virtual University (in Bulgarian) ==History== The Bulgarian Virtual University (BVU) was established at the end of 2004. The initiative came from the Chairmen of the Council of Rectors of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, the Higher Certifying Committee, the Union of Teachers, the Federation of the Unions of Scientists, the Bulgarian Association of Information Technologies and other educational, research and business organisations. The agreement to set the BVU up was signed by the Rectors of 37 Universities and the Directors of 27 Institutes of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. ==Mission== The idea of the initiators and founders was that the Bulgarian Virtual University would initially be a national educational portal to all universities in the country (similar to the Canadian Virtual University) and its independent functions and importance would gradually increase. As Professor Y. Kouzmanova, PhD, Chairman of the Council of Rectors, stated in her welcoming speech, This is the first realistic step towards the integration of the universities in Bulgaria. BVU has not been established with the aim of becoming a governing body, thus restricting and taking over some of the functions of the regional universities. The goal of BVU is not to teach students and confer qualifications at the moment because in Bulgaria there is no still legislation for virtual education.. The goal of BVU and the programme as a whole is to provide all-round technical and methodological support to the regional universities in their transition to electronic education, namely in setting up computer rooms and adopting software platforms for electronic education, as well as in developing web-based courses and virtual laboratories, creating virtual libraries, centres for distance learning, virtual universities and campuses. Another equally important goal of BVU is to promote the integration of the Bulgarian with the European and world virtual educational space. ==Success== At the end of 2008 four years will have passed since the establishment of the Bulgarian Virtual University. Besides serving successfully as a portal to the regional universities, this site allows an interested person to start his search from a specific area of higher education, and going through the professional field, to find a relevant degree programme, and, eventually, the sites of the universities offering Bachelor courses in this programme. The BVU site is also the centre of the national network of virtual libraries in Bulgaria. ==References * Category:Education in Bulgaria Category:Educational organizations based in Bulgaria ","title":"Bulgarian Virtual University"},{"id":"20149389","text":"East Cape is a former New Zealand Parliamentary electorate, from 1978 to 1993. ==Population centres== The 1977 electoral redistribution was the most overtly political since the Representation Commission had been established through an amendment to the Representation Act in 1886, initiated by Muldoon's National Government. As part of the 1976 census, a large number of people failed to fill out an electoral re-registration card, and census staff had not been given the authority to insist on the card being completed. This had little practical effect for people on the general roll, but it transferred Māori to the general roll if the card was not handed in. Together with a northward shift of New Zealand's population, this resulted in five new electorates having to be created in the upper part of the North Island. The electoral redistribution was very disruptive, and 22 electorates were abolished, while 27 electorates were newly created (including East Cape) or re-established. These changes came into effect for the . The East Cape electorate was made up of areas that previously belonged to (which moved south) and (which was abolished). Settlements in the original electorate included Whakatane, Opotiki, Taneatua, Te Kaha, Tokomaru Bay, Tolaga Bay, and Matawai. The electorate stopped just short of the city of Gisborne, but included the suburb of Kaiti. Subsequent boundary changes through the 1983 electoral redistribution drew the electorate further from Gisborne and included Kawerau and Murupara. In 1993, the East Cape electorate was abolished and most of its area was included in the Eastern Bay of Plenty electorate, with the portion from Hicks Bay to south of Tokomaru Bay included in the electorate. ==History== The East Cape electorate was first won by Duncan MacIntyre of the National Party in 1978, who had previously been the representative for the Bay of Plenty electorate (1975–78).

She pushes her younger sister Katie (Joan Leslie) into a marriage with singer/dancer Albert Runkel (Jack Carson). Katie has no interest in the man, but is desperate to leave the poor conditions that she and her sister live in, in a dirty steel town. Runkel's partner Paul Collins (Dennis Morgan) realizes Helen's deeper intentions and tries to stop her from breaking Runkel's heart. Now living in wealthier surroundings, Helen tries to make a start on Katie's career. After showcasing her in Runkel's act, she is able to put her in a Broadway production. Katie soon becomes a successful singer and actress, and Collins and Runkel's act flounders. Runkel can't bear being away from his wife on tour and refuses to live off her earnings or even use his wife's name to promote himself. He eventually commits suicide. Meanwhile, Katie's popularity goes to her head, and she becomes a wild party girl, losing an important opportunity. She later meets with Paul, who is now a successful band leader. He falls in love with Katie, and they start a relationship. However, Katie is forced to choose between him and appearing in Helen's first play. She chooses the play over Paul, who has asked her to marry him, and he leaves. Before the play, Paul comes to see Katie to wish her luck, but Helen runs him off and the sisters fight over the motivation for Katie's success. During the play, Katie forgets lines and has to be cued several times before collapsing in the middle of the production. Later that evening, after recovering from her collapse, Katie tells Helen that she never wants to see her again. Paul appears and the two profess their love for each other. ==Cast== {  -  70px Ida Lupino as Mrs. Helen Chernen  70px Joan Leslie as 'Katie' Blaine -  70px Dennis Morgan as Paul Collins 70px Jack Carson as Albert Runkel - } * Gladys George as Lily Emery * Faye Emerson as Ice Cream Parlor Waitress * Paul Cavanagh as John \\"Jack\\" Shagrue * Dolores Moran as Young Blonde (uncredited) * Emory Parnell as Policeman (uncredited) ==Production== Both Bette Davis and Ginger Rogers initially were offered the role of Helen, but both declined. Ida Lupino was cast. Shaw wanted Howard Hawks or William Wyler to direct the film, but because they were busy with other projects, producer Jerry Wald hired Vincent Sherman. Portions of a documentary film by Pare Lorentz were used to represent the mining town of Green Hill. To achieve a more realistic feel during the scenes that took place in Green Hill, neither Lupino nor Leslie wore makeup. The film's first and last scenes were added at Jack L.

Davis (Stargate SG-1 George Hammond), who died from a heart attack in 2008. \\"Enemy at the Gate\\" involves a Wraith plan to significantly upgrade a Hive Ship by integrating it with stolen Zero Point Modules from Asurans, and picks up a weak transmission from Earth from an alternate reality (\\"Vegas\\"), alerting the ship to Earth's location. ==Plot== \\"Todd\\" (Christopher Heyerdahl) informs Atlantis that a group of Wraith have multiple ZPMs and they plan to use one of them to power a new super Hive Ship. \\"Todd\\" urges the expedition to destroy it, but when the team reaches the hive, they realize that the ZPM has already made the ship far more powerful than expected, and causes significant damage to Daedalus before jumping into hyperspace. The team then finds out that the Hive has picked up a subspace transmission from the alternate reality depicted in \\"Vegas\\", giving the Wraith the location of Earth. Earth sends Apollo and Sun Tzu to stop them, but the two ships are quickly disabled. Lt. Col. Sheppard (Joe Flanigan) gates to Earth and warns Carter (Amanda Tapping) of the situation. However, before their plan of fitting nukes on the F-302s is complete, they discover that the ship has already arrived, and is sending a large squadron of darts, which perform a kamikaze run into Area 51, destroying the Antarctic Ancient control chair, and ZPM losing hope of using the Antarctic drone weapons against the ship. Sheppard, however, plans on using his F-302 to break into the Hive, where he might detonate a nuclear weapon destroying the Hive from within. Meanwhile, Carson Beckett (Paul McGillion) returns and flies the city to Earth, after finding more ZPMs from \\"Todd\\". However, the stardrive shuts down just as they approach the Milky Way. Zelenka (David Nykl) is able to implement a \\"wormhole drive\\", which sends the city to Earth within seconds. Meanwhile, in attempting to gate to Earth the Atlantis expedition connects to a Stargate aboard the Hive, which has been brought for the purpose of superseding Earth's gate to prevent dialing out. Woolsey (Robert Picardo) sends Teyla (Rachel Luttrell), Ronon (Jason Momoa), McKay (David Hewlett) and Lorne (Kavan Smith) to the Hive to destroy it. However, in the process, Ronon is killed. The team find Sheppard about to detonate the nuke, but stop him. Since the Hive is over Earth, they plan to remote detonate the nuke, after they safely gate to the Alpha Site. They find Ronon, who was brought back to life by the Wraith and rescue him. Meanwhile, Atlantis arrives to destroy the ship, but the powerful weapons push Atlantis into Earth's atmosphere. Before the shield fails, the Hive is destroyed by the nuclear warhead. Atlantis is burning up on re-entry, though Carson manages to control the city, and lands in the Pacific Ocean, subsequently cloaking and secretly moving Atlantis to the coast off San Francisco. In the end, the team takes time to admire the view of the Golden Gate Bridge. ==Production== Even though \\"Enemy at the Gate\\" is the final episode in the series, its production number was 519, leaving 520 for \\"Vegas\\", which was filmed on location in Las Vegas, Nevada. The shooting of \\"Enemy at the Gate\\" overlapped with \\"Vegas\\", which was not unusual as Atlantis used to film multiple shows at the same time during its run. The VFX budget was over half a million dollars, only being seconded by \\"The Daedalus Variations\\" for the most VFX dollars spent on an episode in season 5. Many of the happenings in \\"Enemy at the Gate\\" were originally planned because the episode was the 100th episode as well as a season finale. When the writers learned of the cancellation, they found the events even more appropriate to serve as series finale. In writing the episode, the writers had to take a lot of backstory into account. It needed to be addressed that the Atlantis characters did not necessarily know the recurring characters from the Stargate franchise such as Major Davis. Stargate Atlantis was originally intended to be continued by a two-hour movie, but MGM filed for bankruptcy in 2010 and shelved the Atlantis film indefinitely. Because it was not very clear to the audience, Paul Mullie explained that the \\"Todd\\" character \\"is very much back to being a full-fledged human life sucker at the beginning of this episode\\", and gave this as the reason why Sheppard appears so cruel to \\"Todd\\". The original first scene included explanatory dialog, which was cut when SciFi asked for a Keller scene earlier in the show so that her appearance in the last third would not be as jarring. New explanatory dialog that Mullie added to the first act of the script was filmed but later cut for time. There are plans to make the trimmed and cut scenes available in a special extended version, likely to be released on DVD. Brad Wright temporarily considered to use the wormhole drive as a set- up for a similar drive in Stargate Universe, but instead, this technology is planned to appear as part of the story for the Atlantis film. The last scene's possible connection to Star Trek is pure coincidence. The producers had wanted the city to come down on Earth near a recognizable landmark, as to be different from the previous five years of the show where Atlantis was always located in the middle of the ocean. Martin Gero and Carl Binder were insistent that it should be the Statue of Liberty, but the geography was not plausible enough for leaving the city cloaked for any length of time without anyone noticing and/or getting killed. So the producers settled on San Francisco and the Golden Gate Bridge. Although the producers knew of Don S. Davis' (George Hammond) heart problems, his death \\"came as a total shock\\" to them. They originally talked about just showing an \\"in memoriam\\" card at the end of the show, but as Davis's death also meant the end of the character's arc, they decided to acknowledge it by renaming the ship. ==Release and reception== After its US release, \\"Enemy at the Gate\\" received a Neilson rating of 1.5, making Stargate Atlantis the second-highest rated Sci Fi series of the week, with the lead being the finale of Sanctuary, which earned a 1.6 rating. In total, \\"Enemy at the Gate\\" was viewed by 2.02 million people, including 973,000 for in the 18 to 49 demographic, and 1.12 million age 25 to 54. In the UK, the finale was viewed by 633,000, placing Stargate Atlantis third in the top ten for Sky1 in that week, behind The Simpsons and season seven premiere of 24. However, IGN reviewer Tory Ireland Mell has given the episode a \\"mediocre\\" score of 5.8 out of 10, where the reviewer felt that everything on the episode was \\"forced\\", and felt the final scene was \\"uninspiring\\", though the episode was praised for the conversation between Sheppard and Carter. Sci Fi Wire said that the episode was a very \\"Satisfying conclusion\\" for the series end. The episode won the awards for \\"Best Overall Sound in a Dramatic Series\\" and \\"Best Sound Editing in a Dramatic Series\\" at the 2009 Leo Awards. ==References * Enemy at the Gate at mgm.com * Category:Stargate Atlantis episodes Category:American television series finales Category:2009 American television episodes ","title":"Enemy at the Gate (Stargate Atlantis)"},{"id":"20149614","text":"Groupe Barrière operates casinos in France, Switzerland and elsewhere in Europe. The group also operates in the French luxury hotel industry and in the catering and leisure industries. ==History== 5 Stars Normandy Hotel, Deauville ===François André, founder=== *1912-1951: re-inventing the Deauville and La Baule seaside resorts As a young man from Ardèche who came up to Paris in the early 20th century, François André started a casino business by acquiring the Ostend casino in Belgium, while Eugène Cornuché, his partner, began building the Hôtel Normandy and having the Deauville casino rebuilt in 1912. In 1918, François André set up the Haussmann gaming circle in Paris and continued to grow his business by designing the La Baule resort based on the Deauville model and by purchasing the Hôtel Royal and casino in 1923. He invented the modern day resort concept by combining casinos, luxury hotels and sports facilities all on one site. In 1926, François André took on the construction of the Hôtel Hermitage at La Baule. 1927, he took over from Eugène Cornuché as managing director of SHCD (Société des Hôtels et Casino de Deauville). He then had the Hôtel du Golf in Deauville built. ===Lucien Barrière=== *1951-1987 - Groupe Lucien Barrière's founding and development throughout France In 1951, Lucien Barrière, François André's nephew, joined the group. In 1957 Lucien Barrière was appointed to the Board of several of the group's entities and became his uncle's sole legal heir in 1961. He undertook a project to modernise and develop the group by buying new establishments in Trouville, Dinard, St-Malo, Royan and Enghien-les-Bains. In 1980, SHCLB (Société Hôtelière de la Chaîne Lucien Barrière) was founded to cover the La Baule hotels and casinos. In 1987, Lucien Barrière participated in the arrival of slot machines in France. ===Diane Barrière-Desseigne=== *1990-2000: In the early 1990s, Accor became a major SHCLB shareholder. In 1990, Diane Barrière- Desseigne succeeded her father, Lucien Barrière, and launched major renovation projects. On top of their prestige, the hotels are closely connected to the film industry and the Arts. The elite figures of the film industry visit the Normandy Barrière and the Royal Barrière during the American Film Festival in Deauville. In 1995, Diane Barrière-Desseigne suffered a very serious plane accident and from 1997, her husband Dominique Desseigne co-managed the SHCD and SHCLB at her side. In 1998, SHCD bought Fouquet's restaurant and brand. Diane Barrière-Desseigne died in 2001. Dominique Desseigne took over group management and became chairman of SFCMC. ===Dominique Desseigne=== *Since 2001: Under the chairmanship of Dominique Desseigne, the SHCD and the SHCLB took on a new dimension with the first international developments. In 2003, SHCLB opened the Casino Barrière de Montreux in Switzerland, which became the leading casino in Switzerland in 2008 in terms of total gross gaming takings.*Source: Commission Fédérale des Maisons de Jeux en Suisse (Swiss Casino Federal Gaming Commission) During the same year, SHCD took over the Ryads Resort Development, owner of the land on which the Hôtel Naoura Barrière in Marrakech (Morocco) was later built, supported by top ranking investors who purchased an equity stake in Ryads Resort Development. In 2004, the Desseigne- Barrière family, Accor and Colony Capital investment funds decided to team up as Société Hôtelière de la Chaîne Lucien Barrière, subsequently renamed Groupe Lucien Barrière, which combined the businesses of SHCD, SHCLB and Accor Casinos to create a prestigious casino and hotel group. Since 2005, the expansion has continued with the opening of casinos in Toulouse, Cairo, Leucate, Blotzheim and Lille, the opening of the Naoura Barrière in Marrakech (Morocco), Hôtel Fouquet's Barrière in Paris and the Spark (fitness centre for treatments, sport and Spa) in Enghien-les-Bains. The Hôtel Barrière Lille will open during autumn 2010 and the hotel complex and balneo-therapy centre adjoining the Casino Barrière de Ribeauvillé is forecast to open late 2011. During the same period, the public service concessions of the Barrière Casinos in La Baule, Dinard, Deauville, Saint-Malo, Nice, Cassis and Saint Raphaël were renewed, which reveals the confidence these towns place in the group. On 15 April 2009, Colony Capital sold its Groupe Lucien Barrière shares to Accor, which now holds a 49% equity stake in the company. In 2010, Groupe Lucien Barrière and Française des Jeux designed an on-line gaming platform with 3D online gaming, which is called LB Poker company. ==Groupe Barrière establishmentsHotels=== Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and US President Barack Obama at the Royal Barrière during the 37th G8 summit in May 2011.

As part of the 1976 census, a large number of people failed to fill out an electoral re-registration card, and census staff had not been given the authority to insist on the card being completed. This had little practical effect for people on the general roll, but it transferred Māori to the general roll if the card was not handed in. Together with a northward shift of New Zealand's population, this resulted in five new electorates having to be created in the upper part of the North Island. The electoral redistribution was very disruptive, and 22 electorates were abolished, while 27 electorates were newly created (including Tarawera) or re-established. These changes came into effect for the . ==History== In the 1978 election, the Tarawera electorate was won by Ian McLean. McLean retired at the and was replaced by Max Bradford.

(abbreviated as WW2BAM, informally called as Milyonaryo) is a Philippine game show based on the original British format of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?. The main goal of the game is to win 2 million Philippine pesos (earlier 1 million) by answering 12 multiple-choice (previously 15) questions correctly. If an incorrect answer is given, the contestant will leave with the guaranteed amount in the last safe haven they have correctly answered. However, a contestant may opt not to answer a question and walk away with their full winnings. Contestants are given various \\"lifelines\\" to help them answer the questions. The show first aired from November 13, 2000 until December 14, 2002 on the government-sequestered channel IBC. It was produced by Viva Television and hosted by actor Christopher de Leon. This incarnation of the show ran until December 14, 2002. On May 23, 2009, the game show was revived by TV5, with actor-host-comedian Vic Sotto as the new host. The show ran until November 22, 2015. ==History2000–2002: Viva/IBC Version=== The first version of the show was hosted by the actor Christopher de Leon. The first season of the original Millionaire, which began on November 13, 2000, had its 15th question prize of ₱1,000,000. In 2001, the final question's prize was doubled to ₱2,000,000. The show lost its popularity soon after Viva Television Studio, its studio in Parañaque City, was destroyed by a fire due to faulty wiring on April 4, 2002, and the show moved to Riverbanks Center in Marikina City. The final episode of this incarnation aired on December 14, 2002. ===2009–2015: TV5 Version=== Joey de Leon (right) plays as a contestant with Vic Sotto (left) as host In April 2009, promotional videos and content about the comeback of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? started airing on TV5. Vic Sotto was announced as the host of the show. The revival began airing on May 23, 2009. Following the network move, the show was taped in a new set in the TV5 Studio and used the updated graphics, title sequence, and music from the 22nd series of the original UK version. It premiered as a celebrity special, featuring 10 celebrities as contestants in the Fastest Finger First—Ara Mina, Mo Twister, Manilyn Reynes, Polo Ravales, Megan Young, Jay Manalo, Nadia Montenegro, Rafael Rosell, Gladys Reyes, and Assunta De Rossi. The Fastest Finger Finger round which determined the contestant who be playing was removed in favor of auditioning through text entry and mall shows starting season 6. Producers now have a predetermined list of contestants from the auditions. This incarnation of the show featured different money tree and lifeline formats. The last episode was aired on November 22, 2015. ===Top prize winners=== Throughout the original run on IBC, no contestant completed the game by answering all fifteen questions correctly. There were two contestants who came the closest—De La Salle University associate professor Amelita Lopez-Forbes, and actress Sharon Cuneta on December 25—who each answered 14 questions correctly and won a million pesos in 2001. In the TV5 incarnation, there were 3 contestants who have won the top prize. Sharon Cuneta (January 9, 2010) Sharon Cuneta had previously played in the IBC version of Millionaire and walked away at question 15 with ₱1,000,000, splitting her winnings equally in thirds—for the San Lorenzo Ruiz Formation and Learning Center, for the Chosen Children Foundation, and for the sick daughter of her colleague. On January 9, 2010, three days after her birthday, Cuneta once again played on the show and won ₱2,000,000, making her the first top prize winner in the Philippine franchise's history. All of the money she won was donated to the Hospicio de San Jose. Coincidentally, the 13th question in her game was about the name of the island the orphanage is located, Isla de Convalecencia. The final question was about William Shakespeare's work, Macbeth. Karl Jonathan Aguilar (September 18, 2011) On September 18, 2011, the Philippine version gained its second top prize winner: IT specialist Karl Jonathan Aguilar. The final question was about the name of the Index Librorum Prohibitorum. He did not use his lifelines up to the 13th question worth ₱600,000. When his last lifeline, Phone-A-Friend, was used during the final question; his friend suggested one of the wrong answers. Eduardo Gaeilo Pajinag, Jr. (October 20, 2013) The third top-prize winner was IT auditor Eduardo \\"Gaeilo\\" Pajinag, Jr. on October 20, 2013. He said that he auditioned seven times unsuccessfully before being accepted. He was the first winner of the new money tree, the High-Risk money tree. The final question was about Jabberwocky, the nonsense poem written by Lewis Carroll. The other options were synonyms of \\"nonsense\\". After considering where the dance group Jabbawockeez got their name, he answered correctly to win the ₱2 million peso top-prize. ==FormatGame rules=== Screenshot of the show illustrating how the question and choices appear on- screen {  style=\\"text-align:center; float:right; margin- left:10px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size:90%;\\" - ! colspan=\\"7\\" style=\\"background: #58B9E4\\" Payout structure - ! rowspan=\\"4\\"  Question number ! colspan=\\"6\\"  Question value - ! colspan=\\"2\\"  IBC ! colspan=\\"4\\"  TV5 - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:75px;\\"  2000 ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:75px;\\"  2001–2002 ! style=\\"width:75px;\\"  2009–2015 ! style=\\"width:75px;\\"  2013–2015 ! colspan=\\"2\\"  2015 - !

Contestants must arrange the four answers in the correct order stated within the question (i.e. alphabetically, chronologically). The contestant who answers the question correctly and in the fastest time plays the main game. In the event that nobody answered the question correctly, a new question is asked. If two or more contestants gave the correct order at the same time, there is a tiebreaker question between the contestants to determine who advances to the main game. After completing Fastest Finger First, the contestant begins the main game where he/she must answer a series of increasingly difficult questions. The questions are valued at progressively higher sums of money, up to the top prize of ₱2,000,000 (₱1,000,000 in 2000). The 15 questions are randomly chosen by the computer from a list of pre-generated questions based on general knowledge. For each question, there are four options labelled from A to D. During the game, contestants are given three lifelines to help them with a question at any time. There are two safe havens at questions 5 and 10. If a contestant answers a question incorrectly but has passed a safe haven, they leave with the safe haven amount. If a contestant is unsure about a question, they may walk away and leave with the amount they have already banked. To confirm that their answer is final, the host asks \\"Is that your final answer?\\". Upon saying \\"final answer\\" together with the selected option, their answer is deemed final and cannot be changed. The host is not shown the correct answer on his monitor until a contestant has said \\"final answer\\". If the episode has reached the end of its allotted time, a klaxon is cued to highlight this. Contestants who are still playing the main game would return in the next episode to continue their game. Over the course of the show's run, the format of Millionaire was changed in a number of aspects, mainly relating to the setup of questions and the payout structure used in the game, along with minor tweaks and changes in other aspects: * In 2000, contestants had to answer fifteen questions, with two safe havens at ₱10,000 and ₱100,000, and could use the 50:50, Phone-A-Friend and Ask the Audience lifelines at any time within the game. * The following year, the ₱400,000 question was removed. ₱500,000 and ₱1,000,000 became the 13th and 14th question values, respectively. The top prize was increased to ₱2,000,000. * The TV5 version launched with a new money tree with modified cash values, but still with a top prize of ₱2,000,000. The safe havens were ₱20,000 and ₱150,000. The same 3 lifelines were offered. * Starting in season 6, the Ask the Audience was replaced with People Speak. Switch was also introduced as a fourth lifeline in the 6th season. It was available only after passing the second safe haven. Additionally, the Fastest Finger Finger round was removed in favor of auditioning through text entry and mall shows. Producers now have a predetermined list of contestants from the auditions. * In the 10th season, Phone-A-Friend was removed. Instead, Switch was available from the beginning of the game. A new format was also introduced where the contestant may choose between the Classic and High Risk money tree. In the High Risk money tree, the second safe haven at ₱150,000 was removed, but a fourth lifeline, Double Dip, was added and could be used at any point within the game. * In the 14th season, the questions were reduced from 15 to 12. Unlike its British counterpart, the first three questions were simply removed. The money trees were identified as Money Trees 1 and 2, where 1 is the Classic format and 2 is the High Risk format. The lifelines available were Phone-A-Friend, Switch and Double Dip. 50:50 was added as a fourth lifeline in High Risk format. Also, the three pre-arranged friends were displayed onscreen. ===Lifelines=== Contestants are given a set of lifelines to help them in the game. Lifelines may be used once only. * 50:50: The computer removes two random incorrect answers, leaving the correct answer and one incorrect answer. * Phone-A-Friend (2000–2012; 2015–): The contestant calls one of their friends from their predetermined list. They are given 30 seconds to discuss the question. * Ask the Audience (2000–2010): The members of the audience are polled using a keypad with buttons labelled from A to D. They press the button corresponding to the answer they think is the correct one. The percentage of the answers are shown onscreen and on the monitors. * People Speak (2011–2015): Members of the audience who think that they know the answer are instructed to stand up. The contestant selects three people to be asked for their answer. A ₱20,000 cash prize is split equally to the selected people who have answered correctly. * Switch (2011–): The computer picks a new question of the same value. Any lifelines used on the original question are not reinstated. This lifeline was initially available after question 11. It was made available from the beginning of the game in the succeeding seasons as a replacement for Phone-A- Friend. * Double Dip (2013–): The contestant is given two chances to answer a question. If the first answer is incorrect, they cannot walk away and must give a second answer. The set of lifelines used per season is tabulated below. {  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! rowspan=\\"3\\"  Lifeline ! colspan=\\"6\\"  Season - !

It was built as the Hôtel Normandy in 1912. ==History== The Hôtel Normandy was opened in 1912 by architect Théo Petit, following the opening of the nearby Casino of Deauville. Both were opened by Eugène Cornuché, the former owner of Maxim's restaurant in Paris and director of the Trouville-sur-Mer casino. In the next year, he opened the Royal Barrière Hotel in Deauville. Later, his partner, François André, took over management of the hotel. In 1927, he built the Hôtel du Golf. In 1962, the Groupe Lucien Barrière was founded. The hotel is considered the flagship hotel of Groupe Barrière. One year after its opening, funded by her English lover Boy Capel, Coco Chanel set up her Chanel hat shop within the hotel grounds. ==Hotel== Hotel Barrière Le Normandy Deauville is a palace hotel built in a traditional regional architecture of manor style— Anglo-Norman cottage with half-timbered and checkered stones. It has 226 rooms and 45 suites, decorated by interior designer Jacques Garcia and inspired by the Belle Époque style. Most of the rooms have a view of the sea. Nineteen lounges host conferences, receptions, cocktails, and gala evenings. The suite \\"A Man and a Woman\\" is kept in memory and tribute to the love scene from Claude Lelouch's 1966 film A Man and a Woman. The main restaurant is La Belle époque. The hotel also features a piano bar offering a menu of more than one hundred varieties of whiskey, a fitness center, a spa, and a children's club. It has an inside corridor that directly leads to the Casino of Deauville. The hotel was renovated in 2015-2016. ==TV and Films== The hotel was used as a filming location for several TV shows and films, such in 1996, when it was used as the location for Agatha Christie's Poirot in the episode The Murder on the Links. The episode is adapted from a novel with the same name that was published in 1923. The events originally take place in a fictional town called Merlinville-sur-Mer in northern France in the 1920s, however, in the adaptation, the events take place in Deauville a decade later. The 2013 romantic comedy film Hôtel Normandy is named after the hotel, with its main character, Alice, staying at the hotel. A scene in Claude Lelouch's Palme d'Or-winner A Man and a Woman was shot in the hotel, starring Anouk Aimée and Jean-Louis Trintignant.https://www.hotelsbarriere.com/en/deauville/le- normandy/guest-rooms-and-suites.html == References  External links == * *Hotel Normandy (official site of the Lucien Barriere Hotel Chain) Category:Deauville Category:Hotels in France Category:Buildings and structures in Calvados (department) Category:Tourist attractions in Calvados (department) Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1912 Category:1912 establishments in France Category:Hotels established in 1912 ","title":"Hotel Barrière Le Normandy Deauville"},{"id":"20149736","text":"Hotel Majestic, Cannes, (2006) Charles Henri Nicod (28 January 1878, Levier, Doubs - December 1967) was a French architect active in the period between the two World Wars.
