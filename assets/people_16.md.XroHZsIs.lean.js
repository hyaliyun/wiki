She works on upwardly motile Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and is on the Board of Directors of eLife. == Early life and education == Avasthi studied integrative physiology at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. During her undergraduate program she worked on insect classification and synaptic plasticity. She became more interested in the brain, and earned her PhD in neuroscience under the supervision of Wolfgang Baehr at the University of Utah. During her doctoral studies she investigated how cilia help our eye's photoreceptors detect light. She was a postdoctoral researcher with Wallace Marshall at the University of California, San Francisco. Here she began work on Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a model organism for studying cilia. Cilia function requires normal cilia length and motility, and Avasthi identified that the dopamine binding G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) were the most regularly involved with flagellar length regulation. == Research and career == Avasthi uses Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a unicellular green alga, to investigate the assembly of cilia. She was particularly interested in the cellular machinery needed to maintain cilia, and used small molecule chemical inhibitors to identify important features in ciliary transport. Avasthi found that actin, a cytoskeleton protein, was required for intraflagellar transport (IFT) regulation in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The actin is recruits IFT to basal bodies during the elongation of flagella; and without actin the flagellar length is lost. She saw the same impacts using a myosin inhibitor, which suggests that actin may use a myosin pathway. In 2015 Avasthi started her own research group at the University of Kansas Medical Center, which is supported by the National Institutes of Health. She combines chemical biology and biochemistry with genetics to understand the mechanisms that regulate assembly of the cilium. In 2018 she was awarded an NIH R35 Outstanding Investigator Award. === Academic service === Avasthi is enthusiastic about reforming scientific research culture, helping early career researchers set up their own laboratories. She launched New PI Slack, an online space for over a thousand new Principal investigators to share notes and ideas. Avasthi supports preprints and the reform of scientific publishing, and is on the Board of Directors of eLife and ASAPbio. In her laboratory she leads a preprint journal club, where members of her group read and review new material, providing feedback to authors. == References == Category:Open access activists Category:Women biochemists Category:Women physiologists Category:University of Kansas faculty Category:University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign alumni Category:University of Utah alumni Category:1979 births Category:Living people ","title":"Prachee Avasthi"},{"id":"61287467","text":"Wuyuan Commandery () was a historical commandery of China, located in eastern Hetao region.

Councillor Matt Brown, originally Executive Member for Social Justice, Inclusion and Policy, played a key role in developing the model with his colleague Councillor Martyn Rawlinson, working in conjunction with the Centre for Local Economic Strategies. The first issue they tackled in 2012-2013 was to localise their procurement spend in Preston and the surrounding county of Lancashire. ==See also== * Community-supported_agriculture * Using smartphone for calculating food miles * Local food ==ReferencesExternal links== * FarmShare: Blockchain Community-Supported Agriculture Category:Political terminology Category:Politics of Lancashire ","title":"Community wealth building"},{"id":"61287585","text":"\\"What a Life\\" is a song recorded by South Korean duo Exo-SC, the second official sub-unit of the South Korean boy group Exo.

It was released in 1986. Frederica von Stade: The Complete Columbia Recital Albums, Sony CD, 88875183412, 2016 The same artists recorded Canteloube's seventeen other Auvergnat songs for the album's predecessor, Frederica von Stade: Chants d'Auvergne, Vol. 1, released in 1982. ==Recording== The album was recorded digitally on 21-24 July 1985 in Studio No. 1 at EMI's Abbey Road Studios, London. The engineers used Neumann microphones and a Sony PCM 1610 system. The album was mastered at the CBS Recording Studios in New York City with CBS's DisComputer system. ==Packaging== The cover of the album was designed by Alan Davis, and features a photograph of von Stade taken by John Gotman. ==Critical receptionReviews=== Joseph Canteloube Robert Ackart reviewed the album on LP in Stereo Review in June 1986. Canteloube's orchestrations of his Chants d'Auvergne were, he thought, open to criticism. The composer's arrangements hinted at the sound-world of ancient instruments, but some of them were so elaborate that they seemed alien to the folk-tunes that they enveloped. There was no denying, though, that they were gorgeous, and there was much to enjoy in their rhythmic complexity. The way in which Frederica von Stade performed them on her new disc could be praised without reservation. She was especially good at expressing the sadness of the less sunny songs. \\"Her limpid, golden voice, admirably handled, draws from each selection its full share of musical beauty and poetic meaning.\\" And she sang the Canteloube cycle at the beginning of her album - a setting of verses celebrating summer, moonlight and dawn - with \\"an utterly seductive tonal and stylistic voluptuousness\\". Conducting, Antonio de Almeida was sensitive, and seemed more deeply engaged with his music than he did on some of his other LPs. In sum, the album was an \\"excellent\\" recording of a \\"glorious\\" performance that was \\"a joy to listen to\\".Ackhart, Robert: Stereo Review, June 1986, p. 124 Hilary Finch reviewed the album on LP in Gramophone in July 1986. Frederica von Stade, she thought, was one of the few singers who sounded at home in Canteloube's arrangements of the folk-songs of the part of France from which he came. Her first selection of the Chants d'Auvergne had demonstrated \\"the singer, like the song, to be a perfect fusion of childlike storyteller and sophisticated vocal orchestrator\\", and her new album did likewise. One song was very reminiscent of the earlier album's \\"Ba√Øl√®ro\\". \\"Pastourelle\\" was another example of \\"hilltop to hilltop vocalise\\". \\"Lou boussu\\" painted a picture of a hunchback with a \\"nice balance of melancholy and wry humour\\" that was reminiscent of Erik Satie. \\"Obal, din lo coumb√®lo\\" was a wistful miniature fable about a hare, a shepherd and the three daughters of a Prince. \\"Jou l'pount d'o Mirabel\\" - \\"At the Mirabel bridge\\" - exemplified the subtlety both of Canteloube's craftsmanship and of von Stade's response to it: she used her voice like an artist touching in \\"fleeting brushstrokes of suggestion as [a] washer-girl and [a] horseman are brought into view ... behind a heat haze of rising and falling piano chromatics\\". What most made the album worthy of a place on collectors' shelves was not, however, its Auvergnat songs at all but rather a work of Canteloube's own invention. Von Stade was the first singer to have recorded Triptyque for more than twenty years. The 1914 song cycle put one in mind of both Jean- Jacques Rousseau and Ernest Chausson. \\"The pantheistic ecstasy of Roger Fr√™ne's poetry is realized in steamy, late-romantic settings, with the voice joining in the nocturnal orchestration of the central moonlit panel, and ending in long, clear arcs of hymning melody to Pan\\". The album left one feeling regretful that much of Canteloube's music still lay unheard in libraries' dustiest recesses.Finch, Hilary: Gramophone, July 1986, p. 200 The Ch√¢teau de Chalencon in the Auvergne's St Andr√© de Chalencon In the October 1997 issue of Gramophone, Richard T. Fairman used a compilation CD of most of Frederica von Stade's Auvergnat songs as a reference disc when reviewing a new CD of the Chants d'Auvergne performed by Dawn Upshaw, the Orchestre de l'Op√©ra de Lyon and Kent Nagano.Canteloube, Joseph: Chants d'Auvergne (complete), with Dawn Upshaw, cond. Kent Nagano, Erato CD The von Stade anthology was one that he had long been fond of. It presented her performances of the most familiar of Canteloube's songs in renditions that were free of eccentricity. \\"Von Stade varies her tone according to the sense of each song,\\" he wrote, \\"but the overall mood is less sharp, more comfortable if you like, than with Upshaw.\\" Moreover, von Stade's Royal Philharmonic provided a more sumptuous backdrop than Upshaw's Lyon orchestra. Collectors tempted by Upshaw's album would \\"probably find that the consoling romanticism of [von Stade's] tried-and- trusted disc [was] more what they had in mind.\\"Fairman, Richard T.: Gramophone, October 1997, p. 123 Writing in Opera News in December 2016, David Shengold mentioned the album in the course of reviewing a box set of Frederica von Stade's recordings in which it was included: \\"[Von Stade's] two luminous discs of orchestrated Canteloube songs ... would be on anyone's list of essential traversals.\\"https://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2016/12/Recordings/Frederica_von_Stade__The_Complete_Columbia_Recital_Albums.html Frederica von Stade's approach to the Chants d'Auvergne was also critiqued in the 1988 edition of The new Penguin guide to compact discs and cassettes, which judged that \\"Fine as Frederica von Stade's singing is, she is stylistically and temperamentally far less at home in Canteloube's lovely folksong settings than Victoria de los Angeles,Canteloube, Joseph: Chants d'Auvergne (excerpts), with Victoria de los Angeles, EMI Records CD Kiri Te KanawaCanteloube, Joseph: Chants d'Auvergne (complete), with Kiri Te Kanawa, cond.

Bhardwaj rose to prominence after producing a documentary‚ÄîMartyrs of Marriage, which covered abuse(s) of criminal section 498A (Anti-dowry law) by brides and their families. She also exposed a conspiracy of alleged victims in the Rohtak sisters viral video controversy by interviewing the witnesses and collecting proof. == Education and career == Deepika Narayan Bhardwaj graduated with a B.Tech from Technological Institute of Textile & Sciences in 2006. She also did a post-graduate Diploma in television journalism from Indian Institute of Journalism & New Media in 2009. She worked as Software Engineer at Infosys during 2006 to 2008 before leaving the job to pursue film-making. Her first documentary film Gramin Dak Sevak was a student film winner at Jeevika: Asia Livelihood Documentary Festival in 2009. She has been working as editorial consult at Exchange4Media since November 2010. == Activism  498-A and Martyrs of Marriage === Bhardwaj alleges to have been the victim of a false 498A case, after she and her cousin were charged under the provisions courtesy a police-complaint by her ex-sister-in-law; the issue was resolved in an off- court settlement involving a huge sum of money. This brought her into contacts with Save Indian Family Foundation, and she has since often collaborated with them in demanding an outright repeal of the law or amending to a gender- neutral version. Women right groups and critics however note that the law has been already decriminalized to a large extent by the Supreme Court, and that relevant crime-statistics when coupled with extremely high rates of under- reporting necessitate its presence. The conviction rates were similar to other laws and given a high charge-sheet rate, did not corroborate with the MRA rhetoric about the law being mostly (ab)used to pursue outright frivolous complaints over trivial issues. Bhardwaj's personal episode also went on to serve as the motivations for making a documentary on the locus. Martyrs of Marriage (2017) narrated first-person tales of various victims who alleged of being at the receiving ends of abuse of 498A and interviewed politicians, judges et al for their take on the issue. === False sexual harassment allegations === Bhardwaj campaigns against false sexual harassment allegations. She had supported the #Mentoo movement, a campaign that was started in response of false allegations of the #MeToo movement in India and wrote about how the me-too movement turned men into disposable or collateral damage, sacrificable at the altar of the idea of protecting women. In the Rohtak sisters viral video controversy, she interviewed several witnesses and released videos that held the accusers of lying. === National Commission for Men === Bhardwaj campaigns for the establishment of a National Commission for Men in India that would deal with men's issues including domestic violence and sexual assault. == References == Category:People from Gurgaon Category:Living people Category:1986 births Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Indian human rights activists Category:Indian documentary filmmakers Category:Men's rights activists Category:Indian activists Category:Indian activist journalists Category:Indian women activists ","title":"Deepika Narayan Bhardwaj"},{"id":"61287651","text":"Incident on a Dark Street is a 1973 TV movie broadcast on NBC Saturday Night at the Movies.

As a result of the building of the city's defences by the Irish Society, which was a consortium of livery companies based out of the City of London, the city was officially renamed Londonderry in the 1613 royal charter. This is what has subsequently led to the naming dispute for the city and county of Derry/Londonderry. The walls are at the centre of the historic city of Derry and within them are a number of Derry's most important landmarks including the Apprentice Boy's Hall and St. Columb's Cathedral (the first ever purpose build Protestant Cathedral). ==HistorySiege of Derry=== The Siege of Derry was the first major conflict that occurred during the Williamite War in Ireland. It began when 13 apprentices took the keys for the city's gates and locked them against the advancing forces of the Earl of Antrim who were loyal to James II. As Antrim did not have enough men to lay siege to the city, he retreated to Coleraine. On 18 April 1689 the siege would begin in earnest when forces loyal to the king arrived and ordered the city to surrender. Soon James himself would also arrive and ask the city to surrender, but the city refused. The siege would continue until 1 August when ships carrying food and supplies broke through the boom across the River Foyle and relieved the city. The fact that the city's walls have never been breached gave rise to one of its nicknames; the Maiden City. ===The Troubles=== When the Apprentice Boys March that commemorated the closing of the gates passed through the city in August 1969, some threw pennies from the city walls towards the Catholic majority Bogside. The march was already seen as provocative to many of the city's Catholic population and, along with tension that had already been building, rioting broke out that turned into the Battle of the Bogside. For most of the Troubles the walls were closed off to the general public. However, in August 1973 an IRA bomb was detonated on the walls in a successful effort to destroy the Walker Monument. The monument was a 100ft column and statue of siege hero, Governor George Walker that had been erected in 1828.Derry Journal- Siege Hero Walker Felled in Blast Especially given its prominence facing the Bogside, many nationalists found it an offensive symbol of Protestant ascendancy, hence why the IRA targeted it for destruction. The section of the wall that contained the monument remained closed, until it was reopened in 2010 (although the column and statue have never been rebuilt).Newsletter - Siege of Derry monument destroyed by IRA in 1973 reopens ==Layout== Bishops Street Gate The walls are about 1 mile in circumference and contain many of the city's most important landmarks. The entire length of the walls is fully accessible on foot. There are seven gates in total, four of which were built at the same time as the walls themselves and three were added later.\\\\- The City Gates of Derry/Londonderry * Ferryquay gate is one of the original four gates and gave access to the ferryquay on the River Foyle. This was the first gate to be closed by the Apprentice Boys during the siege of Derry. * Shipquay gate is one of the original four gates and originally gave near direct access to the River Foyle, before the land that became the Guildhall was reclaimed from the River. * Bishop's gate is one of the original four gates. The original gate was replaced with a triumphal arch in 1789. * Butcher's gate is one of the original four gates and was named for the street immediately inside the walls where many of the city's butchers were based. * New gate was built in the 1790s and reinforced during the tensions that lead to the 1798 United Irish rebellion. * Castle gate was built between 1805 and 1808. * Magazine gate is the most recent gate to be added, being built in 1888 and gave access directly to the riverfront. ==Cannons== The walls are lined with 22 cannons from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, other cannons can be found displayed elsewhere in the city. Derry boasts the largest collection of cannons whose precise origins are known, with many of them being used during the Siege of Derry. In 2005, 24 of the cannons (including two displayed at Brook Hall) were restored to the former glory, with the famous 'Roaring Meg' located at the double bastion near Bishop gate. \\\\- 17th Century Walls ==References== Category:Derry (city) Category:City walls ","title":"Derry city walls"},{"id":"61287690","text":"Todd Dixon Still (born 1966) is an American New Testament scholar\\"Eerdmans Signs Two New Testament Scholars\\", Publishers Weekly, New York, 9 January 2017.Bomberger, Rachel. \\"Goodacre and Still Named New Coeditors of New International Greek Testament Commentary Series\\", FrontGate Media, 9 January 2017. and serves as the Charles J. and Eleanor McLerran DeLancey Dean and the William M.

Born in Vilnius, Apolewicz and his family were forced to move to Gda≈Ñsk after the second world war due to the Polish population transfers which took place after the countries borders changed. In his youth he played for Sparta Orunia, playing his professional career with Lechia Gda≈Ñsk. During his playing career he played at times either as a forward or in midfield. Apolewicz ranks highly in Lechia Gda≈Ñsk records, appearing in the top 10 for both; most games played and goals scored for the club. ==Lechia Gda≈Ñsk== After playing with Sparta Orunia in his youth (later called \\"Start Gda≈Ñsk\\"), Apolewicz joined Lechia Gda≈Ñsk in 1958. He played his first game for Lechia at the beginning of the 1959 season against Ruch Chorz√≥w, with his first goal coming against G√≥rnik Radlin in the same season. During his early years Lechia played 5 seasons in the I liga, the top division in Poland, with the team finishing mid table for the first four seasons. In the fifth season since Apolewicz made his debut, Lechia were relegated from the I liga. During his time in the I liga, Apolewicz played 86 times, scoring 8 goals. After Lechia's relegation the rest of Apolewicz's career was spent in the II liga and the III liga, the second and third tiers. During the four seasons in the I liga, he played in 92 league games, scoring 20 goals. Apolewicz was involved in the first ever Tricity Derby for Lechia against the club's biggest rivals Arka Gdynia, starting the game as Lechia went on to win 2-1. Lechia suffered another relegation in 1967, seeing Lechia playing in the third tier for the first time in their history. Lechia were more competitive in the III liga, finishing in the top 3 four seasons out of five before winning promotion back to the II liga in 1972. In the III liga, Apolewicz played in a more attacking role at the club, scoring 29 goals in 70 appearances. Lechia's season back in the II liga was to be his last before he retired. He played just the one game that season, coming on as a substitute as Lechia drew 0-0 with ≈ölƒÖsk Wroc≈Çaw. During his career Apolewicz amassed a total of 260 appearances and scoring 57 goals in all competitions. ==Personal life== Alongside his playing career Apolewicz was a motor mechanic by trade. Lechia Gda≈Ñsk honoured Apolewicz's time and achievements at the club by putting him on the \\"Avenue of Stars\\". This is a walkway at the MOSiR Stadium in Gda≈Ñsk with Lechia players of merit having their name in a golden star on the pavement. In the late 1980s he needed a right leg amputation after an embolism, and suffered a stroke in 1990. He died on 12 May 2003 and is buried at the Srebrzysko Cemetery in Gda≈Ñsk. ==References== Category:1938 births Category:2003 deaths Category:Lechia Gda≈Ñsk players Category:Polish footballers Category:Footballers from Vilnius Category:People from Wilno Voivodeship (1926‚Äì1939) Category:Association football forwards Category:Association football midfielders ","title":"Jerzy Apolewicz"},{"id":"61287928","text":"Ester St√•hlberg, n√©e H√§llstr√∂m (February 17, 1870 - July 21, 1950) was a Finnish writer and educator and the first First Lady of Finland.

However, he is best known nationally in the UK for presenting the ITV Tyne Tees children's television pop music programme Razzmatazz between 1981 and 1987. The show also provided Lisa Stansfield with an early presenting role. He also acted as a producer for ITV's ill-fated Top of the Pops competitor, The Roxy He subsequently moved to London, leaving mainstream broadcasting to focus on social work and community projects such as video and radio workshops at The Community Zone in South London, as well as working on rehabilitation projects for prisoners with The Clink Institute (now The Clink Charity).

She has studied the evolution of the agricultural pest whitefly and identified genetic differences between various species. She works with African scientists to develop computing and genomics skills across the continent, and is a Senior TED fellow. == Early life and education == Boykin grew up with her mother, who worked at Phoenix Suns basketball games to pay Boykin's way through college. She studied biology at Occidental College, where she worked on the chaparral shrub Arctostaphylos parryana. She moved to San Francisco State University for her Master's studies, working with Bob Patterson on a phylogenetic analysis of Arctostaphylos. She earned her PhD in 2003 at the University of New Mexico, where she worked in the Los Alamos National Laboratory theoretical biology research group. Here she learned how to use a supercomputer, analysing sequence data of influenza and hepatitis C in an effort to provide information for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) vaccines. Boykin moved to the United States Department of Agriculture in Florida, where she began to investigate whiteflies. At the time, Europe limited the importation of flowers from Florida because of concerns about whiteflies.After completing her postdoctoral research, Boykin taught science at Jensen Beach High School. In 2009 Boykin moved to Lincoln University, where she worked in the Bio- Protection Research Centre. == Research and career == Since 2012, Boykin has been a Senior Researcher in the Australian Research Council Plant Energy Biology group at the University of Western Australia. She became interested in Africa as whiteflies native to the continent represent the base of their evolutionary tree, and after attending a Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation workshop that visited a smallholding farm in Kenya seriously impacted by them. She works with African researchers to use genomics and supercomputers to improve their ability to understand and tackle insect outbreaks. The portable DNA sequencing devices that she introduced to Africa have been helping fight crop disease since 2017. In an effort to establish the causes of the devastation of cassava crops, Boykin investigates the various whitefly in Sub- Saharan Africa. Worldwide, over 700 million people a day depend on cassava for their daily calories. Whiteflies transmit two viruses that are lethal for cassava; the cassava mosaic virus and cassava brown streak virus disease. These viruses are contained in Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. In particular, Boykin is interested in the Bemisia tabaci (silverleaf whitefly), which plague East Africa. She works with the Mikocheni Agricultural Research Institute (Tanzania), the Department of Agricultural Research & Technical Services (Malawi) and the National Crops Resources Research Institute (Uganda) in the Cassava Virus Action Project (CVAP). Boykin works directly with Joseph Ndunguru, an African scientist who has brought biotechnology to Africa. CVAP used the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre to identify that the whitefly is actually a species complex of over 34 different species. The work of Boykin and her Cassava warriors has resulted in a yield increase of over 800% for the cassava plant. Boykin created WhiteFlyBase, a space to share data about whitefly species. Boykin was appointed a Senior TED fellow in 2017. She delivered her first TED Talk, Why Cassava is a Poverty Fighter, in Perth in 2016, but has also appeared on the main TED stage discussing the African Cassava Whitefly Project in Vancouver. She was made a Gifted Citizen in 2017. She was part of Science Foo Camp in 2019. == References == Category:American women academics Category:Computational biologists Category:Occidental College alumni Category:University of New Mexico alumni Category:University of Western Australia faculty Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people ","title":"Laura Boykin"},{"id":"61288025","text":"Hans Bredmose (23 August 1888 - 18 December 1958) was a Danish gymnast.

Each of these regional leagues is run by a localised football association under the overall management of the BFA and follows the Botswana football calendar from August to May. At the end of each campaign the 17 regional champions qualify for and contest the Botswana Division One playoffs.

She was a milliner when she met and married the Quaker William Alexander in Doncaster on 13 February 1801. They were to have nine children. Her husband was a bank clerk, but in time he started to deal on his own, and in time, he had a thriving business which relied on trust. Her husband died suddenly in 1819. At the time of his death, it seemed likely that the family business would be lost too. Alexander invested the life assurance paid out from her husband's death into the business and took over the leadership. Her husband's executors were convinced by her talents and the business became A.M.Alexander. When her eldest son became an adult in 1823, he was taken into the business, and the following year the business was renamed A. and G.W.Alexander. Her son was however not the leading partner, and he took a third of the profits while she took two thirds. In 1828 her son became an equal partner, and for four years they shared the profits equally. Her share reduced as new partners were added to the business, but by the time of her retirement in 1838 she still owned a third of the company and had ¬£1000 a year.

The Priory of St John the Baptist at Sandleford was founded for the Augustinian Canons Regular by Geoffrey, Earl of Perch and his wife Maud some time between 1193 and 1202. In 1274, Maud de Clare, Countess of Gloucester and Hertford made arrangements to refound it as a double house for Fontevrault Benedictine nuns and brothers, but this did not come about. It was dissolved in 1478 and abandoned by the remaining monks after years of mismanagement by a prior. The ownership fell into the hands of the Bishop of Salisbury, and circa 1480 passed to the Dean and Chapter of Windsor. The old priory chapel is the present library.

Wool production has taken place at the site since at least the eighteenth century, and the surviving buildings house a number of pieces of historic machinery which are still in operation. It was designated a Category A listed building in 1995, still operates as a working mill, and is open to the public from April to September. ==Description== The overall site comprises several buildings, all dating to the nineteenth or early twentieth centuries. The mill itself was originally a single-storey rectangular building, but the addition of a two-storey carding and spinning mill led to its current L-plan design. Both parts of the building are rubble-built with corrugated iron rooves, and there is a large weatherboarded lean-to extension, also with a corrugated iron roof, added in the late nineteenth century to house equipment. This building contains a number of pieces of historic machinery, including two Victorian looms, made by Hutchinson, Hollingworth & Co., which are thought to be the oldest looms still to be in use. There are two dwellings on the site. The mill house, where the miller's family would have lived, was built around 1910. Rubble-built, with two storeys, it features an elegant staircase with cast iron balusters, indicative of the relative wealth of the owner. There is also a cottage, the oldest remaining building on the site, dating from the early nineteenth century. Harled, with a corrugated iron roof, it has an adjoining square-plan dairy and, diagonally opposite, a winter drying shed. There is a shop, built for that purpose in the late nineteenth century and still used as such. It is a single-storey square-plan rubble-built structure, to the south- east of the main mill. The building currently used as a visitor centre was originally a byre. Built in the late nineteenth-century, it is a simple, rectangular building, with plain weatherboarding and a corrugated iron roof. An early twentieth-century sawmill is attached at the west gable, and a modern extension is attached to the north wall. ==History== Wool production has taken place at the Knockando site since at least the eighteenth century. William Roy's map of Scotland, dated 1749, depicts buildings at the site, and records from 1784 make reference to a waulk mill, operated by the Grant family at Knockando. The Grants and their mill are mentioned again in the 1851 census, which also records the presence of a wool carder, a spinner and a weaver on the site. By the 1860s, the mill was owned by Alexander Smith, who established the company A Smith and Son. The company built a new building for the mill, which had some water-powered machinery, but most work at this point was still done by hand. In the 1870s, a second-hand water wheel, with a diameter of fourteen feet, was installed, and in the 1880s a weaving shed was built to house the water-powered loom. The late nineteenth century was a high-point for the mill's commercial success, as evidenced by the construction of the dwelling house for the miller's family, and the shop to sell the mill's produce. In the early twentieth century, Knockando Woolmill primarily served the local market for blankets, tweeds and yarn, although it benefited from contracts from the Ministry of Defence during the first world war for blankets for the services, and it was during this period that the drying shed was built. In the years following the war, the mill entered a period of decline. In 1945, a flood destroyed the weaving shed, and in the late 1940s the waterwheel was disconnected and electric motors were installed to power the machinery. By the 1960s, most small district mills had either expanded to serve a larger market, or had gone out of business. Unusually, Knockando continued to operate as a local mill, still owned by the company A Smith and Son established in 1860, now under the management of Duncan Stewart, a nephew of the Smith family who continued working at the mill into the 1970s. In 1976, the mill was purchased by Hugh Jones, who, acting as the sole miller, continued to operate it in the traditional manner for thirty years. In 1995 the mill, including the machinery, water power system and various outhouses, was designated a Category A listed building, but by 2000 the buildings and machinery were in a poor state of repair, so a charity, the Knockando Woolmill Trust, was established to renovate and maintain them. By 2009, the trust had raised ¬£3.3 million for renovations, including a grant of ¬£1.3 million from the National Lottery Heritage Fund, and the ownership of the mill was transferred to the trust. Renovation work was completed in 2012, and production of fabric on the site resumed. In 2016, Knockando Woolen Mill won the Europa Nostra EU Prize for Cultural Heritage, in the Conservation category, and in 2017 it was awarded funding by Highlands and Islands Enterprise to allow it to expand its production and workforce. ==Tartan== The Knockando Woolmill produces a unique tartan. Designed in 2010 by John B Gillespie to commemorate the renovation of the mill, the Knockando Woolmill Tartan is primarily composed of red, blue and green, intended to represent the rust from the iron roof of the mill, water from the burn, and grass from the surrounding fields. The tartan is registered with the Scottish Register of Tartans, and may only be manufactured at the Knockando Woolmill. ==Current usage== The mill continues to make fabrics on its historic machinery. It is open to visitors each year from 18 April to 26 September. == References  External links == * Knockando Woolmill Trust website Category:Wool industry Category:Category A listed buildings in Moray Category:Charities based in Scotland ","title":"Knockando Woolmill"},{"id":"61288271","text":"Cecil F.

The period was a subject of media coverage starting in 2002, with 55 cases and in 2005, it escalated to 424 cases. The refugees were mostly from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and former Yugoslavia. After a long heated debate, psychiatrist Thomas Jackson, the state investigation expert who held the controversial idea that the children were being abused and should be separated from their parents, was shut out of the debate. The debate ended with a more generous refugee policy that formulated a new condition for the apathetic children titled \\"resignation syndrome\\" (uppgivningssyndrom in Swedish). Jackson vehemently opposed this diagnosis insisting on calling it coerced child abuse. Jackson also criticized Swedish doctors and the healthcare system for indirectly contributing to child abuse. When suspicions of manipulation or abuse were uncovered, News24 published an article in 2005 of a \\"child-abuse scam being uncovered in Sweden\\". == Resignation syndrome == Resignation syndrome is characterized by depression, apathy, non-communication, and loss of bodily functions. There are also signs of severe long-term stress which are worsened by asylum processes, waiting times, and rejection by the home country. It is also followed by a gradual behavioral withdrawal into an unconscious and severely handicapping state that requires tube feeding. The children are unable to move, eat, drink, or respond even to painful stimuli and can be in this state for months or years. When the refugee families' social situation improved, most children recovered. In other medical professions, the condition is seen as a hoax or child abuse with the goal of being granted permanent residence. == Debate == The debate involved several doctors, reporters, and activists who all engaged with the goal of understanding whether the children were simulating or if they were victims of severe abuse. According to an article published in Svenska Dagbladet by chief physician Hans Bendz, simulation is a known phenomena and it is not impossible in the case of the apathetic children. A study conducted in 2016 stated that the children were either catatonic as a result of psychogenic stress due to waiting for asylum or that they were a victims of malingering by proxy, rendering them unable to eat, drink or talk. The hypothesis was that the children had become severely catatonic once they had found out that they were being deported as families lacked asylum. The Swedish Social and Health Authority, in its Guidelines on Uppgivenhets Syndrome published in 2013, writes that a patient is not completely healthy until the family has received a permanent residence permit. However, the debate continued over the origin of the phenomena. Swedish doctor Henry Ascher, together with Anders Hjern, claimed that it was due to trauma related to being refugees. This thesis was supported by Gellert Tamas. The phenomena was titled as an epidemic. In an open letter signed by 42 psychiatrists, they demanded that the government stop promoting child abuse by not granting permanent residence. In 2004, the government initiated a state investigation with the goal of analyzing and surveying the prevalence of the condition but reporters from Sveriges Radio accused the state investigators of lying. == Criticism against Tamas == Gellert Tamas, author and lecturer, published a book titled De Apatiska (lit. The Apathetic) criticizing Swedish doctors and politicians who suspected that the children were simulating or were being manipulated. The book was criticized by Swedish doctor and associate professor, Tomas J Eriksson, stating that Tamas had failed to discuss why there was an increase from zero to 400 cases within a few years and why it decreased again. He also stated that Tamas had failed to explain why the condition only affected children awaiting asylum and who were accompanied by family members. Tamas also never discussed why the phenomena only occurred among children from former Yugoslav and Soviet republics. Eriksson also questions why Tamas does not explain how this never happens among Swedish children who are under severe pressure. Eriksson had stated in a debate on SVT that he had treated many refugee children and stated that the children were either poisoned or manipulated. Peter Engels√∂y, deputy head and chief physician, stated in an article published by Aftonbladet that Tamas' book was full of incorrect statements and that Tamas had used character assassination on Engels√∂y. The heads of the Swedish agency for child and youth psychiatry (Barn- och ungdomspsykiatrin) criticized Tamas in an article published by Aftonbladet stating that Tamas was spreading rumors about the psychiatrists' alleged incompetence in treating apathetic children. The criticism was that the psychiatrists could not solely base their clinical diagnosis on Tamas publications without the risk of encouraging child abuse. An article in Dagens Nyheter stated that Tamas' credibility can be questioned. Tamas was reported by the governments' state experts Marie Hessler and Nader Ahmadi to the Granskningsn√§mnden f√∂r radio och TV (the investigation committee for radio and TV) for having intentionally distorted the commentary of several participants in the Swedish television program Uppdrag Granskning's episode of \\"The Toying of the Apathetic\\". Thomas Jackson stated in lectures for healthcare staff and in his publications that Tamas' book was dangerous for apathetic refugee children as he spread rumors that the national agencies had, in turn, spread rumors that the children were simulating. According to an article published by DTMedia, reporters Gellert Tamas and Janne Josefsson did not listen to the criteria for forced simulation which Jackson presented in his participation on Uppdrag Granskning. == Government investigation == According to Nader Ahmadi, the research leader of the state investigation SOU:2006, in some cultures, children could be used \\"holistically\\" for the survival of the family.Ahmadi N (2006). Asyls√∂kande barn med uppgivenhetssymtom ‚Äì trauma, kultur, asylprocess [Asylum-seeking children with symptoms of resignation ‚Äì trauma, culture, asylum process]. Statens offentliga utredningar SOU 2006:49. Edita, Stockholm Ahmadi has also stated in an article by Gefle Blad that \\"manipulation, simulation and poisoning of the children is not impossible\\". Most children were from former Soviet republics and former Yugoslavia. Marie Hessler, head of the Stockholm County Council's child psychiatry unit, stated that she had never witnessed any similar cases in the neighboring Nordic countries. Hessler was heavily criticized in the fevered debate for her neutrality by the Liberals, the Center Party and the Christian Democrats. In 2005, there was a case of a severely depressed boy who faced deportation and the Swedish humanitarian organizations demanded he be granted permanent residence. However, the proposal was voted against by the Moderate Party. At the time, migration minister, Barbro Holmberg, said that giving special treatment could increase the risk for even more asylum children to become apathetic. The Green Party's leader, Gustav Fridolin, accused her of being racist stating that asylum families would never manipulate their children. Holmberg was also criticized in chronicles published in Barometern and Gefle Blad for having stated that \\"refugee parents drugged and abused their own children\\". Annica Ring, an executive official in the Migration Board office in Solna, Stockholm, was interviewed by Svenska Dagbladet. In this interview, she stated that the board had been investigating some \\"irregularities\\" among the refugee families indicating that the parents were in some way responsible for the condition of the children, either through psychological manipulation or medication. The board reported this to the social authorities and when nothing happened, they turned the report to the police who suspected that the children had been poisoned. The board was heavily criticized by the Swedish media. Bj√∂rn Sundin, a reporter stated that he did not believe in the state investigation expert Thomas Jackson's theory after he, as a symbolic protest, joined Svenskarnas Parti, but Sundin noted that Jackson's argumentation had validity and credibility, and that the critique of Jackson was not met objectively. Swedish author, Lars Ulwencreutz, praised Jackson in his book for \\"having the bravery of calling the phenomena child abuse\\". == Child abuse == However, Thomas Jackson, psychiatrist, doctor and the elected expert of the state investigation during the Labour Party at the time concluded that the children were under severe abuse being tube fed by parents or guardians intending to weaken the child to gain wealth from the Swedish welfare system. This led to a large controversy and Jackson was labeled as an incompetent Nazi by author Gellert Tamas and by reporters Malena Rydell and Jenny Wennberg of Arbetarbladet. According to Jackson, the abuse has continued and he proposed the term, \\"commando syndrome\\". Jackson has reported that after his investigation, he was contacted by trafficking gangs from Eastern European countries who threatened him. After having contacted the police, they stated that the threats were due to the unveiling of criminal networks. Jackson published an article in Dagens Medicin but it was removed as Jackson's standpoint was too controversial. Jackson's thesis is supported by Marc Feldman, an expert on Munchausen by proxy. Tomas Eriksson, an elected expert of the state investigation, has stated that the children might be manipulated or poisoned. Lise Tamm, the state prosecutor, began an investigation based on reports that refugee parents were criminally abusing their children, but Socialtj√§nsten, the Swedish social service, had \\"conflicting interests\\" with the authorities which made an investigation impossible. Tamm stated in 2006 that the Migration Board had reported nine parents in Stockholm who were suspected of abusing their children. Tamm concluded that Tamas had intentionally distorted her commentary of the situation. In 2011, child right experts, Laila Lindberg and Sara Damber, stated in an article published by Svenska Dagbladet that apathetic children were denied help as health care personnel often lacked courage and knowledge in their diagnosis of the potential abuse of the children. In another article by Svenska Dagbladet, the National Board of Health and Welfare had failed in reporting the suspected abuse of children by refusing to cooperate with the authorities. Some healthcare personnel had witnessed how parents in secret emptied the nourishing drop from the children's tubes. In some cases, there were reports of families hating their children who were not always sick. According to an article published by Aftonbladet in 2005, Janna Valik, the general director of the Migration Agency, failed to investigate reports of abuse among apathetic children and was displaced by the government. The Chancellor of Justice started an investigation of the Migration Agency to determine if the correct procedure had been followed. == Sweden == In a study conducted in September 2011 by Henry Ascher from the University of Gothenburg, the refugee children were caught in an ambiguous debate: on one side, it was Sweden's humane migration policy following the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and on the other hand, the suspicion of guardians abusing their children after receiving the decision of deportation. According to an article by the BBC, the phenomenon occurs only in Sweden and is labeled as \\"resignation syndrome\\". Jackson has commentated on this stating that the correct term for this phenomenon should be \\"commando syndrome\\". In an article by Melissa Sartore of the Ranker, the children became ill after the parents were denied asylum. She described it as a \\"mysterious disease\\". G√∂ran Bodeg√•rd wrote in his commentary on the paper \\"Pervasive Refusal Syndrome (PRS) 21 years on‚Äîa reconceptualization and renaming\\" that after the families were denied residency, 400 children fell ill. In 2016, Dagens Medicin published an article about the increasing numbers of apathetic refugee children. BMJ published an article about the Karolinska Institutes controversy whether or not the children were simulating or being abused. According to an article by Professor Karl Lofgren from the Victoria University of Wellington, he discussed how the children could be traumatized by war despite not having lived in a war zone since the majority came from former Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. Lofgren also stated that there was no psychiatrist involved in the state investigation. This is incorrect as Thomas Jackson is mentioned as the licensed psychiatrist. Lofgren also wrote that when all refugee children were granted general amnesty in 2005, there was a decrease in cases in 2007. Thomas Jackson has stated that there are over 2000 children possibly being abused since many of the guardians now are paid by the state to provide care for the children. Bill Schiller from the BBC aired a radio episode stating that this phenomenon did not exist in other countries which led to a savage debate as to whether or not the children were faking. According to an article by Svenska Dagbladet, the number of apathetic refugee children has decreased ever since financed care was provided for the guardians at home. Migrationsverket, Sweden's Migration Agency, suspected 13 cases of malingering by proxy where parents were found abusing their children. Several doctors and nurses stated in an interview that the parents used physical violence on the doctors if they did not immediately recommend asylum. Many doctors provided the guardians with tubes in to nurture them; thereby, furthering the abuse. Some children were also isolated with windows and curtains closed. Karl Sallin, a pediatrician at Karolinska University Hospital, told the New Yorker that \\"another way to give the children hope would be to treat them properly and not leave them lying on a bed with a nasal tube for nine months\\". In the spring of 2005, the debate about the apathetic refugee children had grown stronger mobilizing asylum rights movements with organizations, individuals, political parties, and religious communities who all campaigned for a general amnesty. Apathetic refugee children and their parents were subjects of skepticism as an increasing suspicion of forced manipulated coercing was a possible risk. Gellert Tamas claimed these statements were not true. Bj√∂rn Lundin, the head physician at the child and youth psychiatric clinic and Stefan Croner, the head physician at the child and youth medicine clinic, presented munchhausen- by-proxy as a theory in an article explaining that in some cases the children are victims of severe abuse. The doctors stated that in these cases one of the parents, usually the mother, is the perpetrator. == Nocebo effect == According to an article by Hannah Bradby in 2017, there was a risk of the \\"nocebo effect\\", the \\"evil twin\\" of the placebo effect, where a doctor, through a supposedly neutral medical intervention, brings about unwanted side effects. Well-meaning doctors reinforce the necessity for refugee children's extreme suffering in to persuade the Migration Board to grant residency permits which leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy where the parents decide that only granted residency will make the child healthy again. The idea was criticized as it prevented a proper medical investigation of the child's condition. Bradby also stated that within days, after the child is separated from the parents, regardless of the previous condition of the child, the child becomes healthy eating and drinking like normal. Jackson has stated that this type of phenomenon does not exist in Norway as the children who fall victim to this are separated from the parents to see if they recover. == Culture == In 2011, the Stockholm State Theater, having drawn inspiration from Gellert Tamas book \\"De Apatiska\\" (lit. The Apathetic), hosted a play mocking politicians and medical personnel who suspected malingering by proxy and who disagreed with the idea that the children were traumatized from war.

He was reported to have made good money whilst in Bengal, including an award of ¬£30,000 as compensation for suffering caused in the siege of Calcutta. In 1760 he transferred to Bihar. Fullerton was a member of a small Company force which was assisting the Nawab of Bengal Mir Kasim in a conflict with Shah Alam. He was present at the Battle of Mohsinpur and was the only surviving European officer. On the death of his fellow officers he assumed command and led a retreat to Patna where he played a significant role in the town's defence. After the conflict, he returned to Bengal and resigned his post. He intended to return to Britain but instead returned to his post as surgeon at Patna in 1763. Fullerton was part of the Company's force that was captured by Mir Kasim near Manji in 1763. He was held captive at Patna, and present at the Patna massacre of 1763. Through intercession from Sayyid Ghulam Husain Tabatabai who regarded him as an intimate friend, Mir Kasam spared his life. He was the only European to escape unharmed from the massacre. Following his release he was placed under house arrest in Patna, until under the guise of visiting the Dutch factory, he hired a boat to take him across the Ganges river to Hajipur where some Company troops were present. After tensions with Mir Kasam subsided, Fullerton remained in Patna for a further two years. He was later accused of misrepresenting a letter written by Nand Kumar to Raja Balwant Singh of Benares suggesting a plot to overthrow Company rule in Bihar and requesting help. An inquiry was held by the Company council in Calcutta and he was censored for misconduct. In protest Fullerton tendered his resignation on 21 March 1765 and sailed for England on the Ponsborne. ==Death== Fullerton died in Scotland on 22 October 1805. == References  Further reading == * \\"Fullerton's letters\\", William Fullerton, National Archives * The Diaries of Three Surgeons of Patna, 1763, by Firminger, Walter K.

This almost square block is bounded by the River Enborne to the south; on the west by a hedge line that runs two furlongs to the east of the Andover Road (A343) which runs north-south through Wash Common; Monks (Monkey) Lane and therefore Newbury to the north (though the parish boundary runs a bit south of the road); and the Newtown road, A339 (previously A34) to the east (though clearly parish boundary and the priory/school is to the east of that). Almost the only way into this park is from the west, from the A343, Andover road, past the Roman Catholic church at Warren Lodge, and down the remaining 200 yards of an ancient track flanked by field maple, oak, ash, hazel, ivy, elm, elder, hawthorn, and blackthorn.Hoopers rule, see Hedge#Hedgerow dating Around here the cavalry of Prince Rupert of the Rhine lined up before the First Battle of Newbury in September 1643, and near here are the meadows which feature in the beginning of Richard Adams' semi-factual novel Watership Down. At this point the enclosed track ends at the Newbury (Wash Common)/Sandleford parish boundary, but the public footpath or former carriage track continues. In previous centuries, in Mrs. Montagu's day, this was the main route to the priory from the west, from places like Bath, Somerset.Mrs. Montagu's letters (Climenson) and those associated with her nephew (viz. William Wilberforce) record many visitors passing via Sandleford on their way to or from Bath. Here the view quickly opens out, expansively, perspective tricks have been played with hedge and wood edge lines which add to the sense of infinity and space. 1911 Ordnance Survey map of Sandleford, Berkshire, UK.jpg1911 Ordnance Survey map of Sandleford.

Barn copse is passed on the left or north. A hedge line connects Barn Copse to Dirty Ground Copse, and another hedge line from that forms an arrow with the northern edge of Gorse Covert. Comparison of the 1761 John Rocque map with how things now appear suggests a degree of highly clever tweeking of wood and hedge lines to maximise the effect of the landscape took place in the late eighteenth century.A Topographical Map of the County of Berks, by John Rocque, Topographer to His Majesty, 1761. In the far distance on the right, to the south, there is Sidown Hill with its brick folly Heaven's Gate, built in 1749 for Hon. Robert Sawyer Herbert (1693‚Äì1769), MP (for Wilton 1722‚Äì1768), of Highclere, second son of Thomas Herbert, 8th Earl of Pembroke, visible at about 60 feet high, and next to that Beacon Hill. As the track passes through the bottle-neck formed by this hedge and the north-east end of Gorse Covert the viewer then goes through to the next instalment, a first distant prospect of Sandleford Priory itself, and the North Downs, including Watership Down. The track continues due east passing High Wood and a distant view of Slockett's Copse and Crook's Copse beyond to the left or north. Eventually the track reaches the A339 and the main entrance to the priory/school. Through the heart of this block of 500 acres a small stream runs north south from the top of Crook's Copse, down between High Wood and Slockett's Copse and then having been joined by another smaller stream runs east parallel with the southern edge of High Wood and then turns south again towards the River Enborne. In 1749 Elizabeth Montagu wrote to her husband from Tunbridge Wells: My Dearest, ... I flatter myself the Captain will think Berkshire not inferior to Surry [sic], especially if he bestrides his Arabian steed, and surveys the prospects from Newbury Wash, Greenham &c.; When he is tired of mere cows and sheep, and would behold some of those fair creatures, Father Philip's geese,The Hermit, or Father Philip's Geese, the title of a poem by Jean de La Fontaine published in The Gentleman's Magazine, October 1733, page 544....The Letters of Mrs. Elizabeth Montagu, published by Matthew Montagu, Esq., her nephew & executor, volume III, page 121, London, 1813. Mrs. Montagu's views on landscape, indicating that parks and gardens should be under the care of the cherub Contemplation, are somewhat revealed in a letter to Gilbert West, dated 1753, 25th: 'I suppose you have been at Stowe, where art has exhausted all her powers,which West's uncle, Viscount Cobham, had masterminded' Equel, che il bello, o il caro accresce all' opre L'arte, che tutto fa, nulla si ScopreQuoted from Torquato Tasso describing the gardens of Armida 'Such, I am told, is its present state; when I saw the gardens they brought not so much to one's imagination the scenes of paradise, as of that garden, where the sapient king with his fair spouse held dalliance;Milton's Paradise Lost. it is rather a retreat for the proud and victorious, than the philosophic mind; like the poets, it was an Elysian only for heroes; ambition found examples there, and restless emulation fair incitements, but no quiet scenes hushed the passions into peace, and excluded the visions of this world's vanities; which, I take to be the great benefit of the retreat which should put the mind into the guardian care of the cherub Contemplation.'the cherub Contemplation', comes from John Milton's Il Penseroso.' In September 1757 Mrs Montagu wrote to Dr. Messenger Monsey (1693‚Äì1788), FRS, ... I assure you we have Groves too at Sandleford, where you may meet your Amante Sposa, Dame Melancholy, as often as you please....Sandleford, 8 September 1757 ===Job creation scheme=== Haytley's painting, with Sandleford haymakers, circa 1744. In July 1782 Mrs Montagu mentioned the high unemployment then found in Newbury and the works going on at Sandleford: The scene is extremely animated; 20 men at work in the wood and grove, and the fields around are full of haymakers. The persons employed on the work are poor weavers who by the decay of our manufacture at Newbury are void of employment, and not having been trained to the business of agriculture are not dexterous at the rake and pitchfork, but the plain digging and driving wheel barrows they can perform and are very glad to get their daily subsistence.Quoted in The Omnipotent Magician, by Jane Brown, Pimlico, London, 2012, p297. ===Tourist attraction=== In a letter dated Deal, 21 July 1786, Elizabeth Carter wrote to her friend Elizabeth Montagu: 'Your letter, my dear friend, ... The trouble which you receive from the curiosity of people to see your improvements at Sandleford, is one of the natural embarras des richesses. Nobody plagues me by besieging my doors in carriages, and upon pillions to see my cottage. After all, however, it is very strange how people can be so impertinent, one would think they might at least suspend their impatient curiosity till you were absent'.Letters of Elizabeth Carter to Elizabeth Montagu, Letter CCLIX, page 261, volume 3, London, 1817. A year later Elizabeth Carter, in a letter, dated Deal, 22 June 1787, pointed to the music of the groves: ' ... By this time, my dear friend, I hope you are enjoying the music of your groves at Sandleford... '.Letters of Elizabeth Carter to Elizabeth Montagu, Letter CCLXII, volume 3, London, 1817. ==Past descriptions of the house and estateElizabeth Montagu 1743=== In 1743 Mrs Montagu wrote from Sandleford to her old friend the Duchess of Portland and described her new retreat: '...I had a very pleasant journey to this place, where I am delighted to find everything that is capable of making retreat agreeable; the garden commands a fine prospect, the most cheerful I ever saw, and not of shirt distance which is only to gratify the pride of seeing, but such as falls within the humble reach of my eyes. We have a pretty village [ Newtown ] on a rising ground just before us.' Where the cottage chimney smokes, Fast between two oaks.From John Milton's 'L'allegro', 'Hard by, a cottage chimney smokes, From betwixt two aged oaks,' 'Poverty here is clad in its decent garb of low simplicity, but her tattered robes of misery do not here show want and wretchedness; you would rather imagine pomp was neglected than sufficiency wanted.' 'A silver stream [the Alder stream, aka river Enborne] washes the foot of the village; health, pleasure, and refreshment are the ingredients that qualify this spring; no debauch, or intoxication, arises from its source.' 'Nature has been very indulgent to this country, and has given it enough of wood and water; the first we have here in good plenty, and a power of having more of the latter, as improvements are undertaken.' 'Here are temptations to riding and walking. I go out every evening to take a view of the country; the villages are the neatest I ever saw; every cottage is tight; has a little garden, and is sheltered by fine trees...' The Letters of Mrs. Elizabeth Montagu, edited by her nephew Matthew Montagu, MP, London, 1809. ===Survey 1781=== A survey of the 619 acre, 2 roods and 17 perches estate made for Mrs Montagu in 1781, by John Spyers (c1720-1798) on behalf of Lancelot Brown, and used when the lease of 503 acres and 111 acres was sold to William Chatteris on 3 November 1835, shows that in 1835 111 acres were owned outright by the Lord Rokeby on the east side (mostly in the parish of Greenham), that 87 acres on the east side belonged to the Dean and Canons of Windsor (held by Lord Rokeby), and that 416 acres on the west side of the road (also leased from the Dean and Canons of Windsor by Lord Rokeby), with 5 acres belonging to Mrs Colman near the mill.Berkshire Record Office (BRO:D/ELM T19/2/13) One question regarding this 1781 survey is whether it was a depiction of what work was to be done, as conceived by Lancelot Brown, or more likely exactly how the estate was at the time? Meanwhile, the 1871 map shows the landscape as it might have been embellished by Brown, especially regarding the ponds near Broadmoor and Waterleaze woods. It is also possible that this 1871 map was based on a lost map made by Brown as a result of works undertaken after that 1781 survey. In November 1762 replying to a letter from her husband Mrs Montagu wrote:Huntingdon, MO2464You are very good in consulting me about the Trees..., which suggests that landscape works had been going on post the Rocque map of 1761 and preceding Capability Brown's involvement post 1781, more in a style as seen at Studley Royal/Fountains Abbey or as painted by people like Jacob van Ruisdael, Antonie Waterloo (1609‚Äì1690), or Thomas Gainsborough (1727‚Äì1788). 87 acres of coppices on the west side (acres, roods, perches) *Waterleaze and Broadmoor coppice: 41 2 09 *High Wood coppice: 18 3 10 *Upper Moor coppice: 2 01 10 (now Gorse covert) *Lower Moor coppice: 3 1 01 (now Gorse covert) *Dirty Ground: 5 0 17 *Orchard House coppice: 5 2 10 (now Slockett's copse) *Wilsons coppice: 4 0 06 (now Barn copse) *Parting Ground coppice: 5 2 16 (now Crook's copse) *Furze close border: 0 2 16 (near Orchard House coppice) *Hassocks above Halls mead: 0 2 12 (linear or ghost wood east of Parting Ground coppice). 60 acres of meadowland on the west side (acres, roods, perches) *Upper mill mead; *Lower mill mead; *Mill mead; *Grabbed piddle; *Pound meadow; *Over way cow leaze; *Upper peat mead; *Upper eight acres; *Four acres; *Ireland; *Halls mead. 227 and 40 acres of arable on the west side (acres, roods, perches) *Great Water leaze 12 2 19; *The Pond 0 3 24; *Middle Leaze 14 1 15; *Upper Moor 13 1 21; *Lower Moor 11 1 30; *Fulwars 16 0 33; *Picked Harts 10 3 24; *Round Harts 20 2 14; *High wood close 16 1 0; *Fatting Leaze 19 3 03; *Adams ground 20 1 6; *Parting ground 15 0 22; *High Field 23 2 28; *Gravel close 3 1 13; *Furz ground 28 3 15; and *Newberry [sic] grounds, (aka Tydehams, alias Tidlaws), comprised three fields on the brow of the slope north of Monks' Lane, looking north down towards Newbury, that totalled 40 2 00. (These 40 acres were developed into Newbury's smartest cul- de-sac from March 1923 when Dr. George Alan Simmons (died 1951) bought 42 acres from Christopher Saunders, who had acquired them in 1911 from the trustees of the estate of Alpin Macgregor, late owner of the Sandleford Priory Estate. There were 10 houses by 1928; 12 by 1931; 25 by 1941; 28 in 1963; 30 by 1982; and 39 in 2010. Major-general Llewelyn Alberic Emilius Price-Davies, VC, CB, CMG, DSO, lived briefly, 1926‚Äì1929, at the house variously known as Badsworth, Mary Leen and Lustleigh).At the time of the Newbury tithe award the forty acres were leased by the Dean and Canons of Windsor to Henry Churchyard, and in 1777 it was occupied by Henry Grace (info: R.B. Tubb).Newbury Road by Road, by R. B. Tubb, Thatcham, 2011. The 16 acres field known as Fulwars was no doubt named after Fulwar Craven, 4th Baron Craven (1704‚Äì1764), of nearby Benham Park and Hampstead Marshall, High Steward of Newbury 1739‚Äì1764,Walter Money, FSA, Newbury, 1887, page 555. and a founder of the Craven hunt.Fulwar Craven was ward and nephew of Sir Fulwar Skipwith, 2nd Bt., (1676‚Äì1728), MP (Coventry). The 1781 survey map also shows the Montagu purchases of coppices (such as Little Peckmore and Collin's coppices) and water-meadows at Peckmore and on the north side of the Auborn stream (alias river Enborne), and its layout before its severe disturbance by the new west-east running A339; re- routed along the river Enborne as a result of two of the old roads to Newbury that formerly crossed Greenham Common south-north being severed when the airport was made circa 1942. The map also shows a Rick yard; farm yard, with a very large barn;size as shown also by a photograph of circa 1906 the Green yard in front of the priory; a Wilderness walk; and a Bowling green. The map shows the stream that flows south into the river Enborne (aka Auborne stream) which also marked the border of the parishes of Greenham and Sandleford and was to provide the water that formed what is known as Brown's (extant), Woodhouse (derelict),Named after Mrs Montagu's butler Joseph Woodhouse or his poetical shoemaker brother James Woodhouse (c1735-1820), who worked as the land steward and bailiff at Sandleford from the mid-1760s onwards. and Newtown ponds (seems to have disappeared). Collin's coppice ran just east of the priory's demesne, near where the first ponds were formed. Collin's coppice still exists at the south-western corner of Greenham Common, as does Peckmoor, an arable field now a grazed part of Bunker farm. ===Mary Morgan 1791=== Photograph of Wyatt's alteration to the chapel at Sandleford Priory, 1906, by Evelyn Elizabeth Myers (c. 1872‚Äì1909).

Mary Morgan's husband was rector of Wisbech a mere 15 miles north of Coveney, near Ely. one of the two daughters of the Ipswich composer Joseph Gibbs (died 1788), and wife to Rev. Caesar Morgan, DD, (died 1812, aged 62), vicar of Wisbech and then Rector of St James' Church, Stretham, Cambridgeshire and (from 1804) a Prebendary of Ely,The Gentleman's Magazine, November 1818, page 473. in her A Tour to Milford Haven, in the year 1791 published in 1795, wrote (Letter V, To Miss B _ _ _ _ , Burfield [ Burghfield ], 13 July 1791):She was staying with Mrs Montagu's brother Rev. William Robinson (died 1803) who was rector of Burghfield. Robinson's son was then rector of Coveney, near Ely; a friend and neighbour of Mrs Morgan. ...I felt myself sufficiently gratified, that a great portion of genius is possessed by my sex; I was entirely devoid of dread or envy. After driving twenty miles through a very pleasant country, and through the pretty town of Newbury, we entered Mrs. Montagu's park, which seemed to have undergone some recent improvements, as the trees were many of them newly planted. The approach to the house is a fine lawn, with sheep feeding upon it. This gives you the idea of beauty blended with utility, which always produces agreeable sensations in the mind...page 33 ...In this wing is an elegant dressing-room above stairs. This too has a large bow, on the outside of which there is a very spacious balcony, surrounded by iron balustrades. The balcony commands a distant view of the Hampshire hills, and an extensive diversified country. The small village of Newton in the Valley has an humble simplicity in it, that is agreeably contrasted with the lofty hills beyond it... ...When we withdrew to go to bed, we were ushered up stairs by the major domo, with a wax light in each hand. I found the bedroom lighted up, and a female waiting in it ready to undress me. Mrs M.-- was not conducted into my room, but into a dressing-room adjoining, by a door that opened into a passage. Reflecting on this, to me unusual ceremony, I almost began to fancy myself a bride again; or else, that I was transported into some fairy region, where I was to be waited upon by spirits, that were every where attending without being called for... ...In the dressing-room there was a collection of books; amongst them I found your friend Miss Cornelia Knight's Dinarbas. Here you may amuse yourself in the morning, if you please, till dinner calls you again to society. The grounds are laid out with the same Attic taste, as the house. Through a great part of them Mrs. Montagu has trained a river, which was little more than a ditch; and means to extend it still further... she has likewise cut a winding path through her plantations. It is a carriage way and is a mile in length. It is also a very pleasant walk, and may serve; 'or for study, or for love' being perfectly secluded. At agreeable distances are benches under the shadow of a large tree, or the shelter of a close hedge interwoven with woodbines and honeysuckles.Mary Morgan, 1795, page 33. When walking in the grounds, I observed an extraordinary degree of cleanliness and decency in the men, who were at work in them. Upon enquiry I found they were all fed and cloathed by her hand. I perceived too that many of them had some great defect, occasioned by age, natural infirmity, or misfortune, being either blind, deaf, dumb, or lame; yet she so paired them, and fitted their employments to their several faculties, that the remaining senses of one served to supply the deficiencies of the other. By this stroke of benevolent ingenuity, though she does not get so much work done, as she would by stronger and abler men; she has the heart- felt satisfaction of making those useful and happy members of society, whom nobody else would employ, and who, but for her, must be dependent upon a parish for an idle and scanty substance. I hope it is not prophane to say, she has made the blind to see, the deaf to hear, the dumb to speak, and the lame to walk.Morgan, 1795, page 39 The whole of this place suggested to me the idea of a Roman villa. There is every thing for use as well as beauty. The farm and dairy are not omitted; they supply the family and table with all things necessary and delicate. In short, there is a style in every part of it, that bespeaks a superior degree of judgment. Nothing is gaudy or superfluous, yet nothing is wanting. Native genius, matured by observation upon what is simply elegant, has guided the hand of the amiable possessor of this enchanting place... Adieu.A Tour to Milford Haven, in the year 1791, London, 1795, pages 32‚Äì45; also quoted by Stephen Bending in Green Retreats, women, gardens and eighteenth-century culture, Cambridge University Press, 2013, page 171.A Tour to Milford Haven, in the year 1791, London, 1795, pages 32‚Äì45; also quoted by Stephen Bending in Green Retreats, women, gardens and eighteenth-century culture, Cambridge University Press, 2013, page 171. A few days later she continued: (To Miss B., Letter IX, Woodstock, 16 July 1791): Having before described Sandleford to you, I cannot help observing, that it is a striking contrast to Blenheim. But it is such a one, as when the eye, dazzled with gazing at the sun, falls on the soft green of a beautiful lawn, upon which it may rest for ever without satiety or weariness. At Sandleford the mind is gratified with everything that can render life rational and happy. At Blenheim it is fatigued with contemplating objects, that seem like a golden dream, too gay and too gaudy to be real.Mary Morgan, 1795, page 76. Morgan's list of subscribers shows that Elizabeth Montagu, aka Montagu, Mrs. Portman Square-10 copies., and her nephew (the son of Rev. William Robinson, rector of Burghfield), aka Robinson, Rev. Mr. Rector of Coveney, in the Isle of Ely-6 copies., evidently appreciated this ebullient description. ===William Cobbett 1821=== The Radical MP and journalist William Cobbett (1762‚Äì1835) wrote about Sandleford in his journal whilst staying with the farmer Mr. Budd at Burghclere, on 30 October 1821.William Cobbett, Rural Rides, London, 1853. Appropriately 150 years later Budd's Farm was home to the writer Roger Mortimer. This is the gist of it: :'...Came through a place called \\"a park\\" belonging to a Mr. Montague, who is now abroad ; :Of all the ridiculous things I ever saw in my life this place is the most ridiculous. The house looks like a sort of church, in somewhat of a gothic style of building, with crosses on the tops of different parts of the pile. There is a sort of swamp, at the foot of a wood, at no great distance from the front of the house'. :'...Here is a fountain, the basin of which is not four feet over, and the water spout not exceeding the pour from a tea-pot. Here is a bridge over a river of which a child four years old would clear the banks at a jump...' :'...In short, such fooleries I never before beheld; but what I disliked most was the apparent impiety of a part of these works of refined taste'. :'...I wonder how long this sickly, this childish, taste is to remain?' :'..At the end of this scene of mock grandeur and mock antiquity I found something more rational; namely, some hare hounds, and, in half-an-hour after, we found, and I had the first hare-hunt that I had had since I wore a smock-frock !' 'Came through a place called \\"a park\\" belonging to a Mr. Montague, who is now abroad ; for the purpose, I suppose, of generously assisting to compensate the French people for what they lost by the entrance of the Holy Alliance Armies into their country. Of all the ridiculous things I ever saw in my life this place is the most ridiculous. The house looks like a sort of church, in somewhat of a gothic style of building, with crosses on the tops of different parts of the pile. There is a sort of swamp, at the foot of a wood, at no great distance from the front of the house. This swamp has been dug out in the middle to show the water to the eye; so that there is a sort of river, or chain of diminutive lakes, going down a little valley, about 500 yards long, the water proceeding from the soak of the higher ground on both sides. By the sides of these lakes there are little flower gardens, laid out in the Dutch manner; that is to say, cut out into all manner of superficial geometrical figures. Here is the grand en petit, or mock magnificence, more complete than I ever beheld it before. Here is a fountain, the basin of which is not four feet over, and the water spout not exceeding the pour from a tea-pot. Here is a bridge over a river of which a child four years old would clear the banks at a jump. I could not have trusted myself on the bridge for fear of the consequences to Mr. Montague; but I very conveniently stepped over the river, in imitation of the Colossus. In another part there was a lion's mouth spouting out water into the lake, which was so much like the vomiting of a dog, that I could almost have pitied the poor Lion. In short, such fooleries I never before beheld; but what I disliked most was the apparent impiety of a part of these works of refined taste. I did not like the crosses on the dwelling house; but, in one of the gravel walks, we had to pass under a gothic arch, with a cross on the top of it, and in the point of the arch a niche for a saint or a virgin, the figure being gone through the lapse of centuries, and the pedestal only remaining as we so frequently see on the out-sides of Cathedrals and of old churches and chapels. But the good of it was, this gothic arch, disfigured by the hand of old Father Time, was composed of Scotch fir wood, as rotten as a pear; nailed together in such a way as to make the thing appear, from a distance, like the remnant of a ruin ! I wonder how long this sickly, this childish, taste is to remain? I do not know who this gentleman is. I suppose he is some honest person from the 'Change or its neighbourhood; and that these gothic arches are to denote the antiquity of his origin! Not a bad plan; and, indeed, it is one that I once took the liberty to recommend to those Fundlords who retire to be country-'squires. But I never recommended the Crucifixes ! To be sure the Roman Catholic religion may, in England, be considered as a gentleman's religion, it being the most ancient in the country; and, there-fore, it is fortunate for a Fundlord when he happens (if he ever do happen) to be of that faith. This gentleman may, for anything that I know, be a Catholic ; in which case I applaud his piety and pity his taste. At the end of this scene of mock grandeur and mock antiquity I found something more rational; namely, some hare hounds, and, in half-an-hour after, we found, and I had the first hare-hunt that I had had since I wore a smock-frock ! We killed our hare after good sport, and got to Burghclere in the evening to a nice farm-house in a dell, sheltered from every wind, and with plenty of good living; though with no gothic arches made of Scotch-fir'. ==Bibliography== *Stephen Bending, Green Retreats, women, gardens and eighteenth-century culture, Cambridge University Press, 2013. *Evelyn Elizabeth Myers (c.1872‚Äì1909), A History of Sandleford Priory, Newbury District Field Club, Special Publication. no. 1.

Harold Schwartz (March 13, 1910 ‚Äì December 22, 2003) was an American businessman and real estate developer who along with his son, H. Gary Morse, founded the active adult retirement community The Villages, Florida. == Early life == Harold Schwartz was born March 13, 1910, in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Louis and Katherine Schwartz. == Career == In the 1930s, Schwartz worked as a travelling salesman, selling products for his father's tailoring company until it was forced to close due to the Great Depression. In 1947, Schwartz began purchasing radio stations, including several \\"border buster\\" stations in Mexico. Many of these stations, located just across the border with the United States, operated without proper licenses. Schwartz is credited with the discovery of famed disk jockey and radio personality Wolfman Jack, employing him at his Tijuana, Mexico, radio station in the late 1960s. In the 1950s and 60s, Schwartz operated a thriving mail-order real estate business, selling plots of land in New Mexico and Florida to customers around the country until federal law banned the practice in 1968. ==Founding of The Villages== In the early 1970s, Schwartz turned his focus from mail-order land sales to land development. Schwartz, along with business partner Al Tarrson, founded Orange Blossom Gardens, a mobile home park in Central Florida located off of US Highway 27-441. Using land leftover from his mail-order land sales business, Schwartz began selling homes to retirees. Initially, sales were slow, with only about 400 homes being built in the original development. In 1983, Schwartz, unsatisfied with the progress, bought out Tarrson's interest in the business and brought in his son, advertising executive, H. Gary Morse as a business partner. Together, Schwartz and Morse increased sales at Orange Blossom Gardens exponentially and created interest in the growing community. In 1992, the name of the development was changed from Orange Blossom Gardens to The Villages. ==Personal life== In 1934, Schwartz married Mary Louise Lee. Together, the two shared a son, Harold, and a daughter, Mary. The two later divorced. In 1946, Schwartz married Bernice Newman. Together they shared a son, Richard. Schwartz died on December 22, 2003, at the age of 93. His ashes were interred in the base of a statue depicting him at Spanish Springs Town Square in Lady Lake, Florida. ==References== Category:1910 births Category:2003 deaths Category:People from Sumter County, Florida Category:Businesspeople from Florida Category:Businesspeople from Chicago ","title":"Harold Schwartz"},{"id":"61288300","text":"Ajit Singh is an Indian politician.

It consists of four different versions of \\"Louca\\" (\\"Crazy\\"), a song she had released in 2017 and that was part of the soundtrack of superseries Onde Nascem os Fortes, by Rede Globo: a remastered version, an acoustic version, a remixed version and an a cappella version. The EP was released with a show at Sesc Pompeia, in S√£o Paulo, on the following day of the release's arrival on digital platforms. == Background == The track was originally recorded by Mexican singer Thal√≠a on her 2005 album El Sexto Sentido, but Caymmi actually first heard it in a cover version by Banda Kitara. Originally, the song would be the closer of her 2018 album Alice, but it ended up excluded from the final track listing and would only be added back as a bonus track of the album's 2019 re-release, in its a cappella version, which was exclusively released prior to the EP at Red Bull's website. \\"Louca\\" would close the album so that it would contrast with the opening track \\"Spiritual\\", which opening lines say \\"I'm not getting crazy\\". The idea of releasing the track was matured throughout 2018, with the original plan having the EP as a Christmas gift for the fans. However, that did not happen. Nevertheless, the idea of allowing fans \\"to see different ways of making the same song also, of choosing my favorite form of them\\", as the singer put it, was kept. In another interview, she said: About the lyrics, Caymmi said: The acoustic version features Mateo Pirac√©s-Ugarte, from the band Francisco, el Hombre, and it received a clip, which exclusively debuted at the Tenho Mais Discos Que Amigos! website and was recorded at YouTube Space, in Rio de Janeiro. About the partnership, Pirac√©s-Ugarte said: The remixed version was created by DJ J Brasil. By the time of the EP's release, she was already sure of a future release for the same year - it came in May, titled Electra.

It currently serves as a U.S. Border Patrol station. == Development == After the Pearl Harbor attack on December 7, 1941, distrust towards Western Europe and Japan began to increase. Paranoia among Americans increased after the discovery that more than 1 million Germans were fleeing to countries in Latin America. FBI agents were ordered by the Roosevelt administration to capture Nazis in Latin America and deport them to internment camps across the southern states of the U.S. Almost 20 countries in Latin America assisted in capturing approximately 5,000 Germans who fled to their countries; however, many of the detainees were innocent. Not only were Nazis being captured and sent to the camps, so were Jews and Hitler resistors. == Controversy  Allegations === Reports have shown that dictators in Latin America would accuse people of being Nazis to receive pay from the U.S. government. Some Latin American residents were accused and turned in by their government in order to gain their property and belongings. === Abuse === At these internment camps, the U.S. government would allow the prisoners of war to fly their Swastika flags and sing Nazi songs at the camps in an effort to protect their freedom and welfare; however, due to the obligatory mix of opposing sides at the camps, this led to discrimination and attacks against the Jews who were held there. The National Refugee Service along with various Jewish organizations, when informed of the mistreatment of the Jewish and non-Jewish people, demanded that they be moved to Camp Algiers. Camp Algiers soon became known as 'the camp of the innocent' because about 81 Jews and non-Jews were sent there to escape harassment of Nazis at other camps. It contained a small library, musical instruments, and the residents were allowed to shop locally. The children were permitted to receive an education at Algiers elementary and high school. === Condemnation of internment camps === Max Paul Friedman, a professor at American University, made a statement about the mistreatment of the Jews and non-Jews in his book Nazis and Good Neighbors: The United States Campaign against the Germans of Latin America in World War II: \\"Here was the creation of camps set up deliberately outside of the legal system in order to intern people suspected of subversion against whom there very little evidence. So it was an illegal operation that wound up being counterproductive and a violation of human rights, and it was sort of swept under the rug after the war.\\" He further explains what he believes the mistakes were that the U.S. made in an effort to prevent an outbreak of Hitler supporters in the south and to avoid enemy aliens. He also describes the community and living conditions of the internment camps located in Texas, Tennessee, North Dakota, Florida and Louisiana. == Outcome == In 1943, after 2 years of detainment, the Jewish internees were finally paroled. Jewish families in other cities became parolees-at-large (becoming a 'sponsor' for a refugee) and spoke out for their freedom. By the end of the year, they were allowed to leave the camps but could not return to their home countries because the war had not yet ended. By 1944, only 6 Jews were left residing at Camp Algiers. Nazi supporting Germans were sent there soon after, and a former Hitler advisor was appointed as the head of the internee committee, which created an unsafe environment for the Jews that remained at Camp Algiers for the following 2 years. === Present day === The owner of the camp is collaborating with private investors to secure financing and preserve much of the camp. Most of the buildings are decaying and collapsing, except for one, which has already been reconstructed and preserved by the Department of Homeland Security. === Coverage === Due to the lack of coverage of the historical facility, many residents of the area are unaware of its history as an internment camp for Europeans trying to escape imprisonment during WWII. When asked about the history of the station, Border Patrol Agent Robert Rivet stated, \\"We've always been told here that the facility was used as an embarkation facility. The immigrant ships would come up the river, and pull over dockside. And the inspectors would go out and look for diseases on board the vessels and all for quarantine purposes. As far as some sort of camp, I've never heard that story.\\" ==References== Category:World War II internment camps in the United States Category:History of New Orleans ","title":"Camp Algiers"},{"id":"61288377","text":"Harry George Thomas Groves (1918-1997) was a male boxer who competed for England. ==Boxing career== Groves represented England and won a gold medal in the 60 kg division at the 1938 British Empire Games in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. ==Personal life== He was a brewers drayman by trade and lived in Condell Road, Battersea during 1938. ==References== Category:1918 births Category:1997 deaths Category:English male boxers Category:Boxers at the 1938 British Empire Games Category:Commonwealth Games medallists in boxing Category:Commonwealth Games gold medallists for England Category:Lightweight boxers ","title":"Harry Groves"},{"id":"61288403","text":"Vivo is an upcoming American computer-animated musical film produced by Columbia Pictures and Sony Pictures Animation.

The party's main goal is to advance policies against LGBT rights, and against what its backers call \\"the destruction of the family\\". ==History== The party's basis is in Rabbi Zvi Thau and his Har Hamor Yeshiva. Rabbi Thau and his followers believe that HaBayit HaYehudi, led by Rabbi Rafi Peretz, and Tkuma, led by Bezalel Smotrich, have not sufficiently advanced Jewish values ‚Äì particularly in the realm of opposition to LGBT rights, protection of the Shabbat as a day of rest, and the protection of the Orthodox conversion process. Following Rabbi Thau's disappointment with the parties of the Union of the Right-Wing Parties, he and his followers decided to form the Noam party. While Rabbi Thau is the party's spiritual leader, Rabbi Dror Aryeh is the political leader of the party. Another student of Thau that is involved in the creation of the party is Rabbi Shlomo Aviner. He said that: \\"The party will fight against the destruction of the family, against the destruction of conversion, against the destruction of Shabbat, against the destruction of the Western Wall, and against the use of deviant content in the IDF and the Education Ministry.\\" The Noam party was reported to be in talks with the Otzma Yehudit party, which split recently from the United Right, for a possible joint run. In 2015, Otzma Yehudit allied itself with the Yachad party of former Shas chief Eli Yishai, running on a joint ticket for the 2015 Israeli legislative election. Rabbi Thau endorsed the joint ticket, marking the first time the Har Hamor dean had explicitly endorsed a political party. On 28 July, Noam and Otzma Yehudit agreed to run on a joint list for the September 2019 Israeli legislative election. The agreement between Noam and Otzma Yehudit was dissolved on 1 August because Noam disagreed with Otzma having secular Jewish candidates. Noam filed its list independently of any other party, though it withdrew from the race on 15 September. ==Controversy== The party released a homophobic video under the comment: \\"An entire country is going through conversion therapy. The time has come to stop it.\\" In the video, a mother, father, and son go to vote on election day in September, and the family is \\"bombarded\\" with LGBT and Reform imagery. Once they reach the voting booth, the mother writes on her voting slip, \\"Let my son marry a woman\\", while the father writes, \\"Let my grandson be Jewish\\". The video was removed by YouTube for violating its terms of use. ==ReferencesCategory:Political parties in Israel Category:Religious Zionist political parties in Israel Category:Orthodox Jewish political parties Category:Chardal Category:Conservative parties in Israel Category:Social conservative parties Category:Far-right political parties in Israel Category:2019 establishments in Israel Category:Political parties established in 2019 Category:Organizations that oppose LGBT rights ","title":"Noam (political party)"},{"id":"61288464","text":"Balu Balachandran is a Distinguished Fellow and the Group Leader for the Ceramics and Covetic Materials group in the Applied Materials Division at Argonne National Laboratory, Chicago, USA. == Education == He received his Bachelor of Engineering (BE) degree in Metallurgical Engineering in 1975 from National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli, a premier technical university in India.

Receive this name for being close to the acting area of Dom Bosco Social Work. ==History== Platform of the station. Sign of the station name. In mid-1987, S√£o Paulo Metro hired a study for the expansion of East-West Line from Itaquera to Guaianazes. Besides the studies didn't recommend the extension of the line, because of risk of collapse caused by overcrowding, Qu√©rcia administration started the construction of the branch (called East Extension) on November 1987. The construction included P√™ssego, Jos√© Bonif√°cio and Guaianazes stations and were made by constructor Andrade Gutierrez. Shortly after, the construction were put on hold by Metro for lack of BNDES financing, which claimed for Metro debt in the paying of other financings. The work of East Extension continued in a slow way, though the conclusion was scheduled to 1991, and with constant paralyzations until being totally put on hold in 1992 during Fleury administration. Meanwhile, Metro hired architects Jo√£o and Odil√©a Toscano do project the new station. Named P√™ssego, because of the proximity with the homonymous brook, the station project predicted the massive use of steel and glass. The structure, of 2 levels connected by stairs and elevators, formed a cross where north and south branches were formed by accesses, linear bus terminal, mezzanine and ticket offices and the east and west branched is where the platforms were located. The project of P√™ssego station received the Great Prize in 4th Architecture International Biennual, in 1999. In 1995, during Covas administration, S√£o Paulo Government renegotiated the construction contracts. P√™ssego station construction was resumed by constructor Constran, with the work supervision transferred from the Metro to the CPTM. On 25 May 2000, the station, renamed to Dom Bosco, was opened and integrated to the CPTM network. ==Toponymy== Toponymic studies coordinated by Metro in the end of 1980s concluded that the new station show be named P√™ssego, for crossing the old Peach Road. Until 1998, the name P√™ssego was used to call the station. In 1998, State Deputies Walter Feldman (PSDB), Roberto Gouveia (PT), Ricardo Tripoli (PSDB) and Vitor Sapienza (PMDB) elaborated projects and indication to rename P√™ssego station to Dom Bosco, with the reason to pay tribute to Dom Bosco Social Work, and get votes from the local catholic community. Feldmans project (338/1998) was approved and became State Law 10,427/99. ==References== Category:CPTM stations Category:Railway stations opened in 2000 Category:2000 establishments in Brazil ","title":"Dom Bosco (CPTM)"},{"id":"61288490","text":"Alfred Harper (born 1915) was a male boxer who competed for England. ==Boxing career== Harper represented England in the 57 kg division at the 1938 British Empire Games in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. ==Personal life== He was a mechanic by trade and lived in Ingleby Street, Spring Hill, Birmingham during 1938. ==References== Category:1915 births Category:English male boxers Category:Boxers at the 1938 British Empire Games Category:Possibly living people Category:Featherweight boxers ","title":"Alfred Harper"},{"id":"61288506","text":"The Land Rover Defender is a four-wheel drive off-road SUV from British automotive company Jaguar Land Rover. The car was launched on 10 September 2019 at the Frankfurt Motor Show. It is significant for being the first all- new version of the Defender, breaking the engineering lineage with its predecessor, a descendant of the original Series Land Rovers of 1948. This modern monococque 4x4 is aimed at a more upmarket sector than its predecessor, leaving a gap in the market for those still wanting a more rugged utilitarian vehicle.Land Rover's sensitivity in this matter led them to litigate against Ineos, claiming that the Grenadier's visual similarity to the old Defender was a breach of the company's intellectual property rights.Allan, Lawrence (10 August 2020). \\"Jaguar Land Rover's trademark court case: testimonies revealed\\".

Abdullahi Yusuf Irro once commanded the 60th. Under the leadership of General Abdullah Mohamed Fadil, Abdullahi Ahmed Irro and other senior Somali military officials formulated a plan of attack for what was to become the Ogaden War in Ethiopia. At the start of the offensive, the SNA consisted of 35,000 soldiers,Gebru Tareke, \\"The Ethiopia-Somalia War\\", p. 638. and was vastly outnumbered by the Ethiopian forces. Somali troops seized the Godey Front on 24 July 1977, after Division 60 defeated the Ethiopian 4th Infantry Division. Godey's capture allowed the Somali side to consolidate its hold on the Ogaden, concentrate its forces, and advance further to other regions of Ethiopia.Gebru Tareke, \\"From Lash to Red Star: The Pitfalls of Counter-Insurgency in Ethiopia, 1980‚Äì82\\", Journal of Modern African Studies , 40 (2002), p. 471 The invasion reached an abrupt end with the Soviet Union's sudden shift of support to Ethiopia, followed by almost the entire communist bloc siding with the latter. The Soviets halted supplies to Barre's regime and instead increased the distribution of aid, weapons, and training to Ethiopia's newly communist Derg regime. By 1978, the Somali forces were pushed out of most of the Ogaden, although it would take nearly three more years for the Ethiopian Army to gain full control of Godey. Division 60 then dissolved amid the first phase of the Somali Civil War. It was reestablished on 1 July 2013. From that time, it supervised Brigade 7 centered on Baidoa; Brigade 8 at Huddur in Bakool; and Brigade 9 in Gedo, with divisional headquarters in Baidoa.

In 1971 he founded the in Paris as a \\"centre for care and support for addictive practices\\". Because of this, and because he published extensively, he became well known, attracting the media soubriquet \\"le psy des toxicos\\" (loosely, \\"shrink to the addicts\\"). ==LifeProvenance and early years=== Claude Olievenstein was born in Berlin five months after Adolf Hitler took power. According to several sources his parents worked in tailoring. Elsewhere Maurice Olievensztein, his father, is described as a company sales director (\\"Directeur commercial de soci√©t√©\\"). He himself rarely mentioned of his Jewish early childhood in Berlin. He did write of one important experience, however. One evening Claude and his elder brother Armand accompanied their grandfather to the circus. A Nazi thug whom they encountered presumably realised that they were Jewish and hit the old man, pushing him to the ground: \\"I saw him sprawling on his hands and feet, and even today I feel an unbelievable surge in hatred [at the thought if it]. My grandfather, who was a proud man, stood up without saying a word, dusted off his hat, and took our hands ... the humiliation was experienced [by him] as a complete global collapse. He had the reaction which, twenty years later, would be mine.\\" ===Armand=== Claude Olievenstein's elder brother, (1931-2006) also became a psychiatrist. But he is better remembered as a prolific poet. After they moved to France. Armand married and changed his family name to one that sounded more French. Claude Olievenstein did not do this. Because Armand's marriage to Marie Landau was fruitful, Claude Olievenstein also became uncle to the left-wing businessman and controversialist . ===Student years=== Although the shoah unfolded in all its horror only during the early 1940s, long before that it was already clear that the situation in Germany was only going to get worse, especially for Jews. Towards the end of the 1930s the Olievensteins escaped to France. By 1942 the French puppet government was beginning to round up Jews in the southern half of France, where most had congregated to get away from occupied northern France (Approximately 50% of the Jews in Metropolitan France were by this time refugees from Germany or from territories recently over-run by German forces.) For those gathered up, deportation to death camps in Germany followed. The Olievensteins, however, having avoided extermination by escaping from Germany to France, now avoided extermination a second time when they refused to comply with the government requirement that Jews should identify themselves by always wearing a Yellow star where it could be seen. Following a childhood which taught him to conceal his Jewish provenance, after the nightmare ended Claude Olievenstein's family settled in Paris, city which he would quickly come to love: \\"Now we had our place in the world. We had the right to be ourselves, the 'Jewish problem' had ceased to exist\\". It was in Paris that Claude Olievenstein undertook his studies in Psychiatry. As a young man be briefly joined the Young Communists, but was in the end excluded. He became one of the leaders of the Union of French Jewish students: his Jewish identity was always very important to him. Part of Olievenstein's training was undertaken at the Charenton asylum near the Bois de Vincennes park, where he studied under the internationally renowned neuropsychiatrist Dr. Henri Baruk (1897-1999). Many of Baruk's ideas were at the time outside the medical mainstream: he was passionately opposed to the use of antipsychotic drugs, and indeed forbade their use in the cases under his charge. That was followed by a couple of internships. In 1965, as an internee at the hospital in Villejuif, he rebelled against the system of institutionalised asylums which, he said, simply created dependency in patients and did nothing to cure them. Olievenstein was far from alone in voicing these concerns, which were also being raised by the charismatic philosopher turned psychologist Michel Foucault. In 1967 Olievenstein visited California and was evidently influenced by the \\"Summer of Love\\" ideas then circulating on the American west coast. The next year, when the time came to defend his doctoral thesis, his chosen subject was LSD. His researches involved becoming sensitised to the issues surrounding drug addiction. They may also have involved experimenting with he fashionable (but illegal) recreational drugs of the time, but sources are evasive on the point. After that he began to find himself sought out as a possible source of confidential advice, first by drug users and, later, by relevant public authorities. ===Physician=== With drug dependency rising up the public agenda during the 1960s and 1970s, Olievenstein's subject choice for his dissertation was timely. He was one of the first French psychiatrists to focus on the treatment of drugs dependency. In pursuit of this, in 1971 he founded the Marmottan Medical Centre in Paris as a \\"centre for care and support for [non-alcoholic] addictive practices\\". (Alcoholism was a long- standing issue that was already more extensively catered for by the medial establishment.) Marmottan became an international benchmark facility, training a number of specialists who subsequently themselves became leaders in the field of addiction treatment He advocated a form of care that saw admission to the institution not as the solution to addiction problems, but as the opportunity to start a Psychotherapeutic treatment programm inspired by Psychoanalysis, which at that time was still a widely respected therapeutic device. En √©crivant ces lignes provocatrices, il savait pourtant qu'il avait d√©j√† choisi son camp : celui des victimes, et non pas celui des bourreaux. Opposition to Marmottan came not just from local residents. There were still many in the mainstream medical community who believed that enforced very rapid weaning off addictive drugs was the only effective treatment. During the 1970s Olievenstein wrote up and published his researches and findings. One book which found a wider audience was published in 1977 under the title \\"Il n'y a pas de drogu√©s heureux\\" (\\"There are no happy drug addicts\\"). The opening line was almost as arresting as the title: \\"I could have been a little Nazi if I hadn't also been a little Jew\\". The book became a best seller. Before the scourge of HIV/AIDS was identified, Olievenstein vigorously opposed Methadone treatments and the perceived dogmatism of one or two \\"therapy lobbies\\". Instead he teamed up with Joseph Engelmajer to set up in the south (near Toulouse) Le Patriarche, an association committed to \\"rehabilitating drug users in a communitarian environment\\". The approach became popular nable during the 1970s and 1980s, but as fashions in medicine moved on Le Patriarche fell from favour, identified in a 1995 government report as one of several \\"sects\\" that had emerged to support drug addicts. He also opposed the unregulated sale of syringes (although he was quick to change his position once the role of shared syringes in connection with the AIDS epidemic emerged). Claude Olievenstein believed there was a sense in which \\"therapeutic communities\\" under the direction of non-professionals were simply an alternative form of alienation. He shifted his position in 1984, responding to the AIDS crisis, becoming an advocate for the (still tightly regulated) decriminalisation of Cannabis use. But he continued to speak out against the alleged benefits of Methadone treatment. He was also critical of Methadone substitutes, notably \\"Subutex\\" (Bupr√©norphine) on account of addictive properties that could very readily make it a \\"treatment for a lifetime\\". In 1987 Claude Olievenstein accepted an appointment as associate professor of Anthropology at the University of Lyon. Here he conducted a seminar course on the excluded and marginalised. His 1999 book \\"Naissance de la Veillillesse\\" (\\"Birth of Old Age\\") concerns his Parkinson's diagnosis. The condition progressed relatively rapidly, obliging Claude Olievenstein to retire in June 2001. Faced with a rapid physical decline, he soon disappeared from public life. Claude Olievenstein died in Paris on Sunday 14 December 2008. == Output (selection) NotesReferences== Category:People from Berlin Category:Physicians from Paris Category:Jewish emigrants from Nazi Germany to France Category:French psychiatrists Category:20th-century French physicians Category:French psychoanalysts Category:Deaths from Parkinson's disease Category:1933 births Category:2008 deaths ","title":"Claude Olievenstein"},{"id":"61288592","text":"Aleksandr Akhyun (born 24 June 1892, date of death unknown) was a Russian gymnast.

After a storm (portrayed in the overture), various people disembark from a ship that has landed at Dover (\\"To Albion's genius raise the strain\\"). Among them are Lady Elinor and her friend Cicely. Elinor is distraught: Her father wants her to marry the Baron of Oakland, although she is in love with Sir Palamede. With her attendants, Lady Elinor goes to warm herself in a nearby cottage owned by Maud. Lord William also disembarks and, in speaking to his servant Lewis, reveals that he is in disguise as Sir Palamede. He was on the same ship at Lady Elinor but avoided her, knowing that she is promised to the Baron of Oakland. In love with her, he laments his fate (\\"From Hope's fond dream tho' Reason wake\\"). *Scene II: The inside of Maud's cottage. Inside the cottage Lord William (who everyone thinks is Sir Palamede) takes Lady Elinor by surprise and explains he was on the same ship as her. She laments their predicament (\\"Tho' pity I cannot deny\\") as she exits. Maud appears and offers her grandson Martin to lead Sir Palamede (really Lord William) to the Baron of Oakland. Maud knew the current Baron before he appropriated his title when he was just Edmund the ploughman. Maud relates that Edmund achieved his position because the previous baron, Lord William, was banished (with his son) due to rumor of a plot to take the life of William the Conqueror. On his deathbed, the accuser declared Lord William innocent. Thus Sir Palamede (really Lord William) has come to reclaim his estate. Cicely observes the mysteriousness of Palamede's presence and remarks on the differences between women and men (\\"Nature to woman still so kind\\"). *Scene III: A Rural Prospect---A Cottage Robert, a servant to the Baron of Oakland, enters accompanied by his huntsmen \\"Hark! the sweet horn proclaims afar\\"). He inquires of Edward's health, but Edward is distracted by seeing Adela through a window, whom he loves. He alludes to a secret that involves the Haunted Tower on Oakland Castle. The Baron of Oakland enters, boasting of his pride and that he is known as the terror of the neighbourhood. The Baron reminds his son Edward that the Lord de Courcy's daughter will make an appropriate wife, although Edward appears disinterested. After the Baron leaves Edward goes to Adela's cottage, knocks, then hides himself. Adela opens the door, wondering who knocked (\\"Whither, my love! ah! whither art thou gone!\\"). Edward then reveals himself. In dialogue with Adela, Edward states that his father does not act like a true baron and that he himself has not been swayed by the presumed rise in station. Adela and Edward sing of their mutual affection (\\"Will great lords and ladies\\"). *Scene IV: A Field De Courcy, accompanied by his attendantes, wonders whether his sister Lady Elinor was on the ship that recently docked. A servant Charles replies that she is headed toward the Baron of Oakland and that \\"Sir Palamede\\" is with her. This distresses De Courcy who asks Charles to gain as much intelligence as he can in order to avenge his family. Left alone, Charles proclaims that he will spy out of duty, but prefers to rejoin the woman he left behind in France (\\"My native land I bade adieu\\"). *Scene V: The inside of Maud's Cottage Lady Elinor tells Lord William (who she still believes is Sir Palamede) that she does not want to marry the Baron of Oakland. Not wanting to disobey her father, she will delay the marriage as long as possible. Cicely has a plan to go to the Baron as Lady Elinor's attendant until her father communicates with her. The three commiserate (\\"Against the shaft of cruel fate\\"). Act II *Scene I: An Apartment in the Castle The servant Hugo reveals to Robert that he's served in the Oakland Castle long enough to witness three heads of the estate. In preparation for the wedding, Robert asks Hugo whether he's ever seen Lady Elinor. Hugo has not, but knows that she's beautiful, and leaves. Robert fetches Adela who is nervous pretending that she is Lady Elinor. Left alone, Adela knows she needs more confidence to pass as Lady Elinor (\\"Be mine, tender passion, soother of care\\"). Robert returns with the Baron of Oakland who assumes he is meeting Lady Elinor. A moment of embarrassment ensues until the Baron, frustrated that he does not have a prepared speech, is able to speak haltingly a few awkward words to Lady Elinor (who is really Adela). Unlike the Baron's, Adela is well well-spoken. She makes numerous allusions to people who pretend to be whom they are not which frustrates and embarrasses the Baron. Edward enters and the Baron asks him to speak to Lady Elinor appropriately. Edward, also in on Adela's disguise, acts familiarly with Adela. His forthrightness surprises the Baron. *Scene II: A view near the Castle Outside of Oakland Castle, Sir Palamede (really Lord William) tells Lady Elinor to keep up the disguise. Not realizing that Sir Palamede is Lord William, Lady Elinor rhetorically asks whether Palamede recommends disguise (\\"Hush, hush; such counsels do not give\\"). Cicely arrives, followed by the Baron of Oakland. Wanting to know who are the two, Cicely tells the Baron that Lady Elinor is Lady Elinor's lady-in-waiting, and that Lord William is Sir Palamede, a jester. The Baron does not think much of the occupation of jester, but Lord William responds that \\"satire well applied, is the medicine of the mind\\" and sings a song underscoring that adage (\\"Tho' time has from your lordship's face\\"). Brushing off slights to his reputation, the Baron asks why are Lady Elinor'servants outside the castle when Lady Elinor is inside the castle. Realizing that someone is impersonating Lady Elinor, the group chooses to maintain their disguises. Lewis, a servant to Lord William (who is aware of his disguise), enters with letters for the Lord. As Lord William and Lady Elinor exit, Lewis remarks on their mutual love and suggests to Cicely they too could partake of such mutual affection. But Cicely responds that she is too independent to get married (\\"What blest hours, untainted by sorrow\\"). *Scene III: An Apartment in the Castle. Edward is preparing for the wedding (\\"Now all in preparation\\"). Adela enters and the two engage in bantering and arguing until Robert enters. Edward changes his mood from one of argument to the upcoming wedding (\\"While swords and shields are clashing\\"). *Scene IV: An Antique Hall, a State Chair; several People discovered, Tenants, Servants, etc. Lord William and Lady Elinor verify among Cicely, Charles and Lewis that their disguises are still holding. Adela, Edward and Robert enter and the group sings a sextet extolling love (\\"By mutual love delighted\\"). The Baron enters and begins a speech but stumbles over the words. He is called away, while the group concludes the sextet. *Scene V: A Room in the Castle De Courcy mentions to Baron of Oakland that his sister (Lady Elinor), who the baron is supposed to marry, is in love with Sir Palamede. The Baron recognizes that something must be done. *Scene VI: The kitchen, tenants and servants discovered at different tables---at the upper end an Ox, roasting, coos, etc. basting it. Robert extols the food being prepared for the wedding (\\"Now mighty roast beef is the Englishman's food\\"). Lord William, Lady Elinor, and Cicely enter and the ensemble closes the act extoling love (\\"Love's sweet voice to Hymen speaking\\"). Act III *Scene I: A Room in the Castle. In dialogue with Charles, De Courcy reveals that he has surrounded Oakland Castle to prevent Sir Palamede from leaving, although he expresses a doubt about Palamede's guilt. Charles ruminates on honour (\\"Where'er true valour can its power display\\"). The Baron of Oakland re-enters with De Courcy, plotting to capture Sir Palamede. They have heard the villagers have been taking up arms and, noting the frequency of messages Sir Palamede has been sending and receiving, assume that he is fomenting a potential uprising. Edward enters, somewhat intoxicated, and says he is to marry Lady Elinor, who prefers ale to wine. Adela enters (still disguised as Lady Elinor) and although Edward keeps up the charade, De Courcy immediately recognizes that the woman is not his sister. He leaves the Baron, who also leaves but not before puzzling whether he should be insulted or not. Left along, Edward banters with Adela who affirms her love for him (\\"Love from the heart, all its danger concealing\\"). *Scene II: The Sea at the back of the stage and a light-house; a part of the Tower is seen, the cellar door by the second wing; a little further, a flight of stairs leading to a door; stage lights down Lady Elinor enters, followed by Lord William (whom she still thinks is Sir Palamede). She worries that something is about to happen but Lord William tries to reassure her (\\"Dangers unknown impending\\"). She leaves and Hugo enters, happy to see his master Lord William after a long time. Lord William assures Hugo that confirmation from the King of England is on the way that he is the rightful heir of Oakland Castle. He has followers who are prepared to overtake the castle at the right time. Hugo reveals to William that his late father's armour has been left in a specific room, but that no one has entered the room since his death. He relates that there have been noises coming from the room. Just then a light appears and a noise is heard from the room. William goes to find who's there while. As Hugo leaves he's seen by the Baron of Oakland who surmises that Hugo is part of Sir Palamede's plot. He leaves as Robert and Martin enter, intoxicated from having raided the wine cellar. They leave in search of Lewis. *Scene III: A Room in the Castle. With Cicely present, Lady Elinor worries about Sir Palamede's fate (\\"Dread parent of despair\\"). Cicely responds that, while high birth is an advantage, there are also advantages to not having such a station (\\"From high birth and all its fetters\\"). Adela and Robert enter, and Lady Elinor, still pretending to be her own lady-in-waiting, pester Adela (who is pretending to be Lady Elinor) to see if her needs are met (\\"Begone; I discharge you! away from my sight!\\"). *Scene IV: A chamber in the Tower, folding doors in the back Scene, and arch leading to another apartment, thro' which enter Lord William Upon entering the chamber in the tower, Lord William discovers his father's armour and invokes his assistance (\\"Spirit of my sainted sire\\"). He hides within the room as Lewis, Robert and Martin enter and set about drinking (\\"As now we're met, a jolly set\\"). As they sing they hear their voice echoing (really Lord William behind a screen). Their revelry is interrupted by Baron of Oakland who berates them for drinking. He asks them whether they've seen evidence of the haunted presence and Robert affirms they have. He sings a line and they hear the echo. When the tower bell tolls, Lord William emerges from behind the screen, dressed in his father's armour. The Baron immediately recognizes the elder Baron of Oakland and is scared. Lewis declares that armed men are fighting. The Baron leaves to investigate. *Scene V: An Apartment in the Castle, drums and trumpets without. Adela and Edward speak of the misery of portraying upper class. The Baron enters, warning of the fighting but avoiding it. Lady Elinor (who the Baron still thinks is a lady-in-waiting) shames the Baron for not fighting and asks the whereabouts of her brother, before leaving. The Baron is puzzled by the reference but Adela clarifies that the lady-in-waiting is really Lady Elinor. A servant enters warning that the castle gates are being breached. The Baron suspects he'll die of fright before he dies by the sword. *Scene VI: Changes to the Hall, after alarms of drums and trumpets. Edward and Adela fear that they will be casualties of the fighting. De Courcy enters, congratulating Lord William and his knights; apparently all disguises have been revealed. They are followed by Lady Elinor, Cicely and Charles. De Courcy presents Lord William to Lady Elinor, saying that he is the person their father contracted her to marry. Two men enter restraining the Baron who now recognizes the deception but pleads for clemency. Lord William responds that he wants the Baron's friendship. He wishes success to Adela and Edward (who are thankful they no longer have to pretend). All sing for happy times (\\"The banished ills of heretofore\\"). ==Songs== Act I *To Albion's genius raise the strain ‚Äî Chorus *From Hope's fond dream tho' Reason wake ‚Äî Lord William *Tho' pity I cannot deny (composed by Pleyel) - Lady Elinor *Nature to woman still so kind (Welsh tune) ‚Äî Cicely *Whither, my love! ah! whither art thou gone!

He entered the S√£o Jo√£o Maria Vianey Seminary in Palmas in 1977, and then studied philosophy in the Faculty of Philosophy of Palmas and theology at the Instituto Teologico Santa Catarina in Florian√≥polis. He spent the years 1995 to 1997 obtaining a licentiate in sacred liturgy from the Pontifical Atheneum of St. Anselm in Rome. He was ordained a priest of the Diocese of Palmas‚ÄìFrancisco Beltr√£o on 9 February 1991 by Bishop Agostinho Jos√© Sartori.

On 14 June 2017, Pope Francis appointed him Archbishop of Londrina. Geremias was installed there 12 August 2017. When asked about the Londrina clergy's tradition of political engagement, he said the Church cannot avoid political issues and added: \\"I believe that the Church is an opinion-maker and should rather contribute to a better policy. We must promote politics without being partisans.\\" In 2019 he was elected to a three-year term as president of the South Region 2 of the CNBB, effective 10 May. He is also a member of its Permanent Council and of its Commissions for Liturgy, for Migrants, and for the Earth. In January 2018, his diocese hosted the Inter-Church Conference of Base Ecclesial Communities (BCEs). He stressed the need to balance the movement's drive for social transformation with a need to \\"act calmly, with much serenity\\" so as to avoid creating the impression of political partisanship. He said: \\"We have to be very careful in that dialogue with society.\\" Conservative activists criticized Steinmetz, citing the display of partisan political party banners at the BCE meeting, and in July 2019 a business trade group protested a diocesan statement detailing how the government's proposed pension reform will hurt workers.

Hingson developed multiple medical devices, including the jet injector for inoculations. He founded the Brother's Brother Foundation, an organization which provides vaccinations and medical assistance to impoverished regions. His awards include the Labat Award from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and the President's Volunteer Action Award. ==Early life== Robert Andrew Hingson was born on April 13, 1913 in Anniston, Alabama to Eloree Elizabeth Haynes Hingson and Robert Andrew Hingson. Hingson demonstrated a concern for suffering at an early age. Because of this, his parents encouraged him to go into the ministry. Instead, he decided to be a physician. ==Medical career== After receiving his medical degree from the Emory University School of Medicine in 1938, Hingson interned at the U.S. Marine Hospital on Staten Island, New York in 1938, and joined the United States Coast Guard as chief medical officer aboard several ships. While serving in the Atlantic, Hingson treated U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau, Jr. who was suffering from an intense migraine, ‚Äúblind from pain and on the verge of collapse.‚Äù As thanks, Morgenthau secured Hingson a position at the Mayo Clinic from 1939-1941. After World War II, he was the first professor of anesthesiology at the University of Tennessee College of Medicine. In 1948, he became a professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. In 1968 when the University of Pittsburgh offered him an appointment at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, together with the University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine, and the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health. At the same time, he was made the Chief of Anesthesiology at Magee- Womens Hospital. ==Inventions and innovations== Known as a ‚Äútinkerer‚Äù among friends, Hingson developed several important medical devices such as the Western Reserve Anesthesia Machine, Oxygen Inhalator, and Resuscitator. With the help of colleague Waldo B. Edwards, he also developed the continuous caudal anesthesia epidural administration to alleviate the pain of childbirth. In 1938, Hingson developed a painless method of inoculating patients. Known as the jet injector this was perhaps his greatest contribution to medicine. The discovery was quite accidental. A sailor came to his hospital in Staten Island with a swollen hand. When Hingson examined the patient, he found that his hand was engorged with crude oil. Finding no entry wound, Hingson deduced that a high-pressure oil hose aboard the seaman‚Äôs vessel had developed a minute leak. A high-pressure jet of oil had then painlessly perforated the man‚Äôs thumb and filled his hand with oil. A fortuitous accident, Hingson not only healed the seaman but began research on a high-pressure injection system for medical use. Before Hingson‚Äôs innovation, inoculation as preventive medicine in underdeveloped countries was time-consuming, but with the jet injector, inoculations could be administered at a rate of 1,000 patients per hour. The efficacy of the mass inoculation technology was astonishing. For instance, in 1958, smallpox claimed 150 million victims worldwide. A mere decade later, there were only 65,000 cases. Hingson‚Äôs jet injector was also used around the world to inoculate against cholera, influenza, polio, and typhoid. ==Brother's Brother Foundation== In 1958, Hingson began a 100-day, 45,000-mile medical mission. With a team of doctors aboard a large plane, they visited Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East performing operations, administering vaccinations, and delivering medical supplies. Among the mission‚Äôs accomplishments, in Gaza, the team vaccinated every child under the age of four against polio. Following this mission, Hingson formed Brother‚Äôs Keeper; after a Nigerian medical student suggested that, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need a keeper; we need a brother,‚Äù the organization was renamed Brother‚Äôs Brother Foundation. Over time, the organization‚Äôs mission focused specifically on providing vaccinations and other medical assistance to impoverished regions. Dr. Hingson retired from day to day work at the foundation in 1981. ==Awards== Hingson was the recipient of many awards throughout his life. Among them were the Labat Award from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia in 1981 and President Reagan‚Äôs President's Volunteer Action Award in 1987. He was also nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. ==Personal life== Robert Hingson married Gussie Dickson in 1940. The couple had five children, the youngest of which‚ÄîLuke Hingson‚Äîsucceeded Robert as president of Brother‚Äôs Brother Foundation. ==Death== Robert Hingson retired to Ocilla, Georgia in 1984. On October 9, 1996, he died at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Lake City, Florida due to complications of polymyositis. ==References== Category:20th-century American inventors Category:American medical researchers Category:American anesthesiologists Category:1913 births Category:1996 deaths Category:20th- century American physicians ","title":"Robert Andrew Hingson"},{"id":"61288979","text":"La Cueva Historic District, in Mora County, New Mexico near Mora, New Mexico, is a historic district which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

Chilean tugboat Independencia captured a Spanish gunboat who belonged to the frigate Resoluci√≥n. ==EventsBackground=== On 24 September 1865, Spanish Admiral Jos√© Manuel Pareja declared the beginning of hostilities against Chile, establishing the blockade of its ports, given the refusal of this country to accept Spanish demands. This caused the Chilean government to declare war on Spain the next day, in response to Pareja's decision. The Spanish admiral wanted to block the entire Chilean coast with his warships, but due to its extension, he had to confine himself with difficulty to the ports of Caldera, Coquimbo, La Herradura, Valpara√≠so, Tom√© and Talcahuano. In the first days of war, the frigate Resoluci√≥n was entrusted the blockade of the last two mentioned ports, and for the blockade to be effective, it had to patrol the entire bay of Concepci√≥n, due to the small ports that were in the zone. ===Action=== To optimize the blockade of the bay of Concepcion, the Spaniards dispatched from the Resoluci√≥n a 2-gun gunboat. The objective of this gunboat was to prevent the traffic of smaller vessels from Talcahuano to Penco and Tom√©. On 17 November, in front of Tom√©, the Chilean tugboat Independencia approached dangerously to the Spanish gunboat, who immediately began to attack him with his guns. The Chilean ship simulated surrender, turned off the lights and stopped its steam engine. The Spaniards approached and proceeded to board the tugboat to capture it, but at that moment they were surprised by a detachment of at least a hundred Chilean soldiers who were manning the ship. The Spaniards were forced to surrender and the gunboat was captured. Later, the Spanish gunboat was sent by his captors to the port of Constitution. ===Aftermath=== The capture of the Spanish gunboat was mentioned by the Chilean newspaper El Mercurio, in the edition of 25 November 1865 and also in the American newspaper The New York Times, in the number of 1 January 1866. The Spanish newspaper La √âpoca reported the event on 19 January of that year. This event is part of the series of negative results that the Spanish fleet had when blocking Chilean ports. The blockade proved ineffective and added to other war failures, such as the battle of Papudo on 26 November, which led the Spaniards to end the blockade of the ports in early 1866, with the sole exception of Valpara√≠so. ==ReferencesBibliography== * Category:History of South America Category:Naval battles involving Spain Category:Naval battles involving Chile Category:Battles of the Chincha Islands War Category:Conflicts in 1865 Category:1865 in Chile Category:November 1865 events Category:Biob√≠o Region ","title":"Action of 17 November 1865"},{"id":"61289006","text":"Start of the Hanover Grand Prix on August 5, 1920 This list of sport awards is an index to articles about notable medals, prizes, and other awards in the field of sport.

A precursor to the International Football Association Board, the meeting's major purpose was to address inconsistencies between the laws of the various associations, particularly between England and Scotland. Among the changes resulting from the conference were: * the throw-in had to be taken from over the head with two hands (the FA had previously allowed the ball to be thrown in with one hand) * the use of a crossbar was made mandatory (the FA had previously permitted either a tape or a crossbar to be used) * the kickoff had to be kicked forwards (not previously required by the FA) * the award of an automatic goal for handball by an opponent that prevented a goal (adopted by the FA earlier that year) was eliminated * it was no longer possible to be offside from a corner-kick (previously allowed by the FA) * the boundary of the field of play should be marked by a touch line as well as by flags The new laws were used in the international matches of the 1882-83 season (with the exception of the first, England v. Wales, which still used the old rules). They took general effect in the Laws of the Game at the beginning of the 1883-84 season. ==List of delegates== * Francis Marindin (president of the FA, representing England) * William Peirce Dix (vice-president of the FA and treasurer of the Sheffield Football Association, representing England) * John Wallace (member of the Committee of the SFA, representing Scotland) * Thomas Laurie (vice-president of the SFA, representing Scotland) * Llewellyn Kendrick (representing Wales) * W.

A very small community of Jews lives in Angola mostly in the capital city of Luanda with a handful scattered elsewhere of mixed origins and backgrounds. There are also a number of transitory Israeli business people living in Angola. ==Background== Angola is a country in southwestern Africa. From the 15th century, Portuguese colonists began trading there and a settlement was established at Luanda during the 16th century. Portugal annexed territories in the region which were ruled as a colony from 1655, and Angola was incorporated as an overseas province of Portugal in 1951. After the Angolan War of Independence (1961-1974) Angola's independence was achieved on November 11, 1975. ==Middle Ages== Some historians have noted the presence of Sephardi Jews in Portuguese West Africa by researching records from the Portuguese Inquisition relating to the New World. These show that there was a significant Sephardic presence in Angola and Guinea trading posts and that Portuguese settlements were crucial in the development of a Crypto-Jewish diaspora across the Atlantic region. Some historians claim that Paulo Dias de Novais (1510-1589), a grandson of Bartholomew Dias was a \\"Jewish\\" (probably meaning \\"Crypto-Jewish\\" or a Converso of some sort) colonizer who became \\"Lord-Proprietor\\" of Angola in 1571 who brought Jewish artisans to Luanda where a so-called \\"clandestine rabbi\\" was conducting services in a secret Luanda synagogue. By the late eighteenth century more Jews arrived and a community was functioning in Dondo. ===Angola as a center of \\"Judaizers\\"=== Historians record that there are a number of cases of Portuguese New Christians, such as Gaspar de Robles, Manuel Alvarez Pricto, testifying in the Americas that they were introduced to \\"Judaizing\\" by relatives and friends while in Angola, many attesting they were introduced to the \\"Law of Moses\\" in Angola. ==Early Modern history== Mariana Pequena, a black woman from Angola who was exported as a slave to Rio de Janeiro in Brazil in the late seventeenth century, after obtaining her freedom in Brazil, she began a relationship with a white Portuguese New Christian chose to convert to \\"Judaism\\" (perhaps meaning: Crypto-Judaism). In her confession, she revealed the full extent of her network which included many fellow believers. In 1711, being \\"accused of Judaism\\" she was condemned by the Portuguese Inquisition in Lisbon for her beliefs. ==Modern history== There was a suggestion to create a Jewish \\"colony\\" or agricultural settlement in the Portuguese colony of Angola for Russian and Romanian Jews in the early 1900s. There was a prior proposal to set up a Jewish settlement in 1886 by the Alliance Juive Universelle encouraged by the Portuguese Jew S.A. Anahory. These efforts did not come to fruition. Another failed effort was the so- called \\"Angola Plan\\" with attempts from 1907 to 1913 by the Jewish Territorial Organization, under the influence of Israel Zangwill in Britain, to set up an autonomous Jewish entity somewhere in West Africa with Angola as a strong possibility. After 1910, Portugal's new republican leaders proposed Angola for Jewish colonization as both a practical solution to increasing the white population and to win support from liberal Jewish circles. By June 1912 the Portuguese chamber of deputies passed the final version of a bill to authorize concessions to Jewish settlers, clearly indicating Portugal's desire to use Jewish immigration to consolidate its hold over Angola. No financial support was offered and by 1913, many officials of the Jewish Territorial Organization in London turned against it in favor of settling Palestine. Another failed suggestion to settle Jews from Eastern Europe in Angola resurfaced in 1934. In 2014 the Chabad Lubavitch movement opened a Chabad house in Luanda with many Jews in attendance. ===Angola‚ÄìIsrael relations=== Angola‚ÄìIsrael relations refers to the historical and current bilateral relationship between Angola and Israel. Angola has an embassy in Tel Aviv and Israel has an embassy in Luanda. The Israeli government aided the National Front for the Liberation of Angola in 1963 and 1969, during the Angolan War of Independence (1961-1974). In the 1960s, Holden Roberto, head of the NFLA, visited Israel and FNLA members were sent to Israel for training. In the 1970s, Israel shipped arms to the FNLA through Zaire. The Israeli embassy in Luanda was reopened in 1995, and Tamar Golan, who worked to maintain Israeli contacts with African countries throughout these decades, was appointed the Israeli ambassador. Tamar Golan left this post in 2002, but returned to Angola later on upon the request of the Angolan President Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos in order to help establish a task-force, under the auspices of the UN, for the removal of landmines. The Israeli company \\"Geomine\\" provided Angola with mine detecting equipment, in order to facilitate their removal.Israeli technology clears landmines in Angola, by Adam Gonn, Jerusalem Post, 10 August 2010 President Dos Santos visited Israel in 2005. In March 2006, the trade volume between the two countries amounted to $400 million. The Israeli ambassador to Angola is Raphael Singer. In 2010, the Angolan government refused to receive openly gay Isi Yanouka as the new ambassador due to his sexuality. In August 2012, the Angolan chancellor took a three-day visit to Jerusalem, where the governments of Angola and Israel ratified in Tel Aviv an agreement to strengthen the bonds between both countries. Israeli President Shimon Peres said that this should be based on the fields of science and technology, economy, and security, and the Angolan chancellor expressed the desire to continue with the bilateral cooperation in health, agriculture, science and technology, and the formation of Angolan experts. A 2018 report in the Algemeiner Journal: \\"Ambassador: Israel to Invest $60 Million in Angola, Including Solar Power Plant,\\" that Israel allocated $60 million to invest in Angola, including the construction of a solar power plant in the province of Benguela according to an AllAfrica.com report. Ambassador Oren Rosenblat made the announcement after a meeting with Benguela Governor Rui Falc√£o. ===Arcadi Gaydamak=== In a 2006 article titled \\"Luanda Made Him a Billionaire and a Diplomat\\" in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, it was reported that Arcadi Gaydamak was \\"one of the most influential business people in Angola and one of the closest to the corridors of power with ties to president Jose Eduardo dos Santos and dos Santos' daughter businesswoman Isabel dos Santos, generals and high-ranking police officers trace back several years.\\" According to this report the close relationship garnered Gaydamak an Angolan diplomatic passport, as well as French, Canadian, Russian and Israeli citizenship and holding a \\"title\\" in the Angolan embassy in Moscow. Angola turned him into a billionaire estimated at $3 billion in an interview with Haaretz. Flying the new president of the state-owned Russian rough diamond exporter Alrosa to Luanda to introduce him to dos Santos. ===Angolagate=== In October 2009, Arcadi Gaydamak (b. 1952) a Russian Jew from Israel living in France and French magnate Pierre Falcone were convicted by a French court of organizing arms trafficking in Angola during the civil war in 1993‚Äì1998, to the value of US$790 million, in violation of the Lusaka Protocol. Gaydamak was sentenced in absentia, and it was unclear whether he would ever serve the six year prison term, since he returned to Israel where he is known as a generous Israeli philanthropist. His conviction on the arms dealing charges was overturned by the Court of Appeal in Paris on 29 April 2011. ==See also== * Religion in Angola: Judaism * Freedom of religion in Angola * History of the Jews in Southern Africa ==References== Jews Angola Angola Angola History ","title":"History of the Jews in Angola"},{"id":"61289151","text":"Ignace Hellenberg (died 2004) was a French art dealer. ==Early life== Ignace Hellenberg was the son of Sigmund and Betty Hellenberg.https://www.imj.org.il/en/collections/291109 ==Career== Hellenberg was a French art dealer, based in Paris.https://www.imj.org.il/en/collections/291109 ==Death== Hellenberg died in 2004.https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4575482,00.html ==Legacy== In his will, he left more than more than NIS 200 million to the Israeli state to create rehabilitation hospitals for disabled Israel Defense Forces veterans.https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4575482,00.htmlhttps://www.timesofisrael.com/army- opens-new-medical-center-to-treat-masses-of-troops-flocking-south/ In 2017, the Southern Regional Medical Center opened, with about one-third of the NIS 60 million ($16.8 million) expenditure coming from Hellenberg's bequest.https://www.timesofisrael.com/army-opens-new-medical-center-to-treat- masses-of-troops-flocking-south/ Hellenberg donated numerous artworks to the State of Israel.

Her arrest would date back to 7 June, when she last connected to her WhatsApp account. The Iranian Human Rights website Gozaar stated that she had been arrested by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and was being detained at Evin Prison. French authorities stated that Adelkhah was being denied access to consular assistance, and are demanding access to their citizen. In June 2019, Adelkhah's Sciences Po colleague Roland Marchal was also arrested in Iran when he came to visit her. On 7 February 2020, their lawyer said the two had petitioned prison authorities to allow them to get married. Marchal and Adelkhah were reportedly to go on trial on 3 March 2020 but it was postponed due to COVID-19 pandemic in Iran. Marchal was released on 20 March 2020 as part of a prisoner swap, but no verdict was reached on the case of Adelkhah. On 16 May 2020, the 15th Chamber of the Tehran Court sentenced Adelkhah to five years' imprisonment for conspiring against national security, and one year for propaganda against the state. During her trial, she was represented by Iranian lawyer Saeid Dehghan. Although Adelkhah is French- Iranian, Iran does not recognise this dual citizenship, and so continues to deny her access to French consular services. Sciences Po is in contact with the French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs to campaign and raise awareness for Adelkhah's release. == Works == * Ramadan et politique Paris : CNRS √©ditions, 2000. , * Guerre et terre en Afghanistan Aix-en-Provence PUP, Presses Univ. de Provence 2013. , *Dubai, cit√© globale Paris : CNRS, 2001. , * Les mille et une fronti√®res de l'Iran: Quand les voyages forment la nation * El estado del mundo * Un p√©ril islamiste?

If a class was stuck, Wylliams would sing Summertime and tell the students to start moving to it. At question-and-answer sessions following end-of-residencies performances during which Wylliams ‚Äúwowed‚Äù student audiences, he was oftentimes begged to sing Summertime as he had so often done while he taught. ==Career== Wylliams began to pursue dance training at the Denver-based school of Cleo Parker Robinson during his early teens and subsequently advanced to performing in her company ‚Äì Cleo Parker Robinson Dance Ensemble ‚Äì until 1982 when at the invitation of Eleo Pomare, he moved to New York City to appear with Eleo Pomare Dance Company. Ultimately, Pomare set all of his solos on Wylliams - entrusting Wylliams to dance all of the roles he - Pomare - had created and performed for himself. Wylliams, too, danced in the companies of Jos√© Lim√≥n, Pina Bausch, Paul Sanasardo, Donald Byrd, Fred Benjamin, Rod Rodgers, as well as with Netherlands Danse Theatre and Forces of Nature Dance Theatre Company. Wylliams choreographed for ballet and modern dance companies around the world. Among dances he choreographed are Ascension, Baharini, Evidence of Souls Not Seen, In the Rain, Minus Him, Quiet City, Shah Tah Tee and Sweet In the Morning. Wylliams taught in Russia, East Germany, Asia, and throughout the United States. He, too, was a visiting professor of dance at the University of Missouri-Kansas City's Conservatory of Music. In Boston during the late-1980s-into-very-early-1990s, Wylliams was interim-artistic- director of the Danny Sloan Dance Company; was founding artistic director of Wyll/Danse Theatre; collaborated with multi-Emmy-Award-winning-television- producer Barbara Barrow-Murray; appeared with Sarah Caldwell‚Äôs Opera Company of Boston [OCB]; was assistant choreographer to renown-Broadway-choreographer Patricia Birch for the OCB‚Äôs staging of Leonard Bernstein‚Äôs \\"Mass‚Äù, as well as for an OCB engagement at the Bolshoi in Moscow. Leni Wylliams dancing SWEET IN THE MORNING in May 1994 Wylliams was assistant choreographer for Martin, a ballet tribute to Martin Luther King, Jr. with music and libretto by Gordon Parks which premiered in Washington, D.C. during 1989 and was screened on national television on King's birthday in 1990. Wylliams, too, assisted Carmen de Lavallade in choreographing the Metropolitan Opera‚Äôs 1990 staging of Porgy and Bess . Wylliams met Mary Pat Henry while both were guest artists at a festival in Vancouver, BC, Canada. It was there that they both became aware of their remarkably-similar visions of dance and its history. Soon after, Henry relocated to the University of Missouri‚ÄìKansas City to teach at its Conservatory of Music and then beckoned Wylliams to move there too. During 1991, the two of them founded Wylliams/Henry Danse Theatre [WHDT] and were its co-artistic-directors. In 1992, Wylliams choreographed what was to become his signature solo - Sweet In The Morning'' \\\\- with vocals by Bobby McFerrin. Wylliams performed his Sweet In The Morning during ‚ÄúMasters Night‚Äù on Wednesday, July 3 at the 1996 National Black Arts Festival [NBAF] in Atlanta, GA. That signature solo danced by Wylliams was shown along with a select array of presentations by other NBAF performance artists in a televised documentary of the festival - Ark of the Spirit with Avery Brooks - produced by. Turner Broadcasting System Just over two months later, the life and career of Wylliams came to a gruesome end. ==Murder== During the morning of Friday, September 13, 1996, Wylliams was found slain ‚Äì bludgeoned, doused with a flammable, and set on fire ‚Äì inside the bedroom of his Benton Boulevard, Kansas City home. The Jackson County medical examiner's office determined Wylliams had died of blunt trauma and smoke inhalation. On September 17, 1996, suspect Timothy O. Evans - 26 years old - was apprehended and charged with first-degree murder and armed criminal action. Evans‚Äô fingerprints had been found on Wylliams‚Äô car, on the front door of his home, and on the 10-pound steel dumbbell used in the bludgeoning. Wylliams‚Äô blood was found on shoes and clothing belonging to Evans. Prior to his encounter with Wylliams, Evans had told acquaintances he was going out to ‚Äújack‚Äù [rob] someone. December 11, 1997, Evans was found guilty of first-degree murder, first-degree arson and armed criminal action. On January 30, 1998, he was given a life sentence in the beating death, a life sentence for armed criminal action, plus 15 years for first-degree arson. Wylliams was survived by his mother Allice Ollie; his stepfather Esau Ollie; his sisters Kimberly M., Dana Y. and Rebecca D. Williams - all of Denver, CO; plus by his father Harold Williams Jr. of Harrisburg, PA, and his paternal-grandmother Mattie L. Faulkner of Coraopolis, PA. ==Wylliams/Henry Danse Theatre== The company built by co-artistic- directors Leni Wyllaims and Mary Pat Henry changed the face of dance in the Midwest. Wylliams/Henry Danse Theatre - now known as Wylliams/Henry Contemporary Dance Company - continues to present with a range of more than 100 works that is as broad as any company in America. It's known for its beautiful, athletic style. and its presentation of powerful, uplifting works from a rich archive of American modern dance.

The author of innovative manuals dedicated to the teaching of history and geography, she, together with , developed the educational \\"recipe\\" that they called \\"enthusiastic observation\\". They also worked to change the androcentric canon of geographical studies to include women. She lived in exile during the Francoist Spain era, forming part of the intellectual elite that carried out educational, philological, literary, legal, and cultural work. Her family had close connections to that of poet Federico Garc√≠a Lorca. ==Biography== Gloria Giner de los R√≠os Garc√≠a was born in Madrid on 28 March 1886. The daughter of and , she spent her childhood and adolescence in Madrid, Alicante, and Barcelona, cities where her father held the Chair of Philosophy. After finishing high school in 1906 and teaching in 1908, she completed her training by attending classes at the Instituci√≥n Libre de Ense√±anza and taking courses in art, pedagogy, and philosophy. In 1909, she was promoted to the . ===Marriage, family, and social life=== On 1 July 1912, Giner married Fernando de los R√≠os, who had obtained the Chair of Law at the University of Granada. It was in this city that the couple took up residence, and in which Gloria was a teacher at the Normal School, by right of consort at first, and later in her own position. A year later, their daughter was born. In Granada, the R√≠os Giner family became friends with the Garc√≠a Lorca family, with Manuel de Falla, and with Berta Wilhelmi and her husband Eduardo Dom√≠nguez. Wilhelmi had been in contact with the Instituci√≥n Libre de Ense√±anza and had organized some community schools in Almu√±√©car. With her collaboration, Giner organized the education of her daughter Laura and other children, including , in order to separate them from Granada's private education system. ===Laura de los R√≠os and Isabel Garc√≠a Lorca=== Federico Garc√≠a Lorca was one of the select circle of friends of the R√≠os family. He dedicated the poem Romance son√°mbulo to Fernando and Gloria, and was the one who introduced their daughters, Laura de los R√≠os and Isabel Garc√≠a Lorca. The friendship between the latter was very intense and lasting. They became sisters-in-law when Laura married Federico's younger brother . In an interview, Isabel Garcia Lorca recalled: Laura, in another interview, told of her mother's life in Granada: ==Professional career== In 1931, the Provisional Government of the Republic appointed her husband Minister of Justice, and in December, Minister of Public Instruction. Giner told her daughter, \\"I'm not going to give up my career and live as a minister.\\" Nonetheless she performed some ceremonial functions and accompanied her husband on trips through Spain. In 1932 she was on leave as a teacher at the Normal School, but continued teaching at the Instituci√≥n Libre de Ense√±anza. In 1933, after her husband resigned from government office, she rejoined teaching by accepting a position in Zamora. For three courses she lived alone in a hotel room three days a week, returning to Madrid for the rest of the week. In Zamora, as in Granada, society shunned her for being the wife of a socialist and not attending religious services. ==Exile== At the end of September 1936, Fernando de los R√≠os was appointed ambassador of Spain to the United States, a position he held until March 1939. Gloria Giner moved to Washington, D.C. with her daughter, her mother, and a nephew of her husband. Fernanda Urruti, Fernando's mother, would later join them. In Washington, Giner was invited to several meetings that Eleanor Roosevelt organized in the White House. During the Civil War, Fernando de los R√≠os was separated from his professorship at the University of Madrid. In 1939, the Franco government definitively separated him from his chair and dismissed him. Fernando de los R√≠os taught at The New School for Social Research in New York, an institution founded to welcome European intellectuals who emigrated for political reasons. Giner was a professor at Columbia University. The R√≠os-Giner family lived in exile in the United States, which did not recognize Spanish Republican exiles and subjected those who wanted to enter to immigration laws. However, university students and artists were exempt from the rigid immigration quota, provided they were endorsed by US citizens or claimed by a university. Gloria was one of the exiled academics who passed through American universities and formed an intellectual elite. In 1942, her daughter Laura married Francisco Garc√≠a Lorca, younger brother of the poet Federico, in the Mead Chapel of Middlebury College, where both were professors at the Spanish School. The couple had three daughters, and the family lived together in a New York apartment. In addition to preparing classes, writing poems, and working on the publication of her works, Giner took care of her three granddaughters, took them out for walks and, if necessary, took them on the bus and subway in New York. In 1949, Fernando de los R√≠os died. Over 50 personalities of politics and culture attended the funeral. Jos√© de los R√≠os ‚Äì the younger brother of Fernando and Francisco Garc√≠a Lorca ‚Äì presided over the dual family. Fernando's wife, mother, and daughter stayed at the house during the funeral, in accordance with Spanish custom at the time. ==Return to Spain== Gloria Giner returned to Spain with her daughter's family in 1965. She died in Madrid on 6 February 1970. She was buried in the , and her husband's remains were reinterred there alongside hers on 28 June 1980. ==Teaching methods== Gloria Giner and her great friend worked together on the teaching of geography in order to connect with students. Giner defended the formative capacity of the plastic arts \\"as a real basis for the teaching of history in the first years of the formation of the culture of the child\\". Her 1935 book Cien lecturas hist√≥ricas became a prominent text for educational reformers inspired by the work of Rafael Altamira. With Altamira and Maria Montessori as references, they developed didactic methods that, in Serrano's words, revolved around \\"enthusiastic observation\\". This consisted of teaching geography in dialogue with the students, strengthening their physical and emotional relationship with the environment. Another component of enthusiastic observation was emotional. Impositions of rote memorization were eliminated. In Giner's words, \\"the soul was educated and the spirit strengthened\\". Serrano and Giner also advocated for the meaningful inclusion of women in the androcentric canon of studies on geography. The Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy had, in 1803, included the meaning of the word hombre (man) to refer to all mankind. Taking the term as inclusive of women, they understood that it forced men to relate to nature as women did. Serrano considered that rendering the androcentric references in geography meaningless would foster a \\"new creative, loving, anti-destructive, and anti-war humanity\\". In the opinion of professor Ana I. Sim√≥n Alegre, this teaching, in the language of the 21st century, could be called the development of environmental education or the first manifestations of ecofeminism. Giner's last book, Por tierras de Espa√±a (1962), also incorporated audio-lingual teaching methods. ==Works== * Historia de la pedagog√≠a (1910) * Weimer, Hermann 1872-1942 (translation) * Geograf√≠a Primer grado.

This brief pre-season stint landed him a position in the Queensland Cup with Tweed Heads Seagulls where he made 17 appearances. Following Seagulls away fixture against Papua New Guinea Hunters, Carne suffered a near-death experience after he endured an anaphylactic episode on-board the return flight to New South Wales. Tweed Heads coach Jimmy Matson gave him a relief tablet and oxygen which gradually regained his breathing and kept him calm until the plane arrived back in Australia. The cause was determined to most likely be due to traces of nut present in a carton of Orange Juice which Doyle-Manga had purchased post match. After taking time to recover following this experience, he returned to play for Seagulls. Carne was notable for his Hard-Hitting style of play in the 2017 season which was noticed by Norths Devils Head Coach Rohan Smith who enlisted him into the 2018 Squad. Doyle-Manga made an appearance in each game for the Devils and had a tackle efficiency of 88% which made him a credible asset to the team.

While in university at the age of 19, Melanie had also been teaching design programs to fellow students. After seeing students struggle, she created Fusion Books, which took the idea of empowering students to design their own school yearbooks by using a simple drag-and-drop tool equipped with a library of design templates that could be populated with photos, illustrations, and fonts. Over five years, Fusion Books grew into the largest yearbook company in Australia and expanded into France and New Zealand. Canva Having known all along that the technology Melanie had developed with Fusion Books could be applied more broadly, she set out to build Canva with co- founders Cliff Obrecht and Cameron Adams. Melanie ventured to Silicon Valley where a chance encounter with investor Bill Tai saw him invite Perkins to San Francisco to pitch her idea which in turn helped her to build further relationships. Melanie secured American Actors Woody Harrelson and Owen Wilson as early investors, even going so far as to learn to kitesurf in order to meet with the latter.

The canal lies between the Prinsengracht and the Lijnbaansgracht. ==History == The Jordaan, between the outer canal and the town wall, was part of a major urban development at the start of the 17th century. The canals and streets were not laid out on a new plan, but were enlargements of the existing polder ditches and pathways. In the Jordaan many canals and streets are named after flowers. This canal is named for an eglantine rose (Rosa rubiginosa). During construction of the canal belt, a pattern was followed that curved around the old city center in a semicircle. As a result, the Egelantiersgracht is slanted in relation to the canal belt and does not connect directly to the bridges over the Prinsengracht. The houses in this neighborhood were partly built for artisans and skilled tradespeople. The houses are built on a smaller scale than the great mansions on Herengracht, Keizersgracht and Prinsengracht. For this reason, they are in great demand as residences. There has been some new development, but the Egelantiersgracht has kept much of its original character. Six of the eleven Jordaan canals were filled in in the 19th century. The Egelantiersgracht, Bloemgracht, Lauriergracht, Looiersgracht and Passeerdersgracht maintained open water connections between the Prinsengracht and the Lijnbaansgracht. ==Architecture == *The St. Andrieshofje at Egelantiersgracht 107-114 was built in 1617. The passageway to its courtyard is splendidly decorated in blue and white tiles. *Egelantiersgracht 8, built in 1649, is a typical example of austere Amsterdam renaissance, with the upper sections of the front gable in original condition. It has two gable stones, one of St Willibrord and one of a brewer. Onno Boers, in his 2007 monograph of gable stones in Amsterdam, explains more fully: the Willibrord stone is copied from an engraving by Cornelis Bloemaert, ca. 1640, which features a wine barrel and a bottle: the barrel signifies a miracle performed by the saint, who once replenished a monastery's empty wine barrel by putting his crozier in it, and the bottle another miracle, when 12 or even 40 monks drank from a bottle he miraculously refilled. That, in combination with the stone with the brewer, leads Boers to conclude the house must have been a drinking establishment. *Egelantiersgracht 66, which was demolished in the Hunger Winter, was rebuilt between 1963 and 1964 by the Diogenes Foundation. The neighboring buildings Egelantiersgracht 68 and 70 have been restored. *Also on the Egelantiersgracht there were so- called corridors in several places between the houses . These narrow alleys provided access to the (often illegally) built-in backyards behind the row of houses, where the less fortunate lived in dilapidated shelters. ==Famous residents == *The pedagogue John Amos Comenius ( 1592‚Äì1670), lived in Egelantiersgracht 62. *The tobacco pipe maker Eduard Bird (c. 1610‚Äì65) owned a house on the corner of Egelantiersgracht and the last cross street. *Jan Bouman (1706‚Äì76), architect of the Dutch quarter in Potsdam, grew up on the Egelantiersgracht. *The writer Theun de Vries (1907-2005) lived in Egelantiersgracht 66. ==See also == *Canals of Amsterdam ==External link == *For the alleys on the Egelantiersgracht: Jordaan Koninkrijk der Sloppen, Gangen en binnenhoven in beeld, Theo Bakker.

The famine is considered to have begun in 1230 and lasted until 1231. It was named after the Kangi era (1229‚Äì1232), during the reign of Emperor Go-Horikawa. The shogun of Japan was Kuj≈ç Yoritsune. The famine was severe throughout Japan. It was caused by cold weather caused probably by volcanic eruptions, coupled later with a general breakdown of society. The anomalous cold weather started in 1229, resulting in a shortage of food. As the excessive rains, cold spells and blizzards destroyed crops in July 1230, the shortage developed into famine, and people started to die en masse in September 1230. The lack of sunlight and cold was so severe what the winter clothing was necessary in spring and summer. The relief efforts by Emperor and Shogunate were generally ineffective, as no food was available at all. To ease population mobility in the worst stricken areas, human trafficking was legalized in 1231, among other means - confiscations and forced food distribution. The social order broke down, and bands of marauding robbers (including former Buddhist monks) became common. The strife spilled even to Goryeo, as starving residents of Kyushu raided coastal towns for food. The weather reversed to warm in winter of 1230-1231, again resulting in crop failure in 1231, this time due to lack of soil moisture and scarcity of seeds. Overall, about one third of the population of Japan perished (dead numbering -), meaning the Kanki famine may be the worst in Japanese history. In the same years, the great famine also struck Kievan Rus' and Novgorod. ==See also== *List of famines *Demographic history of Japan before the Meiji Restoration *Kan'ei Great Famine *Y≈çwa famine ==References== This page is based on Japanese Wikipedia page ÂØõÂñú„ÅÆÈ£¢È•â, accessed 16 July 2019.

They were mainly used in Porsche's racing cars. ==Type 753== The first Porsche flat-eight was the Type 753. Work began on it in 1960, following the announcement of a 1.5-litre displacement limit for the 1961 Formula One (F1) season. The design of the new F1 engine was done by Hans H√∂nick and Hans Mezger. The 753 inherited the traditional Porsche features of a boxer layout and air-cooling, but with the number of cylinders increased to eight. Bore and stroke were respectively, resulting in a displacement of . The oversquare dimensions kept piston speeds low, and also kept the engine narrow and as far out of the airflow on the sides of the car's tub as possible, although it was still wider than the 120¬∞ V6 and 90¬∞ V8s of the competition. The centre of the engine was a magnesium crankcase cast in two halves split vertically along the centre-line of the crankshaft. The crankcase carried a one-piece crankshaft in nine main bearings. The eight aluminum cylinder barrels had their bores treated with a spray-on molybdenum/steel coating called Ferral. Each finned cylinder had its own separate aluminum cylinder head, with four studs per cylinder holding the heads and barrels to the crankcase. An aluminum valve-gear cover cast as a single piece stabilized the four cylinders on each side of the engine. The valvetrain was similar in some respects to that designed by Ernst Fuhrmann for the Type 547 four-cylinder engine. There were two overhead camshafts per cylinder bank, operating two valves per cylinder. As with the 547, the cams were driven by shafts rather than gears or chains, and the cam lobes were separate pieces that were keyed onto the shaft. The 753 added a second countershaft above the crankshaft to the single one underneath the crankshaft in the 547. Both countershafts rotated at half crankshaft speed. Two layshafts from the upper countershaft drove the left and right intake camshafts, while two other layshafts from the lower countershaft drove the exhaust camshafts, eliminating the vertical shafts in the 547's cylinder heads that gave that engine one of its nicknames. A short vertical shaft from the bevel gear on the right-hand inlet camshaft drove the axial cooling fan at 0.92x crankshaft speed. The valvetrain was designed to operate reliably at up to 10,000 rpm. The engine had a dry sump system with a separate oil tank. A Bosch dual ignition system with four ignition coils and two distributors fired two spark plugs per cylinder. The air-fuel mixture was delivered by four Weber double downdraft carburetors; two on each side. Assembly of the engine was a time consuming job, often requiring repeated assembly and disassembly with extensive hand-fitting of components. Building and setting up a 753 never took less than 100 hours and could take up to 220 hours. The engine, with exhaust and clutch, was long, wide, high and weighed . A prototype engine was first started on a test-bench on 12 December 1960. Initial power output was disappointing; (some sources say ), when the target had been . Mezger and his team worked to improve both the engine's reliability and power output. The earliest engines had a 90¬∞ angle between the valves. When this was reduced, first to 84¬∞ and subsequently to 72¬∞, power output rose. Other changes included reshaping the combustion chamber, lightening crank pins, and switching to titanium connecting rods. Power was eventually raised to . Although the chassis of the Type 787 F1 car was lengthened to accommodate the 753, the flat-eight was never installed and the car used the 547 throughout its short life. The 753 engine debuted in Porsche's Formula One Type 804 on 20 May 1962 at the Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort. With a compression ratio of 10.0:1, the engine produced at 9200 rpm on its first outing. This was still less power than the new Coventry-Climax and BRM V8 engines. With the improved six-speed transmission from the Type 718 and a ZF limited-slip differential, the car reached a top speed of . The 753 delivered Porsche's only F1 win as a constructor at the 1962 French Grand Prix at Rouen-Les-Essarts, in an 804 driven by Dan Gurney. A short-stroke version of the engine was developed, designated the 753/1. The 753 also influenced the design of the engine for Porsche's 901 project, that would become the 911. ==Type 771== Porsche 771 engine at the Porsche Museum A second version of the Porsche flat-eight meant for sports-racers in the 2 litre class was developed at the same time as the 753. This engine, designated Type 771, had a bore larger that the 753, resulting in an engine that displaced . Carburettor bores were increased to Power output rose to . This engine was used in the 718, 904 (of the 16 904s kept by the factory, six were fitted with the eight-cylinder engine), 906, 907, 909, and 910 sports-racer models between 1962 and 1968. A version of the 771 enlarged to was designated Type 771/1. ==Type 908== The next flat-eight Porsche engine was not a further development of the Type 771, but rather a version of the Type 916 quad-cam racing six-cylinder engine with two additional cylinders. This engine first appeared in the Porsche 908 racers, and is called the Type 908 engine. The engine's internal dimensions were carried over from the Type 916, which had in turn inherited the measurements of the production 911 engine. Bore and stroke were respectively, for a total displacement of . With a 10.4:1 compression ratio, power output for the early versions was . The engine debuted at the Le Mans practice weekend on 6 April 1968. Type 908 engines were installed in two VW-Porsche 914 cars at the factory in 1969. The first was built by Ferdinand Pi√´ch using a full-blown racing engine developing . The second received a detuned version of the engine, and was given to Ferry Porsche as a gift on his 60th birthday. Called \\"914/8s\\", both are part of the collection at the Porsche Museum. ==Type 1966== Another flat-eight engine design was related to Porsche internal project Type 1966, which corresponded to Volkswagen project EA266 of the late 1960s and early 1970s. The goal of EA266 was to develop a replacement for the Volkswagen Beetle. Volkswagen's prototypes used a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout and were powered by a water cooled inline four cylinder engine with the cylinder bores laid over horizontally, mounted longitudinally under the rear passenger seat. Ferdinand Pi√´ch envisioned the Type 1966 as the basis for a three-tiered replacement for the 911, with four-, eight-, and twelve-cylinder water cooled boxer engines mounted amidships. A design for a car with three- abreast seating was developed. A prototype flat-eight engine was also built for Pi√´ch. The prototype engine was loosely based on the inline four developed for EA266, and included DOHC cylinder heads and two EA266 water cooled cylinder blocks on a common crankshaft. The new car was expected to be introduced in 1973. According to designer Anatole \\"Tony\\" Lapine, shortly after project EA266 was cancelled by Volkswagen all materials relating to the Type 1966 were destroyed, including the prototype engine. ==Type 988/960== Rumours about another proposed Porsche flat-eight began to circulate in the mid-2010s. The mid-engined Porsche 988 (later renamed the 960) was to challenge the Ferrari 458 and Lamborghini Hurac√°n models using a flat-eight engine that displaced 4 litres and was fitted with four turbochargers. Power output was projected to be in excess of . The 960 was expected to have been released in 2019, but some report that its release may have been pushed back as far as 2026. ==References== Category:Flat engines ","title":"Porsche flat-eight engines"},{"id":"61290670","text":"Cavo is a village in Tuscany, central Italy, administratively a frazione of the comune of Rio, province of Livorno.

The river begins at Higgins Lake and meanders to Houghton Lake at a length of approximately . It also passes through the small Marl Lake within South Higgins Lake State Park near its source. ==Activities== Historically, the Cut River served to transport lumber from the Higgins Lake area to Houghton Lake. Portions of the river were dredged to allow for lumber transport during the late-1800s, although no remnant of this exist today. The Cut River is a popular fishing destination because of its calm, undeveloped, and scenic environment, which allows for easy use for smaller canoes and kayaks. A single public access point is available at Marl Lake. The river only has three bridge crossings: East Higgins Lake Drive, West Lansing Road, and near its mouth along East Houghton Lake Drive (County Road 100). A small dam was constructed near the river mouth, which prevents navigating from the Houghton Lake to Higgins Lake without portaging over Houghton Lake Drive. ==Water levels== The small river serves an important purpose to regulate the water level within Higgins Lake, which also affects the water level of Houghton Lake. A small dam was constructed across the Cut River near Higgins Lake for this purpose. A bridge along East Higgins Lake Drive passes over the inconspicuous dam. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources closely monitors the water levels within the Cut River, as it is a popular spawning location for walleye in Houghton Lake. Because of the small dam, fish within Houghton Lake can no longer travel to Higgins Lake. Depending on the fluctuating water level within Higgins Lake, the Cut River may endure periods of very low water levels that can adversely affect fish populations. Other common fish along the river include smallmouth bass, yellow perch, trout, and northern pike. The river has a very low watershed until it meets with Backus Creek nearer Houghton Lake. In recent years, residents along the Higgins Lake shoreline have complained about increasing coastal erosion because of rising water levels within Higgins Lake, which are controlled by the small dam along the Cut River. Scientific evaluation constantly monitors the water level and flow within the Cut River, as it can affect the water levels of Higgins Lake, Houghton Lake, and even leading to the Muskegon River going to Lake Michigan. ==References== Category:Rivers of Michigan Category:Rivers of Roscommon County, Michigan ","title":"Cut River (Roscommon County, Michigan)"},{"id":"61290694","text":"The United States Senate election of 1922 in New York was held on November 7, 1922.

Madurese golekan with crab claw sails Golekan is a type of traditional boat from Madura, Indonesia. They once plied as far as Singapore, where they are referred to as Madurese traders. In the present this type of boat is only known locally, especially near Bangkalan in Western Madura and around the Kangean islands.Horridge. (1981). p. 79. ==Etimology== Dutch observer van Deventer wrote that it means \\"freight seeker\\". Gibson-Hill stated the name comes from Malay word golek, which he claimed meant crank (tender, or 'tippy') when applied to a canoe. Rather, the name derived from kolek, a Javanese word for 'boat', applied to a wide range of small craft along the north coast of Java. Thus the name golekan would meant 'a kind of kolek'.Stenross. (2007). p. 275. Golekan in Madurese culture were regarded as \\"male\\", being referred to as parao laki (male boat), so it has different ornamental motif from lis-alis and janggolan (parao bini - female boat). The primary symbol was the rooster, associated in Indonesian culture with combat and fearlessness. ==Description== A golekan (left) in Banjarmasin. The golekan is an indigenous perahu type, with no trace of modern influence in hull form, construction, or sailing rig. Despite the traditional nature of design, golekan appears to have been a relatively recent development.Stenross. (2007). p. 85. Golekan had single large and fat linggi (stempost) just like leti leti, with gulungan motifs painted black. It has deckhouse without secondary cabin at the aft of the boat. Usually had 2 sails (usually lete sail), with upper beam supported by temporary pole and mast at the direction of the wind, or at both side of the boat, with support ropes at both upper beam. The hulls were always painted white, with polychrome sheer stripe, and the upper portions of end posts, as well as the finials painted black. Medium-sized golekan used as fish transporters were about 12 metres in length with a long deckhouse.Stenross. (2007). p. 88. The golekan of Telaga Biru were both larger and more numerous than elsewhere, consistent in size at about 55 feet (16.8 m) length and 14 feet (4.3 m) beam. The vessels remained fully traditional until mid-1970s, when the first engine was installed. The last traditional golekan was built in 1983.Stenross. (2007). p. 94. Golekans reaching Singapore in 1950s has a length of 50-55 ft (15.24-16.8 m) with 12.5-13 ft (3.81-3.96 m) beam, waterline length of 41-45 ft (12.5-13.7 m). A golekan with 52 ft (15.85 m) waterline could carry 500-550 pikul (31.2-34.4 ton). They are slow, seldom exceed 8.5 knots (15.7 km/h). ==Role== Sambas river, West Borneo. In the past, golekan is used as transport vessel, reaching as far as Singapore. In the early 1950s golekan from Sepulu were sailing to Singapore with mixed cargoes of palm sugar, coffee, tamarind, dried fish, and mats, along with considerable numbers of passengers from the island of Bawean. Madurese skippers would buy cattle from local market and sell them for handsome profit in Pontianak, Manggar, or Pangkal Pinang. The vessels would make 6 voyages a year, during dry season only. Largest golekan could carry up to 40 animals, tethered on a platform inside the long deckhouse. Large amounts of fodder and water needed to be carried to nourish them for the voyage.Stenross. (2007). p. 92. Since 1980s increasing amount of timber were brought to Telaga Biru. in 1990s this timber trade bloomed, trucks from East Java and even Bali regularly making their way to Telaga Biru to obtain the high quality timber being landed there.Stenross. (2007). p. 96. The main role for small golekan (about 20 tons in weight) is for transporting fishes from perahu mayang that remains at the sea. They had a row of boiling pots for sterilizing fishes just like lis-alis. In Bangkalan, the reason why they had 2 different type of boat is that the golekan is heavier and slower than lis-alis but they are more useful in open sea compared to lis-alis. Golekan is associated with man while lis-alis is associated with woman, and every village must have several from each kind to survive in every season, golekan is the one used when western season wind arrived.Horridge.

OneSky began its work in 1998 (under the name Half the Sky). Originally founded by filmmaker Jenny Bowen to provide nurturing care and early education to young children in China‚Äôs state-run welfare institutions, OneSky has gone on to serve left-behind children in China‚Äôs impoverished rural villages, the children of migrant workers in Vietnam‚Äôs industrial zones, and children at risk living in ger districts surrounding Mongolia‚Äôs capital Ulaanbaatar. In May 2020 it opened the P. C. Lee OneSky Global Centre for Early Childhood Development in Sham Shui Po, Hong Kong. Through early childhood development, OneSky helps vulnerable young children reach their potential. OneSky‚Äôs approach draws from Reggio Emilia which is adapted to local education standards and cultural norms. By 2019, OneSky had trained 38,800 caregivers, serving 187,500 children. ==History== In 1997, Jenny Bowen and husband Richard Bowen adopted a child from a Chinese social welfare institution. The child suffered from the adverse effects common to institutionalized children. After a year of love and stimulation, she caught up and began to thrive. Bowen set up Half the Sky with the aim of offering the same care to children in China‚Äôs orphanages. In collaboration with early childhood educators and pediatricians, the organization trained employees in China‚Äôs orphanages to provide care and early education to infants and toddlers. In 2005, China‚Äôs Ministry of Civil Affairs held its first national conference on orphan care and Half the Sky was the only foreign organization invited to present. By 2007, OneSky's approach had become China‚Äôs national standard for care of orphaned children, including those in rural villages orphaned by AIDS. Half the Sky was invited to provide guidance for Hu Jintao‚Äôs ‚ÄúBlue Sky‚Äù Plan, a massive infrastructure investment in child welfare. In 2008, the organization was recognized for its contributions by official registration at a national level‚Äîone of only a small handful of foreign NGOs. In that same year Jenny Bowen won the Skoll Award for Social Entrepreneurship, presented by Jimmy Carter, in recognition of OneSky‚Äôs efforts to bring change to China‚Äôs child welfare system. In 2011, with OneSky programs operating in 56 state-run welfare institutions across China, OneSky entered into a groundbreaking public/NGO/private partnership celebrated at the Great Hall of the People to, together with government, train every child welfare worker in the nation. In 2014, Jenny Bowen's book, Wish You Happy Forever: What China‚Äôs orphans taught me about moving mountains was published by HarperCollins. In 2015, Half the Sky began the process of bringing its programs and training to rural China to assist left-behind children. In 2016, to reflect its broadened mission, Half the Sky changed its name to OneSky for all children. In 2017 OneSky developed a demonstration early learning center in Da Nang, Vietnam specifically for the children of migrants who had moved to work in factories. These children would otherwise have had no safe, affordable care. In 2018 Vietnam‚Äôs Ministry of Education and Training invited OneSky to scale its training for early education practitioners and caregivers across 19 provinces. In Mongolia‚Äôs capital city of Ulaanbaatar, OneSky trained caregivers in a state-run nursery serving vulnerable toddlers. In 2020, OneSky opened the P. C. Lee OneSky Global Centre for Early Childhood Development in Sham Shui Po, Hong Kong. The center is a training hub for early childhood care and education (ECCE) for childcare professionals and paraprofessionals locally and across Asia. It also provides community space for children up to the age of six and their caregivers. == External links == * OneSky official page ==References== Category:Children's rights organizations ","title":"OneSky for all children"},{"id":"61291164","text":"Leah Davidson (born 28 March 2001) is an Australian professional women's footballer who plays as a defender for Brisbane Roar. ==Club careerYouth career=== In 2013, Torpey started her youth career playing for the U-13's Palm Beach Girls.

Amongst other accomplishments, he is well known for developing the Hoshen-Kopelman algorithm. He was also amongst the first scientists pushing to establish the field of nanotechnology. ==Birth, Education, and Early Career== Kopelman was born in Vienna, Austria and on April 1, 1939, at the age of 5, he fled with his parents (Josef and Klara-Chaja) from Austria to Jerusalem during the Second World War. Later, while living in Tel-Aviv and in the sixth grade, his science teacher loaned him a German booklet on chemical experiments. With several other friends he formed a chemistry club, where they performed numerous experiments. The club included Assa Lifshitz (who went on to become a professor at the Department of Physical Chemistry at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem) and Joshua Jortner (who went on to become a Professor at the School of Chemistry, Tel Aviv University in Tel-Aviv, Israel). With a desire of helping society, he later attended the Israel Institute of Technology to earn his bachelor's degree in chemical engineering and his master's degree in chemistry. He took classes on quantum mechanics with David Bohm and group theory with David Fox. Kopelman studied under Ralph Halford to earn his PhD in Chemistry at Columbia University. He also worked at Harvard as the first postdoctoral researcher of William Klemperer. After this, he worked as a lecturer in chemistry at the Israel Institute of Technology and a Senior Research Fellow at the California Institute of Technology with Wilse Robinson. ==Educator and Scientific Researcher== In 1966, Kopelman accepted a professorship position in chemistry at the University of Michigan, where he has served for over 50 years. As an educator, Kopelman has successfully trained many active scientists in the fields of chemistry, biomedical engineering, applied physics and others. Students of his have included Weihong Tan and Nobel-Prize winners Eric Betzig, Roald Hoffman, Richard Smalley, and Arieh Warshel. In his scientific work, he has authored over 600 publications, including scientific papers, patents, and books with nearly 30,000 citations. His publications have an h-index of over 80 (h-indexes of over 60 are considered to be ‚Äútruly exceptional‚Äù). Kopelman‚Äôs work spans many disciplines and collaborators. Some of his notable accomplishments include: * Hoshen Kopelman Algorithm - ‚Äúa simple and efficient algorithm for labeling clusters on a grid, where the grid is a regular network of cells, with the cells being either occupied or unoccupied‚Äù Example output from the Hoshen-Kopelman algorithm. Each number in the image represents a differentiable cluster. * Pioneering nanotechnology - Kopelman was publishing so early in the field that journals forced him to remove ‚Äúnano‚Äù from articles as it was not yet an accepted term (e.g. Nano-optics) * Using pulled fiber optics for near-field optics (including published work with Eric Betzig) and for intracellular measurements * Light sources smaller than the optical wavelength * Multiple discoveries in nanosensors and nanomedicine * Discovery of the largest ever electric fields in cells ==Awards== Kopelman‚Äôs awards include * Etter Memorial Lecture in Materials Chemistry, University of Minnesota * Pittsburgh Analytical Chemistry Award, 2011 * Richard Smalley Distinguished University Professorship of Chemistry, Physics and Applied Physics, 2006 * ACS Division of Analytical Chemistry Award in Spectrochemical Analysis, 2005 * American Chemical Society Morley Award, 1997 * American Physical Society Lady Davis Fellowship * Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science * Guggenheim Fellow, 1995 * J.

Located north of Duke University's East Campus, it originally served as a residential neighborhood for service employees of the University and local tobacco and textile mills. It is bordered by West Durham Historic District and Watts‚ÄìHillandale Historic District to the west and Trinity Historic District to the east. Northgate Mall is located on the northeastern edge of the neighborhood. A low-lying area, the neighborhood is subject to flash flooding. Dye Branch, a section of Neuse River's tributary Ellerbe Creek, flows through Walltown.https://files.nc.gov/ncdeq/Water%20Quality/Planning/NPU/319/WatershedMGTPlans_9element/Ellerbe_Creek_Local_Watershed_Plan.pdf Floodwaters from Hurricane Florence on Buchanan Boulevard, between Trinity Park and Walltown, in September 2018. == History  Foundation and Jim Crow === George Wall House on Onslow Street. Walltown is named after George Wall, a formerly enslaved man who worked as a custodian at Trinity College (later renamed Duke University). Wall, born a slave to the grandfather of a Trinity College physics professor, worked as a farm laborer before obtaining his freedom. Wall and his family settled near the college after its relocation to Durham from Trinity and purchased a lot nearby, building a house in 1906. The area expanded and became known as Walltown, serving as a residential neighborhood for service staff at Duke University and workers at the local tobacco mills. In 1910 the first church was built in the neighborhood and named Wall Street Baptist Church, in honor of Wall. A small church on Englewood Avenue. In 1948 two female residents, who were members of the Durham Negro Youth Federation, led a door-to-door voter registration drive in Walltown and Hickstown to encourage African-American citizens to vote in an election for Durham County Commissioner in which one of the candidates was an African-American. In 1937 the Walltown Community Council was formed and two years later had an all-female leadership team. In 1955 Walltown residents awarded Frizelle Daye a gold plate, presented by Rev. L.M. Gooch, and appointed him the \\"Bronze Mayor\\". Daye's wife, Callie, was a local beautician and head of the Walltown Housewives League in the 1940s and 1950s. She wrote a column for The Carolina Times titled Walltown Notes. She later chaired the Durham NAACP's membership drive in the 1960s. An old barber shop on Knox Street. In May 1958 the first legal challenge against racial segregation in Durham Public Schools was filed by Rachel Richardson, a resident of Walltown, and Evelyn McKissick, wife of Floyd McKissick. Many of the anti-segregation protesters in Durham were residents of Walltown.  Walltown School  Discovery Charter School in the former St. James Family Life Center building in 2019. In 1919 the Walltown Graded School was built on North Road (later West Club Boulevard). A Rosenwald School, it served African-American children in the neighborhood. The school building was expanded in 1945. In 1955 the original building was demolished and replaced. During desegregation, some African-American students were reassigned from Walltown to Brogden Junior High School. White students were not enrolled at Walltown School until 1970. The school later closed and the property ownership was transferred to the Durham County government in 1994. In 1997 the property was listed for sale. St. James Baptist Church bought the building for $374,240 and, with assistance from Self-Help and Duke University, created the St. James Family Life Center. The building was acquired by Discovery Charter School, a STEM-based school, in 2019. === Modern era === Walltown developed into an epicenter of crime and poverty and began experiencing high vacancy rates in the 1970s. By the 1980s, Walltown's poverty, unemployment, and crime rates exceeded the city average. A mini-mart on Knox Street became a drug trafficking hub in the neighborhood. Walltown became a center of gang violence and drug trade. In 1990, seventy- three percent of the homes in Walltown were rental properties rather than owner occupied properties. In 1994 the Center for Community Self-Help commenced a large scale housing renovation program in the neighborhood. In 1996 the Walltown Neighborhood Ministries formed, made up of local ministers, to provide community outreach. In 1998 seventy-nine percent of residents lived below the poverty line. St. John Missionary Baptist Church on Onslow Street. In the 21st century Walltown has faced periods of gentrification, due to its close proximity to Downtown Durham and Duke University. Historically a blue- collar neighborhood, the nearby neighborhoods Watts-Hillandale and Trinity Park are historically white and affluent. In 2006 the crime rate in Walltown reduced to half the percentage rate it had in 1996. Self-Help Corporation's efforts in the 1990s led to the brokering of affordable rental housing for Duke employees and students and the creation of Trinity Heights Homesites. In 2018 leaders of the Walltown Community Association met with Durham City Council officials to propose city regulations and zoning standards to help reduce property tax increases and raised rent in the neighborhood, which has forced some residents to relocate. In October 2000 Joseph and Cynthia Henderson opened Walltown Children's Theatre, a dance and performing arts school, in a former church building in Walltown. Durham Parks and Recreation offered grants to fund the tuition at the theatre for ten students from low- income households. In 2005 the Walltown Health Clinic opened. In March 2009 the Walltown Community Recreational Center was built, a city-funded community center adjacent to Walltown Park, replacing an original recreational center that was built during segregation. Bull City Legacy, a minor league professional basketball team in the Tobacco Road Basketball League, played their home games at the center. == Notable residents == * DJ Nabs, American DJ and record producer * Jonathan Wilson-Hartgrove, American Christian preacher and writer == Notable buildings == * George Wall House == References == Category:African-American history in Durham, North Carolina Category:Neighborhoods in Durham, North Carolina Category:Populated places established by African Americans Category:Gentrification in the United States ","title":"Walltown, Durham, North Carolina"},{"id":"61291326","text":"Melhania damarana is a plant in the family Malvaceae, native to southern Africa. ==Description== Melhania damarana grows as a shrub tall, with several stems from a woody base.

In promotion of the tour and single, Brooks' Chicago performance of \\"Dive Bar\\" was aired on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. ==Critical response== Steve Johnson of the Chicago Tribune praised the tour, stating, \\"Brooks fist-pumped, finger-pointed and humbly hat- doffed his way through a honky-tonk jukebox worth of old hits, one new single (twice) and some touching homages to country legends in a show that lasted a surprisingly generous 100 minutes.\\" He continued, \\"if you accept that the golden ratio in concert-going is size of talent to size of room, then this one was special, a night to get close and personal with a performer typically seen from, at best, binocular distance in a hockey arena.\\" ==Shows== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + List of concerts, showing date, city, country, and venue - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:12em;\\" Date ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:10em;\\" City ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:10em;\\" Country ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:18em;\\" Venue - !colspan=\\"5\\"  North America - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center July 15, 2019 Chicago  rowspan=\\"7\\"  United States  Joe's on Weed Street - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center August 15, 2019 Bakersfield  Buck Owens Crystal Palace - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center September 23, 2019 New Braunfels  Gruene Hall - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center October 16, 2019 Sanford  The Barn - - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center October, 28, 2019 Rootstown  Dusty Armadillo - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center December, 2, 2019 Mount Laurel  Prospector‚Äôs Steakhouse - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center February 5, 2020 Foxborough  Six String Grill & Stage - } ==References== Category:2019 concert tours Category:2020 concert tours Category:Concert tours of the United States Category:Concert tours of North America Category:Garth Brooks concert tours ","title":"Dive Bar Tour (Garth Brooks)"},{"id":"61291616","text":"William J. Nellis (born June 25, 1941) is an American physicist. He is an Associate of the Physics Department of Harvard University. His work has focused on ultra-condensed matter at extreme pressures, densities and temperatures achieved by fast dynamic compression. He is most well-known for the first experimental observation of a metallic phase of dense hydrogen, a material predicted to exist by Eugene Wigner and Hillard Bell Huntington in 1935. Nellis has been President of the International Association for the Advancement of High Pressure Science and Technology (AIRAPT) and Chairman of the American Physical Society (APS) Topical Group on Shock Compression of Condensed Matter. He has received the Bridgman Award of AIRAPT, the Duvall Award of APS and is a Fellow of the APS Division of Condensed Matter Physics. Nellis is an author or coauthor of more than 250 published papers. Most of his research has been focused on materials during or after dynamic compression at high pressures for properties including electrical conductivities, temperatures, equation-of-state data, and shock-wave profiles to investigate compressibilities and phase transitions in liquids and solids. == Early life and education == Nellis was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1941. He received his B.S. degree in Physics from Loyola University of Chicago, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, in 1963 and his Ph.D. degree in Physics from Iowa State University in 1968. His Ph.D. thesis research included measurements of electrical and thermal conductivities of single crystals of the Rare Earth elements Gadolinium, Terbium and Holmium in the Ames National Laboratory at Iowa State.W. J. Nellis and S. Legvold, \\"Thermal Conductivities and Lorenz Functions of Gadolinium, Terbium, and Holmium Single Crystals,\\" Phys. Rev. 180, 581 (1969) Following graduate school, Nellis was a postdoctoral researcher in the Materials Science Division of Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), where he measured electrical and magnetic properties of ordered and disordered alloys of the Actinide elements Plutonium, Neptunium and Uranium mixed with non-magnetic Transition Metals. The experiments at ISU and ANL were performed at cryogenic temperatures in the range of 2 ‚Äì 300 Kelvin.W. J. Nellis and M. B. Brodsky, \\"Magnetism in Palladium-Actinide Alloys,\\" in Plutonium 1970 and Other Actinides, edited by W. N. Miner (Metallurgical Society of the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers, New York, 1970), pp. 346-354. == Career and work == From 1970 to 1973, Nellis was Assistant Professor of Physics at Monmouth College (ILL) where he taught undergraduate physics courses and was Director of the College‚Äôs Computer Center. In 1973, he left Monmouth to join Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LNLL), where he performed computational simulations of condensed matter under dynamic compression driven by shock waves generated with high explosives. In 1976, Nellis moved within LLNL to the High-Dynamic-Pressure Experimental Group, in which he measured properties of approximately 30 cryogenic liquids and solids compressed dynamically to pressures in the range 20-500 GPa with associated temperatures up to as much as several 1000 Kelvins. Those molecular fluids are representative of fluids in the interiors of Giant Planets and in reacted high explosives. Those temperatures, pressures and densities were generated by impact of a high- velocity projectile onto a target material. Impactors were accelerated with a two-stage light-gas gun to velocities as large as 8 km/s (18,000 mph). Impactors were typically 25 mm in diameter and 2-3 mm thick. Samples were 25 mm in diameter and 0.5 - 3 mm thick. Experimental lifetimes were around 100 nanoseconds. Fast electrical and optical measurements were made with detectors having sub-ns resolution time. In 2003, Nellis retired from LNLL and joined the Department of Physics at Harvard University as an Associate. Since leaving LLNL, Nellis has collaborated with scientists in Japan, Russia, China and Sweden, as well as in the United States. Nellis has also been involved with the International Association for the Advancement of High Pressure Science and Technology, AIRAPT, for the greater part of his career serving as the vice president from 1999 to 2003 and as the president from 2003 to 2007. From 1998 to 2007, he served as the editor of the journal Shock Waves. === Significant discoveries === Nellis is most well-known for the first experimental observation of a metallic phase of dense hydrogen,Weir, S.

Journal of Chemical Physics, 3, 764-770. Dynamic compression generates temperature T and entropy S on rapid compression and the product TS controls phase stability via the free energy. By tuning the magnitude and temporal shape of a reverberating shock pressure pulse, H2 dissociates to H at sufficiently large density that measured electrical conductivities of fluid H cross over from semiconducting to degenerate metal with Mott‚Äôs Minimum Metallic Conductivity at pressure 1.4 million bars (140 GPa), nine-fold H atom density in liquid H2 and calculated temperature of 3000 K. Similar electrical conductivities of H under multiple- shock compression have been measured by Fortov et al.Fortov, V. E., Ternovoi, V. A., Zhernokletov, M.V., Mochalov, M. A., Mikhailov, A. L., et al. (2003). Pressure-produced ionization of nonideal plasma in a megabar range of dynamic pressures. Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Physics, 97, 259-278.

Chinese Physics Letters, 31, 126201. are in good agreement with the electrical conductivity data measured in. Once the pressure dependence of the electrical conductivity of semiconducting and metallic fluid H was measured, those conductivities were used to address the likely cause of the unusual external magnetic fields of the planets Uranus and Neptune, which are neither dipolar nor axisymmetric as the fields of Earth and other planets with magnetic fields. Planetary fields are caused by convection of electrically conducting fluids in their interiors, most of which in Uranus and Neptune is hydrogen. Because the electrical conductivity of fluid H approaches metallic at ~100 GPa, the magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune are primarily generated close to their outer surfaces, which implies the existence of nondipolar contributions to their fields,Granzow, K. D. (1983). Spherical harmonic representation of the magnetic field in the presence of a current density. Geophysical Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society, 74, 489-505. as observed. Because Uranus and Neptune are fluids, no strong rotating rock layers exist in their interiorsHelled, R., Anderson, J. D., Podolak, M. and Schubert, G. (2011). Interior mofels of Uranus and Neptune.Astrophysical Journal, 726, 15-1 ‚Äì 15-7. to couple the existence of planetary rotational motion into the convective currents that generate the magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune. His experiments on liquids expected at high pressures and temperatures in deep planetary interiors have major implications for developing pictures of the interiors of giant planets both in this and in other solar systems.Nellis, W. J. (2015). The unusual magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune. Modern Physics Letters B, 29, 1430018-1-1430018-29. Through his research, Nellis also discovered that at very high dynamic shock pressures and temperatures, electrons in metals and strong insulators have a common uniform behavior in shock velocity space,Ozaki, N., Nellis, W.

Physical Review Letters, 30, 1346-1349. The mechanism in insulators is a crossover from strong localized directional electronic bonds to a more-compressible delocalized electronic band structure characteristic of metals. His technique to recover solids as thin as a micron intact from shock pressures up to a million bars has facilitated synthesis of metastable materials for characterization of material structures and physical properties.Nellis, W.

Nellis"},{"id":"61291620","text":"The twentieth century Russian philosopher and literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin wrote extensively on the concept of dialogue. Although Bakhtin's work took many different directions over the course of his life, dialogue always remained the \\"master key\\" to understanding his worldview. Bakhtin described the open-ended dialogue as \\"the single adequate form for verbally expressing authentic human life\\". In it \\"a person participates wholly and throughout his whole life: with his eyes, lips, hands, soul, spirit, with his whole body and deeds. He invests his entire self in discourse, and this discourse enters into the dialogic fabric of human life, into the world symposium.\\" ==Bakhtin's understanding of dialogue== Dialogue is usually analyzed as some kind of interaction between two monads on the basis of a pre-conceived model. Bakhtin regards this conception as a consequence of 'theoretism'‚Äîthe tendency, particularly in modern western thought, to understand events according to a pre-existing set of rules to which they conform or structure that they exhibit. This forgets that the rules or structures have been abstracted from the event, that the event is prior to the abstraction and that the event is always replete with a context, intimacy, immediacy, and significance to the participants that is effaced in the act of abstraction: \\"We cannot understand the world of events from within the theoretical world. One must start with the act itself, not with its theoretical transcription.\\"Bakhtin, Mikhail. Towards a Philosophy of the Act, quoted in Morson and Emerson (1990). p. 50 According to Bakhtin, dialogue lives on the boundaries between individuals: not in the sense of a meeting between isolated entities that exist \\"within\\" the boundaries (he argues that there is no \\"within\\"), but actually on the boundaries themselves.Morson and Emerson (1990). p. 51 In Bakhtin's view, \\"no living word relates to its object in a singular way\\". Between the speaking subject, the word, and its object there exists \\"an elastic environment of other words about the same object... it is precisely in the process of living interaction with this specific environment that the word may be individualized and given stylistic shape.\\" There is, effectively, no such thing as the monad. People are not closed units, they are open, loose, disordered, unfinalized: they are \\"extraterritorial\\" and \\"nonself-sufficient\\".Morson and Emerson (1990). p. 52 \\"To be means to be for another, and through the other for oneself. A person has no sovereign internal territory, he is wholly and always on the boundary; looking inside himself, he looks into the eyes of another or with the eyes of another.\\"Bakhtin (1984). p. 287 ===Outsideness=== In his early writings Bakhtin used the concepts of outsideness and the surplus to elucidate the necessary conditions for dialogical interaction. In one's view of the other there is a surplus of spatio-temporal objectivity necessitated by the very fact of its externality: \\"In order to understand it is immensely important for the person who understands to be located outside the object of his or her creative understanding‚Äîin time, in space, in culture... Our real exterior can be seen and understood only by other people because they are located outside us in space and because they are others\\".Bakhtin. Response to a question from the New World editors, quoted in Morson and Emerson (1990). p. 55 Only the outside perspective, never the person themselves, can see \\"the clear blue sky against whose background their suffering external image takes on meaning\\".Bakhtin, Mikhail. Author and hero in aesthetic activity. p. 25. Translated by and quoted in Morson and Emerson (1990). p. 53 If the surplus is actively entered into the other's world, or the view from outside oneself is likewise engaged, the potential for new understanding comes into existence. In this sense dialogue has more profound implications than concepts such as 'empathy', or the social anthropologist's goal of understanding an alien culture from within, which involve trying to merge with the other's position.Morson and Emerson (1990). p. 53-55 In such a situation nothing new can come into existence: there is only a duplication of the closed circle of what already exists. ===Monologization=== For dialogue to be possible there must be a plurality of positions. The dialogic is thus alien to any theory that would tend towards a monologisation of views‚Äîfor example, the dialectical process, or any kind of dogmatism or relativism. Of dialectics as a form of monologization Bakhtin wrote: \\"Take a dialogue and remove the voices, remove the\`emotional and individualising intonations, carve out abstract concepts and judgements from living words and responses, cram everything into one abstract consciousness‚Äîand that's how you get dialectics.\\" Both relativism and dogmatism \\"exclude all argumentation, all authentic dialogue, by making it either unnecessary (relativism) or impossible (dogmatism).\\"Bakhtin (1984). p. 69 Dogmatism excludes any view or evidence that is at variance with it, making dialogue impossible, while at the (theoretically) opposite extreme, relativism also has a monologising effect, because if everything is relative and all truths are equally arbitrary, there is simply an infinity of monologizations, not a fruitful dialogue.Morson and Emerson (1990). p. 59 Relativism precludes the potential for creativity and new understanding inherent in dialogue: each finds only the reflection of itself in its separateness. In the dialogic encounter \\"each retains its own unity and open totality, but they are mutually enriched.\\"Morson and Emerson (1990). p. 56 According to Caryl Emerson, Bakhtin does not suggest that the creative potential inherent in the dialogic encounter is necessarily benign. There is no guarantee that an individual's investment of herself in dialogue will necessarily yield 'truth', 'beauty', 'consolation', 'salvation', or anything of that kind (ideal goals often claimed by monologic philosophies or methods). Engagement with the other brings concretization, liberation from solipsistic self-absorption, new realities and new choices, but these do not exclude 'negative' possibilities. The dialogic encounter, since it implies intimacy and vulnerability, can involve increased suffering and susceptibility to the cruelty or stupidity of the other. As Emerson expresses it: \\"By having a real other respond to me, I am spared one thing only: the worst cumulative effects of my own echo chamber of words.\\" ===Reification=== \\"Reified (materializing, objectified) images\\", Bakhtin argues, \\"are profoundly inadequate for life and discourse... Every thought and every life merges in the open-ended dialogue. Also impermissible is any materialization of the word: its nature is dialogic.\\"Bakhtin (1984). p. 293 Semiotics and linguistics, like dialectics, reify the word: dialogue, instead of being a live event, a fruitful contact between human beings in a living, unfinalized context, becomes a sterile contact between abstracted things. When cultures and individuals accumulate habits and procedures (what Bakhtin calls the \\"sclerotic deposits\\" of earlier activity), and adopt forms based in \\"congealed\\" events from the past, the centripetal forces of culture will tend to codify them into a fixed set of rules. In the reifying sciences, this codification is mistaken for reality, undermining both creative potential and true insight into past activity. The uniqueness of an event, that which cannot be reduced to a generalization or abstraction, is in fact what makes responsibility, in any meaningful sense, possible: \\"activity and discourse are always evaluatively charged and context specific.\\"Morson and Emerson (1990). p. 59 In theoretical transcriptions of events, which are based in a model of \\"monads acting according to rules\\", the living impulse that actually gives rise to discourse is ignored. According to Bakhtin, \\"to study the word as such, ignoring the impulse that reaches out beyond it, is just as senseless as to study psychological experience outside the context of that real life toward which it was directed and by which it is determined.\\"Bakhtin (1981). p. 292 ==Dostoevsky== In the existing forms of 'knowledge', the open-ended dialogue of life is monologized‚Äîturned into a summary statement of its contents, but failing to recognize its unfinalizable nature. Bakhtin felt that the literary methods of Dostoevsky are far more adequate to the task of representing the reality of human interaction than scientific and philosophical approaches (including, and especially, psychology: Bakhtin emphasizes that Dostoevsky explicitly rejects the idea that he is a psychologist). Dostoevsky's characters are, by the very nature of his creative design, \\"not only objects of authorial discourse, but also subjects of their own directly signifying discourse.\\"Bakhtin (1984). p. 7 Multi-voicedness (Polyphony), is essential to Dostoevsky: the world of his novel is constructed upon it, such that it can be said that this multi-voicedness is itself the primary object of his work. Each character, and each implied voice in a character's internal dialogue, is an other consciousness that never becomes merely an object for the author or any other character or voice. \\"A character's word about himself and his world is just as fully weighted as the author's... It possesses extraordinary independence in the structure of the work; it sounds, as it were, alongside the author's word and combines both with it and with the full and equally valid voices of other characters.\\"Bakhtin (1984). p. 7 In Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics Bakhtin credits Dostoevsky with three major innovations that make possible the 'Great Dialogue' of the polyphonic novel.Emerson (1997). p. 146 The first is unfinalizability: Dostoevsky's image of the human being is of a being that can not be wholly finalized by anything, even death. The second is the representation, through words, of the \\"self-developing idea, inseparable from personality.\\" The third is the discovery and creative elaboration of dialogue \\"as a special form of interaction among autonomous and equally signifying consciousnesses.\\"Bakhtin (1984). p. 184 ==Discourse== Bakhtin argues that dialogic interactions are not reducible to forms that are analyzable by linguistic methods. While dialogic relations presuppose a language, they do not reside within the system of language and are impossible among the elements of a language.Bakhtin, M. M. (1986) Speech Genres and Other Late Essays. Trans. by Vern W. McGee. Austin, Tx: University of Texas Press. p. 117 Instead they must be analyzed as discourse. The discursive word is never separate from a subject who utters it in address to another subject: the word must be embodied for it to have any dialogical status.Bakhtin (1984). p. 199Morson and Emerson (1990). p. 147 ===Single-voiced discourse=== In his analysis Bakhtin distinguishes between single-voiced and double-voiced discourse. Single-voiced discourse always retains \\"ultimate semantic authority\\" for itself: it is not clouded by the presence of another word relative to its object. *Direct, unmediated discourse \\"recognizes only itself and its object, to which it strives to be maximally adequate.\\"Bakhtin (1984). p. 186 It exhibits an aspiration to absolute language, as if there could be no better, or indeed other, way of giving verbal form to the object. A metalinguistic analysis might reveal its contingency, but it has no interest whatsoever in such an analysis, and presents itself as the final word.Morson and Emerson (1990). p. 148 *\\"Represented\\" or \\"objectified\\" discourse emanates from an author/narrator but is presented in the form of a character, ostensibly one that is typical of a particular type of individual or social group. To the character herself the discourse is direct and unmediated, but the reader is aware that there is an objectification going on by virtue of the fact that there is a narrator presenting it to an audience. Despite the apparent duality, Bakhtin treats it as another form of single-voiced discourse since there is no dialogical relationship between the author and the character. That is, the character only lives as the author's objectification, not as an autonomous voice capable of dispute, agreement etc.Morson and Emerson (1990). p. 149 ===Double-voiced discourse=== In double-voiced discourse, another semantic intention, coincident with the speaker's own intention, is felt in the utterance. This second discourse (the \\"word of the other\\") can be either passive or active. When it is passive, the speaker is in control: the other's word is deliberately invoked for the speaker's own purposes. When it is active, the other's word does not submit to the speaker's will, and the speaker's discourse becomes fraught with the resistance, challenge and implied hostility of the second voice.Morson and Emerson (1990). p. 150 Passive double-voiced discourse *Stylization is an example of what Bakhtin calls unidirectional double-voiced discourse. The style of an earlier speaker is adopted because it is deemed to be correct and suitable to the intent of the present speaker. Though the aim is unidirectional, stylization is double-voiced because the style is adopted specifically because the speaker is in a dialogical relationship of agreement with the other, and wishes this relationship to be known. The agreement implies the possibility of disagreement, and thus casts \\"a slight shadow of objectification\\" over what was originally direct/unmediated discourse.Morson and Emerson (1990). p. 150‚Äì52 *Parody is an example of varidirectional discourse. In contrast to stylization, it introduces \\"a semantic intention that is directly opposed to the original one.\\"Bakhtin (1984). p. 193 It signifies not only disagreement but active hostility: a desire to repudiate or diminish the other's discourse is evident. The parodist will indicate his own hostility by deliberately accentuating or exaggerating the objectionable aspects of the other's discourse.Morson and Emerson (1990). p. 153 Related to parody is any kind of double-voiced use of someone else's words‚Äîin irony, mockery, ridicule, indignation, etc. *Skaz (Russian: the spoken word, oral discourse) in the Russian formalist school meant a form of writing that gives the impression of being spontaneously spoken. It re-creates the idiosyncrasies of oral discourse, often in dialect. Bakhtin distinguished between skaz as a form of objectified discourse (i.e. single-voiced), to be found in writers like Turgenev and Leskov, and parodistic skaz (double-voiced), to be found in works like Gogol's The Overcoat and Dostoevsky's Poor Folk.Morson and Emerson (1990). p. 154 Active double-voiced discourse *In hidden polemic, the speaker's discourse is apparently directed toward its own referential object, but it is structured so that it simultaneously attacks someone else's discourse on the same theme, about the same object. The other's discourse is not addressed openly, as in stylization or parody, but rather its existence is implied through the \\"polemical coloration\\" of the speaker's intonations and syntactic constructions: \\"One word acutely senses alongside it someone else's word speaking about the same object, and this awareness determines its structure.\\"Bakhtin (1984). p. 196 *A rejoinder in an intense dialogue, while directing itself toward its object, simultaneously reacts to, answers and anticipates the interlocutor's word. A variety of subtle semantic changes to one's own and the other's word can be detected in a rejoinder of this kind.Bakhtin (1984). p. 197 *Hidden dialogue is when a speaker is directly addressing, anticipating, reacting to another's discourse, but that other voice is not actually present in the dialogue‚Äîthe interlocutor's statements themselves are omitted, but they are implied in the speaker's responses to them. According to Bakhtin, hidden dialogue and hidden polemic are of great importance in all Dostoevsky's works, beginning with his earliest work, Poor Folk. The character of Makar Devushkin constructs his epistolary discourse around the imagined, but not actually present, rejoinders of an other voice. ==References== Category:Russian philosophy Category:Literary theory Category:Discourse analysis ","title":"Dialogue (Bakhtin)"},{"id":"61291621","text":"Prakash Punj or Bahu Uddeshiya Prakash Kendra and Udyan (Multi Purpose light centre and Garden) is under construction park at Guru Ka Bag near Bazzar samiti in Patna Sahib area. ==Overview== The Prakash Punj is being built at a cost of 54.16 crore to keep the memory of 350th prakash parv of Guru Gobind Singh over the land of 10 Acres.

Over his lifetime, his style changed from a strict Romanticism to an early type of Impressionism. == Biography == His father was Marie-Antoine Hervier (1783-after 1830), a painter of portrait miniatures who had studied with Jacques-Louis David and gave young Adolphe his first lessons. This was followed by studies with Charles Dusaulchoy (1781-1852), who was known for his many portraits of Napoleon.Annie Bauduin (1980), Adolphe Hervier : un artiste ind√©pendant entre le romantisme et l'impressionnisme, page 1 et suiv. He also frequented the workshop of L√©on Cogniet, who was an acquaintance of his father's. He began to produce his own works by the late 1830s. However, he wasn't able to exhibit at the Salon for the first time until 1849, having been rejected since at least 1840. Despite continued rejection, he would exhibit there on five later occasions, three times in the 1850s and, finally, in 1870. Following an unsuccessful sale in 1856, organized by Hervier himself at the H√¥tel Drouot, his work began to attract the attention of art critics, such as Champfleury and Philippe Burty, who was especially appreciative.Cit√© par Henri Beraldi, ¬´ Hervier ¬ª in Les Graveurs du XIXe si√®cle : guide de l'amateur d'estampes modernes, vol. VIII, Paris, Conquet, 1885-1892, note pg.111. In addition to his numerous oil and watercolor paintings, he produced engravings by etching, aquatint and lithography. Despite being Parisian, his favorite painting locations were in Normandy; including Honfleur, Le Havre, Rouen and Granville. Camille Corot helped promote his work, but he made little money and was employed painting landscape backgrounds for more prestigious artists; notably Charles √âdouard Armand-Dumaresq.Short biography @ the Oxford Index. He never married and, upon his death, his estate went to his mother and brother. Albums of his engravings were published in 1888 and 1896, but he was largely forgotten until January 1909, when an influential art magazine, The Studio, devoted an entire issue to him. His paintings may be seen at the Mus√©e des beaux-arts de Dijon and the Mus√©e Lambinet. The Louvre has a collection of his prints and drawings. ==Selected works== File:Hervier-Interior.jpgPeasant Interior File:Adolphe Hervier Le Potiron.pngThe Pumpkin File:Hervier- Village.jpgVillage Scene File:Hervier-Piggery.jpgThe Piggery File:Hervier- Farmyard.jpgFarmyard == References  Further reading == * Annie Bauduin, Adolphe Hervier, un artiste ind√©pendant entre le romantisme et l'impressionnisme, Villeneuve d'Ascq, Universit√© de Lille III, 1980, ‚Äî fr.

She lost her father at the age of two, and a year later, her older sister Margherita died also. The following year, his mother Caterina died of sorrow. Maria and her sister Ida went to live in Sogliano al Rubicone, to their maternal aunt Rita Vincenzi Alloccatelli. Maria assisted her brother Giovanni, doing everything in her power to support him in his literary work until his death in 1912. Pascoli made her his legatee. She lived for more than forty years, taking care of her memoirs and archival documents as well as her correspondence. She thus made a fundamental contribution to the knowledge of the details of her life. She stayed in the villa of Castelvecchio, keeping many notes and memories in her diaries. She spontaneously approached fascism and went to Rome twice to meet Benito Mussolini, who also visited her at Casa del Poeta in 1930. When she died in 1953, Maria bequeathed by will \\"the house, the chapel, the books, the papers of her brother Giovanni, the family memories and other things of the house\\" to the municipality of Barga.

The group came to public notice after a Facebook video was widely shared in which masked and armed members called for the overthrowing of Costa Rica's government. Judicial authorities quickly reacted and the Organismo de Investigaci√≥n Judicial quickly identifies the spokesperson's voice and location, arresting three suspects all with previous convictions for different crimes. ==Video== On July 7, 2019 the group released a video on social media taking advantage of a pro-government demonstration that same day, and congratulating the focus of trade unions and student protests in recent days. Who allegedly would be the group's leader Alvaro Sequeira Mendiola calls on the Public Force and the general population to take up arms against the government of Carlos Alvarado Quesada and the deputies of the Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica, threatening to send the former into exile not to resign voluntarily. The video was condemned both by the President of the Republic, Carlos Alvarado, and by the main opposition party, the National Liberation Party. However, others such as the lawyer and right-wing presidential candidate Juan Diego Castro rejected the veracity of the video and accused the government of being behind it, claims that were proven false. ==Captures== The government of Costa Rica filed an official complaint with the Public Prosecutor for the crimes of sedition and mutiny, contemplated in the Costa Rican Criminal Code as creditors of sentences of up to four years in prison. In a joint work of the Ministry of Public Security by Michael Soto Rojas, the Directorate of Intelligence and Security led by Eduardo Trejos Lalli and the Judicial Investigation Agency directed by W√°lter Espinoza, it was possible to identify by voice the authors of the video, who had a criminal record. The group was coordinated through a WhatsApp group. The video was recorded in La Espa√±olita de Santa Rita in a farm and Christian center called \\"La Trinidad\\" belonging to Mas√≠s and used as a place for religious meetings. Mendiola who is known by the alias \\"Captain Carabina\\" and \\"Captain Miguel\\" has a long-lasting activity in subversive groups including the terrorist organization \\"Armed Wing of the People\\" and was candidate for mayor of Aserr√≠ in the far-right Evangelical Christian party Costa Rican Renewal. Mendiola has a pending sentence of twelve years in prison for illicit association, fraud and illegal carrying of arms. His stepson and co-accused Jeffrey Gabriel Fern√°ndez Ram√≠rez has a record of deprivation of liberty, damages and attempted homicide. Mas√≠s, who supplied the premises where they met and where explosives, weapons and drugs were found, was previously convicted for his crimes as commander of the Cobra Command that killed two indigenous peasants and raped two women of the same ethnic group. He was arrested while on his property with Costa Rican pro-Palestinian activist Tatiana Gamboa Freer who rose to fame for his expulsion from Israel. Gamboa is not included among the suspects of belonging to the group. Mas√≠s had to be hospitalized due to health problems caused by the tension during the raid and arrest. The suspects were given three months of preventive detention as requested by the Office of Drug Trafficking and Related Offenses. ==References== Category:Paramilitary organizations Category:Far-right politics in Costa Rica ","title":"July 7 Patriot Front"},{"id":"61292363","text":"Will Reilly (born December 3, 2002) is an American soccer player who plays for Atlanta United 2 in the USL Championship via the Atlanta United academy. == Club career == On July 13, 2019, Reilly appeared for Atlanta United 2, the USL Championship affiliate of Atlanta United FC, appearing as a half-time substitute in an 8‚Äì1 loss to New York Red Bulls II. == References External links== * Category:2002 births Category:Living people Category:American soccer players Category:Association football midfielders Category:Atlanta United 2 players Category:Soccer players from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:USL Championship players Category:People from Decatur, Georgia ","title":"Will Reilly"},{"id":"61292373","text":"General Francis Augustus Eliott, 2nd Baron Heathfield (31 December 1750 ‚Äì 26 January 1813) was a senior British Army officer. ==Military career== Heathfield was a soldier who served as lieutenant-colonel of the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons.

None of the sources consulted provides any insight either into a mechanism of Elizalde's political elevation or this of his political demise.Elizalde was one of 79 traditionalists in the Francoist Cortes, some 3% of the total, Miguel Angel Gim√©nez Mart√≠nez, Las Cortes de Franco o el Parlamento imposible, [in:] Trocadero: Revista de historia moderna y contemporanea 27 (2015), p. 78 There are no details available referring to his 1954-1958 Consejo Nacionala detailed study on Consejo Nacional does not mention Elizalde, see Miguel √Ångel Gim√©nez Mart√≠nez, El Consejo Nacional del Movimientola \\"c√°mara de las ideas\\" del franquismo, [in:] Investigaciones hist√≥ricas: √âpoca moderna y contempor√°nea 35 (2015), pp. 271-297 or Cortes activity.a study on the Francoist Cortes ignores Elizalde, see Gim√©nez Mart√≠nez 2015 He was not noted in newspapers of the era; the only case his name appeared in the press was related to Elizalde's own article in Punta Europa, a Traditionalist periodical headed by V√≠cente Marrero.Jes√∫s Elizalde, La fiesta de los M√°rtires de la Tradici√≥n, [in:] Punta Europa 1956/3, pp. 18-20, available here It is not clear whether cessation of Elizalde's Cortes career had anything to do with a so-called Acto de Estoril of 1957, when some 50 Traditionalists visited Don Juan and declared him the legitimate Carlist heir.Alcal√° 2001, p. 139, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 24, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 302, Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 186 Due to his wartime record and former position in the Navarrese executive Elizalde was among the most eminent ‚Äúestorilos‚Äù; the act completed his 15-year journey to the Juanista camp and confirmed his definitive breakup with the Javierista branch of Carlism. However, it proved to have been Elizalde's political swan song. He did not enter Consejo Privado or other institutions grouping politicians from Don Juan's inner circle, and he soon disappeared from public life altogether; it is not clear whether he was marginalized or deliberately withdrew into privacy. Barely 50-year-old, he was no longer featured in the media and is not listed by historiographic works as engaged in politics, be it in the Francoist, Juanista or Carlist structures. The exception is an episode from 1967, when he briefly served as vice-president of Hermandad de Cristo Rey de Requet√©s Ex-Combatientes, a pro-Juanista organisation of Carlist wartime volunteers.ABC 12.10.67, available here ==See also== * Carlism * Traditionalism (Spain) * Carlo-francoism ==FootnotesFurther reading== * Martin Blinkhorn, Carlism and Crisis in Spain 1931-1939, Cambridge 2008, ==External links== * Elizalde at the official Cortes service * Category:Carlists Category:Members of the Congress of Deputies of the Second Spanish Republic Category:Members of the Cortes Espa√±olas Category:Navarrese people Category:Propagandists Category:Roman Catholic activists Category:Spanish anti-communists Category:Spanish lawyers Category:Spanish monarchists Category:Spanish people of the Spanish Civil War (National faction) Category:Spanish Roman Catholics Category:University of Zaragoza alumni ","title":"Jes√∫s Elizalde Sainz de Robles"},{"id":"61292501","text":"Picht is a surname.
