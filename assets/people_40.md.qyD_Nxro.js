It has also evolved into a pageantry for male impersonators, drag kings and trans men. == National pageants in the United States == National drag pageants became enmeshed within the gay community during the 1960s with a national circuit of pageants organized by Flawless Sabrina and have become increasingly prevalent since. Drag pageants were held in individual gay bars, and discothèques during the post Stonewall era. Drag pageants evolved independently, in the decade subsequent to the first gay Mardi Gras coronations. === Miss Gay America === Mirroring the format of the Miss America contest, the first national gay pageant Miss Gay America (MGA) was held in 1972 at the Watch Your Hat & Coat Saloon in Nashville, Tennessee, Nashville's first gay dance and show bar. Jerry Peek opened this bar in 1971, and it was an instant sensation, not only with gay patrons, but also with the straight crowd. Norma Kristie, state representative of Arkansas, was crowned as the winner of the 1973 Miss Gay America Pageant, and in 1975 Norman \\"Norma Kristie\\" Jones took ownership of the pageant from Jerry Peek, who founded the Miss Gay America Pageant. Norman Jones would form Norma Kristie, Inc. and operate the pageant and its network of preliminaries for the next 30 years. Since its inception, MGA has prided itself as a showcase for pure female impersonation: Contestants must be men who live as men, achieving a convincing feminine illusion solely through their own ingenuity, creativity, and resourcefulness. Bodily feminization via female hormones, breast implants, and/or injectable fillers such as liquid silicone is strictly forbidden (plastic surgery and fillers above the neck are permitted, however). An interview in male attire is a key component of the pageant; contestants are judged not only for their poise and articulateness but for their overall masculine presentation—points may be deducted for feminine aspects such as overly plucked eyebrows or long fingernails. In February 2005, the Miss Gay America pageantry system was purchased by Larry Tyger and Terry Eason of L & T Entertainment. Currently, contestants are judged in 5 categories: Male Interview, Solo Talent, Evening Gown, Stage Question & Answer, and Production Talent. On February 4, 2016, Michael Dutzer and Rob Mansman of Mad Angel Entertainment purchased the Miss Gay America pageant From L & T Entertainment.

The title was passed to the 2010 First Alternate, Coco Montrese, who was crowned in a special ceremony at The Grey Fox Nightclub in St. Louis, MO. * *5 Coti Collins is the longest competing Miss Gay America winner. His first appearance at Miss Gay America was in 1988 as the First Alternate from the Miss Gay West Virginia America franchise. ===Miss Continental=== As Miss Gay America grew in popularity and prestige, many professional female impersonators who lived full-time as women found they were unable to compete in the pageant due to its longstanding rule barring transgender contestants. Aside from the prestige of holding a national title, MGA afforded its winner guaranteed show bookings at every state preliminary held during the title year; thus, the MGA crown turned what was often local, part-time work into a full-time job. Because many trans women also use drag shows as a source of income, it was only natural that a pageantry system would evolve to meet their needs. In 1980, Chicago nightclub promoter Jim Flint, owner of the Baton Show Lounge, filled this void with the creation of the Miss Continental U.S.A. Pageant. Contestants were scored in interview, swim wear, talent, and evening gown; for the finalists, an on stage question. A number of notable winners either were \\"boy queens\\" at the time that they won or have never pursued gender transition—including Chilli Pepper, the first Miss Continental, Michelle Dupree, Miss Continental 1998, Naysha Lopez, Miss Continental, 2013 and Brooke Lynn Hytes, Miss Continental 2014-15—but over time the Continental Pageantry System became renowned for its \\"titty girls,\\" or pre-/non-operative transsexual contestants. On January 7, 2019 Jim Flint released a statement that Continental would be the second pageant out of the top 5 to allow post-operative contestant to compete in its pageants, the only other National System that allowed that until this time was All American Goddess. Today, Miss Continental has preliminaries representing various U.S. states as well as Canada and Europe.

On a preliminary level, the first MI crowned into the EOY system was Joey Paige, who captured the title of Kentucky EOY King at the preliminary pageant in Louisville on July 3, 2011. This was the only EOY MI prelim contest held that year. Michigan EOY also sent a representative to Nationals that year, Spacee Kadett, though Spacee was appointed the title in the state. The remaining contestants for the first EOY King contest entered as open competitors, and such open entry into EOY King competition continues to this day. In July 2011, after national competition, EOY crowned Spacee Kadett as the first national king in its system. Spacee's victory and reign of outrageous drag helped push drag kinging to a more daring and theatrical level across the US, and set a standard for kings in the EOY system. {  - !Year!!Titleholder!!First alternate!!Second alternates!!Notes - 2011Spacee KadettRichard Cranium - 2012MystikalSpikey Van Dykey Tanner Taylor - 2013Owen McCordMichael ChristianBruno Diaz - 2014Chase McGroinGunner Daimon Gatlyn - 2015ChaosBruno Diaz - 2016Preston DickersonJordan Reign Leo Scott - 2017Romeo WhiteRocky Valentino  - 2018Liam ScottScrappyChristian Gaye } =Femme Entertainer of the Year= In 2015, EOY promoters and owners expanded the contest to include the Femme counterparts with the first National Pageant held at the Connection Complex theatre. {  - !Year!!Titleholder!!First alternate!!Second alternate!!Notes - 2015Tymisha HarrisNova Loza Taylor Rene - 2016Bella Nicole HarlowIvy Les Vixens Nevaeh Sweetness - 2017Cass Marie DominoMiranda Casada Qtip Chanel - 2018Olivia JaneMiranda Casada Venus Envy } NEOY Pageantry / http://www.eoy.netClick Click Expose Gay Entertainment Media / http://www.clickclickexpose.com ===Miss Gay USofA=== Houston, Texas based MGA promoter Jerry Bird purchased the bankrupt Miss Gay USA pageant from former MGA Jimi Dee in 1985. Within a few years he took the pageant from a small twelve contestant affair to a national showcase with over eighty participants. In 1986, the first Miss Gay USA Naomi Sims crowned Michael Andrews. In the mid-1990s the pageant was renamed Miss Gay USofA after complaints and legal threats from the owner of Miss USA, Donald Trump, who placed a cease and desist order until verbiage could be agreed upon that allowed for both competitions to continue without confusion or discrimination. There have been a wide range of contestants in the Miss USofA System, and many USofA titleholders also count the Miss Gay America crown as accomplishments in female impersonation. These include: Naomi Sims, Miss Gay USA 1979 (Miss Gay America 1985); Michael Andrews, Miss Gay USA 1986 (Miss Gay America 1977); Jacquelyn DeVaroe, Miss Gay USofA 1997 (Miss Gay America 1994); Lauren Taylor, Miss Gay USofA 1998 (Miss Gay America 1997); Alyssa Edwards, Miss Gay USofA 2006 (Miss Gay America 2010, though Edwards was stripped of the title a few short months after winning the crown); Dominique Sanchez, Miss Gay USofA 2010 (Miss Gay America 2003); Luscious, Miss Gay USofA 2011 (Miss Gay America 2007), and, Asia O'Hara, Miss Gay USofA 2007 (Miss Gay America 2016). The following is the list of the winners of the Miss Gay U.S.A. Pageant — then a complete change of ownership — Miss Gay USA winners 1986 through 1994 and Miss Gay USofA winners from 1995 through present: Miss Gay USofA {  - !Year!!Titleholder!!First alternate!!Second alternate!!Third alternate!!Fourth alternate!!Location!!Notes - 1979Naomi SimsMichael AndrewsDina JacobsXXCrowned in Houston, TXDeceased - 1980Jahnau Reis (Jahna Steele)Dina JacobsRoski FernandezXXCrowned in Houston, TXDeceased - 1981Dina JacobsXXXXXNo Contest Held Dina carried over from the previous year - 1982Eartha KittOdessa BrownVonda DeLayneXXCrowned in Austin, TXDeceased - 1983Lady Nova Bernard??XXCrowned in Houston, TXDeceased - 1984Lisa King??XXCrowned in Atlanta, GADeceased - 1985No ContestXXXXXJerry Bird purchased the Miss Gay USA Pageant & became its promoter. - 1986Michael AndrewsTandi AndrewsTommie RossJerry HarperLauren BrachCrowned in Houston, TXDeceased - 1987Diana HuttonTiffany ArieagusTommie RossErica AdamsDina JacobsCrowned in Columbia, SCDeceased - 1988Tommie RossNetasha EdwardsCandi StrattonRita RossTina DeVoreCrowned in Indianapolis, INActive - 1989Netasha EdwardsCandi StrattonEddie DeeMonica MunroCarmella Marcella GarciaCrowned in St. Louis, MODeceased - 1990C’ezanne BlincoeRita RossBianca PaigeFarrah McCrayJamie MonroeCrowned in Louisville, KYActive - 1991Sable ChanelTandi AndrewsMahoganyRita RossAmber RichardsCrowned in Atlanta, GARetired - 1992Tandi AndrewsMahoganyBianca PaigeDenise DarcellSweet SavageCrowned in San Antonio, TXDeceased - 1993Sweet SavageNicole DuBoisJamie HunterCocoVictoria WestCrowned in San Antonio, TXDeceased - 1994CocoVictoria WestAmber RichardsNatasha RichardsTerryl Lynn FoxCrowned in St. Louis, MODeceased - Due to copyright threats from Donald Trump who was then co-owner of Miss USA/Miss Universe, the pageant was renamed Miss Gay USofA.

New competitions with new requirements brought a wider variety of performers to drag pageantry. Contests for plus-sized, mature and African American female impersonators became popular. ===All American Goddess=== This pageant system was created by Scott Gonyaw. Unlike the \\"Big Four\\" of drag pageantry, AAG welcomes postoperative trans women as contestants. *2007 - Latoya Bacall *2008 - India Ferrah *2009 - Candi Stratton *2010 - Alyssa Edwards *2011 - Alana Steele *2012 - Asia O'Hara *2013 - Brittany Moore *2014 - Sunny Dee-Lite *2015 - Dena Cass *2016 - Alexis Mateo *2017 - Antwanette Chanel Roberts *2018 - Nikki Vixxen *2019 - Tiffany T.

Though technically a state pageant, Miss Florida FI held prestige comparable to that of a national pageant for many years, with entertainers from around the U.S. vying for the crown, and guests and judges who included international celebrities. Before Miss Continental and Miss Gay USA (now Miss Gay USofA) were created, Miss Florida was the only major female- impersonation pageant that permitted trans women to compete. (Jim Flint, owner and founder of the Continental Pageantry System, has acknowledged Miss Florida as his inspiration for creating Miss Continental.) *1972 - Tricia Marie *1973 - Emoré DuBois *1974 - Roxanne Russell *1975 - Noly Greer *1976 - Hot Chocolate *1977 - Dana Manchester *1978 - Tiffany Arieagus *1979 - Rachaell Santoni *1980 - Tiffani Middlesexx *1981 - Nikki Adams *1982 - Dana Douglas *1983 - Victoria Lawrence *1984 - Chena Black *1985 - Amber Richards *1986 - Mahogany *1987 - Sandy Laurent *1988 - Lakesha Lucky *1989 - Shanté (Alexandra Billings) (see note below) *1990 - Chena Kelly *1991 - Bobbie Lake *1992 - Stephanie Shippae/Monica Munro (see note below) *1993 - Esmeralda Russell *1994 - Gloria Klein *1995 - Heather Fontaine *1996 - Jasmine Bonét *1997 - Electra *1998 - Erika Norell *1999 - Danielle Hunter *2000 - Amy DeMilo *2001 - Valentina *2002 - Tasha Long *2003 - Cézanne *2004 - Angelique Ali (dethroned) *2004 - Gina DiAngelo *2005 - Champagne Bordeaux *2006 - No contest *2007 - Victoria Michaels *2008–2013 - Inactive *2014 - Brittany Moore *2015 - Chasity Ross Boen *2016 - Shantell D'Marco *2017 - Kalah Mendoza *2018 - Jazell Barbie Royale *2019 - Kylee Hunter Miss Florida FI at Large *1988 - Angel Sheridan *1989 - Joey Brooks *1990 - Andrea Lovelace *1991 - Robin Knight (dethroned), Lola Lush *1992 - Luna *1993 - Alicia Brooks *1994 - Sierrah Foxx (Deceased) *1995 - Lorrie Del Mar *1996–1999 - Inactive *2000 - Carmella Marcella Garcia (Deceased) *2001 - Nicolette Ashton *2002 - Jasmine Skiies *2003 - No contest *2004 - Jocelyn Summers *2005 - Sasha Sommers *2006 - No contest *2007 - TP Lords *2008–2016 - Inactive *2017 - Nicole T.

An alternative pageant called Miss Florida State was held that year; Shanté (Alexandra Billings) was crowned the winner but is not officially recognized as a former Miss Florida FI. In 1992, ownership of the pageant again fell into dispute after the death of its second owner, René Rodriguez. This time, two competing pageants were held: Miss Florida FI, won by Stephanie Shippae ́, and National Miss Florida, won by Monica Munro. Monica is also unrecognized as an official former, but she walked in the Parade of Miss Floridas that opened the 2001 pageant at the invitation of the owners. ===Miss National, Miss National At Large, Mr. National=== This pageant was a huge part of the \\"Big 5\\" National pageant systems in the 1990s and early 2000s. It was created by Kevin Scott in 1994. The first winner was Tandi Andrews, but she was decrowned because she requested to run for another national pageant during her National reign. Her request was denied, she ran for that pageant regardless and was then decrowned. Tommie Ross assumed the crown. The last winners were Natasha Richards in 2003 for Miss National, Chelsea Pearl in 2002 for Miss National at Large, and Monte St. James in 2002 for Mr. National. In 2009, two people from Alabama attempted to purchase the contest and appointed Mokha Montrese as Miss National 2009. That sale fell through and was never completed. The system is now owned by Josh Maywalt. In 2018, ShaeShae LaReese won the title of Miss National 2018. All three divisions will return to the stage in 2021. *1994 - Tandi Andrews (DeCrowned) & (Deceased) *1994 - Tommie Ross *1995 - Tasha Long *1996 - Tamisha Iman *1997 - C'ezanne *1998 - Ashley Kruiz (Deceased) *1999 - Shawnna Brooks *2000 - Terri Vanessa Coleman *2001 - Nicole DuBois *2002 - Martina Diamante *2003 - Natasha Richards (Deceased) *2004 - 2008 - Inactive *2009 - Mokha Montrese *2010 - 2017 - Inactive *2018 - ShaeShae LaReese *2019 - No Contest *2020 - No pageant due to COVID-19 Miss National at Large *1996 - Sierrah Foxx (Deceased) *1997 - Niesha Dupree *1998 - Clarissa Cavalier (Deceased) *1999 - Darcel Stevens *2000 - Latoya Bacall *2001 - Monica Van Pelt *2002 - Chelsea Pearl *2003 - 2018 - Inactive *2019 - No Contest *2020 - No pageant due to COVID-19 *2021 - Dena Cass Mr. National *2000 - Carl Harris *2001 - Calvin St. Claire *2002 - Monte St. James *2003 - 2018 - Inactive *2019 - No Contest *2020 - No pageant due to COVID-19 *2021 - Mykul J.

This closed in the late 1950s with the exception of a short freight only section from Gasselternijveen to Buinen which closed at the same time as Assen - Stadskanaal (early 1960s). Although the tracks have been removed, the remains of the track beds of both lines are still visible in the landscape.

He was born in Acireale and graduated in physics in Catania in 1951. He began working with Luigi Fantappiè on what they called projective relativity at the Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica in Rome. In 1958 he won a scholarship to the Istituto H.

His most important contribution concerns a general method for the construction of unified field theories in physics... Since then, physicists have tried, without much success, to repeat the firm Maxwell, looking for a single unified theory and ultimately that was supposed to merge into a single entity, in addition to the electric field and magnetic field, all other fields Known in physics, from gravity to the nuclear industry. The great idea of Arcidiacono, in this respect has been to abandon a priori looking for a unique and definitive theory, to focus, instead, on how to build an entire class of unified theories, arranged in hierarchical order, in so that every theory is the generalization, or perfection, than immediately before. The construction method proposed by him was obtained through a thorough analysis of the logical transition from classical mechanics of Newton to Einstein's Relativity Restricted. This method has enabled him to build two successive generalizations of Restricted Relativity, known as projective Relativity and Relativity Compliant. In the first field is unified with the hydrodynamic field and the second is the unification of the electromagnetic field, as the hydrodynamic and gravitational.\\" Also notable for the books he has written: * Entropia, sintropia, informazione.

Species in the family have a widespread distribution, ranging from the Arctic, (Rhizomarasmius), to the tropics, e.g. Gloiocephala, and from marine sites (Mycaureola) and fresh waters (Gloiocephala) to semiarid forests (Xerula). ==Description== Most species in the Physalacriaceae form fruit bodies with caps and stipes. They have a monomitic hyphal system (wherein only generative hypha are produced), and clamp connections are present in the hyphae. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped with two to four sterigmata. The basidiospores generally have ellipsoidal, spindle-like (fusiform), cylindrical, or tear-drop (lacrimiform) shapes; they are thin-walled, hyaline, and do not react with Melzer's reagent. The family also contains corticioid fungi (in genus Cylindrobasidium) and a secotioid species (Guyanagaster necrorhiza). ==Taxonomy== The family was originally defined by English mycologist E.J.H. Corner in 1970 and revised in 1985 by Jacques Berthier but neither author anticipated the application to a molecularly defined group of agarics first identified by Moncalvo and others in 2002.

He authored several screenplays, over forty novels, short stories, travel and autobiographic books and essays. He was introduced to the literary circles as the author of radio, TV and theater drama at the beginning of the sixties. His books have been translated to twenty languages. The shorts stories collection Kinoteka at three and novels The Green Felt of Montenegro and The Last Flight to Sarajevo were published in French by L'Age d'homme in Lausanne while The Mastery of Šlomović was published by Xenie in Vevey. His paintings were exhibited in New York, Boston, Geneva, Frankfurt, London and other cities.Dejan Stojanović (1990-11-09). \\"Pogledi issue #70, pp. 46-47\\" (in Serbo-Croatian). He was also known as an illustrator, illustrating his own and numerous books by other authors. He was a regular member of the Academy of Sciences and Arts of Republika Srpska. ==Early life== Kapor was born in 1937 in Sarajevo, Drina Banovina, Kingdom of Yugoslavia. His father, Gojko Kapor, was a bank clerk, and his mother, Bojana was a housewife. In 1941, during World War II, a bomb fell on the home in which Kapor, his grandmother, and his mother were taking refuge. Kapor's mother used her body as a shield and, although she was killed, Kapor was able to survive. He reflected back on that day, remembering that even the little cat, which he held in his arms, died. Kapor knew very little about his mother since not much was said in his family. Immediately following World War II, Kapor moved with his family to Belgrade, Serbia where he remained for most of his life. ==Education== As a young man, Kapor studied painting at the Academy of Art in Belgrade under the guidance of Professor Nedeljko Gvozdenović. Although Kapor graduated with a degree in painting, he had grown fond of writing as a young boy. Therefore, while studying art he also occupied his time with news writing. Kapor would write news articles and interviews and then accompany his writing with his own representative portrait or illustration. It is through this method that Kapor was able to combine his two greatest passions he had in life, painting and writing. ==Literary works== Kapor is one of the most popular Serbian writers, whose literary phenomenon has spread over three decades. Kapor easily attracted the attention of the public by writing his constant reflections on the reality of the current time. The generations of people from former Yugoslavia were connected through Kapor's writings which have become best sellers in Zagreb's publisher \\"Znanje\\" and its famous library \\"Hit\\". Kapor also wrote many documentary films, television shows, and novels. His novels, \\"Una\\" and \\"The Book of Complaints\\" were made into films. These films have been translated into many languages including: French, German, Polish, Czech, Bulgarian, Hungarian, Slovenian, and Swedish. His most famous works include, \\"Ada\\", \\"Zoe\\", \\"From Seven to Three\\", and \\"The Chronicle of a Lost City\\". ==Artwork== Kapor has exhibited many of his paintings across various countries such as in the United States, Germany, and France. The reason he preferred to showcase his artwork in foreign countries rather than in Belgrade was that he did not enjoy the \\"art climate\\" set in Belgrade. He felt that many great artists in Belgrade were forgotten, whereas in other countries, a new emerging artist does not \\"erase\\" those who came before him/her. ==Death== After having two surgeries, Kapor died from throat cancer on 3 March 2010. ==Works== A 2020 post card featuring Kapor's artwork (left) and self-portrait (right) *Foliranti, 1975 *Provincijalac, 1976 *Ada, 1977 *Lanjski snegovi, 1977 *Hej, nisam ti to pričala, 1978 *Zoe, 1978 *Beleške jedne Ane (hronika u 26 glava), 1978 *Skitam i pričam: putopisni dnevnik, 1979 *101 priča, 1980 *Una: ljubavni roman, 1981 *Onda, 1982 *Sentimentalno vaspitanje, 1983 *Knjiga žalbi, 1984 *011-Istok-Zapad, 1990 *Halo, Beograd, 1990 *Dama skitnica i off priče, 1992 *Zelena čoja Montenegra, 1992 *Blokada 011, 1992 *100 nedelja blokade, 1994 *Lero – kralj leptira, 1995 *Poslednji let za Sarajevo, 1995 *Hronika izgubljenog grada, 1996 *Od sedam do tri, 1996 *Smrt ne boli: priče iz poslednjeg rata, 1997 *Najbolje godine i druge priče, 1997 *Ivana, 2001 *Od istog pisca, 2001 *Legenda o Taboru, 2002 *Sanja, 2003 *Čuvar adrese *Dosije Šlomović *Konte *Lep dan za umiranje *Ljubavne priče *Samac *Uspomene jednog crtača *Eldorado *Putopis kroz biografiju ==References* Category:1937 births Category:2010 deaths Category:People from Sarajevo Category:Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Serbian writers Category:Serbian painters Category:Writers who illustrated their own writing Category:Members of the Academy of Sciences and Arts of the Republika Srpska Category:Deaths from cancer in Serbia Category:Deaths from throat cancer Category:Burials at Belgrade New Cemetery ","title":"Momo Kapor"},{"id":"20544928","text":"thumb Michael Hochberg (born 1980) is an American physicist.

While at the CU-Boulder, he was the director of the Collaboration Technology Research Group and a member of the Institute of Cognitive Science. Ellis was the first African-American to earn a Ph.D. in Computer Science (1969), and the first African-American to be elected a Fellow of the ACM (1997). Ellis was a pioneer in Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Groupware. He and his team at Xerox PARC created OfficeTalk, one of the first groupware systems. Ellis also pioneered Operational Transformation, which is a set of techniques that enables real- time collaborative editing of documents. ==Childhood== In 1958, at age 15, Ellis applied for a job as a graveyard shift computer operator at the manufacturing firm Dover to earn money to help his family. He was offered the job because he was the only applicant. Although his job title was computer operator, his main duties were to walk around all night and be visible to prevent break-ins, and to watch over, but not touch, the company's new computer. At the time, Dover's computer was based on vacuum tube technology (2,400 vacuum tubes), used punch cards as input and output, and filled an extremely large room. In Ellis' free time on the job, he read and re-read the dozens of computer manuals that came with the machine. He taught himself as much as possible about the machine without touching it. Two months after he started the job, Ellis helped the company through an emergency. They had run out of unused punch cards, and needed to use the computer to process payroll by morning. During the emergency, Ellis was the only one who knew how to recycle the used punch cards. He lifted the hood of the computer and disabled the parity check circuitry. The used punch cards were recycled and the company was able to process the payroll. After this experience, the company began to seek him out whenever they had computer problems, and even asked him to operate and program the computer for them. Ellis states that this experience helped ignite his passion for computing. ==High school and college== Throughout high school, Ellis' teachers recommended that he attend summer school programs at the local universities in Chicago. This was his first encounter with college-level students and university life. Though poor, Ellis was able to attend Beloit College in the fall of 1960 because the church he and his family attended awarded him a scholarship. In Ellis' junior year, Beloit College received an IBM 1620 as a donation, and he and his chemistry professor were asked to set it up. This was the start of the Beloit College computer lab, of which Ellis was the director. During the early 1960s, Beloit didn't offer a degree in computer science, however, Ellis was able to substitute some of his science laboratory work with computer projects. In 1964, Ellis received a B.S. degree from Beloit double majoring in math and physics. After graduating from Beloit, Ellis enrolled in MIT for graduate school, but only stayed a short time because of his civil rights activism. He eventually attended graduate school at the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign, where he worked on hardware, software, and applications of the ILLIAC IV supercomputer. In 1969, Clarence Ellis earned a Ph.D. in computer science from UIUC, becoming the first African-American to do so. His Ph.D. advisor was David E. Muller. ==Career== Ellis worked at Bell Labs from 1969 to 1972 on probability theory applied to the theory of computing. In 1972 he became an assistant professor and a founding member of the computer science department at the University of Colorado Boulder to work on operating systems research. Ellis accepted a position three years later as an assistant professor in EECS at MIT to work on research related to ARPANET. He left MIT after one year to start work at Xerox PARC and Stanford University. Ellis remained at Xerox PARC and Stanford University for nearly a decade. During his time there, he worked on the icon-based GUI, object-oriented programming languages, and groupware systems. \\"He was part of the team of sociologists, psychologists and computer scientists who worked on Alto, the world’s first personal computer (PC) and its related interfaces and software. Many of these innovations from the 1970s that Ellis was part of were later widely commercialized, for example in Apple’s Lisa computer and Microsoft’s MS-DOS software. At PARC, Ellis headed the Office Research Group, which developed the first office system to use icons and Ethernet for collaborating at a distance.”Neil. (2019, May 20).

Retrieved Sept 16, 2020 from: https://medium.com/@bedstuyguy/clarence-skip-ellis-the-first-black-ph-d-in- computer-science-6ccae49b148 In the mid-1980s, Ellis led the Groupware Research Group at the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation (MCC). While at MCC, he led efforts in Real-time Collaborative Editing, and pioneered the field of Operational transformation. In the early 1990s, Ellis left MCC to become the Chief Architect of the FlowPath workflow product of Bull S.A. in France. In 1992, Ellis returned to the University of Colorado Boulder as full professor with tenure in the computer science department. There he continued his work on groupware, in particular next-generation, large-scale Workflow systems, and agent-mediated meeting support systems. In 2009, he became an emeritus professor at the University, where he insisted on periodically teaching an introductory computing course to “encourage students of all ethnicities to expand their horizons.\\" Lum, L. (2002). Expanding Horizons: Clarence \\"Skip\\" Ellis. Diverse Issues in Higher Education, 19(1), 37. To provide further opportunities for students to pursue science and engineering, Ellis “helped establish the 10-week Summer Multicultural Access to Research Training (SMART) program at the university.” In 2013, Ellis won a Fulbright Scholarship to teach and perform research in the computer science department at Ashesi University. At Ashesi, his research interests were developing computer systems to simulate alternative forms of government for developing countries. ==Death== Ellis dedicated much of his work in later years to Ashesi University in Accra, Ghana. He died unexpectedly at the age of 71 of a pulmonary embolism during a flight home from Ghana on May 17, 2014. ==References== Category:1943 births Category:African-American computer scientists Category:American computer scientists Category:Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery Category:University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign alumni Category:Beloit College alumni Category:University of Colorado Boulder faculty Category:Ashesi University faculty Category:2014 deaths Category:Scientists at PARC (company) Category:Academics from Illinois ","title":"Clarence Ellis (computer scientist)"},{"id":"20544959","text":"Lonemore () is a crofting village on the north shore of Gair Loch near the village of Gairloch, Ross-shire, Scottish Highlands and is in the Scottish council area of Highland.

Broadcasting on 103.3FM from the Bow Brickhill transmitter, the station was part of Global Radio's Heart Network. The station's flagship shows were Heart Breakfast with Wes Venn and Heart Drivetime with Lucy Ellis. ==History== The station was launched as Horizon Radio by Chris Pearson in October 1989 as sister station to neighbouring Chiltern Radio and part of The Chiltern Radio Network. It was subsequently rebranded as 'Horizon Radio, The Hotter Mix' in 1992. The first song played was \\"The Only Way Is Up\\" by Yazz and the Plastic Population. The station was later re-branded as FM 103 Horizon in 1995, following the purchase of the Chiltern Radio Network by the GWR radio group, before changing back to Horizon Radio in 2006 and finally, Heart in January 2009. The name, Horizon Radio, had no real significance other than being an idea created when the station launched, due to the aerial view and 'horizon' seen from the transmitter location at Bow Brickhill, some 7 miles South East of the city. ==Sports coverage== During the 2008-09 football season, the station's predecessor Horizon Radio secured a deal with the MK Dons football club to broadcast live match commentary for both home and away matches which continued following the Heart rebrand; the Dons competing in the Coca-Cola League 1.

For example, it can be localized, commonly to the hands and feet (localized pustular psoriasis), or generalized with widespread patches appearing randomly on any part of the body (generalized pustular psoriasis). However, all forms of pustular psoriasis share in common the presence of red and tender blotchy skin covered with pustules. Pustular psoriasis can be localized, commonly to the hands and feet (palmoplantar pustulosis), or generalized with widespread patches occurring randomly on any part of the body. Acrodermatitis continua is a form of localized psoriasis limited to the fingers and toes that may spread to the hands and feet. Pustulosis palmaris et plantaris is another form of localized pustular psoriasis similar to acrodermatitis continua with pustules erupting from red, tender, scaly skin found on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. Generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) is also known as (von Zumbusch) acute generalized pustular psoriasis in acute cases, and as impetigo herpetiformis during pregnancy. GPP is a rare and severe form of psoriasis that may require hospitalization. This form of psoriasis is characterized by an acute onset of numerous pustules on top of tender red skin. This skin eruption is often accompanied by a fever, muscle aches, nausea, and an elevated white blood cell count. Annular pustular psoriasis (APP), a rare form of GPP, is the most common type seen during childhood. APP tends to occur in women more frequently than in men, and is usually less severe than other forms of generalized pustular psoriasis such as impetigo herpetiformis. This form of psoriasis is characterized by ring-shaped plaques with pustules around the edges and yellow crusting. APP most often affects the torso, neck, arms, and legs. ==Diagnosis Classification === Pustular psoriasis is classified into two major forms: localized and generalized pustular psoriasis. Within these two categories there are several variants: {  !Classification of Localized and Generalized Pustular Psoriasis - Localized pustular psoriasis * Palmoplantar pustulosis (acute and chronic) * Acrodermatitis continua (of Hallopeau) - Generalized pustular psoriasis * (von Zumbusch) acute generalized pustular psoriasis * Acute generalized pustular psoriasis of pregnancy (impetigo herpetiformis) * Infantile and juvenile * Subacute circinate and annular } ==Management== injection of methotrexate ==References External links == Category:Psoriasis ","title":"Pustular psoriasis"},{"id":"20545008","text":"Lonemore () is a village on the north shore of the Dornoch Firth in Sutherland, Scottish Highlands and is in the Scottish council area of Highland.

During that time, he also studied for and received his semicha from the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary of Yeshiva University, which was awarded in 1934, signed by Rabbis Bernard Revel and Moshe Soloveichik. Rackman practiced law for nine years before his religious service in the military. During that period, he would serve for occasional weekends as a rabbi at communities in Glen Cove and Lynbrook, New York.Dugan, George. \\"Dean of Orthodox Rabbis; Emanuel Rackman\\", The New York Times, March 3, 1977. Accessed December 4, 2008. Rackman entered service during World War II in the United States Army Air Forces in 1943 as a chaplain. He served as a military aide to the European Theater of Operations special adviser on Jewish affairs, where his experiences with survivors of the Holocaust influenced his decision to pursue the rabbinate.Grimes, William. \\"Emanuel Rackman, Prominent Rabbi, Dies at 98\\", The New York Times, December 4, 2008. Accessed December 8, 2008. Rackman was the eighth in as many generations to earn rabbinic ordination, but the first to earn a living as a rabbi. He said that \\"it was my father's hope that I would continue the family tradition, insofar as I could be both learned in the Jewish tradition while making a living in another way\\". In the 1950s, the United States Air Force Reserve denied Rabbi Rackman's security clearance, citing him as a \\"bad risk\\". In a 1977 profile in The New York Times, Rackman cited his opposition to the death penalty for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and his support for Paul Robeson as factors behind the decision. Offered the opportunity to resign or face a military tribunal, the Rabbi chose a court martial, where he was acquitted and was shortly thereafter promoted from major to lieutenant colonel.

After a trip to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union in 1956 as part of a group from the Rabbinical Council of America, Rackman was part of a group of New York-area Rabbis who reported that their experience \\"leads us to the melancholy conclusion that Judaism in Russia is seriously threatened with extinction\\", despite improvements in the preceding years for Soviet Jewry. The group noted that the conditions for Jews in Poland were far better, with a government that was actively friendly with the Jewish community there.Salisbury, Harrison E. \\"U.S. Rabbis Fear Soviet Jews Face Extinction of Religious Life; But Group Back from Russian Visit Cites Some Progress in Last Two Years--No Yiddish Institutions Found Hopeful of a Trend Improvement Noted Poles Chide Soviet on Jews\\", The New York Times, July 13, 1956.

In 1969, Rackman praised the JDL, claiming that in many instances \\"the Jewish Defense League has demonstrated its ability to be the instrument presently required by the Jewish community.\\" In 1970, he was named as provost of Yeshiva University. He was the president of Bar-Ilan University from 1977 until 1986, succeeding Max Jammer and succeeded by Michael Albeck, and served as the school's chancellor until his death. Rackman worked to address the situation of agunot through the establishment in the early 1990s of the Beit Din L'Ba'ayot Agunot (Court for the Problems of Chained Women), which annulled the marriages of hundreds of women, freeing them to remarry. The court, and its methodology, was widely criticized by other Orthodox rabbis, many of whom would refuse to officiate at the marriage ceremonies of women whose prior marriage had been ended by this form of annulment. Criticism came from across the Orthodox spectrum, with the Haredi Agudath Israel of America calling the court's halachic basis \\"spurious\\" and British Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks claiming that Rackman's solution exacerbated the problem it was trying to solve. == Personal == Rackman married the former Ruth Fishman in 1930.

The Palatine Maximilian Railway also included a branch (the Winden–Karlsruhe railway) from Winden via Wörth and the Maxaubahn to Karlsruhe. == Overview == It was named by the Palatine Maximilian Railway Company, who had built the line, in honour of the reigning King of Bavaria at that time, King Maximilian II. Built as a transit route, the line acted as part of a long-distance, north-south, trunk route for the first few decades. It lost this important role completely in 1930, whilst the Winden−Karlsruhe section, originally built as a branch, experienced an upturn, as a consequence of which the Winden−Wissembourg section in particular was sidelined. As a result, passenger services on the latter ceased in 1975, but were reinstated in 1997. Goods traffic on the Maximiliansbahn reduced sharply from the 1990s. == Route == Apart from the Winden–Wörth and Winden–Wissembourg sections the line is double-tracked throughout. From Neustadt to Winden in runs mostly past the vineyards along the German Wine Route in the Palatinate, which however peter out towards the south. The Palatine Forest however remains constantly in its view. On the Winden–Wissembourg section, it passes for most of its length the heathlands, the so-called \\"cattle belt\\" (Viehstrich) and runs along the western edge of the Bienwald forest. The Winden–Karlsruhe section runs as far as Kandel through farming country and, between Kandel and Wörth cuts through the Bienwald. Crossing the Rhine it passes Rheinauen and the edge of Knielingen, before the former Hardt Railway (Graben-Neudorf – Eggenstein – Karlsruhe) joins the Maxbahn and together they run via the stations of Karlsruhe-Mühlburg and Karlsruhe-West to reach Karlsruhe Hauptbahnhof, the city's main station where they end either at platform 1 or 101. Between Wörth and Karlsruhe the line is electrified. The railway runs through various rural counties (Landkreise): The stations from Neustadt an der Weinstrasse to Rohrbach and from Steinfeld to Schweighofen are – with the exception of the independent towns (Kreisfreie Stadt) of Neustadt an der Weinstrasse and Landau – in the county of Südliche Weinstrasse, the stations from Steinweiler to Maximiliansau Eisenbahnstrasse and Schaidt in the county of Germersheim; the stations from Maxau to Karlsruhe Hauptbahnhof in the city of Karlsruhe, and Wissembourg in the French county (Arrondissement) of Wissembourg in the Département of Bas-Rhin. == History  Planning and construction === The first deliberations over the construction of the line go back to 1829. The intention was a trunk route from Strasbourg to Mainz, that would form a counterpart, west of the Rhine, to a railway from Mannheim to Basle. It was discussed at length, whether it was more pressing and desirable to build a route through the uplands from Neustadt via Landau to Wissembourg or to establish a railway line along the Rhine via Speyer, Germersheim and Wörth. The military in particular favoured a course that ran along the edge of the Palatine Forest. In any case the political events of 1848 meant the project came to a standstill. In January 1850 a brochure appeared in Neustadt an der Haardt (now Neustadt an der Weinstrasse) which pushed for a railway via Landau to Wissembourg and in which it was argued amongst other things should serve the larger townships rather than those immediately alongside the Rhine. In 1852 the decision finally fell in favour of the higher route after expert opinion and studies had been conducted in the spring. On 3 November that same year the Bavarian king, Maximilian II, gave the green light for the construction, by approving the foundation of a limited company (Aktiengesellschaft), that was to set the project in motion. The Maximilian Railway was built by Paul Camille von Denis, who had already been responsible for building the Palatine Ludwig Railway from Saarbrücken to the Rheinschanze (today: Ludwigshafen), from which the railway branched. The cost of building the railway came to four million Gulden in all. Finally negotiations took place over the land to be used with the communities that the line would affect; in addition railway construction in the area of Landau was particularly difficult, because at that time it there was a fortification on the terrain intended for the railway. === The Maximilian Railway Company era (1855–1909) === On 18 July 1855 the section of line from Neustadt to Landau was opened, the Landau–Wissembourg section followed on 26 November 1855. On 14 March 1864 the Winden–Maximiliansau stretch was opened and on 8 May 1865 the link between Maximiliansau and the Baden Maxaubahn (Karlsruhe–Maxau) was completed. In 1867 the Neustadt to Winden section was doubled, primarily to meet the increase in north-south traffic. In 1871 the section between Winden and Wissembourg - now belonging to Germany and renamed Weißenburg - was also furnished with a double track. This measure was implemented against the background that the Palatinate was alarmed about the competition for long- distance services, especially from Prussia. The main station at Landau was rebuilt and considerably expanded in 1872 on the opening of the Lower Queich Valley railway (Untere Queichtalbahn - Germersheim–Landau). === Development to 1945 === On 1 January 1909 the Maximilian Railway was transferred, along with the other companies belonging to the Palatinate Railway to the ownership of the Royal Bavarian State Railways. At that time the Maximilian Railway together with the Ludwigshafen–Strasbourg railway were in competition with the Baden railways for long-distance traffic. The long-haul trains on the Maximilian Railway worked the Amsterdam – Cologne – Bingerbrück – Rockenhausen – Neustadt – Wissembourg – Strasbourg – Basle route. Once the First World War had broken out in 1914, scheduled services came to a standstill in order that the line could be guaranteed for military purposes. After the end of the war the Alsace was annexed by France under the terms of the Versailles Treaty. In particular the railway, that from 1920 was operated by the Deutsche Reichsbahngesellschaft (DRG), largely lost its importance for long-distance traffic, because from then on most of it switched to the eastern side of the Rhine. the occupation of the Palatinate by the French made operations even more difficult. From 1923 to 1924, a so-called Regiebetrieb (i.e. publicly owned but independently run) operation was set up that was answerable to France. The final demise of long-distance services came after the end of French occupation in 1930. After the end of the 1930s the main services on the Maximilian Railway flowed increasingly towards Karlsruhe, which is why in 1938 a fixed bridge across the Rhine was built between Maximiliansau and Karlsruhe for the first time; in addition the Saarbrücken–München express trains, that previously ran on the Lower Queich Valley railway from Landau to Germersheim, were routed from now on via Winden, Wörth and Karlsruhe. This switch meant that the Winden–Wissembourg section lost its importance, whilst the former branch to Karlsruhe experienced an upturn. At the beginning of 1945 traffic ceased as a result of the end of the Second World War. === The Deutsche Bahn era (since 1945) === After the Second World War the station building at Landau, that had suffered badly from the war, was gradually replaced by a brand new building. The second track on the section of line between Winden and Wörth was dismantled by the French occupying powers. In 1975 public transit ceased on the Winden–Wissembourg section, and it was finally reduced to a single track. View of Wissembourg station, the southern end of the Maximiliansbahn; the TER waits for the onward journey to Haguenau and Strasbourg Winden station after its modernisation in 2007 In 1985 express trains from Munich to Saarbrücken started running on the Karlsruhe–Landau line. These trains called at Landau in order to use the Queichtalbahn to Saarbrücken. After a shipping accident that occurred in 1987, a new bridge over the Rhine had to be built at Maxau. The bridge was opened on 29 April 1991 with one track and in 2000 was expanded to take a second track because it had become a bottleneck. The second track was opened to traffic on 12 May 2000. At the beginning of the 1990s the depot (Bahnbetriebswerk) in Landau was closed and knocked down. Landau marshalling yard also disappeared. In 1994 through traffic from Karlsruhe to Neustadt in Landau was interrupted for several years; instead trains were route via the Queichtalbahn Pirmasens–Landau as far as Neustadt. In addition in March 1997 the Winden–Wissembourg line was reactivated. In 2003 the main station at Neustadt was modernised as part of the introduction of RheinNeckar S-Bahn onto the Palatine Ludwig Railway. From 1 to 3 October 2005 steam trains belonging to the Ulmer Eisenbahnfreunde (UEF) ran on the Maxbahn on the occasion of its 150th anniversary. The steam trains travelled on a circuit: Neustadt – Landau – Winden – Karlsruhe – Graben-Neudorf – Germersheim – Speyer – Schifferstadt – Neustadt and also from Neustadt to Wissembourg. Some hauled the so-called Silberlings of the Deutsche Bahn (DB). Kandel station was upgraded just in time for these celebrations. == Operations  Timetable === Although through trains run today from Neustadt to Wissembourg, the Neustadt–Winden section today belongs operationally to the Neustadt–Karlsruhe line. The Karlsruhe–Neustadt railway is numbered KBS 676 and Winden–Wissembourg as KBS 679. A Regionalbahn (RB) and a Regionalexpress (RE) train run hourly from Karlsruhe to Neustadt and every hour a Regionalbahn train goes from Neustadt to Wissembourg, it does not stop between Landau and Winden however. The Regionalbahn trains from Karlsruhe to Neustadt stop at all the stations apart from Maximiliansau Eisenbahnstrasse and Maxau. Maximiliansau Eisenbahnstrasse and Maxau are served by the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn (light rail) line S5 (Wörth Dorschberg–Bietigheim-Bissingen), which follows the Maximilian Railway from Wörth to Maxau and switches to street running in the Karlsruhe district of Knielingen. On Sundays and public holidays from May to October five pairs of long distance regional and excursion trains run: * The Alsace Express (Elsass- Express) from Mainz Hauptbahnhof via the Alzey–Mainz railway and Palatine Northern Railway to Wissembourg. * The Rhine Valley Express (Rheintal-Express) from Karlsruhe via the Palatine Ludwig Railway, Alsenztalbahn, Nahetalbahn and West Rhine railway to Koblenz Hauptbahnhof. * The Wine Road Express (Weinstrassen-Express) from Koblenz Hauptbahnhof travelling in the opposite direction to the Rhine Valley Express to Wissembourg. * The Bundenthaler from Mannheim Hauptbahnhof via the Palatine Ludwig Railway and the Felsenland- Express from Karlsruhe Hauptbahnhof with the combined route via the Queichtalbahn and Wieslauterbahn to its terminus at Bundenthal-Rumbach. In addition a pair of trains under the name Strasbourg Express runs all year round at weekends without stopping from Neustadt to Strasbourg Gare Centrale. The Palatine Maximilian Railway can be used in the whole of the Rhineland- Palatinate and French sections with passes issued by the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Neckar including Maximiliansau Eisenbahnstrasse. The Karlsruher Verkehrsverbund is valid from Karlsruhe outwards on the entire line as far as Wissembourg and including Maikammer-Kirrweiler, where a transfer fare is available for the journey to Neustadt (Weinstrasse) Hauptbahnhof. === Motive power === Because the Rhine bridge between Karlsruhe and Wörth was initially a pontoon bridge, locomotives of the Palatine Class T 2.I were employed just to cross the river. Since 1997 Regionalexpress (RE) trains run on the Maximilians Railway stopping en route in Wörth, Kandel, Winden and Landau. Initially tilting trains of DB Class 611 were used. However they proved very unreliable and were replaced only a few years later by the DB Class 612, which has since been used for most RE trains on the line. Since the 1980s DB Class 628 engines have been used for Regionalbahn services, which in turn had replaced the earlier railbuses. DB Class 612 units usually power the Regionalexpress trains, more rarely seen are trains are hauled by DB Class 218 locomotives and comprising red-liveried Silberlings. Landau Hbf Goods train at Wörth station Goods train at Landau Hauptbahnhof === Goods traffic === There is a lot of goods traffic between Karlsruhe and Wörth, and to the Wörth flooded gravel pits, the Mercedes-Benz lorry factory there and the Wörth harbour on the Rhine, which is why this section has been electrified since 1974. Between Wörth and Winden, Wissembourg and Winden, and at the junction of Winden to Landau goods traffic has however since reduced to nothing, which is clear from the extent of dismantling in the stations at Kandel, Winden, Rohrbach, Landau and Maikammer-Kirrweiler as well as the former station at Schaidt. The stations of Kandel, Winden and Schaidt were formerly very important for the transportation of sugar beet, because there were loading facilities at which the sugar beet could be cross-loaded from farm vehicles onto goods wagons. With the Deutsche Bahn exit from this type of transportation in the nineties the loading facilities were dismantled and the transport of sugar beet to the sugar factories switched to the road. Apart from the Wörth–Karlsruhe section and Landauer Hauptbahnhof, the only remaining industrial branches are in Edenkoben. These have not been used for years however. The stub track in the Edenkoben industrial estate of Seewiesen was completely and irrevocably cut off from the station with the removal of track 3, because the pedestrian underpass was built on its trackbed. With the introduction of the new electronic signal box at Neustadt part of the wye was removed. Since then goods trains can no longer run directly to Ludwigshafen but must reverse into the main station. Even the passenger train from Pirmasens Hauptbahnhof to BASF has to reverse in Neustadt Hbf as before without stopping to run through from Maikammer-Kirrweiler to Hassloch. In addition there are in Landau numerous goods sidings, that ran into the town centre, that have since completely disappeared, although sometimes the trackbeds are still visible as overgrown paths between the buildings and squares. At midday a goods train still runs daily from Neustadt to Landau. == Sources References=Further reading=== * Faszination Eisenbahn - Heimat-Jahrbuch 2008 Landkreis Südliche Weinstraße, Verlag Franz Arbogast Otterbach, ISSN 0177-8684 * Michael Heilmann, Werner Schreiner, 150 Jahre Maximiliansbahn Neustadt-Straßburg, pro MESSAGE, Ludwigshafen am Rhein, 2005, * Modell- und Eisenbahnclub Landau in der Pfalz e.V., 125 Jahre Maximiliansbahn Neustadt/Weinstr.-Landau/Pfalz, Landau in der Pfalz, 1980 * Klaus D.

Thaksinomics, Thaksin's economic policies helped to accelerate Thailand's economic recovery from the 1997 Asian financial crisis and reduced poverty. The GDP grew from THB4.9 trillion at the end of 2001 to THB7.1 trillion at the end of 2006. Thailand repaid its debts to the International Monetary Fund two years ahead of schedule. Between 2000 and 2004, income in the poorest part of the country, the northeast, rose 40% while nationwide poverty fell from 21.3% to 11.3%. The Stock Exchange of Thailand outperformed other markets in the region. After facing fiscal deficits in 2001 and 2002, Thaksin balanced the national budget, producing comfortable fiscal surpluses for 2003 to 2005. Despite a massive program of infrastructure investments, a balanced budget was projected for 2007.Asian Development Bank, Asian Development Outlook 2006: Thailand Public sector debt fell from 57% of GDP in January 2001 to 41% in September 2006.The Nation, Public debt end-Sept falls to 41.28% of GDP , 17 November 2006World Bank, Thailand Economic Monitor, October 2003 Foreign exchange reserves doubled from US$30 billion in 2001 to US$64 billion in 2006.The Nation, Black Tuesday: Did the BOT overreact? , 25 December 2006 However, critics charge that Thaksinomics was little more than a Keynesian-style economic stimulus policy re-branded as something new and revolutionary.

Lottery sales of approximately 70 billion baht (US$2 billion) are used for social projects, including the \\"One District, One Scholarship\\" program which provided one student from a low-income family in each district with a scholarship to study overseas. Soon after Thaksin was deposed, the junta banned the lottery, claiming it was a social vice. This lured the poor away from work into gambling addiction. In addition, the supreme court ruled that the cabinet did not have the right to introduce the lottery without due process. The scholarship program was also stopped.The Nation, \\"Ministry suspends lottery sales\\", 18 November 2006\\"Intoxicated\\" Thailand losing billions to lottery: study September 5, 2004The Nation, Justice permanent secretary to seek abolition of jackpot price of Govt lottery, 5 October 2006 The military junta also claimed that Thaksin's government \\"mischievously spent the proceeds in any way it saw fit\\".The Nation, Lotteries move lacks understanding , 3 May 2007 The Thaksin government reduced the state's control of the media by privatizing MCOT, a large television and radio broadcaster.The Nation, Activists call for MCOT delisting , 24 November 2006 After the 2006 coup, some of Thaksin's economic policies were ended. The OTOP program was rebranded, the Government Lottery Office program was deemed illegal. The government also nationalized several media outlets and energy companies. ==Healthcare policies== Thaksin initiated two key healthcare policies: subsidized universal health care and low-cost universal access to anti-retroviral HIV medication (ARVs). Thaksin's 30-baht/visit universal healthcare program won the applause of the general public, but was criticized by many doctors and officials. Prior to the program's introduction, a large portion of the population had no health insurance and limited access to healthcare. The program helped increase access to healthcare from 76% of the population to 96% of the population. Unfortunately, the program increased workloads for healthcare employees and caused many doctors to switch to higher paying careers. It has been also criticized for being greatly underfunded. The financial losses caused by the program led some hospitals to seek alternative sources of income, leading to a boom in the medical tourism industry, with 1.3 million foreign patients earning Thailand 33 billion THB (approx. 800 million USD) in 2005.85 Bogus Doctors Arrested In Thailand Last Year June 6, 2006First International Trade Exhibition and Conference on Medical Tourism, Spa and Wellness Industries, in Bangkok, March 20-23 2008 2007 Post-coup Public Health Minister Mongkol Na Songkhla called the 30-baht program a \\"marketing gimmick\\" and claimed that the government would stop charging any fees for visits to state hospitals.The Nation, Bt30 health fee may be scrapped , 14 October 2006 During the Thaksin government, the number of people living with HIV/AIDS as well as the overall prevalence rate noticeably declined, as fewer were being infected.Follow-up to the declaration of commitment on HIV/AIDS (UNGASS) December 2004 Although successful in expanding access to HIV medication, there are concerns that a free trade agreement with the US could endanger Thailand's ability to produce generic HIV treatments. Thaksin allowed an estimated 2.3 million foreign workers in Thailand to register and seek health coverage under the Thai national healthcare system. They were also eligible for work permits at the end of the registration period, entitling them to full labor protection. Democrat Party Labour Group Committee Pongsak Plengsaeng criticized the move, claiming that it would lead to unemployment amongst Thais. ==Anti-drug policies== Thaksin initiated several highly controversial policies to destroy the Thai illicit drug market, particularly methamphetamines. After earlier anti-drug policies such as border blocking (most methamphetamine found in Thailand is produced in Myanmar), public education, sports, and promoting peer pressure against drug use proved more or less ineffective, Thaksin launched a multi-pronged suppression campaign that aimed to eradicate methamphetamine use in three months. It increased punishment for drug addicts, set provincial arrest and seizure targets, rewarded government officials for achieving targets and eliminating dealers, and ordered a \\"ruthless\\" implementation. In the first three months, Human Rights Watch reported that 2,275 people were killed. The government claimed that only around 50 of the deaths were at the hands of the police. Human rights critics say a large number were extrajudicially murdered. \\"A Wave of Drug Killings Is Linked to Thai Police\\". By Seth Mydans. April 8, 2003. New York Times.

According to the Narcotics Control Board, the policy was effective in reducing drug consumption, especially in schools.Thailand: Public Senses War On Drugs Futile 20 March 2005 King Bhumibol, in his 2003 birthday speech, supported Thaksin's anti-drug approach, although he did request the commander of the police to categorize deaths: those killed by police and those killed by fellow drug dealers. Police Commander Sant Sarutanond reopened investigations into the deaths, and again found that few of the deaths were at the hands of the police. Thaksin's anti-drug approach was widely criticized by international community. Thaksin requested that the UN Commission on Human Rights send a special envoy to evaluate the situation, but said in an interview, \\"The United Nations is not my father. I am not worried about any UN visit to Thailand on this issue.\\" After the 2006 coup, the military junta ordered another investigation into the anti-drug campaign. Former Attorney General Kanit Na Nakhon chaired the special investigative committee. \\"The special committee will be tasked with an investigation to find out the truth about the deaths as well as to identify remedial measures for their relatives\\", said Justice Minister Charnchai Likhitjittha.Bangkok Post, August 3, 2007. \\"Kanit to chair extrajudicial killings probe\\" The committee found that as many as 1400 of the 2500 killed had no link to drugs. However, while giving the opinion that orders to kill came from the top, the panel failed to establish sufficient evidence to charge Thaksin directly with the murders.\\"Thailand's drug wars.

Drug War Chronicle ==Corruption== Transparency International reported that Thailand's reputation for transparency among business executives improved during the years of the Thaksin government. In 2001, Thailand's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) was 3.2 (ranked 61st), whereas in 2005, the CPI was 3.8 (ranked 59th).Thai Public Relations Department, \\"Thailand's Image on Transparency\\", 26 October 2004Transparency International TI 2005 Corruption Perceptions Index Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index 2001 A study of Worldwide Governance Indicators by the World Bank gave a lower score on \\"Control of Corruption\\" during 2002-2005, the period of Thaksin's government, compared to 1998-2000's earlier government.Worldwide Governance Indicators Thaksin himself has consistently denied any wrongdoing by himself or his Thai Rak Thai party. In 2008, Thaksin was found guilty of corruption and sentenced to two years in prison by the Thai Supreme Court. ==Education policies== Thaksin implemented a major series of educational reforms during his government. Chief among those reforms was school decentralization, as mandated by the 1997 People's Constitution.Thaksin Government 2001 Policy Statement, Section 11.1 The policy was designed to delegated school management from the over-centralized and bureaucratized Ministry of Education to Tambon Administrative Organizations (TAOs). The plan met with massive widespread opposition from Thailand's 700,000 teachers, who would be deprived of their status as civil servants. There was also widespread fear from teachers that TAOs lack the skills and capabilities required to manage schools. In the face of massive teacher protests and several threats of school closure, Thaksin compromised and gave teachers whose schools were transferred to TAO management two years to transfer to other schools.Crisis in the ‘Land of the Smile’ International Viewpoint, Online magazine: IV376 - March 2006 Other reforms included learning reform and related curricular decentralization, mostly through greater use of holistic education and less use of rote learning.Thai News Agency, Rote learning to be eliminated from schools, says PM, 21 January 2006 To increase access to universities for lower income people, Thaksin initiated the Student Loan Fund (SLF) and Income Contingency Loan (ICL) programs. The ICL granted loans regardless of financial status, and required recipients to start repayments when their salaries reach 16,000 Baht a month, with an interest rate equivalent to inflation from the day the loan was granted. The SLF had an eligibility limit on family income but carried interest of 1%, starting one year after graduation. The programs were merged and the income limit modified after Thaksin's government was overthrown.The Nation, New student loan scheme to have higher family-income limit , 13 November 2006 Thaksin also initiated the controversial \\"One District, One Dream School\\" project, aimed at developing the quality of schools to ensure that every district has at least one high-quality school. The project was criticized, with some claiming that the only beneficiaries were Thaksin and companies selling computers and educational equipment. Many schools also fell deeply into debt in implementing the project, receiving less than adequate financial support from the central government. In addition, Thaksin altered the state university entrance system. Whereas the former system relied exclusively on a series of nationally standardized exams, Thaksin pushed for a greater emphasis on senior high-school grades, claiming this would focus students on classroom learning rather than private entrance exam tutoring. Thaksin initiated the Income Contingency Loan program to increase access to higher education. Under the program, needy students may secure a loan to support their studies from vocational to university levels. Thai banks had traditionally not given education loans. Thaksin made Thailand one of the first supporters of Nicholas Negroponte's One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) project, with the Thai Ministry of Education committing to purchase 600,000 units.The Nation, \\"CROSSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE: Sipa hopes for equal access for all children nationwide\\", 15 August 2005 However, the military junta later cancelled the project. ==Energy policies== In energy policy, the Thaksin government continued the Chuan Leekpai government's privatization agenda, but with important changes. Whereas the Chuan government's post-Asian financial crisis policies sought economic efficiency through industry fragmentation and wholesale power pool competition,Far Eastern Economic Review, \\"Power Politics Trump Reform\\", 27 September 2001 Thaksin's policies aimed to create national champions that could reliably support stronger economic growth and become important players in regional energy markets.Bangkok Post, \\"Raising sector efficiency \`crucial': Utility's B140bn debt strains public purse\\" Thaksin also initiated a policy to encourage renewable energy and energy conservation. Many Thaksin-era energy policies were reversed following the 2006 coup. ==South Thailand insurgency== A resurgence in violence began in 2001 in the three southernmost provinces of Thailand which all have a Muslim, ethnic Malay majority. There is much controversy about the causes of this escalation of the decades long insurgency. Attacks after 2001 concentrated on police, the military, and schools, but civilians have also been targets. Thaksin has been widely criticized for his management of the situation, in particular the storming of the Krue Se Mosque, the deaths of civilian protesters at Tak Bai in army custody, and the unsolved kidnapping of Muslim-lawyer Somchai Neelapaijit.The New York Times, U.N. Criticizes Emergency Powers, Warren Hoge, July 22, 2005 In October 2004, 84 Muslim human rights protesters were killed at Tak Bai when the army broke up a peaceful protest.At least 84 people killed in Southern Thailand 26 October 2004 The many detainees were forced at gunpoint to lie prone in army trucks, stacked like cordwood. The trucks were delayed from moving to the detainment area for hours. Many detainees suffocated to death due to gross mishandling by the military. After the 2006 coup, the army dropped all charges and investigations into army misconduct related to the Tak Bai incident. Thaksin announced an escalation of military and police activity in the region.Somchai Phatharathananunth \\"Civil Society and Democratization\\" p.222 In July 2005, Thaksin enacted an emergency decree to manage the three troubled provinces. Several human rights organizations expressed their concerns that the decree might be used to violate civil liberties. In March 2005, Thaksin established the National Reconciliation Commission, chaired by former Prime Minister Anand Panyarachun to oversee efforts to bring peace to the troubled south. In its final report released in June 2006, the commission proposed introducing Islamic law and making Pattani- Malay (Yawi) an official language in the region. The Thaksin administration assigned a government committee to study the report, while Muslims urged the government to act faster in implementing the proposals. ==Administrative reformMinisterial restructuring=== One of the most visible of Thaksin's administrative reforms was the restructuring of government department and ministries, labeled the \\"big bang.\\" It was hailed as a \\"historic breakthrough\\" and \\"the first major reorganization of ministries since King Chulalongkorn set up Thailand's modern system of departmental government in 1897.\\" Such a restructuring had been studied for years as a means of undermining the perceived rigidities and inertia of the old system, but was never implemented until the Thaksin government.Martin Painter, Managerial Reform and Political Control: the Case of Thaksin and the Thai Bureaucracy*, Department of Public and Social Administration, City University of Hong Kong, http://www.sog- rc27.org/Paper/Scancor/Martin_Painter.doc The restructuring was designed to streamline the bureaucracy and focus it on performance and results. New ministries were carved out in Social and Human Security Development, Tourism and Sports, Natural Resources and Environment, Information and Communication Technology, and Culture. ===CEO-governors=== Thaksin transformed the role of provincial governors from ceremonial supervisors of ministry officials to active managers of government policy. Historically, central government ministries operated in the provinces through field offices headed by senior officials, who reported back to Bangkok. The Ministry of Interior appointed provincial governors whose role was largely ceremonial. A key component of Thaksin's administrative reform policy, \\"CEO-governors\\" epitomized Thaksin's \\"transformation of the operating style of the traditional bureaucracy into a more results-oriented instrument that would be responsive\\". Piloted in 2001 and introduced in all provinces in October 2003, CEO-governors were put in charge of planning and coordinating provincial development and became accountable for overall provincial affairs. The \\"CEO governors\\" were assisted by \\"provincial CFOs\\" from the Ministry of Finance who reported directly to each governor. The CEO-governors were authorized to raise funds by issuing bonds and were given an intensive training course. After the coup, the junta reverted the role of governors. ===Foreign policies=== Shinawatra with then President of Russia Vladimir Putin at APEC Bangkok 2003 on 21 October 2003 in Bangkok. Thaksin was fiercely attacked for tasking diplomats with supporting domestic economic programs, e.g., promoting OTOP products. Surapong Jayanama, former ambassador to Vietnam claiming that Thaksin's policies were \\"demeaning\\" and would do little to enhance Thailand's international stature. Thaksin also initiated negotiations for several free trade agreements with China, Australia, Bahrain, India, and the US. This policy was also criticized, with claims that high-cost Thai industries could be wiped out.FTA Watch Group website Thailand joined George W. Bush's multinational coalition in the invasion of Iraq, sending a 423-strong humanitarian contingent. It withdrew its troops on 10 September 2004. Two Thai soldiers died in Iraq in an insurgent attack. Thaksin announced that Thailand would forsake foreign aid, and work with donor countries to assist in the development of neighbors in the Greater Mekong Sub-region. Thaksin was attacked by influential former diplomats for acting undiplomatically with foreign leaders. Kasit Pirom, former Thai ambassador to Japan and the United States, noted at an anti- Thaksin rally \\"When Khun Thaksin went to the United Nations to attend a joint UN-Asean session, he did not behave properly when addressing the session, which was co-chaired by the UN secretary-general and the Malaysian premier. In his address Thaksin did not mention the name of the Malaysian premier\\". Thaksin established close, friendly ties with the Burmese dictatorship, including extending the neighboring country a four billion baht credit line so it could conclude a satellite telecom deal with his family business.Thaksin to face charges over Burma telecom deal. ICT News, August 2, 2007 url: http://www.burmait.net/ict-news/2007/aug07/thaksin-to-face-charges-over-burma- telecom-deal/ During the time Thaksin was in office as prime minister, he was ambitious about making Thailand a regional leader. He proposed, and was supported by other South East Asian countries, an economic treaty at the sub- regional level, to promote economic, technological, and infrastructure development. His government also provided economic assistance to neighbouring countries Laos and Cambodia. Thaksin has been attacked for his support of former Deputy Prime Minister Surakiart Sathirathai's failed campaign to become UN Secretary General. ===2005 re-election campaign=== Under the slogans \\"Four Years of RepairFour years of Reconstruction\\" and \\"Building Opportunities\\", Thaksin and the Thai Rak Thai Party (TRT) party won landslide victories in the February 2005 elections, sweeping 374 out of 500 seats in Parliament. The election had the highest voter turnout in Thai history. ===Suvarnabhumi Airport=== After more than 30 years of planning and debate, the Thaksin government completed construction of the new Suvarnabhumi Airport, one of the world's largest. The airport was officially opened a week after the overthrew of the government. Some members of Thaksin's government were accused of corruption while overseeing the construction of Suvarnabhumi Airport. ===Other criticisms=== There have also been complaints that Thaksin-appointed relatives to senior positions in the civil service and independent commissions, for example by elevating his cousin, General Chaiyasit Shinawatra, to Army commander-in-chief. In August 2002, he was promoted from Deputy Commander of the Armed Forces Development Command to become Deputy Army Chief. Both General Chaiyasit and Defense Minister General Chavalit Yongchaiyudh denied charges of nepotism at the time. General Chaiyasit replaced General Somthad Attanan as Army commander-in-chief. However, General Chaiyasit was replaced by General Prawit Wongsuwan in August 2004, after only a year in office. His replacement was in response to an escalation of violence in southern Thailand. Prawit was succeeded by Sonthi Boonyaratglin in 2005. Thaksin was also accused of interference after the Senate appointed Wisut Montriwat (former Deputy Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance) to the position of Auditor General, replacing Jaruvan Maintaka. Respected former Thai ambassador to the UN Asda Jayanama, in an anti-Thaksin rally, claimed that Thaksin's two state visits to India were made in order to negotiate a satellite deal for Thaksin's family-owned Shin Corporation. The accusation was countered by Foreign Minister Kantathi Suphamongkhon, who attended the state visits with Thaksin. Thaksin's government has been accused of exerting political influence in its crackdown on unlicensed community radio stations. Thaksin often faced harsh comparisons. Social critic Prawase Wasi compared him to AIDS, Privy Council President Prem Tinsulanonda and Senator Banjerd Singkaneti compared him to Hitler, Democrat spokesman Ong-art Klampaibul compared him to Saddam Hussein, and the newspaper The Nation compared him to Pol Pot.The Nation, Thailand has its 'Hitlers', 5 October 2006Matichon, รุกเปิดเจ้าของ\\"แอมเพิลริช\\" จี้\\"แม้ว\\"ตอบ ยุแก้ลำเลิกใช้มือถือ\\"เอไอเอส\\", 30 January 2006The Nation, Real war has just begun, 16 February 2006 Thaksin has been engaged in a series of lawsuits brought by American businessman William L Monson regarding a cable-television joint venture the two partnered in during the 1980s. ==See also== * Presidency of Rodrigo Duterte * Philippine Drug War ==References== Category:Thaksin Shinawatra Category:Political history of Thailand Thaksin Shinawatra ","title":"Premiership of Thaksin Shinawatra"},{"id":"20545256","text":"Satellite image of the peninsula. The Bergen Peninsula (, ; ) is a peninsula in Vestland county, Norway. The city of Bergen, Norway's second largest city, is located on the peninsula. The peninsula extends out from the mainland and it is surrounded by the following fjords: Samnangerfjorden, Bjørnafjorden, Fusafjorden, Raunefjorden, Byfjorden, Salhusfjorden, Sørfjorden. The peninsula is connected to the rest of mainland Norway by a narrow, wide strip of land between the villages of Trengereid and Årland. The municipality of Bergen, about of the municipality of Bjørnafjorden, and about of the municipality of Samnanger are all located on the peninsula. The highest point is the tall mountain Gullfjellet. == Geography == View from Gullfjellet. The primary mountain region on the peninsula is Gullfjellet, with the tall mountain Gullfjellstoppen as the highest peak. A number of lower peaks are found on, or connected to, the Gullfjellet massif. Another significant mountain plateau, Ulriken - Vidden - Rundemanen, is found just east of Bergen's city centre. Sveningen is another massif south of Gullfjellet, bordering Samnanger and Os municipalities. Additionally, a number of smaller mountains and forest hills are scattered around within the peninsula. All of the mountains are highly accessible to the public, seen in light of road access, trail systems, and low climbing difficulty. Both Gullfjellet and the Ulriken - Vidden - Rundemanen massif by Bergen are popular in all seasons. The Ulriken - Vidden - Rundemanen massif also offer easy access through gondola and funicular railway. The leveled plateau between Rundemanen and Ulriken is excellent for skiing in winter, providing the snow stays. Those who seek behind the public trails will also find interesting routes on the massifs mentioned above. You will even find good scrambling opportunities very near Bergen through the ridges on Søre Midtfjell and on the north side of Ulriken. == Transport == Fritz C. Riebers vei, a motorvei in Bergen. Bergen Peninsula has many roads and highways. The two main highways are the European route E16 highway running from the city of Bergen to the east and the European route E39 highway running north–south through the city of Bergen. The Nordhordland Bridge on the E39 highway connects the Bergen peninsula to the islands and mainland to the north. There are rail connections along the Bergen Line railway that run through the mountain Ulriken to Arna from the city center and then on to Oslo. Previously there was a railway line from Nesttun and Os, called Nesttun-Os Railway. Bergen Airport, Flesland, located on the southwestern shore of the peninsula has air connections to other airports in Norway as well as Europe and Asia. This airport serves as main airport for nearly 600,000 people and had five million passengers in 2008. ==References== Category:Peninsulas of Vestland Category:Geography of Bergen Category:Bjørnafjorden Category:Samnanger ","title":"Bergen Peninsula"},{"id":"20545258","text":"The Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) http://hints.cancer.gov/ is a cross-sectional, nationally representative survey of American adults sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. HINTS provides publicly available data on American adults' knowledge of, attitudes toward, and behaviors related to cancer prevention, control and communication.

Journal of General Internal Medicine, 23(3), 223-228 Program planners can use the data to overcome barriers to health- information access and to obtain data to help them create more effective communication strategies. Social scientists can use the data to refine theories of health communication and to recommend methods to reduce the burden of cancer. As a national-level surveillance vehicle for cancer and health communication, HINTS can make valuable contributions to the larger cyberinfrastructure devoted to health and may potentially be leveraged with other national-level surveys (e.g., The Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance Survey Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance Survey and National Health Interview Survey National Health Interview Survey) to gauge the effects of policy changes on population health. == HINTS Surveys HINTS 1 (2003)=== The first HINTS data were collected between October 2002 and April 2003 via a Random Digit Dial (RDD) telephone survey using a Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) format to accommodate complex skip-patterns based on respondent's answers. Data were collected from 6,369 respondents. The survey instruments are available in English and Spanish.View the 2003 survey instruments: English here and Spanish hereView the final report ===HINTS 2 (2005)=== HINTS 2 data were collected from February 2005 through August 2005.

View the 2005 survey instruments: English here and Spanish here View the 2005 Final Report ===HINTS 3 (2008)=== HINTS 3 data were collected from January 2008 through May 2008. The sample design for HINTS 2008 consisted of two samples with each sample selected from a separate sample frame. One sample used the same RDD/CATI methodology as prior surveys. Survey administration averaged 30 minutes per respondent. Data were collected from 4,092 respondents. The second sample was selected from United States Postal Service address administrative records. After the CATI instrument was modified to produce a printed questionnaire, the survey and a cover letter were sent to the address sample. All adults at each sampled address were asked to return the completed questionnaire in a postage-paid envelope. Data were collected from 3,582 respondents. Data from both surveys became available for public use in February 2009 along with a final report.

The University of Puerto Rico Comprehensive Cancer Center and the Puerto Rico Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System collaborated with the National Cancer Institute on the project. A total of 639 interviews were conducted (603 complete and 36 partially complete). Data and documentation as well as instructions on how to combine the data set with HINTS 2007 is available on the HINTS website. ===HINTS 4, Cycle 1 (2011)=== Data for cycle 1 were collected from October 2011 through February 2012. The sample design consisted of a single-mode mail survey, with two methods of respondent selection: the All Adult method and the Next Birthday method. The sampling consisted of a two-stage stratified sample of addresses used by Marketing Systems Group (MSG). In the All Adult method, two questionnaires were sent with each mailing, where all adults residing in a sampled household were asked to complete the questionnaire. In the next birthday method, one questionnaire was sent with each mailing so that the adult who would have the next birthday in the sampled household was asked to complete the questionnaire. Data were collected from 3,959 respondents. The methodology report, complete data set and the survey instruments are available on the HINTS website. ===HINTS 4, Cycle 2 (2012)=== Data for cycle 2 were collected from October 2012 through January 2013. The sample design consisted of a single-mode mail survey, using the Next Birthday method for respondent selection. It included two stages. In the first stage, a stratified sample of addresses was selected from a file of residential addresses. In the second- stage, one adult was selected within each sampled household. The sampling frame consisted of a database of addresses used by Marketing Systems Group (MSG) to provide random samples of addresses. Complete data were collected from 3,630 respondents. The methodology report, complete data set and the survey instruments are available on the HINTS website. ===HINTS 4, Cycle 3 (2013)=== Cycle 3 data were collected from September 2013 through December 2013. Like cycle 2, the sample design consisted of a single-mode mail survey that used the Next Birthday method for respondent selection. The sample design for this survey consisted of two-stages. In the first stage, a stratified sample of addresses was selected from a file of residential addresses. In the second-stage, one adult was selected within each sampled household. The sampling frame consisted of a database of addresses used by Marketing Systems Group (MSG) to provide random samples of addresses. Complete data were collected from 3,185 respondents. The methodology report, complete data set and the survey instruments are available on the HINTS website. ===HINTS 4, Cycle 4 (2014)=== Data were collected from August through November, 2014. The sample design for this cycle consisted of a single-mode mail survey, using the Next Birthday method for respondent selection. The sample design consisted of two-stages. In the first stage, a stratified sample of addresses was selected from a file of residential addresses. In the second-stage, one adult was selected within each sampled household.

Pundt was born and raised in Berlin, Germany. In 1944, at age 16, he began service as a Naval Cadet. He fought in the defense of Berlin against the Russian army in 1945. After his capture by the Russians, he escaped from a P.O.W. camp the following December. Pundt came to the United States in 1951. He was drafted to serve in the Korean War with an aerial intelligence unit of the U.S. Marine Corps. He was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 1954. In 1955, Pundt began the study of architectural engineering, design and history at the University of Colorado. From 1957 to 1960 he studied history of art and architecture at the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign, where he received his B.A. and M.A. degrees in 1960. In 1960-61 he traveled in Europe, supported by the Mary McLean Travel Scholarship. Pundt went on to Harvard University where he earned his Ph.D. with Distinction from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in June 1969; his dissertation was supervised by Professors James S. Ackerman and Eduard F. Sekler. From 1962 to 1968, Pundt taught at the University of Illinois, at both the Urbana and Chicago campuses. He was the founder of the Committee on Architectural Heritage, a University of Illinois student/faculty organization that fought for the preservation of Frank Lloyd Wright’s Frederick Robie House. He also participated in the fight to save H. H. Richardson’s John J. Glessner House in 1966. Pundt moved to Seattle in 1968 to join the faculty of the Department of Architecture at the University of Washington. He was promoted to full Professor in 1973. He received a joint appointment in the School of Art, Division of Art History in 1976. He was also a member of the faculty of the College of Architecture & Urban Planning (now College of Built Environments) Certificate Program in Historic Preservation. Pundt was an inspirational teacher, he offering courses in architectural history and historic preservation. He also taught in the UW Architecture in Rome program in 1977 and 1987, and he taught at the Technische Universitat, Berlin, in 1974-75 (as a Fulbright Senior Lecturer), and at Tokyo Institute of Technology in 1982. He was an invited speaker at various schools in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Pundt’s published scholarship addressed nineteenth century Prussian architect, Karl Friedrich Schinkel (1781-1841). His publications included Schinkel’s Berlin: A Study in Environmental Planning (1972; German edition 1981; Japanese edition, 1985), and he was a principal contributor and co-author for Karl Friedrich Schinkel: Sammmlung Architektonischer Entwürfe (Collection of Architectural Designs) (1982, and subsequent editions). Through his involvement with the Committee on Architectural Heritage, he was the instigator of an exhibition and associated catalogue, Frank Lloyd Wright: Vision and Legacy (1967). Pundt's preservation interests led to his involvement in US/ICOMOS (International Council on Monuments and Sites). Beginning in 1990, he was a member of the Gesellschaft des Wiederaufbaus der Frauenkirche, Dresden, a citizen initiative for the reconstruction of Dresden’s famous Church of Our Lady, destroyed in 1945. After German reunification, he lectured and consulted on preservation projects such as the Palace and Gardens of Sanssouci in Potsdam, the Bauhaus in Dessau, and the reconstruction of historic Dresden. Pundt was the recipient of multiple awards including: Karl Friedrich Schinkel Medal (Bauakademie, Berlin, 1981), Victor Steinbrueck Chair (University of Washington College of Architecture & Urban Planning, 1983), Lionel Pries Teaching Award (voted by students in the UW College of Architecture & Urban Planning (now College of Built Environments), 1985), University of Washington Distinguished Teaching Award (1992), and Order of Merit, First Class, of the Federal Republic of Germany (1992). In June 1996, Pundt retired after more than 35 years as a university faculty member, but continued to teach on a reduced schedule. He died on September 15, 2000, in Donauwörth, Germany. Pundt is remembered by former students for his inspirational presentations on architecture and preservation. He was an advocate of the arts and humanities in the face of what he perceived as an increasing academic and societal emphasis on science and technology. ==External links== *UW Research Showcase essay on Hermann Pundt *COLUMNS (UW alumni magazine) obituary for Hermann Pundt *Seattle Times obituary for Hermann Pundt * Proposed introduction to unpublished reissue of Schinkel's Berlin Category:1928 births Category:2000 deaths Category:American architecture writers Category:American architectural historians Category:Harvard University alumni Category:University of Illinois faculty Category:University of Washington faculty Category:Educators from Seattle Category:Officers Crosses of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany Category:20th-century American historians Category:20th-century American biographers Category:20th-century American male writers Category:American male non-fiction writers ","title":"Hermann Pundt"},{"id":"20545450","text":"FG syndrome (FGS) is a rare genetic syndrome caused by one or more recessive genes located on the X chromosome and causing physical anomalies and developmental delays. FG syndrome was named after the first letters of the surnames of the first patients noted with the disease. First reported by American geneticists John M. Opitz and Elisabeth G. Kaveggia in 1974, its major clinical features include intellectual disability, hyperactivity, hypotonia (low muscle tone), and a characteristic facial appearance including macrocephaly (an abnormally large head). ==Presentation== FG syndrome's major clinical features include intellectual disability, usually severe; hyperactive behavior, often with an outgoing personality; severe constipation, with or without structural anomalies in the anus such as imperforate anus; macrocephaly; severe hypotonia; a characteristic facial appearance due to hypotonia, giving a droopy, \\"open-mouthed\\" expression, a thin upper lip, a full or pouting lower lip; and partial or complete loss of the corpus callosum. About a third of reported cases of individuals with FG syndrome die in infancy, usually due to respiratory infection; premature death is rare after infancy. ===Developmental effects=== Associated with agenesis (absence) of the corpus callosum, intellectual disabilities are common among individuals with FG syndrome. Motor ability is also impaired as a result of having FG syndrome and its effects on the development of neurons. During infancy, problems arise in the gastrointestinal and gastroesophageal systems of the body. The most common gastrointestinal problems include constipation from imperforated anuses and gastroesophageal reflux. Cardiopulmonary defects also contribute to roughly 60% of premature deaths in infants with FG syndrome. Of all of the congenital heart defects septal defects are the most common. After infancy, long term survival has been recorded to individuals surviving beyond the age of 50. ==Genetics== Most mutations that cause FG syndrome can be found in the MED12 gene. However, mutations have also been found in FMR1, FLNA, UPF3B, CASK, MECP2 and ATRX genes. Mutations on these different genes lead to the different types of FG syndrome, all with similar characteristics. The FGS1 type mutation is the most common of the types, and is found in the MED12 gene. Known types and affected genes include: {  - ! Type ! OMIM ! Gene ! Locus -  FGS1   MED12  Xq13 -  FGS2   FLNA  Xq28 -  FGS3   FGS3  Xp22.3 -  FGS4   CASK  Xp11.4-p11.3 -  FGS5   FGS5  Xq22.3 } ===MED12 gene=== The MED12 gene codes for the mediator complex subunit 12 protein. The mediator complex is composed of around 25 different proteins that all help with the regulation of gene activity. This mediator complex regulates gene expression by bridging interaction between RNA polymerase II and gene-specific regulating proteins such as transcription factors, repressor proteins, activator proteins, etc. Changes to this complex and the proteins associated can have a severe impact on the production of new proteins. The MED12 gene is also thought to be highly linked to neuron development as well as high usage in the cells signal transduction pathway. This explains the slowed intellectual development individuals with FG syndrome have. ==Diagnosis== There is no established clinical diagnostic criteria for FG syndrome. A healthcare professional might consider the following clinical features in an individual as indicative for further evaluation: * Neurodevelopmental delays * A family history consistent with X-linked inheritance * Characteristic facial features ** Absolute or relative macrocephaly ** Dolichocephaly ** Frontal hair upsweep ** Tall forehead ** Downslanted palpebral fissures ** Widely spaced eyes ** Fullness of the upper eyelids ** Small, simple ears (≤10th percentile) ** Open mouth ** Long narrow face * Broad thumbs and halluces * Congenital anomaly (corpus callosum, anal, cardiac, skeletal) * Hypotonia, constipation, or feeding problems * Characteristic behavior (affable and eager to please) ==Treatment== Treatment for FG Syndrome is individualized to each person. It generally involves a team of specialist to manage the symptoms. == Support and resources == * Unique: Understanding Rare Chromosome and Gene Disorders, https://www.rarechromo.org/ ** MED12 Related Disorders * National Organization of Rare Disorders, https://rarediseases.org/nordpod/ ** FG Syndrome Type 1 * GARD: Genetic and Rare Disease Information Center, https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/ ** FG Syndrome * ==History== Kim Peek (1951–2009) probably had FG syndrome. The name of the syndrome comes from the initials of the surnames of two sisters, who had five sons with the syndrome. The first study of the syndrome, published in 1974, established that it was linked to inheritance of the X chromosome. A 2008 study concluded that Kim Peek, who was the basis for Dustin Hoffman's character Raymond Babbitt in the movie Rain Man, probably had FG syndrome rather than autism. ==See also== *Lujan–Fryns syndrome ==References External links == Category:X-linked recessive disorders Category:Rare syndromes Category:Genetic disorders by inheritance ","title":"FG syndrome"},{"id":"20545476","text":"A Side Productions is a music production company established by Per Magnusson and David Kreuger in early 2001.

They bought of land to build their new ranch and decided to name it Africa U.S.A.History of Vasquez Rocks Africa U.S.A. was a training compound and a provider of animals for HollywoodAfrican Safari: Kenya Imagine Seeing So Many Animals--And So Close? - Duncan Strauss (Clarence, the cross-eyed lion, and Judy the chimp in Daktari, and Ben (originally named Bruno) the bear in Gentle Ben). The compound was also used as location for shows such as Daktari and the original Star Trek episode \\"Shore Leave.\\" Perhaps Helfer's most famous animal he trained was Zamba, who appeared in the MGM logo as Leo the Lion from 1957 to the present. During these years, Helfer created what he called \\"affection training\\", which purported to replace the whip, gun, and chair of the old-school handlers with love, understanding, and respect. Critics state that affection training indeed consisted in surgically modifying (declawing and defanging) the animals and administering sedatives. Ralph Helfer denies this and stated that \\"this was done to animals that had deformities and were injurious to their health.\\" In January 1969, Africa U.S.A. was devastated by a powerful storm over Soledad Canyon which dropped large amounts of rainfall in the region. This resulted in severe flooding and mudslides in the canyons. 20 of the 1,500 animals of the ranch were killed by the torrential flooding. Ralph Helfer bought out Marine World in 1972 when it went bankrupt and added a wildlife park and \\"jungle theater\\", renaming the park as Marine World/Africa U.S.A. This park was the predecessor of Six Flags Discovery Kingdom. He also was a partner and chairman in a small Buena Park, California, theme park called Enchanted Village which was built on the site of the defunct Japanese Village and Deer Park amusement attraction. When this park went bankrupt in fall 1977 he created another company and training park called \\"Gentle Jungle\\". The Gentle Jungle Affection Training School was based in Colton, California and later in Lion Country Safari, in Orange County; finally Gentle Jungle was investigated by USDA where an eventual lawsuit against Helfer for Animal Welfare Act violations. During this period he was the owner of the \\"human\\" chimp Oliver.Oliver's Travels - The Atlantic - James Shreeve - October 2003 Ralph Helfer was cleared of all accusations except one, which was sent to the supreme court, which was meant to deal with the death of a tiger, who died due to a veterinarian over dosing the tiger.

Smuts began studies of wild baboons in 1976. Studies she made of wild olive baboons in Tanzania and Kenya inspired her 1985 book Sex and Friendship in Baboons. The book, the fruit of two years' research, showed how two different groups of the same primate interact with each other socially. She determined that friendship was a critical predictor of sexual activity between male and female baboons: females preferred to mate with males that had previously engaged in friendly interactions with them and could interact with their other offspring as well. Smuts also carried out research into bottlenose dolphin social development, working extensively with Janet Mann.

The ministry has wide ranging responsibilities. The ministry is responsible for local administration, internal security, citizenship, disaster management, road safety, land management, issuance of national identity cards, and public works. The ministry is responsible for appointing the 76 governors of the Provinces of Thailand. The Minister of Interior ( is the head of the ministry. He is appointed by the King of Thailand on the recommendation of the prime minister. Since 30 August 2014, the head of the ministry has been retired General Anupong Paochinda. He is aided by two deputy minister. The FY2019 budget of the ministry is 371,802 million baht. ==History== The ministry in its present form was founded by King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) in his reforms of the Siamese government. The ministry was founded on the 1 April 1892. He appointed his brother Prince Damrong Rajanubhab, to be its first \\"minister of state\\". At the time the ministry was divided into three divisions: the central division (, the northern division (, and the local administration division (. Prince Damrong reorganized the workings of the entire ministry and as a result the entire country. He created the monthon system, a complete new system of sub-divisions of the kingdom. He and the ministry took on so much power, that he was considered second only to the king. After King Vajiravudh (Rama VI) succeeded his father in 1910, the relationship between king and Prince Damrong deteriorated. In 1915 Prince Damrong resigned, officially citing health reasons, though it was an open secret that disagreements with the king were the real reason. During the Revolution of 1932 (actually, coup d'état), the Minister of Interior was Prince Paribatra Sukhumbandhu, who was exiled after the revolution because of his power. From then on the minister became an appointed position within the Cabinet of Thailand. Most ministers had been former police officials. Statue of Prince Damrong Rajanubhab, outside the Ministry of Interior ==Thai Niyom== The MOI, being responsible for provincial affairs, will, in conjunction with other ministries, deploy 7,663 teams to visits to 83,151 communities starting 21 February 2018 to explain the NCPO's Thai Niyom project. At meetings with people in each village, the ministry will a host free lunch for all participants, including villagers, resource persons, and officials. The interior minister explained that most of the Thai Niyom two-billion baht luncheon budget is to be spent on food for villagers, estimated at about 50 baht per head. Four visits will be made by officials to each village. Overall, the program was originally to cost 47 billion baht. In addition to the two billion baht luncheon budget, the combined ministries have been allocated 3.2 billion baht to help farmers switch to \\"economical crops\\"; 3.4 billion baht to develop new crop varieties; six billion baht to increase the value of agricultural products and avoid low prices; 15 billion baht to reduce economic inequality and enhance quality of life; 19 billion baht to upgrade irrigation systems; and 769 million baht for a \\"big data management project\\". The budget has since swollen to 100 billion baht. Thai Niyom, as defined by Gen Prayut Chan-o-cha, is \\"Thainess without ignoring global practices and international norms\\". It is neither nationalism nor patriotism and it is different from populism. \\"It is the extent[ion] of the pracharat (people's state) policy which emphasises internal growth and public participation and support while the government seeks cooperation from the private sector and the academic sector. Cooperation creates the power of three—government, public and private sector,\\" he said. A 61-member panel known as \\"steering committee for development under sustainable Thai Niyom Yangyeun ('Sustainable Thai-ism') projects\\" was set up to supervise the program. Each tambon (sub-district) team will have 7 to 12 members, consisting of local officials, security personnel, academics and volunteers brought together under the \\"Tam Kwam Dee Duay Hua Jai\\" ('Do good deeds by hearts') project. Interior Minister Anupong Paojinda denied the program was aimed at boosting the popularity of the military government. He insisted it was the government's duty to take good care of the people. The Thai Niyom program was officially launched by Prayut in Nonthaburi Province on 9 February 2018 to all 76 provincial governors, chiefs of 878 districts, and high ranking officials of related agencies. The 100 billion baht program allocates 35 billion baht for \\"grass-roots\\" economic development, 34.5 billion baht for tourism, community development, and village funds, and 30 billion for agricultural reform.

He wrote as Hank Reinhardt, the nickname by which he was widely known. He was the husband of editor Toni Weisskopf, formerly married to publisher Jim Baen, whom she succeeded as publisher of Baen Books. ==Life and family== Reinhardt was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia. He served in the U.S. Army in Europe in the 1950s. He later lived for many years in Alabama. He was married twice, first to Janet, who predeceased him and with whom he had two daughters, and second to Toni Weisskopf. He died in Athens, Georgia at the age of seventy-three of a staph infection contracted in the wake of heart bypass surgery. He was survived by his second wife, daughters Dana and Cathy, and two grandchildren. ==Career== Interested in knives and swords from an early age, Reinhardt furthered his education in arms during his Army service and through visits to various European museums. Back in America he held a number of jobs before joining in the 1980s with Bill Adams, president of Atlanta Cutlery, to establish Museum Replicas Ltd, a mail order firm specializing in recreations of medieval weaponry and armor. Thanks in part to Reinhardt's access to the Tower of London Armories, facilitated by his friendship with Ewart Oakeshott, the Armories' head curator, the firm was able to produce quality replicas, many made and tested by Reinhardt himself. He remained connected to the company as a consultant until his death, and also served as a consultant to other sword makers. ==Literary career== Reinhardt was a prolific author of articles on swords and knives, and wrote a column on swords in the movies for Blade magazine. Together with Gerald W. Page he edited the anthology Heroic Fantasy (DAW Books, 1979. He had a book on the history of the sword in progress at the time of his death. It was published after his death by Baen Books as The Book of Swords. He also produced two videos on the sword with Paladin Press. In addition, he played an integral role in Reclaiming the Blade, which includes an in depth interview detailing his experiences in Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA).http://www.reclaimingtheblade.com/main/?page_id=22 ==Career in science fiction fandom== A pivotal figure in Southern science fiction fandom for more than half a century, Reinhardt helped establish ASFO, the earliest science fiction club in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1950. He subsequently co-founded the first such club in Birmingham, Alabama as well. He served as a guest speaker, panelist on arms and armor, and demonstrator of medieval fighting techniques at many science fiction conventions. He also founded the Historical Armed Combat Association and branches of the Society for Creative Anachronism in Alabama, Georgia, and Louisiana. ==Recognition== Reinhardt received a number of awards in recognition of his fan activity and promotion of medieval weaponry, including the 1973 Rebel Award, DragonCon's 1990 Georgia Fandom Award (of which he was the inaugural recipient), and the 2006 Blade Show in Atlanta's Industry Achievement Award. ==BibliographyAnthologies edited=== *Heroic Fantasy (with Gerald W.

This family is within the clade Doridacea (according to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005). ==Distribution== Most species occur in the tropical Indo-Pacific region, but a few species have been found in the tropical Atlantic Ocean and in the Mediterranean. ==Description== The mantle of these oval nudibranchs is flattened dorsoventrally and its dorsal surface is covered with hard, colored tubercles. This mantle is decorated with contrasting colors and patterns as warning signals to predators. The lamellate rhinophores can be retracted. Like other dorid nudibranchs, all species have a dorsal anus, except for the species in the genus Fryeria where the anus is posteroventral and protrusible.Bergh, L.S.R., 1875. Neue Beitrage zur Kentniss der Phyllidiaden. Verhandlungen der zoologisch-botanischen Gesellschaft 25: 659-674. In contrast with the other nudibranchs from the clade Doridacea, the species in this family lack buccal armature, i. e. radulae and jaws. The gill leaflets are situated along the ventral area and to the side (= ventrolateral ) instead of consisting of a dorsomedian (= along the middle line of the upper surface) circlet . The oral glands, which are closely associated with the pharynx and contained in the oral tube, and the stomach have undergone modifications. The female part in the reproductive system of these hermaphroditic snails has two separate openings and the male part one. This is called a triaulic reproductive system. It corresponds to the same triaulic condition of the advanced dorids. Most phyllidiids appear in their natural context during day time in a conspicuous way and are thus exposed to their predators. However their colors are warning signals indicating special capabilities to deter predators, such as bioactive chemical defense. This phenomenon is called aposematism. During observations, only one species was found to be always hidden: Phyllidiopsis cardinalis Bergh. == Feeding habits == There are not many reports on the ecology and the feeding habits of these nudibranchs. As their small mouth lacks a radula and other buccal hard parts, they are known as predators adapted for sucking on sponges. Phyllidia varicosa has been observed feeding on a sponge of the genus Hymeniacidon. Phyllidia flava has been reported feeding on the sponge Acanthella acuta. == Taxonomy == The original spelling was denoted as family Phyllidia. Jean-Baptiste Lamarck coined the words \\"les Phyllidiens\\" and \\"les phyllidéens\\" (1801; 1809). These were later Latinized by J.G. Children (1823) to Phyllidiana, who put them in Hydrobranchiae. The present name Phyllidiidae is now attributed to Rafinesque and not to Lamarck. There has been much confusion in the taxonomy of this family, largely caused by inadequate early descriptions and the difficulties of classifying a family where the species all lack radulae. David J. Brunckhorst in his paper \\"The Systematics and Phylogeny of Phyllidiid Nudibranchs (Doridoidea)\\" reviewed this family and clarified the status of many species as well as describing new species and a genus. Phylogenetic analysis through cladistics shows that the family Phyllidiidae is monophyletic. The phylogenetic tree shows that Ceratophyllidia is sister to the rest of the family and Phyllidiopsis sister to the remaining genera, Phyllidiella sister to the remaining genera, and Reticulidia sister to Phyllidia and Fryeria.Valdés A (2002) A phylogenetic analysis and systematic revision of the cryptobranch dorids (Mollusca, Nudibranchia, Anthobranchia).

He ran the freelance agency Frontline News TV and founded the Frontline Club in London. The Guardian has described him as \\"a former army officer, journalist adventurer and rightwing libertarian.\\" ==Early life== Smith's father was a Queen's Messenger and a colonel in the Grenadier Guards. Smith was an officer in the same regiment, serving in Northern Ireland, Cyprus and Germany. Smith captained the Army shooting team. Prior to setting up Frontline News TV, he was briefly a microlight test pilot. ==Career== In the 1990s, Smith worked as an independent cameraman and video news journalist covering wars and conflict in Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia, Chechnya, Kosovo, and elsewhere. Smith himself filmed the only uncontrolled footage of the Gulf War in 1991, after he bluffed his way into an active-duty unit while disguised as a British Army officer. During the '90s, Smith also ran Frontline News TV, an agency set up in 1989 to represent the interests of young video journalists who wanted to push the envelope of their profession. The workings of Frontline News TV captured the imagination of a generation of young freelancers and was described by the BBC world affairs editor John Simpson as one of the \\"high peaks of journalism\\". Its history has been detailed in a book Frontline: Reporting from the World's Deadliest Places, by David Loyn of the BBC. During Smith's time as a freelance, he worked for many of the world's leading television stations and became an expert on, and advocator of, greater support for freelances operating in war zones. He has worked on journalist safety programmes. As a freelance cameraman, he won, either individually or part of a team, 28 news awards (see below). Smith has been shot twice, but escaped both times with light injuries. While he was filming the Serbian action at Prekaz in April 1998, a bullet lodged in his mobile telephone. ==Current activities== Vaughan Smith's mobile telephone in a display at the Frontline Club showing the sniper's bullet still lodged within. See: Attack on Prekaz for the event during which the bullet was fired. The banknote within view is at value of 1000 DeM, about €512. Smith founded the Frontline Club in London in 2003 as an institution to champion independent journalism and promote better understanding of international news and its coverage. Smith also runs a mixed organic farm on his estate at Ellingham Hall, in Norfolk, a \\"sprawling and elegant Georgian manor house near the town of Bungay\\" which has belonged to his family for more than three centuries. The estate is \\"[s]urrounded by 600 acres of woods and fields. . . . It has 10 bedrooms, a large dining room with a convivial circular table, and portraits of Smith's ancestors hanging on the walls. There is a housekeeper who cooks meals.\\" The farm specialises in pedigree rare-breed pigs, and provides the seasonal food for the Frontline Club and its public restaurant. ===Julian Assange=== In 2010, Smith gave refuge to Julian Assange, the founder of whistle-blowing website WikiLeaks, first at the Frontline Club and then at his country house.Norman, Joshua. \\"Just Where Is WikiLeaks Founder Julian Assange's \\"Mansion Arrest\\"? CBS News, 16 December 2010 He said of his decision to house Assange: \\"Having watched him give himself up last week to the British justice system, I took the decision that I would do whatever else it took to ensure that he is not denied his basic rights as a result of the anger of the powerful forces he has enraged.\\" \\"It was about standing up to the bully and the question of whether our country, in these historic times, really was the tolerant, independent and open place I had been brought up to believe it was and feel that it needs to be.\\" Having backed Julian Assange by offering surety in December 2010, he lost the money in June 2012 when a judge ordered it to be forfeited, as Assange had sought to escape the jurisdiction of the English courts by entering the embassy of Ecuador.https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/04/julian- assange-backers-lose-bail At the Westminster magistrates court in October 2012, Smith plead on behalf of himself and eight other Assange sureties to keep their money, arguing they could not \\"meaningfully intervene in this matter […] between the Ecuadorean, British, Swedish, US and Australian governments.\\" ==Personal life== Smith lives at Ellingham Hall in Norfolk, England, with his wife, Pranvera, and their two daughters, Beatrice & Louise. ==Awards== As a freelance cameraman Smith won, either individually or as part of a team, 28 news awards. Most of them were for The Valley, a film which Smith produced about the Kosovo War, which remains one of the most acclaimed documentaries ever shown on the UK's Channel 4 television. In 2007, Smith was the joint winner of a MediaGuardian Innovation Award and in 2008 a Rory Peck Award finalist for his film about Grenadier Guards in Helmand. Giving a speech at the Rory Peck Awards ceremony, Smith strongly criticised news broadcasters for failing to give cameramen due recognition for their work. \\"I've been shot more times than I have been credited by the BBC,\\" he said. \\"Without the recognition we deserve we spill our blood anonymously, consigned to the margins.\\" == Contributions == * Smith produced The Valley, a film about the Kosovo war of 1998/9. * Smith produced an independent multimedia blog From the Frontline in 2007, reporting from Southern Afghanistan. The blog earned him a Guardian Media Innovation Award. * Smith co-produced Blood Trail, a feature documentary which follows photojournalist Robert King for 15 years, nominated for the 2008 Toronto Film Festival.

Its size (about 100,000 light- years) makes it similar to our own galaxy, the Milky Way. It is called a \\"grand design\\" galaxy because of its well defined spiral arms. One supernova and two ultraluminous X-ray sources have been discovered in NGC 7424. ==Characteristics== NGC 7424 is intermediate between normal spirals (SA) and strongly barred galaxies (SB). Other features include the presence of a central ring-like structure and a relatively low core brightness relative to the arms. The redder color of the prominent bar indicates an older population of stars while the bright blue color of the loose arms indicates the presence of ionised hydrogen and clusters of massive young stars. NGC 7424 is listed as a member of the IC 1459 Grus Group of galaxies, but is suspected of being a \\"field galaxy\\"; that is, not gravitationally bound to any group. ==Supernova 2001ig== SN 2001ig was a rare Type IIb supernova discovered by Australian amateur Robert Evans on the outer edge of NGC 7424 on 10 December 2001. Type IIb supernovae (SNe) initially exhibit spectral lines of hydrogen (like typical Type II's), but these disappear after a short time to be replaced by lines of oxygen, calcium and magnesium (like typical Type Ib's and Ic's). Spiral Galaxy NGC 7424 and SN2001ig. Credit: ESO In 2006, Anglo-Australian Observatory astronomer Stuart Ryder et al. found what they argued could be the binary companion to SN 2001ig using the Gemini Observatory. It is a massive A or F class star that had an eccentric orbit around the progenitor, a Wolf- Rayet star. They believe that the companion periodically stripped the outer hydrogen-rich envelope of the progenitor, accounting for the observed spectral changes. Princeton University fellow Alicia Soderberg et al. also believe that the progenitor was a Wolf-Rayet star, but suggest that the periodic mass loss was a result of the intense stellar wind these stars produce. In a paper published in March 2018, Ryder et al. announced that the surviving companion had been observed with the Hubble Space Telescope in the ultraviolet. This is the first time a companion to a Type IIb supernova has been imaged. Hubble Space Telescope image of surviving companion to SN 2001ig ==Ultraluminous X-ray sources== In May and June 2002, Roberto Soria and his colleagues at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics discovered two Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. ULXs are objects that emit tremendous amounts of X-rays (> 1032 watts or 1039 erg/s), assuming they radiate isotropically (the same in all directions). This amount is larger than currently understood stellar processes (including supernovae) but smaller than the amount of X-rays emitted by active galactic nuclei, which accounts for their alternate name, Intermediate-luminosity X-ray Objects (IXOs). The source designated ULX1 was found in a relatively empty interarm region, far from any bright clusters or star-forming complexes, and showed a 75% increase in X-ray luminosity over the course of 20 days. ULX2 was found in an exceptionally bright young stellar complex, and showed an order of magnitude increase over the same time period. ==References External links == * Category:Barred spiral galaxies Category:Grus (constellation) 7424 070096 ","title":"NGC 7424"},{"id":"20546014","text":"Flabellina affinis is a species of sea slug, an aeolid nudibranch, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Flabellinidae.Gofas, S.

In some organizations, the same person may hold this title along with that of chief technology officer (CTO). Alternatively, a company could have one or the other, or both occupied by separate people. Often, CSOs exist in heavily research-oriented companies; while CTOs exist in product development focused companies. The typical category of research and development that exists in many science and technology companies can be led by either post, depending upon which area is the organization's primary focus. A CSO almost always has a pure science background and an advanced degree, whereas a CTO often has a background in engineering or business development. Some academic research organizations, such as the Fox Chase Cancer Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and the San Diego Supercomputer Center have adopted a similar title of CSO. Typically, their role is to evaluate and set scientific priorities and coordinate the administrative structure that supports scientists. A CSO commonly has a scientific or academic background, yet they may or may not be practicing scientists or academics. ==England== In the National Health Service, the CSO is the head of profession for the 53,000 healthcare scientists working in the organization and its associated bodies. The CSO is one of six NHS professional officers (including the chief medical officer and the chief nursing officer) who are employed within NHS England. These roles lead their own professional groups as well as providing expert knowledge about their specific disciplines to the NHS and wider health and care system. The CSO provides professional leadership and expert clinical advice across the health system, as well as working alongside senior clinical leaders within NHS England and the broader commissioning system. The CSO is also responsible for delivering the government's strategy for a modernised healthcare science workforce, Modernising Scientific Careers. Professor Dame Sue Hill has been the CSO since October 2002 first within the department of health and subsequently NHS England .

It was an extension of the conflicts that formed the English Civil War, pitting the forces of Puritan settlers against forces aligned with Lord Baltimore, then Lord Proprietor of the colony of Maryland. It has been suggested by Radmila May that this was the \\"last battle of the English Civil War.\\" ==Background== The background surrounding the Battle of the Severn flows from the early days of Maryland as a colony, and acts as a mirror to the events simultaneously occurring in England. It pitted the forces allied with the royal proprietor, who was a Catholic and perceived to be a royalist, against forces allied with the Commonwealth of England, who were Puritans. ===Royal proprietorship=== Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, 1st Proprietary Governor of the Province of Maryland Maryland was founded by the first Baron Baltimore, who had previously been the principal secretary to James I. Baltimore resigned from his position after the death of James I following his conversion to Catholicism. After a visit to what would be Maryland in 1628, Baltimore requested that Charles I make a grant of land for a colony in which Catholics could worship freely. Following Baltimore's death on June 20, 1632, the grant of land was made to Cecil Calvert, now the new Lord Baltimore. , Also available at The Charter of Maryland was unique in that it made Lord Baltimore and his heirs the \\"absolute Lords and Proprietaries\\" of the new colony. In effect, the grant created a county palatine, and, indeed, the name of Durham, a county palatine in its own right, is used in the charter. The effect of this document was to create a semi-independent colony, ruled by Lord Baltimore as Duke. Sending his brother Leonard Calvert, the first settlers, a party of Catholic gentry and Protestants, of the new colony landed in present-day St. Mary's City on March 27, 1634. Using his absolute powers bestowed by charter, Cecil Calvert named his brother as royal governor of the new colony, a post he held from 1634–44, and again from 1646 until his death in 1647. William Claiborne, however, had an earlier claim to Kent Island arising from 1631 when he had landed and set up a fur trading post on behalf of the colony of Virginia. Using the language of the charter that allowed him to take possession of land between the Delaware Bay and Potomac River \\"not cultivated or planted\\", Cecil Calvert lay claim to Kent Island. Following the arrest of one of his agents for trading in Maryland waters without a license in 1635, Claiborne fitted out an armed ship, and there ensued a naval battle on April 23, 1635 by the mouth of the Pocomoke River. Following this battle, Leonard Calvert captured Kent Island by force in February 1638. Leonard Calvert, First Royal Governor of Maryland The ensuing fallout from the capture of Kent Island, and the vengefulness of Claiborne, would resonate through Maryland for many years to follow. ===The Plundering Time=== The three part English Civil War, starting in 1642 and ending in 1651, had a direct effect on Maryland. The war itself was fought between the supporters of Charles I and the supporters of the English Parliament. The civil war was followed by a period of time known as the English Interregnum. During this time the English monarchy was abolished, the Commonwealth of England was proclaimed, and England was ruled by Oliver Cromwell, its Lord Protector. The conflict did not finally resolve itself until 1661 with the coronation of Charles II, an act known as the English Restoration. In April 1643, aware of the problems besetting the home-country, Leonard Calvert departed Maryland to consult with his brother Cecil Calvert, leaving Giles Brent as acting governor in his absence. During this time, St. Mary's City was visited by Captain Richard Ingle, an ardent supporter of the Parliamentary side of the conflict, who was placed under nominal arrest for making disloyal comments concerning the King, but who was allowed to escape following his arrest. Upon Leonard Calvert's return, he discovered that Ingle had joined forces with Claiborne and they were planning an invasion of the colony. In September 1644, Ingle captured St. Mary's City, and Claiborne recovered Kent Island, forcing Calvert to seek refuge in Virginia. What followed became known as the Plundering Time, a nearly two-year period when Ingle and his companions roamed the colony, robbing at will and taking Jesuits back to England as prisoners. This ended only in 1646 when Calvert returned from exile in Virginia, recaptured St. Mary's City, and restored order. ===The settling of Providence=== William Stone, 3rd Colonial Governor of Maryland Following the death of Leonard Calvert in 1647, Cecil Calvert named William Stone as governor in 1649. Stone's appointment was carefully made, as he was a Protestant – as were the majority of the members of his council – and a friend of Parliament. By choosing Stone, Calvert could avoid criticism of Maryland as a seat of Popery, where Protestants were allegedly oppressed. Stone and his council, however, were required to agree not to interfere with freedom of worship. In 1649, the colonial Assembly passed the \\"Act Concerning Religion\\" (or the Toleration Act as it is more commonly known), ensuring freedom of religion within Maryland. During the period of Parliamentary rule, Virginia remained faithful to then King Charles II, though Parliament, which had declared England a Commonwealth under their rule, had decreed that support for Charles II was treason. Baltimore and Stone stayed mute on the subject, but almost immediately after taking office, Stone allowed a group of persecuted Virginian Puritans into the colony, who then settled at Providence, present- day Annapolis. The issue of which side Maryland stood was finally settled, at least in appearance, when Thomas Greene, deputy to Stone and a Catholic, declared on November 15, 1649 that Charles II was the \\"undoubted rightfull heire to all his father's dominions\\". All acts taken by the Maryland Assembly would further require an oath of fidelity to Baltimore as \\"Lord Proprietor\\". ===The new Assembly=== In 1651 there began a set of rumors indicating that Lord Baltimore would lose his charter. Parliament had appointed two Commissioners, one of whom was none other than Claiborne, to force Virginia to submit to Parliamentary authority. The other was Richard Bennett, who became Governor of Virginia. They interpreted Maryland to fall under this commission. In March 1652 they removed Stone as governor, only to reinstate him in June 1652. On March 2, 1654, Stone decreed that although he was faithful to the Commonwealth, all writs should \\"run in the Proprietary's name as heretofore\\". On January 3, 1654, the Puritans who had settled at Stone's invitation in Providence communicated to the commissioners that they objected to the oath of fidelity to Baltimore as a Catholic. On July 20, 1654, Stone resigned as governor under duress. The Commissioners became de facto governors of the colony, and the first general assembly under their authority was held on October 20, 1654. Catholics and any other individuals who had borne arms against the Parliament could not be members (effectively limiting the membership to Puritans), and among the 44 Acts passed by this group was a repeal of the Toleration Act, and another that forbade Catholics from practicing their faith. ===Stone's return to power=== On January 31, 1655, The Golden Lyon, a merchant ship commanded by Captain Roger Heamans, arrived in Maryland, and William Stone reported to the Captain that he was no longer Governor of Maryland. At about that time, another ship, The Golden Fortune arrived in the colony with a letter from Oliver Cromwell, by this time Lord Protector, addressed to Captain Stone, Governor of Maryland. Using this as a form of recognition, William Stone challenged the authority of the commissioners, seized back the records of the colony, and mustered his troops to deal with the Puritan settlers allied with them. Recruiting from St. Mary's County, newly restored Governor Stone recaptured the Assembly records, located on the Patuxent River, and sailed with a small fleet up the Chesapeake Bay towards Providence. ==The Battle of the Severn== The battle was fought on Horn Point, the peninsula on the right in a panoramic view from an early photograph, in the present-day neighborhood of Eastport in Annapolis, Maryland Heamans was informed of an alleged plot to kill the inhabitants of Providence, as well as to burn his ship and kill his crew and officers. Following the removal of the women and children of Providence to The Golden Lyon, a war council was convened and appointed William Fuller, later known as \\"Captain Fuller\\" in the coming conflict, the military leader of the Puritan settlers at Providence. On March 23, 1655, the council issued a warrant to Heamans to serve as a counselor, with Heamans relating to Stone that he was bound to do so, ignoring his contrary orders. On March 24, 1655, Heamans fired on sloops and boats heading toward his ship, forcing their retreat. Heamans then ordered an armed sloop to bar their escape by blocking Spa Creek, the inlet of the Severn to which Stone's forces had retreated. On March 25, after Captain Fuller retrieved the only Commonwealth flag in the colony for use as his colors in battle, the forces met on Horn Point, with Fuller's forces driving Stone's small force to the end of the peninsula. In less than one half-hour, the battle was over, with 17 of Stone's forces being killed, and four executed, including Thomas Hatton, secretary of the colony. Thirty-two were wounded, including Stone. Only two of Fuller's force were killed. Governor Stone surrendered after he was promised mercy. Following hostilities, however, the war council issued death sentences for Stone and nine others.Gambrill gives the total number of death sentences as 10 , but Nay states that there were 12 . Four of the prisoners were executed, but the remainder, including Stone, were saved when the women of Providence begged that their lives be spared. ==Aftermath== The primarily Puritan assembly retained powers until April 27, 1658, when proprietorship was restored to Lord Baltimore, religious freedom was ensured, and an agreement of general amnesty was entered into. Thus, in the end, Lord Baltimore not only retained his lands and powers, but was able to avoid the grisly fate of many of his contemporaries in England during this time. The proprietor appointed Josias Fendall to succeed Stone as governor for his loyalty during the battle. The issue of the ongoing Claiborne grievance was finally settled by an agreement reached in 1657. Lord Baltimore provided Claiborne amnesty for all of his offenses, Virginia laid aside any claim it had to Maryland territory, and Claiborne was indemnified with extensive land grants in Virginia for his loss of Kent Island. Governor Fendall soon had a falling out with Lord Baltimore and led a bloodless revolution in 1659 whereby he and Fuller reorganized Maryland's government to resemble the Commonwealth's. However, the Restoration of Charles II in 1660 forced Fendall into exile and restored the proprietorship. Fendall was replaced as governor by Phillip Calvert. In addition, Fuller's estate was confiscated and Claiborne never recovered his former holding of Kent Island. ==See also== *Plundering Time *Toleration Act of 1649 ==ReferencesSources== * Category:North America in the English Civil War Severn Category:Battles in Maryland Category:Pre-statehood history of Maryland Category:1655 in Maryland Category:1655 in England Category:Conflicts in 1655 Category:Puritanism in Maryland Category:Internal wars of the United States ","title":"Battle of the Severn"},{"id":"20546111","text":"Halgerda guahan is a species of sea slug, a dorid nudibranch, a shell-less marine gastropod mollusk in the family Discodorididae.Bouchet P. & Rocroi J.-P.

This was particularly illustrated by the poster sites of the 2008 Rome City Council elections. ==Background== In art, décollage is created by cutting, ripping off or removing pieces of an original image or images to reveal the substrate or the images that lie beneath. A distinct genre of décollage is the torn poster. This happens when a poster has been pasted on top of another poster and then cut or torn to reveal the poster or posters beneath, or where ripped poster fragments are pasted, layer upon layer, to a canvas or substrate to create a new montage. This genre is strongly associated with Mimmo Rotella; he invented it after returning from America in 1953 convinced that nothing in art was original. He had what he later described as a \\"Zen illumination\\" - the discovery of the advertising poster as a form of artistic expression. Armed with a penknife, he began ripping off posters and pieces of the zinc mounts from Rome's council advertising sites. He was then labelled the \\"poster ripper\\" or the \\"painter of glued paper\\". Rotella exhibited his \\"torn posters\\" for the first time at Esposizione d'arte attuale in 1955 and the term \\"décollage\\" was claimed for this genre in the same year by poet, artist and fellow Italian Emilio Villa. This French word, meaning \\"to unstick\\", first appeared in print in 1938 in Dictionnaire Abrégé du Surréalisme and notably from 1949 on, Hains was creating pieces from posters he had torn from Parisian walls. ==See also== *Décollage *Mimmo Rotella ==References== Category:Artistic techniques ","title":"Organic décollage"},{"id":"20546116","text":"Birdnesters of Thailand () is a 1991 French short documentary film directed by Éric Valli.

He described himself as a \\"Jew and an Alsatian, thus doubly Alsatian and doubly Jewish\\". ==Life== Vigée was born in Bischwiller, Bas-Rhin, the son of Germaine (Meyer), a homemaker, and Robert Schwartz, who worked in business.https://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/educational-magazines/vigee-claude- andre-strauss-1921 He was descended from an old family of Alsatian cloth merchants. He spent his youth in Bischwiller, then attended secondary school in Strasbourg. Displaced from Alsace by the invasion of the Germans in 1940, he began to study medicine in Toulouse before joining the Résistance. In 1942, he published his first poems in the underground magazine \\"Poésie 42\\". He fled to the United States in 1943, where he obtained his doctorate in Romance Languages and Literature in 1947. He taught French Language and Literature at Ohio State University, then at Wellesley College and then at Brandeis University. Since 1950, he has regularly published his poetry in France. He lived in Israel between 1960 and 2001, where he taught at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem until his retirement in 1983. On March 18, 2000, the \\"Claude Vigée\\" Cultural Center was opened in his home city of Bischwiller. Vigée died in Paris on 2 October 2020 at the age of 99. Among other subjects, Vigée's poetry discusses the suffering of the Jews, the Alsatians, the Alsatian Jews and the Jews in Alsace, but he also deals with the beauty and the transitoriness of the simple, rural heritage. The pursuit for peace and interpersonal accord is also a recurring motif. From his first collection, La Lutte avec l'ange (1949) he imposes himself by the tone both biblical and rilkean of his language, the magnitude of his visions, the anguished fervor with which he seeks the face of God through the immensities of time and space, the happy spontaneity of his images and the symbolic value of which he knows how to charge: \\"L'humide et chaude nuit rendit coptif des songes Ce grand arbre irrite par les vents eternels.\\" In La Corne du Grand Pardon (1954), L'Ete indien (1957), Canaan d'exil (1962) he has sometimes expressed in classics, sometimes in liberated verses, sometimes in prose, a feeling of exile which is probably less due to the fact he has long lived out of his native Alsace than that born in a Jewish family, he felt everywhere separated from his religious homeland. In Le Poeme du retour (1962), written after he had settled in Israel, he said, in a \\"militant\\" tone quite close to Paul Eluard's, his joy at having found the haven he was looking for, and to be able to work for the cause of his brothers; \\"Apres tant d'abandons, dr misere et de ruines Ce pays est vivant par la grace d'un peuple.\\" ==Awards== Vigée is the winner of numerous awards, including the Johann-Peter-Hebel-Preis (1984), the Grand prix de Poésie de la Société des Gens de Lettres de France (1987), the Prix de la Fondation du Judaïsme français (1994), the Grand prix de Poésie de l'Académie française (1996), the Würth Prize for European Literature (2002) and the Elisabeth Langgässer Literature Prize (2003). ==WorksEnglish Translations=== * * ===Poetry=== * La lutte avec l'ange (1939–1949) Publication 1950.

He was said to have served for several years under Frederick II of Prussia, even though he was only twenty-six years old. Congress granted him a commission on 16 March 1776Lossing, pg 123. as a brigadier general and assigned him to the army under General Philip Schuyler in New York. En route to serve his new commission in April 1776, Woedtke accompanied Benjamin Franklin, who was on a diplomatic mission to Canada. Charles Carroll, a congressman from Maryland on the same mission, wrote that Frederick William was \\"not the best bred up by his Prussian Majesty.\\"Ketchum, 16 This may have been a reference to Woedtke's alcoholism. Baron de Woedtke broke company with the diplomatic mission after reporting to General Schuyler. The two generals joined Brigadier General John Thomas and set out to reinforce General Benedict Arnold in the siege of Quebec. After the failure of the Canadian campaign, de Woedtke remained in New York. He was with the general council (which included Schuyler and Horatio Gates) that decided to abandon Fort Crown Point and consolidate at Mount Independence on the Vermont side of Lake Champlain.Ketchum, 54 He became ill in July 1776, possibly of smallpox, possibly from alcoholism. According to the letters of Horatio Gates and others who were with him, de Woedtke died at the Fort George military post near Lake George in late July 1776, shortly after that meeting; the Continental Congress used July 28 as the date his commission was terminated as the result of his death.

The site is within the Letchworth Conservation Area, management of which is the responsibility of the Letchworth Garden City Heritage Foundation (formerly the Letchworth Corporation). The College occupies a single campus of 3.1 hectares (7.66 acres) comprising a number of buildings, playing fields, gardens and other facilities. ==History== The school buildings belong to the period from 1919 to 1938 when Letchworth was being developed as the first Garden City. Originally built for St Christopher's School, it was acquired by the Sisters of Charity of Jesus and Mary in 1933 to found St Francis' College, a connection which is reflected in several aspects of the buildings, including the chapel. Various buildings have been developed or improved since 1983, when the sisters withdrew. The main entrance is into the Broadway Building, a substantial building extending to four floors, plus a basement. It is constructed from steel uprights and beams, in-filled with concrete floor slabs and brick exterior walls. It was built in 1938; the foundation stone was placed by Bishop Eugène van Rechem. Extensions were made in the 1960s to the Dining Hall and Chapel above and the JCR (junior common room) and the Chapel Annexe was added. The Broadway Building contains inter alia the residential area for the boarders, classrooms, Sixth Form Centre, Head's and her Deputy's offices and some of the College administration staff. The Middle School Building was built in 1919 and Mrs Annie Besant, President of the Theosophical Education trust, laid what was then a cornerstone to mark the occasion. With later additions in 1924 the cornerstone became a single faced stone in the east wall of the building. It is, in part, two storeys high, organised around a central courtyard, within which is a temporary building. The Theatre and Gymnasium were built in 1924 at the same time as the northern part of Middle School and again the foundation stone was laid by the, later, Dr Annie Besant. The Theatre has seating for 330 although the originally capacity was 600. Originally it was intended to be an Assembly Hall, but at the eleventh hour the design was altered to add a fly tower and create a theatre. The statue of St Francis, above the entrance, was added in 1937. Well known in its heyday (Olivier is believed to have made his first stage appearance here, as a babe-in-arms) the Theatre became dilapidated in the 1980s, but the auditorium and stage were refurbished in 2001/02 with further improvements to the foyer and other areas in 2003/04. The Prep. Department Building, a two-storey brick building with basement, was constructed in the 1940s with an extension in the late 1960s. On-site recreation and sporting facilities include a 20-metre indoor heated swimming pool built in the early 1970s, five tarmac tennis/netball courts, a sports field and adjacent grassed sports/playing area. Kindergarten is provided, to the north of the Broadway Building, with an all-weather play area extending into an enclosed garden. The Upper Prep pupils have access to a grassed area known as the Loggia garden south of their classrooms in Middle School. ==Notable former pupils== *Jennie Bond, previously the BBC Royal Correspondent, attended St Francis' College. *Adenike Grange, former Nigerian Minister in charge of the Federal Ministry of Health. *Claire Slater, actress, attended the school. ==References *School Website *ISI Inspection Reports *Ofsted Boarding Inspection Report *Parents' Association Website Category:Independent schools in Hertfordshire Category:Girls' schools in Hertfordshire Category:Educational institutions established in 1933 Category:1933 establishments in England Category:Member schools of the Girls' Schools Association Category:Boarding schools in Hertfordshire Category:Letchworth Category:Buildings and structures in Letchworth ","title":"St Francis' College, Letchworth"},{"id":"20546234","text":"The 1998 Stuttgart Masters (known as the Eurocard Open for sponsorship reasons) was a tennis tournament played on indoor hard courts.

He served as the head football coach at the University of Toledo from 2009 to 2011 and at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign from 2012 to 2014, compiling a career college football coaching record of 33–41. Beckman was terminated by Illinois on August 28, 2015, seven days prior to the Illini's scheduled season opener, after numerous allegations of abuse of players surfaced. ==Early life== Beckman attended high school at Forest Park High School in Beaumont, Texas, for two years before completing his secondary education at Berea High School in Berea, Ohio. Beckman is the son of David Beckman, a longtime NCAA, NFL, and CFL coach and scout.http://www.sj-r.com/article/20120826/News/308269981http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-12-12/sports/ct- spt-1213-illinois-tim-beckman--20111213_1_toledo-offensive-coordinator-dave- beckman-head-coach He attended the University of Findlay, where he lettered on the football team for two years; in both years the Oilers qualified for the NAIA Football National Championship playoffs. He graduated from Findlay in 1985 with a degree in physical education. ==Coaching careerAssistant coach=== Beckman began his coaching career at Auburn as a graduate assistant under Pat Dye from 1988 to 1989. Auburn were SEC co-champions in those seasons, and Beckman earned a master's degree in education from Auburn. From 1990 to 1995, Beckman was secondary coach and recruiting coordinator at Western Carolina. He later became defensive coordinator and recruiting coordinator at Elon, a position he would hold from 1996 to 1997. Beckman coached at Bowling Green as defensive coordinator and associate head coach from 1998 to 2004 and at Ohio State under Jim Tressel as cornerbacks coach from 2005 to 2006, where he was a three-time nominee for the Frank Broyles Award. Beckman was the defensive coordinator at Oklahoma State University from 2007 to 2008. The Cowboys posted a record of 16–10 during those seasons. ===Toledo=== On December 4, 2008, Beckman was hired as the head coach at Toledo, to replace Tom Amstutz, who resigned during the 2008 season. Beckman's teams at Toledo saw consistent improvement. The 2008 team he inherited went 3–9. In 2009, his first year as a head coach, his team improved to finish 5–7. In the following year, his team finished 8–5, 7–1 in the MAC, earning a berth to the 2010 Little Caesar's Pizza Bowl, which they lost 34–32 to the FIU Golden Panthers. In his final year at Toledo, Coach Beckman finished 9–4, 7–1 in the MAC to be West Division co-champions with Northern Illinois. This team earned a berth to the 2011 Military Bowl. However, Beckman left after the regular season to become the head coach for Illinois. ===Illinois=== At Illinois, Beckman went 12–25 in three seasons, and only won four games in Big Ten play. In his third season, the Illini managed to qualify for a bowl with a 6–6 record, but lost 35–18 to Louisiana Tech in the Heart of Dallas Bowl. On August 28, 2015—just a week before what was to be his fourth season—Beckman was fired after the preliminary results of an internal investigation substantiated accusations of gross player mistreatment. Most seriously, the investigation found that he'd forced players to play through serious injuries and had the medical staff clear these players too soon. In a statement, Beckman called his ouster a \\"rush to judgment\\" that violated the terms of his contract, and stated that he intended to \\"vigorously defend both my reputation and my legal rights.\\" On April 11, 2016, Beckman settled with the university for a one time payment of $250,000 with the decision of firing \\"for cause\\" due to the mistreatment of players standing. http://www.thechampaignroom.com/2016/4/12/11414200/tim-beckman-settlement- illinois-football-news ===North Carolina=== On August 24, 2016; Beckman was hired to serve as a volunteer assistant defensive coach for the North Carolina Tar Heels, working under head coach Larry Fedora. Beckman and Fedora have a working history together, having both served as assistant coaches on Mike Gundy's staff at Oklahoma State in 2007. However, after a firestorm of criticism, Beckman resigned from this position the next day, claiming he did not want to be a \\"distraction.\\" It was later revealed that UNC chancellor Carol Folt had strongly objected to Beckman's presence, even in a volunteer role, once she learned about the arrangement. ==ControversiesToledo=== In 2013, a former Toledo football player, Kyle Cameron, sued Beckman, the University of Toledo, and five members of Beckman's staff at Toledo for negligence and for violating Ohio's anti-hazing law. Cameron's lawsuit and appeal were dismissed as the suit was filed through the incorrect division of the Lucas County Court. However, Cameron's legal counsel has asked the Supreme Court of Ohio to review the case. ===Illinois=== Beckman was hired on December 9, 2011, by Illinois athletic director Mike Thomas. Prior to the start of the 2012 season, Beckman sent six Illinois assistant coaches to State College, Pennsylvania to recruit Penn State football players who the NCAA deemed eligible to transfer without missing playing time due to the Penn State child sex abuse scandal. In October 2012 season, Illinois self-reported secondary violations to the NCAA as television cameras caught Beckman using chewing tobacco on the sidelines during a football game at Wisconsin. ==Head coaching recordSee also== * List of Auburn University people ==NotesReferences * Illinois profile * Oklahoma State profile * Ohio State profile * Bowling Green profile Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Auburn Tigers football coaches Category:Auburn University alumni Category:Bowling Green Falcons football coaches Category:Elon Phoenix football coaches Category:Findlay Oilers football players Category:Illinois Fighting Illini football coaches Category:Ohio State Buckeyes football coaches Category:Oklahoma State Cowboys football coaches Category:Toledo Rockets football coaches Category:Western Carolina Catamounts football coaches Category:Sportspeople from Beaumont, Texas Category:People from Berea, Ohio Category:Players of American football from Ohio Category:Sportspeople from Cuyahoga County, Ohio Category:College football controversies ","title":"Tim Beckman"},{"id":"20546272","text":"Eygelshoven Markt is a railway station located in Eygelshoven, Netherlands. ==History== The station was opened in 1909 as Eygelshoven until its closure in 1952 and subsequent demolition.

Barbato served as acting underboss at one time. ==Career and NJ exclusion== A distant cousin of Genovese crime family mob boss Frank Costello and cousin to Genovese crime family capo Willie Moretti, Barbato was reportedly been an associate of the Genovese crime family since the 1940s At the time, his criminal record included convictions of four counts of bookmaking in the 1950s and 1960s, plus a conviction for robbery in 1963. Sometime in the late 1970s, Barbato became the personal bodyguard and chauffeur for Genovese crime family underboss and Brooklyn faction leader Venero \\"Benny Eggs\\" Mangano. After being recognized as a \\"made member\\" or soldier since the 1970s, Barbato was officially excluded from the state of New Jersey on August 11, 1987. Barbato was a distant relative to the first wife of singer/actor Frank Sinatra, Nancy Barbato (Nancy Sinatra Sr.) ==Indictments and guilty plea== In 2005, Barbato was indicted on federal racketeering charges and racketeering conspiracy, which included murder conspiracy, extortion, loansharking and witness tampering. U.S. law enforcement charged him with operating criminal activities in the Brooklyn section as well as associating with then-current family acting boss Dominick \\"Quiet Dom\\" Cirillo and fellow captains Lawrence \\"Little Larry\\" Dentico and Anthony \\"Tico\\" Antico.

Barbato, Cirillo and Antico were even charged with murder conspiracy, as they reputedly plotted to murder an important witness who had helped building the racketeering case against the defendants. Following the arrests of Barbato and three others, The New York Times reported: > 'With these arrests, law enforcement has effectively dismantled the present > leadership of the Genovese family,' the United States attorney in Brooklyn, > Roslynn R.

The New York Daily News reported that Barbato and the others were \\"allegedly members of the Westside Crew, a ruling panel that runs the crime family in the absence of imprisoned Genovese boss Vincent (Chin) Gigante.\\" Federal Bureau of Investigation Acting Assistant Director John Klochan said at the time: \\"Our hope is that the indictment will serve as their retirement papers.\\" On October 18, 2005, Barbato entered a guilty plea, admitting to his participation in an organized crime family and two acts of extortion conspiracy. Although he admitted to membership in a crime family, he did not name the Genovese family or acknowledge being a capo. Observers of organized crime noted that there was little precedent for this type of admission, as it was contrary to the \\"rules\\" that Mafia members had formerly lived by. ==Release from prison== John Barbato was released from prison at age 74 on July 3, 2008. ==Further reading== *United States.

The highest ancient Mayan social class included a single centralized leader known as the king or Kʼuhul ajaw, who was most often a man but occasionally a woman. The king's power derived from religion and control over resources, and this power was reinforced by other elites, including merchants. This faction of ancient Mayan social classes arose when some individuals gained greater access to resources than others, increased internal and external trade, and specialized within the manufacturing and selling of goods. This influx of wealth for subsections of the ancient Mayan population further subdivided the upper and lower classes, and wealth became a source of power for the elites. == Theological Evidence == Classic Mayan material culture may provide possible indicators of social stratification within Classic Mayan society. Aspects of housing structure remains, such as the type of building material used during construction and the absence or presence of decoration on the outside on the structure, may indicate the occupant's social standing. For example, the remains of a highly decorated stone structure suggest the occupants had a higher social status than the occupants of a non-decorated thatch structure. Furthermore, smaller aspects of material culture such as pottery found within structural remains provide insight into social status. A greater variety of pottery associated with ritualistic feasting is more commonly found in superstructures, which may suggest elites had better access to protein sources than non-elites. Imported pottery fragments are more commonly found in superstructures than in typical housing structures, suggesting that the Classic Mayan elite had greater access to imported products than commoners. Burial placement and type also held great importance in Classic Mayan society. As deceased individuals were often buried under or near their homes, house construction further indicates social status. Additionally, other burial details, such as the type of burial and associated burial goods provide information about status. Wright and Vásquez (2017) initially classify Classic Mayan burials into commoner and elite burials, which may be further subdivided into simple graves and simple crypts for commoners, and elaborate crypts and underground chambers for members of the elite. The presence and type of artifacts uncovered within the burial, which are referred to as grave goods, may also indicate social status and other things. == Skeletal Evidence == Physical remains of Mayan individuals from the Classic period may also include indicators of social standing. Nutritional diseases during life are recorded in an individual's bones, and their presence and severity differs based on access to resources, which is also related to social standing. Such nutritional diseases include dental caries or cavities in an individual's teeth. Cavities form when bacteria in the mouth metabolize sugars from carbohydrates and demineralize the enamel of a tooth. An individual with an easily accessible carbohydrate-rich diet will be more likely to have more cavities. Using burial location as a proxy for social status, Cucina and Tiesler (2003) found that cavities were more common in elite Classic Mayan individuals than non-elite individuals. They also found that there were more cavities in elite females than elite males, suggesting there may have been an additional barrier to resource access based on sex, although this difference may also highlight the role of estrogen in cavity formation. However, Cucina and Tiesler (2003) did not find a meaningful difference in the number of cavities found in non-elite males and females, providing counter evidence to this argument. Due to the more complete preservation of elite skeletal remains than non-elite skeletal remains based on burial practices, it can be difficult to represent non-elite individuals who compromised 90% of ancient Mayan society. ==References== (+)(+) Category:Maya society Category:Social classes ","title":"Maya social classes"},{"id":"20546304","text":"The 2008 Recopa Sul-Brasileira was the 2nd staging of this Brazilian football knockout competition.

Custom harvesters usually own their own combines and work for the same farms every harvest season. Custom harvesting relieves farmers from having to invest capital in expensive equipment while at the same time maximizing the machinery's use. The custom harvesting industry has its roots in the mid-twentieth century. Before the invention of the combine harvester, farmers usually owned their own harvesting machinery and worked in tandem with migrant workers, who would bring their own threshing equipment. As combines became more and more widespread, the demand for migrant labor decreased. Custom harvesters, owning their own combines, existed beginning in the 1920s, albeit on a small scale. However, World War II caused a labor and materials shortage, and the custom harvesting industry experienced a great growth. In North America, the area from Texas to Saskatchewan was heavily traversed by custom harvesters. In 1942, there were approximately 500 such operators in this range, but by 1947 that number had grown to 8,000 in Kansas alone. Over the years, the industry transformed from one being run solely by men into family-run businesses. Harvesters would pass their routes and clients down to their children, thus turning custom combining into family tradition. Custom combiners charge for their services in several ways: a flat per-unit of land price, a per-bale price, or a percentage of the crop. One of the biggest problems for farmers who hire custom harvesters is the availability of labor and the timing of the harvest. If the harvester cannot be available right when the crops are ready, there is the risk of low harvest (if too early) or spoilage (if too late). The number of custom harvesters has dropped in modern times due to a number of reasons. For one, the consolidation of farms into large-scale operations has allowed them to operate on economies of scale such that they do not need to rely on contractors. Competition is another reason. In China, custom harvesting became such a popular profession in the late 20th century that too many people entered the industry and prices became too low to generate a profit. == See also == *The Great American Wheat Harvest (2014) produced and directed by Conrad Weaver (ConjoStudios). *Wild Harvest, a 1947 film starring Alan Ladd, Robert Preston and Dorothy Lamour depicting the lives of custom harvesters. * Amber Wave (TVM) (1980), starring Kurt Russell and Dennis Weaver *Race Against the Harvest (1987), starring Wayne Rogers, Mariclare Costello, Fredric Lehne, Matt McCoy. *The 2000 Mile Harvest, produced and directed by Dylan Winter *Custom Cutters, produced and directed by Dylan Winter == References == Category:Agricultural labor ","title":"Custom harvesting"},{"id":"20546364","text":"Vigée is a surname.

This was their first release from their \\"No Fixed Abode\\" recording studio, set up in South London. The band then increased in size with the addition of Charlton Antenbring and Paul Bryant. Antenbring was a fashion student, disc jockey and reporter for The Big Issue.As of 2004, Antenbring was head chef at The Metropolitan in London's Westbourne Park; see \\"Just Opened\\"; www.caterersearch.com. Jim Di Salvo contributed on guitars, cubase programming, sampling and music production. Throup was a classically trained pianist and contributed to cubase programming and music production. Bryant was the vocalist. Bryant and Throup co-wrote most of Secret Life's material. Contemporaneous to the development of Secret Life, Throup was also working with others involved with techno and house music, such as noted techno and house DJ Lenny Dee.Such as \\"Ethno Tek\\" (High Density Recordings, re-release 2000), \\"Drum Computer\\" (High Density Recordings, re- release 2000) and \\"So High\\" (House Without A Home, re-release 2004).

Information from www.discogs.com; accessed 08-12-10. The band toured extensively, particularly in the United Kingdom, and performed on three popular UK TV music shows: The Beat, Dance Energy and The Hitman and Her. They also released several music videos. Di Salvo left the band in 1993 to set up \\"Bass Boom\\" recording studios. Di Salvo then released numerous singles and albums under his own name,Jason Carter and Jim Di Salvo (1995); www.rolldabeats.com. and the alias act names of \\"The Juggler\\", \\"Bong Brothers\\"\\"Bong-a-Long\\" (1998); www.rolldabeats.com. and \\"Salvo Jets\\",The review refers to the album, which includes the Salvo Jets track \\"Toker Smoker\\", as a \\"dubby groove compilation\\". during the 1990s. One of Secret Life's first singles \\"As Always\\", a 1992 dance arrangement of Stevie Wonder's \\"As\\", was one of the most successful records issued by their then label, Cowboy Records, associated with their manager, Charlie Chester.It had previously been issued in a house version by Chicago-based Ricky Dillard, of the Nightwriters. Music of the Nightwriters, particularly that which was released in the late 1980s, is considered to be very important to the development of house music. For example, the Nightwriters' record, \\"Let The Music Use You\\", sung by Dillard, is considered to be \\"the record that defined deep house\\". See Phil Cheeseman, The History of House Music ; www.trugroovez.com. After house producers Masters At Work remixed Secret Life's \\"Borrowed Time\\" (1994), Chester moved the band to Pulse-8 Records, with a view to enhanced pop appeal. He was able to obtain an eight album deal from the label. The group was now a core duo of Bryant and Throup.New Music Express, Biography of Secret Life; www.nme.com. A pop-oriented single, \\"Love So Strong\\", previously issued by Cowboy Records in 1993, was remixed and released by Pulse-8 in 1994. Three other singles were released in 1994, followed by an album, Sole Purpose, in 1995. According to one reviewer, \\"Production from Brothers in Rhythm, Chris Porter and Pete Gleadall give Sole Purpose an R&B; and house feel, and the album is topped off with...thoughtful lyrics and smooth vocals.\\" From 1992 to 1996, the group released eight singles and one album.A second album was apparently recorded, but not released, due to the bankruptcy of Pulse-8 Records. Two singles from that project, \\"Love Love Love\\" and \\"Vehicle\\", were released in 1996, prior to Pulse-8's bankruptcy. Another song from this project, \\"Self Delusion\\", was included in a later compilation, F.E.A. Version.Dosmilcuatro; www.musicbrainz.org.

D. Blackmore, who later achieved lasting fame for another romantic novel, Lorna Doone. Clara Vaughan, his first novel, was written in 1853 and published anonymously in 1864.\\"Blackmore\\" entry in Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia Of Literature (1995), Merriam-Webster. It was generally well received by the public, though some reviewers at the time believed ascribed it to Mary Elizabeth Braddon. Others criticised the author for not knowing about the law. ==Plot introduction== Clara Vaughan, which takes place in the mid-19th century, is the story of the eponymous heroine, an only child whose father is mysteriously murdered when she is a young girl. As a young woman, she sets out to uncover the identity of her father's killer, and for this reason the novel is often classed among the first detective novels in English. In addition to this overarching theme, there are several sub-plots involving family secrets, romances, and questions of familial inheritance. ==Publication history== The novel was first published in 1864. It was still in print in various editions into the early 20th century and remains in print to this day.Current editions. ===1872 revision=== Blackmore chose to fully revise the novel for a new edition in 1872.

In 2005, Antico was indicted on federal racketeering charges and racketeering conspiracy, which included murder conspiracy, extortion, loansharking and witness tampering. Law enforcement identified Antico as a captain in the Genovese family, operating criminal activities in Brooklyn and Manhattan, as well as associating with then acting boss Dominick \\"Quiet Dom\\" Cirillo and captains Lawrence \\"Little Larry\\" Dentico and John \\"Johnny Sausage\\" Barbato,http://www.thelaborers.net/indictments/cirillo_indictment_finalnew.htm the indictment claimed that Antico was included in a panel since the late 1990s of powerful Genovese family capos who decided to corrupt labor and construction unions in New York and New Jersey through bribing and extorting their locals in order to achieve influence with companies operating in those areas. Antico, Cirillo and Barbato were charged with murder conspiracy, as they reputedly plotted to murder an important prosecution witness.http://www.thelaborers.net/indictments/cirillo_doj_pr.htm On October 19, 2005, Antico pleaded guilty to lesser extortion charges. On March 4, 2006, Antico was sentenced to 30 months in prison.http://www.1010wins.com/pages/70525.php?contentType=4&contentId;=190251 He was released from prison on June 22, 2007. On July 29, 2010, Antico was convicted of racketeering for running a mob social club on Staten Island and conspiracy to extort money from a race track winner. However, he was acquitted of extorting a bagel shop and ordering the robbery of Staten Island jeweler Louis Antonelli, which resulted in Antonelli's shooting death. Antico was sentenced to nine years in prison, a stiff sentence because the judge ruled that the testimony of government witness Salvatore Maniscalco tying Antico to the heist was credible and should be factored in the sentence. Antico was imprisoned at the Butner Federal Medical Center (FMC) in Butner, North Carolina and was released on June 12 2018. ==Further reading== *United States. Congress. Senate.

He made his Bohemians first team debut as a substitute in their 2–0 win over Cobh Ramblers on 8 November 2008. Prior to the start of the 2009 season, Madden joined Shelbourne on loan on 10 February 2009. Bohemians manager Pat Fenlon sent the young striker out on loan hoping for Madden to gain first team experience. Madden made an immediate impression for Shelbourne by scoring in his first competitive appearance for Shels in their opening First Division match against Wexford Youths at Tolka Park on 6 March 2009. He also scored against his own employers for Shelbourne during an EA Sports Cup 2nd round tie at Dalymount Park on 4 May 2009. Madden's loan spell at Shelbourne concluded on 29 June 2009 and he returned to Bohemians. During his loan spell at Shelbourne, Madden made 16 league and cup appearances and scored 8 goals. On 29 September 2009, Madden scored his first goal for Bohs in a 1–0 victory over Derry City in the Brandywell which led to Bohs returning to the top of the league. In the 2010 season, Madden scored 9 goals in 5 matches, and he was voted the Soccer Writers Association of Ireland Player of the Month for June. Madden signed for English League One side Carlisle United on 31 January 2011, for an undisclosed fee signing a two-and-a-half-year contract with the Cumbrian club. On 4 October 2012, Madden joined League One club Yeovil Town on an initial one-month loan deal with a view to extend to gain some much needed pitch time after not featuring in Carlisle's starting league squad this season. He had scored 1 goal in 3 substitute appearances for the Cumbrians this campaign. On 6 October 2012, he made his debut for Yeovil and scored a two goals in a 3–1 home victory against Colchester United.

Following the game it was announced Madden had signed permanently for Yeovil Town for an undisclosed fee on a two-and-a-half-year deal. Madden then went on to score 4 goals in his first two games as a permanent Yeovil Town player in the month of January. By mid February he was already League One top scorer, with 18 goals, despite only starting playing in October. In an interview with the BBC after this run of form he was described by his manager Gary Johnson as \\"the bargain of the season\\". Madden's contribution of 6 goals to Yeovil's perfect January of 3 out of 3 wins didn't go unrecognised as he won the League One Player of the Month award. Madden scored in the 2013 League One play-off Final as Yeovil beat Brentford 2–1 to earn promotion to the Championship for the first time in the club's history. Madden ended the season with the League One golden boot with 23 goals (1 for Carlisle), plus his 2013 League One play-off Final goal to make it 24 in all competitions.

Madden suffered a significant downturn of form during Scunthorpe's play-off push in the 2016–17 season, despite featuring in the majority of the Iron's games. This downturn in form continued into the next season, with Madden scoring only 2 league goals during the very early stages of the 2017–18 season. Madden failed to score in any of his last 16 league appearances for the Iron.

During one period around 1500 the Rinpungpa lords came close to assemble the Tibetan lands around the Yarlung Tsangpo River under one authority, but their powers receded after 1512. ==Rise to power== The Rinpungpa belonged to the Ger () clan, which is traced back to the days of the Tibetan Empire. One of their line, Namkha Gyaltsen, served as nanglon (minister of internal affairs) under the Phagmodrupa ruler Jamyang Shakya Gyaltsen, who held power over Ü-Tsang. He was appointed dzongpon (governor) of the fief Rinpung in Rong, a region in Tsang in an unknown year before 1373. His political position was strengthened by the marriage with the Phagmodrupa princess Sönam Palmö. Their daughter in turn was given in marriage to Sangye Gyaltsen, a Phagmodrupa prince, and gave birth to the later ruler Drakpa Jungne (r. 1432-1445).Olaf Czaja (2013), Medieval rule in Tibet. Wien: ÖAW, pp. 481-2. The son of Namkha Gyaltsen was Namkha Gyalpo who took over the Rinpung estate at the age of 14 and held a number of ministerial positions. He was succeeded in 1413 by his young son Norzang, a strong personality who expanded the fortunes of the family on a Tibet-wide level. He increased his control over territories in Shang, Tag, Ling and Kyur and was the patron of the Jamchen Monastery, founded in 1427. He also founded the Kyemotsal Monastery in Dzongkar in 1437.Olaf Czaja (2013), pp. 483-4. The Rinpungpa took advantage of a family feud within the Phagmodrupa Dynasty in 1434. With the united troops from Rong and Shang, Norzang seized the important place Samdrubtse, modern Shigatse, from the governor of the Chonggye family. This is traditionally said to have taken place in 1435, though the more likely date is 1446.Olaf Czaja (2013), p. 233. Samdrubtse was a very strategic spot and the key to power over Tsang. In the following years Norzang expanded his influence over Tsang, Rong and Shang. His kinsman, the Phagmodrupa king Kunga Lekpa (r. 1448-1481) was born from a Rinpung princess and in turn married a Rinpungpa daughter. He was not able to stop the advances of his powerful vassal. Norzang himself married Kunga Lekpa's sister, further emphasizing the elaborated net of kinship ties between the two families. While still acknowledging the Phagmodrupa, the Rinpungpa subsequently built up a strong position, bearing the title desi (regent). ==Confrontation and invasion== The increasing importance of the Buddhist sects in this period made it crucial for secular rulers to seek support from religious networks. In Tibetan historiography the members of the family are famous as the patrons of the Karma Kagyu school of Buddhism, which was sometimes opposed to the Gelugpa. However, the early Rinpungpa lords supported other sects such as Sakya and its important philosopher Gorampa. After the death of Norzang in 1466 the fortunes of the Rinpungpa took a downturn for a while under his obscure son Kunzang. This person died in the 1470s and was succeeded by Donyo Dorje, the most powerful figure of the line. While pursuing an aggressive and warlike policy to achieve domination over Central Tibet, he also stood out as a religious patron. Thus he sponsored the foundation of the Yangpachen Monastery for the Shamarpa hierarch of the Karma Kagyu sect. This included comprehensive economic dispositions; 2,800 nomadic households were donated to the Shamarpa for providing butter-lamp offerings, and all the monks of Yangpachen were granted a daily measure of barley.Olaf Czaja (2013), p. 487. His policy towards the Phagmodrupa was one of confrontation. The king Kunga Lekpa lived in a conflict-ridden marriage with the Rinpung princess, which added to the rift. Her kinsman Donyo Dorje eventually invaded the central domain of the king in 1480. In the following year a conference was convened in the Phagmodrupa capital Nêdong where the Rinpung princes participated. In the end Kunga Lekpa was forced to abdicate in favour of a nephew, a relative non-entity. ==Height of political authority== The agreement did not put an end to the endemic political turbulence in Central Tibet. The Rinpungpa proceeded to defeat various regional lords and increase their power. In 1485 they attacked the important estate Gyangtse and captured the lord of Yung. New turbulence arose in 1489 and again allowed the Rinpungpa to keep the upper hand. Two years later Donyo Dorje's uncle Tsokye Dorje took power as regent in the Phagmodrupa seat Nêdong (1491–1499) during the minority of the heir Ngawang Tashi Drakpa. The years around 1500 saw the high tide of Rinpungpa power, and the authority of Donyo Dorje was almost absolute, being supported by the Karmapa and Shamarpa hierarchs. There was also a political expansion to the west. In 1499 the important kingdom of Guge in Ngari (West Tibet) had to acknowledge the Rinpungpa.R. Vitali (1996), The kingdoms of Gu.ge Pu.hrang. Dharamsala: Tho.ling gtsug.lag, p. 536. ==Setbacks in the east== Due to pressure from the Rinpungpa, who favoured the Karma Kagyu, the Gelugpa school were forbidden to participate in the new year celebration and the great Monlam ceremony in Lhasa between 1498 and 1517.H. Hoffman (1986), Tibet. A Handbook. Bloomington, p. 56. After the deaths of the powerful princes Tsokye Dorje (1510) and Donyo Dorje (1512), however, the power of the Rinpungpa declined. In spite of Rinpungpa patronage the hierarchs of the Karma Kagyu, Karmapa and Shamarpa, were adverse to being closely controlled by the secular lords. They therefore strove to once again stabilize the long-effaced Phagmodrupa rule. In the early sixteenth century Ngawang Tashi Drakpa of the Phagmodrupa managed to regain a degree of influence, pushing out the new Rinpung lords Zilnonpa and Ngawang Namgyal from Lhasa. He was friendly disposed to the Gelugpa leader Gedun Gyatso (posthumously counted as the second Dalai Lama), which at this stage did not exclude heartily relations with the Karma Kagyu.Olaf Czaja (2013), p. 255. The direct power of Rinpungpa in Ü (East Central Tibet) was henceforth limited. ==External threats and fall from power== An agreement between the factions of Ü and Tsang was reached in 1518. The nominal head of the Rinpungpa, the boy Zilnonpa, asked the king for investiture as dzongpon, and such was given. In fact, however, the Rinpungpa continued to wield power over Tsang on their own accord. The following decades were marked by a confusing succession of clashes and temporary reconciliations between the factions of Central Tibet. In 1532 the Rinpungpa domains were briefly threatened by an invasion by the Muslim general Mirza Muhammad Haidar Dughlat, operating on the orders of Sultan Said Khan, the ruler of Kashgar.L. Deshayes (1997), Histoire du Tibet. Fayard, p. 137. The waning of Rinpungpa power was marked by an abortive invasion of the Mangyül Gungthang kingdom in West Tibet in 1555, which was badly defeated.K.H. Everding (2000), Das Königreich Mangyul Gungthang, Vol. I. Bonn: GmbH, p. 577. In 1557 one of the retainers of the Rinpungpa, Karma Tseten, who was governor of Shigatse since 1548, rebelled against his lord. In 1565, finally, the learned and cultivated Rinpungpa ruler Ngawang Jigme Drakpa was defeated by Karma Tseten though a surprise attack. In that way Karma Tseten founded the new Tsangpa Dynasty which would rule large parts of Central Tibet up to 1642. The Rinpungpa survived in their heartland Rong and periodically tried to revive their fortune. They staged an abortive attack on Kyishö in Ü in 1575 and quarreled with the Tsangpa ruler in the next few years. After the Tsang-Rong war of 1589 their power was exhausted, and they were forced to capitulate in 1590.James Gentry (2013), Substance and sense: Objects of power in the life, writings, and legacy of the Tibetan ritual master Sog bzlog pa Blo gros rgyal mtshan, PhD Thesis, Harvard University, p. 181. Local Rinpungpa princes are known up to the early 17th century.Olaf Czaja (2013), pp. 492-3. ==Legacy== The significance of the Rinpungpa is difficult to assess due to the terseness of the written sources. They upheld political hegemony in Tsang for 120–130 years, but little is known in detail of administrative and economic issues. Their relationship with the Chinese Ming Dynasty seems to have been indirect at best.According to Wang Furen & Suo Wenqing (1984), Highlights of Tibetan history. Beijing: New World Press, p. 73, Namkha Gyaltsen was officially established as regional lord by the Ming Dynasty in 1416. Judging from Tibetan data this is incorrect, since Namkha Gyaltsen was long dead at the time; see Olaf Czaja (2013), p. 483. The most detailed account, The New Red Annals (1538), was written by Panchen Sonam Dragpa who extolled the achievements of the Phagmodrupa kings at the expense of the Rinpung lords, who were depicted as a destabilizing, power-hungry force.Olaf Czaja (2013), p. 253. One may note, however, that their grab of power only began after the Phagmodrupa regime had started to decline due to internal squabbles. The chronicle of the Fifth Dalai Lama, The Song of the Spring Queen (1643), gives a more balanced picture: although sometimes characterized as devious and beset by \\"fierce pride\\", the rulers had great cultural and religious interests. They funded new monasteries, commissioned precious artwork such as gilded Buddhas and thangkas, and at least one of them, Ngawang Jigme Drakpa (d. 1597), was a gifted author whose works are still read.Ngag-dBang Blo-bZang rGya-mTSHo (1995), A history of Tibet. Bloomington: Indiana University, pp. 161-5. The family eventually fell from power for the same reasons as the Phagmodrupa: they had to uphold a fragile balance among autonomous local lords which broke down when a number of dissatisfied elements sided with the new Tsangpa polity. ==List of rulers== *Norzang 1435–1466 *Kunzang 1466–c. 1479 (son) *Donyo Dorje c. 1479–1512 (son) *Ngawang Namgyal 1512–1544 (son of Tsokye Dorje, a son of Norzang) *Dondup Tseten Dorje 1544–?

Each case begins with a headline announcing that one character has been murdered; the player's goal is to choose the killer from the remaining four. The player can gain information by making shots to interrogate one suspect at a time or collect evidence, then make an indicated shot (usually the phone) to choose the killer. An incorrect choice awards points for eliminating an innocent suspect, while a correct choice sends the player to the roof in an attempt to apprehend the killer and close the case (see \\"The Roof\\" below). A suspect being interrogated will always mention the killer by name unless he/she actually is the killer. == Mystery Slots == Three slot machine reels displaying various items and rewards are set into the center of the playfield. Whenever a flashing \\"SPIN\\" shot is made (phone, roulette lane, sewer) or a lit outlane is hit, these reels spin and come to a stop, with the result of the spin shown on the display as well. The player scores points and/or receives items based on the following combinations: * Unmatched images on all three reels, or a Wild on the left or right plus two unmatched images = 5 million points * Two of one image and an unmatched third, with no Wild showing = Second chance (hit any lit \\"SPIN\\" shot within a time limit to complete the trio and collect the reward) * Single or pair of one image, plus Wild images on all other reels = Same reward as three images together * Two unmatched images on the sides, Wild Choice in the middle = Choice between the two items on either side * Three fingerprints = Clue (Bullet, Broken Mirror, etc.) - 10 million points * Three \\"JACKPOT\\" images = Jackpot (starts at 75 million points; increased by hitting jet bumpers during Basement Multiball) * Three magnifying glasses = Piece of equipment (Revolver, Magnifying Glass, etc.) – 25 million points * Three BAR images = 100 million points * Three MULTIBALL images = Start Basement Multiball * Three EXTRA BALL images = Extra Ball * Three question marks = Elevator Madness (instant two-ball multiball) * Three Wild images = The Roof Shooting the left orbit when it is not lit for a Taxi Chase diverts the ball into the jet bumpers, each of which corresponds to a different reel. Hits to the bumpers nudge the reels; once two or more reels match, the bumpers no longer affect them. After the ball falls into the sinkhole underneath the bumpers, the player receives points or items for the three displayed symbols as listed above. If the player earns a second chance from a spin triggered by draining the ball down a lit outlane, another ball is automatically put into play. ==Roulette== Shooting the far right lane raises/lowers the roulette bet with every turn of the spinner, and the color for the bet is changed between red and black by hitting two stand-up targets. When the lane is lit and the player shoots the ball into a saucer at its end, the game offers the option to bet or pass. If the player takes the bet, a simulated roulette wheel is spun; the bet is added to the player's score if it stops on the last color hit, or deducted if it does not. The bonus multiplier is increased whether the player wins, loses, or passes. ==Elevator== The player can shoot any of the three short center ramps to ride an elevator up or down within Tony's Palace or exit at the current floor. Awards for the individual floors are as follows. * Basement: Start Basement Multiball (see below). * Main floor: Light Roulette and Mystery Slots. * 2nd floor: Collect a clue. * 3rd floor: Choice between collecting evidence (worth 25 million points) or identifying the killer. * 4th floor: Mystery Slots spin. * 5th floor: Same as 3rd. * 6th floor: Collect a piece of equipment. * 7th floor: Elevator Madness. * 8th floor: Choice between interrogating a suspect or identifying the killer. * Penthouse: Penthouse Party. Can only be accessed if the player has previously hit the Penthouse Key stand-up. * Roof: Start the Roof phase (see below). Can only be accessed after all other floors have been visited. After a floor is visited, a bank of three stand-up targets rises to block the ramps; all three must be hit to lower them and access the elevator again. Shots to the UP or DOWN ramps skip any previously visited floors. Once every floor has been visited, all of them become available. ==Basement Multiball== This mode can be started in three different ways: * Shoot three balls into the lock just below the T-A-X-I targets * Exit the elevator at the basement * Win it on the slots Three balls are put into play, and the sewer, roulette lane, and Mystery target all award jackpots when hit. A jackpot is also awarded once all three elevator ramps (Up, Down, Exit) have been shot; the three stand-ups then rise to block the ramps and must all be hit to lower them. The jackpot starts at 75 million and increases by 1 million for each jet bumper hit during this multiball, or 5 million per hit if the player has the Revolver. It carries over from one multiball to the next, and stops rising after the first jet bumper hit that brings it to 500 million or higher. ==The Roof== This phase of the game involves the player's attempt to catch the killer. It can be started in any of the following ways: * Choosing the correct suspect after shooting the phone or stopping at the 3rd/5th/8th floor * Spinning three WILD cards on the Slots * Visiting all other floors in Tony's Palace, then exiting the elevator at the Roof The player must first shoot the lit Taxi Chase loop within a limited time, starting a hurry-up countdown, then shoot the phone before it times out. Doing so scores the points, closes the case, and starts a four-ball multiball with all major shots lit to collect the hurry-up value. If the player fails to shoot the phone before the countdown times out, another Taxi Chase must be hit to restart it. Once the player either loses the ball or runs out of time during the Taxi Chase phase, or drains all but one ball during the multiball, a new case begins with all clues unlit. == Digital versions == Digital version of this table is no longer available in The Pinball Arcade for any platform.

It was founded in 1958 as a German Eingetragener Verein, and has been converted in 2016 into a Public Body based on the 1991 Anholt treaty. Participating communities are in Niedersachsen (Osnabrück, Landkreis Osnabrück, southern part of Landkreis Emsland, Bentheim) and Nordrhein- Westfalen (Münsterland) in Germany and parts of the Dutch provinces Gelderland, Overijssel and Drenthe. Participating cities in the region are Münster, Osnabrück, Enschede, and Hengelo. ==HistoryEarly beginnings and consolidation=== The origins of the EUREGIO date back to 1958 when municipal associations on both sides of the border organised the first cross-border conference. An association on the German side, the ‘Interessensgemeinschaft Rhein-Ems’ had been founded as an intermunicipal interest association in 1954 by representatives of local business and local authority politicians of the Westmünsterland and the Grafschaft Bentheim and Lingen Kreise. Among its objectives were the improvement of the local and regional infrastructures, which, in the eyes of the local elites, deserved more attention on the part of the Land and federal governments. On the Dutch side, this was followed by the establishment of an inter-municipal association. In 1962, the more informal Interessensgemeinschaft was replaced by the ‘Kommunalgemeinschaft Weser-Ems’, a public law intermunicipal body. A similar process of intermunicipal integration occurred in the adjoining Dutch border area where the municipalities in the areas of Twente and Gelderland founded the Belangengemeenschap Twente-Gelderland (later Samenwerkingsverband Twente, today Regio Twente) with the explicit objective of co-operating more closely with the Interessensgemeinschaft Rhein-Ems (later Kommunalgemeinschaft Rhein- Ems). Subsequently, a second association, the Samenwerkingsverband Oost- Gelderland (today Regio Achterhoek), was established in the Dutch border area. Today, the Kommunalgemeinschaft Rhein-Ems, the Regio Twente and the Regio Achterhoek together form the EUREGIO. The EUREGIO Arbeitsgruppe (‘work group’) was founded in 1966 to operate as the informal board of the cross-border region. On the basis of regular meetings, it attempted to shift the EUREGIO’s work from purely project-based contacts towards a programmatic collaboration. An important event was the establishment of the Alfred-Mozer-Kommission in 1970, responsible for cross-border initiatives in the cultural field. At the same time, a secretariat was established comprising two units on each side of the border and funded by membership fees. Two studies, in the fields of culture and economic affairs respectively, gave the secretariats a programmatic basis for the further development of the EUREGIO. In the mid- seventies, the Arbeitsgruppe was given a formal basis by means of a statute (Satzung), and a common action programme was developed. This institutionalisation process ended with the Euregio-Rat in 1978, the first cross-border regional parliamentary assembly in Europe constituted by the political delegates of the member authorities. In 1985, the separate secretariats were merged into a single Geschäftsstelle, located in Gronau (DE), situated 75m from the border, employing both Dutch and German staff. On the programmatic side, a ‘regional cross-border action programme’ was presented in 1987, outlining the general strategy for the EUREGIO for a twenty-year period (NEI nd). The elaboration of the programme was based on an agreement in 1984 between the German Federal ministry of economics, the Dutch ministry of economics and the Länder NRW and Lower Saxony (Niedersachsen). Funding was also provided by the European Commission. A steering committee was established, involving the partners in this agreement as well as the provinces, Bezirksregierungen and the EUREGIO. The action programme contained an economic and social analysis of the programme areas, and listed a series of measures aimed at promoting their socio-economic development. This action programme constituted the main input for the first OP for the period 1989-1992, funded as pilot project under art. 10 ERDF. When the European Commission launched Interreg I in 1990, the EUREGIO reacted with the speedy elaboration of a second OP based on its accumulated experience. ===The EUREGIO and Interreg=== Long before Interreg was launched, the EUREGIO had been canvassing by the European Commission for CBC support. As early as 1972, the European Commission, together with national sponsors, helped to finance the elaboration of a first cross-border development plan for the EUREGIO. A similar solution was found for the 1987 action programme before the EUREGIO succeeded in attracting a substantial amount of European funding under art. 10 ERDF for a series of pilot projects at the end of the eighties. However, the ‘big bang’ for the EUREGIO was the launch of the Interreg I CI in 1989 involving a major push in the EU’s funding for cross-border projects. The introduction of Interreg meant that the operations were expanded significantly as it was granted the programme management for the Interreg OP. The relevant procedural details were agreed between the partners in the so-called ‘Interreg-Vereinbarung’. This gave the EUREGIO responsibility for the general programme and financial management, including the elaboration of the OP; the collection, evaluation and preliminary approval/rejection of project applications and their submission to the SC; and the co-ordination of the match-funds. The EUREGIO was thus granted an important role in the administrative procedures for Interreg-supported projects. All project proposals are collected by the secretariat where a first preselection is made based on the basis of the EUREGIO’s own criteria, the general Interreg requirements and the prevailing legislation for the territories of the member authorities. The strict EUREGIO criteria require all projects to have a genuine cross-border character in substantial, organisational, personal and financial respects. As the relevant agreement states, projects must relate to a ‘Euregional interest’, linked to a structural and socio-economic significance for the region (EUREGIO and Rhein-Ems 1996: 29). The approved proposals are submitted to the Steering Committee which is the highest instance in Interreg decision-making. As with the other Euroregions on the Dutch-German border, for the EUREGIO a separate SC has been established. Apart from the EUREGIO representatives, the Committee is composed of senior civil servants representing the following authorities: the Dutch ministry for Economics, and the provinces Drenthe, Overijssel and Gelderland on the Dutch side, and the Ministries of Economics of the German Länder NRW and Lower Saxony as well as the Bezirksregierungen Münster and Weser-Ems on the German side. The EUREGIO proposes the president of the SC and runs its secretariat. The SC is responsible for final project approval and requires unanimous decision-making whereby each of the authorities mentioned has one vote. It also serves as the Monitoring Committee under EU regulations, involving the Commission and the German federal Ministry of Economics as additional members. The Interreg agreements significantly simplify the financial management. For the three Euroregions on its territory, the NRW Land administration has accepted the full and sole responsibility vis-à-vis the European Commission for the lawful implementation of the Interreg OP on behalf of the Dutch central state and Lower Saxony. At the same time, a bank, the Investitionsbank Nordrhein-Westfalen (IB), manages the non-local EUREGIO Interreg funds. All EU and national match-funds, the Dutch contributions included, are paid into a single account. This simplifies the Interreg-related procedures by allowing the Interreg subsidies to be paid to the project leaders in a single assignment. The IB concludes private law contracts with the project leaders specifying the details realising the projects, replacing up to eight public law assignments from up to eight different authorities. The IB also audits the funds on behalf of all other interested parties. To simplify the programme implementation within its own administrative realm, the NRW has established a single Interreg-budget comprehending all match-funds from different ministries. Due to these streamlined procedures, projects are in general approved within three to six months (Deloitte & Touche 1998: 22). As for the substantive content for the Interreg measures, the Interreg agreements define six policy fields as the general framework for the OPs to be submitted for each Euroregion in the areas. Within this general framework, the Euroregions autonomously determine the priorities within their own OPs. == See also == *Ems Dollart Region *Meuse-Rhine Euroregion *List of euroregions ==External links== *Official website Category:Euroregions Category:Lower Saxony Category:Gelderland Category:Overijssel Category:Drenthe Category:Geography of North Rhine-Westphalia ","title":"EUREGIO"},{"id":"20546825","text":"Alexander Vladimirovich Mazin () is a Ukrainian-born Russian writer, poet, and songwriter, specializing in the genres of science fiction, fantasy, and alternate history.

U.S. Senator Harry S. Truman from Missouri was nominated to be President Franklin D. Roosevelt's running-mate in his bid to be re-elected for a fourth term. How the nomination went to Harry S. Truman, who did not actively seek it, is, in the words of his biographer Robert H. Ferrell, \\"one of the great political stories of our century\\".Ferrell, Choosing Truman, preface, page x. The fundamental issue was that Roosevelt's health was seriously declining, and everyone who saw Roosevelt, including the leaders of the Democratic Party, realized it. If he died during his next term, the Vice President would become President, making the vice presidential nomination very important. Truman's predecessor as Vice President, the incumbent Henry A. Wallace, was unpopular with some of the leaders of the Democratic Party, who disliked his liberal politics and considered him unreliable and eccentric in general. Wallace was, however, the popular candidate, and favored by the Convention delegates. As the Convention began, Wallace had more than half the votes necessary to secure his re-nomination. By contrast, the Gallup poll said that 2% of those surveyed wanted then-Senator Truman to become the Vice President. To overcome this initial deficit, the leaders of the Democratic Party worked to influence the Convention delegates, such that Truman received the nomination.Ferrell, Harry S. Truman: a Life, page 163. ==Anti-Wallace movement== A powerful group of party leaders tried to persuade Roosevelt to not keep Wallace as Vice President. Ferrell calls this process \\"a veritable conspiracy.\\" The group consisted of Edwin W. Pauley, treasurer of the Democratic National Committee (DNC); Robert E. Hannegan, Democratic national chairman; Frank C. Walker, Postmaster General; George E. Allen, the Democratic party secretary; and Edward J. Flynn, political boss of New York. They considered several people to replace Wallace. Among the possible candidates were James F. Byrnes, Roosevelt's \\"assisting president,\\" who initially was the prominent alternative, Associate Justice William O. Douglas, U.S. Senators Alben W. Barkley and Harry S. Truman as well as the industrialist Henry J. Kaiser and Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn.Ferrell, Choosing Truman, pages 4-6. Finally the group decided on Truman, but this decision was secondary to the goal of not nominating Wallace.Ferrell, Harry S. Truman: a life, page 164. By late spring 1944, the group had succeeded in turning Roosevelt against Wallace, but the president did not tell Wallace directly and still refused to endorse anybody other than him. In May the president sent Wallace on a trip to China and the Soviet Union, probably with the intention to get him out of the country at an inconvenient time and to obstruct his campaign.Ferrell, Harry S. Truman: a Life, page 164. Roosevelt preferred Byrnes as the best alternative and decided to push him as the party's nominee for the vice presidency if the party delegates refused to renominate Wallace at the 1944 Democratic National Convention. On July 11, the leaders met with Roosevelt in the White House. They recommended Truman. The names of Sam Rayburn, Alben Barkley, James F. Byrnes, and John G. Winant were also raised, but they were dismissed, Byrnes because of his unpopularity among blacks and in the labor movement.Ferrell, Choosing Truman, pages 12-13. Furthermore, Byrnes, who had been born a Roman Catholic, had left the church to become an Episcopalian, which would have alienated many Catholic voters who were a central part of the New Deal coalition. Truman was an ideal compromise candidate. He supported the administration on most issues, was acceptable to the unions, and he had opposed Roosevelt's reelection to a third term, which pleased conservative anti-Roosevelt Democrats. He had supported Roosevelt's foreign policy but was close to Senate isolationists like Burton K. Wheeler. Roosevelt did not know Truman well, but he knew of the senator's leadership of the Truman Committee, and that he was a loyal supporter of the New Deal. Roosevelt suggested William O. Douglas but party officials countered by suggesting Truman. After much debate, the president said, \\"Bob [Hannegan], I think you and everyone else here want Truman.\\" There are, however, other accounts of Roosevelt's exact statement. Pauley, for example, claimed that he said, \\"If that's the case, it's Truman.\\"Ferrell, Choosing Truman, page 14. Just before the meeting ended, Roosevelt instructed Hannegan and Walker to notify Wallace and Byrnes, respectively, that they were out.Ferrell, Harry S. Truman: a Life, page 165. After the group left the meeting, Hannegan asked Roosevelt to put his decision down in writing. Roosevelt wrote a note on a piece of scratch paper and gave it to Hannegan. The next day Hannegan and Walker thus tried to convince Wallace and Byrnes to withdraw, but they refused unless the president himself asked them. Roosevelt did not want to disappoint any candidate.\\"Harry S. Truman, 34th Vice President (1945)\\", U.S. Senate. He told Wallace, \\"I hope it will be the same old team.\\" But Wallace nevertheless understood the president's real intentions, and he wrote in his diary, \\"He wanted to ditch me as noiselessly as possible.\\" Roosevelt also promised to write a letter, saying that if he, Roosevelt, were a delegate to the convention he would vote for Wallace. To Byrnes Roosevelt said, \\"You are the best qualified man in the whole outfit and you must not get out of the race. If you stay in the race you are certain to win.\\" He also explained to Byrnes that he was having trouble with Wallace, who refused to withdraw unless the president told him so, and that he would write Wallace a lukewarm letter.Ferrell, Choosing Truman, pages 25, 28-29. ==Maneuvering== On July 15, Roosevelt was en route to San Diego. He stopped in Chicago, where the Democratic national convention was to be held. Hannegan and Edward J. Kelly, mayor of Chicago, met Roosevelt on board the train. They obtained a typewritten version of the note from July 11: Grace Tully, the president's private secretary, asserted in her memoirs that the letter as originally written put Douglas's name first, but Hannegan asked her to juxtapose the names so it would appear as if Roosevelt preferred Truman. Hannegan, however, has denied this.McCullough, pages 306-307; \\"William O. Douglas 'Political Ambitions' and the 1944 Vice-Presidential Nomination: A Reinterpretation.\\" Truman biographer Conrad Black wrote that Tully did switch the positions of the names, but it was probably at Roosevelt's wish.Conrad Black, Franklin Delano Roosevelt: Champion of Freedom (2003), , page 971. Truman later claimed that Hannegan had shown him a letter from Roosevelt that did not mention Douglas's name, saying \\"Bob, it's Truman. FDR.\\" This letter has never been found.Ferrell, Choosing Truman, pages 82-83, 120n. Years later Hannegan's son William P. Hannegan visited the Truman library in Independence. The retired president asked if William's mother had the letter. He wanted them to look for it. (Ibid). A photograph of FDR's original letter appears in a biography of Douglas.Murphy, Bruce Allen. Wild Bill: The Legend and Life of William O. Douglas. New York: Random House, 2003. . pg. 9 of photographs between pages 366 and 367 Hannegan also tried to get Roosevelt to tone down the Wallace letter. The situation became even more complicated because Roosevelt said pleasant things about Byrnes, so Hannegan believed the president had changed his mind and wanted Byrnes. However, Roosevelt also said that Hannegan must clear Byrnes' nomination with labor leader Sidney Hillman, whom he knew opposed Byrnes.Ferrell, Choosing Truman, pages 36-; Ferrell, Harry S. Truman: a Life, pages 166-167; Arnold A. Offner, Another Such Victory: President Truman and the Cold War, 1945-1953,page 15. The line \\"Clear it with Sidney\\" was subsequently used by Thomas Dewey and the Republicans in their campaign.Tom Robbins, \\"SIDNEY HILLMAN CONSTRUCTIVE COOPERATION\\", Daily News, May 4, 1999; \\"End of Strife\\", Time, 22 July 1946; Marc Karson, \\"Labor Will Rule: Sidney Hillman and the Rise of American Labor.\\" - book reviews, The Progressive, June 1994. On July 17, the chairman of the convention, Samuel D. Jackson, released Roosevelt's Wallace letter. Roosevelt said, somewhat ambiguously, that he, if a delegate, would vote for Wallace, but that he did not want to dictate to the convention. Because it was a lukewarm endorsement, the letter became known as the \\"kiss-of-death\\" letter among the Byrnes and Truman supporters, but on the other hand, as some people pointed out, Wallace was the only candidate who had received a written endorsement. Hannegan had not told anyone about the letter he received on July 15, but now he said that he had a letter in which the president mentioned Truman.McCullough; Ferrell, Choosing Truman, pages 74-75, 82. On July 16 and 17, Sunday and Monday, Byrnes had several setbacks. One was Flynn's concern about losing black votes in case Byrnes got the nomination. The other, more serious, was the increasing opposition against Byrnes from labor, in particular Hillman.Ferrell, Choosing Truman, pages 43-44. On Monday evening the party leaders telephoned Roosevelt, saying that labor would not accept Byrnes and mentioned Flynn's concern as well.Ferrell, Choosing Truman, page 47. Roosevelt concurred and told them to \\"go all out for Truman\\". Now, when the president had really decided on Truman, the leader's next step was to convince Truman that he was Roosevelt's pick.Ferrell, Choosing Truman, page 50. They let Byrnes's friend Leo Crowley inform Byrnes. Truman probably learned of Roosevelt's endorsement the same evening, but he was aware of the president's inconsistency and could not be sure of what it meant. Truman had previously, just like Hannegan, got the impression that Roosevelt wanted Byrnes. But the next morning Truman met with Hillman, who refused to accept Byrnes and said that labor's first choice was Wallace, and if that was impossible they could also consent to Truman or Douglas. Roosevelt had met Hillman the previous Thursday. There is no proof that Roosevelt conspired and struck a deal with Hillman not to accept Byrnes, but it might very well have been like that, according to Ferrell. Byrnes believed that Roosevelt had betrayed him.Ferrell, Choosing Truman, pages 44-45, 54; Ferrell, Harry S. Truman: a Life, page 167. Only now, after his meeting with Hillman, did Truman know that he had a good chance to be nominatedFerrell, Harry S. Truman: a Life , page 167; Choosing Truman, page 53. although Truman had planned to nominate Byrnes, and had the text of a nomination speech for him in his pocket. Truman had repeatedly said that he was not in the race and that he did not want to be Vice President, and he remained reluctant.Ferrell, Choosing Truman, pages 50-52. One reason was that he had put his wife Bess on his Senate office payroll and he didn't want her name \\"drug over the front pages of the papers\\". Since 1943 he also had his sister Mary Jane on the payroll. Moreover, Bess disliked Roosevelt and the White House in general. Byrnes, who was disappointed with Roosevelt, withdrew on Wednesday, July 19, \\"in deference to the wishes of the president.\\"Ferrell, Choosing Truman, page 61. On Wednesday, Truman and the leaders gathered in Hannegan's suite in Blackstone Hotel. Hannegan called Roosevelt while Truman listened, and told him that Truman was a contrary Missouri mule. Roosevelt replied loudly, so everyone in the room could hear, \\"Well, tell him if he wants to break up the Democratic Party in the middle of a war, that's his responsibility,\\" and slammed down the receiver. Truman was dumbstruck, but after a few moments replied, \\"Well, if that is the situation, I'll have to say yes. But why the hell didn't he tell me in the first place?\\" By another account he just said, \\"Jesus Christ.\\" Before the call, Hannegan and Roosevelt had agreed what each one should say.Ferrell, Choosing Truman, pages 61-62; Ferrell, Harry S. Truman: a Life, page 170 350px On Thursday, July 20, Hannegan released the letter which Roosevelt had given him on board the train, and its text appeared in the newspapers the next morning, but as it mentioned both Truman and Douglas it made people confused. The ballot was also held on Thursday. Wallace supporters had packed the convention hall and tried to stampede the convention, as Wendell Willkie had successfully done at the Republican convention four years earlier for the presidential nomination. There were parades and chants for Wallace, and banners for him were everywhere. The organist played the Iowa song, \\"Iowa, Iowa, that's where the tall corn grows!\\" Entrance tickets for each day to the Chicago Stadium had been printed in the same color, and probably the Wallace supporters used all their tickets for the Thursday, and the ushers and takers at the gates couldn't see the difference. It is also possible that they counterfeited the tickets.Ferrell, Choosing Truman, pages 78, 118n. To avoid a victory for Wallace, the leaders got the organist to change his tune and they had Jackson, a Wallace supporter, recognize Mayor David L. Lawrence of Pittsburgh, who moved an adjournment until the next morning.\\"Oral History Interview with David L. Lawrence\\", trumanlibrary.org Until the next day, according to Truman biographer David McCullough, the leaders tried to convince the delegates to vote for Truman. He writes in his book Truman: \\"But Hannegan, Flynn, Kelly, and the others had been working through the night, talking to delegates and applying 'a good deal of pressure' to help them see the sense in selecting Harry Truman. No one knows how many deals were cut, how many ambassadorships or postmaster jobs were promised, but reportedly, by the time morning came, Postmaster General Frank Walker had telephoned every chairman of every delegation.\\" But Robert Ferrell states that their tactics were not to make deals with delegates during the night, but to talk to the delegates during Friday and tell them the president wanted Truman.Ferrell, Choosing Truman, pages 85-86. Meanwhile, police kept large numbers of Wallace supporters out of the convention venue.\\"Oliver Stone's Untold History of the United States\\", Hour 2 ==Vote== At the presidential balloting, Roosevelt got an overwhelming majority, 1086 votes, far ahead of Harry F. Byrd with 89 votes and James A. Farley with one vote. {  + Vice-Presidential vote - ! Candidate !! 1st ballot !! 2nd ballot (before shifts) !! 2nd ballot (after shifts) - Harry S.

Ferrell remarks that Truman was a product of the boss system in Kansas City, and that he was nominated in 1944 by the boss systemFerrell, Choosing Truman, pages 90-91. who had made it clear to Roosevelt that Wallace was unacceptable to them. Ferrell also writes that Roosevelt was disingenuous, in particular towards Byrnes, and \\"elevated untruthfulness to a high art.\\" Roosevelt used subordinates for tasks that were unpleasant, like telling Byrnes and Wallace to withdraw. The Roosevelt administration, writes Ferrell, saw many examples of the president welcoming enemies into the oval office, charming them, and giving every evidence of friendship, whereupon they later received unmistakable evidence of where they stood within the administration.Ferrell, Choosing Truman, pages 91-92. Edward Flynn, however, believed that because of his poor health Roosevelt was reluctant to get involved in a quarrel: \\"I believe that in order to rid himself of distress or strife and rather than argue, he permitted all aspirants for the nomination to believe it would be an open convention.\\"Jean Edward Smith, FDR (2006), page 619. Ferrell asks himself if Truman, who appeared to gain the office without the effort, in reality was playing a calculated and sly game. Ferrell claims that everything suggests that Truman was trying to achieve the office he insisted he was not interested in. He would have been a strange politician otherwise, according to Ferrell. Roosevelt disliked ambitious people, and Truman knew this, so it was probably an advantage to be humble and deny he was a candidate.Ferrell, Choosing Truman, page 93. As a border state senator and a political moderate compared with the liberal Wallace and the conservative Byrnes, Truman was humorously dubbed the \\"Missouri compromise.\\" The liberal group of the party was disappointed with Truman's nomination. Some newspapers falsely claimed that he had been a member of the Ku Klux Klan. Additionally, he was criticized for having his wife Bess on the payroll. However, these controversies had no impact. Few Americans wanted to change their leadership as the Second World War was still going on, so Roosevelt and Truman easily defeated the Republican candidate Thomas E. Dewey and his running mate John W. Bricker. On January 20, 1945, Truman was sworn in as Vice President of the United States. He was destined to hold the job for just 82 days. On April 12, 1945, he succeeded to the Presidency on Franklin D. Roosevelt's death. ==NotesReferences== *Robert H. Ferrell, Harry S.

Relations are based on a long shared border and common cultural and historical interactions. == Shared history == The border between Niger to the north and Nigeria to the south cuts through one of the more densely populated areas of both nations. Culturally, the center and west of this border bisects the northern section of Hausaland: the home of the Hausa people. Prior to the turn of the 20th century there was no formal border here, but the current line is roughly the northern reach of the 19th century Sokoto Caliphate. City states south of this — such as Katsina, Kano, and Sokoto — were allied in a system of Islamic Fulani jihad states. Areas to the north — Maradi, the Gobir refugee state, and the Sultanate of Damagaram — resisted the Sokoto caliphate. Both areas were culturally Hausaphone in the center and west, and Kanuri in the east. In the east, both sides of the present border had been part of the Bornu Empire. The expansion of French and British imperialism in the period 1890–1905 demarcated the line which would become the modern Niger – Nigeria border. During colonial rule, the French and English languages were implanted on each side of the border, along with cultural, educational and political traditions. Rival French and British interests meant that during much of the colonial period trade and relations across this border was dissuaded. Niger, entirely landlocked, was supplied with access to the sea through fellow French West Africa colonies in modern Benin, Togo, and points west. From 1941 to 1943, the French Niger colony was loyal to German occupied France, and the border between the colonies was completely closed. Despite this, common Hausa language and cultural ties meant that there was much informal trade and travel over the long border during the colonial period.William F. S. Miles. Hausaland Divided: Colonialism and Independence in Nigeria and Niger. Cornell University Press, 1994 == Development of bilateral relations == Since independence in 1960, the two states pursued close relations. Each side has based diplomatic relations upon non-interference in the internal affairs of the other. During the Nigerian Civil War, President of Niger Hamani Diori was an active mediator in the conflict. Each side has also strongly appealed to its former colonial powers for support in defense and, unlike Nigerian-Cameroonian or Nigerien-Beninois relations, there have been no serious border conflicts. Hausa language and cultural ties are strong, but there is little interest in a pan-Hausa state.William F. S. Miles. Development, not division: local versus external perceptions of the Niger-Nigeria boundary. The Journal of Modern African Studies (2005), 43:2:297-320 The division of Lake Chad, although forced to go to mediation between Chad, Cameroon, Niger, and Nigeria, awaits formal settlement and has not been a source of tension between Niamey and Abuja. Nigeria has an embassy in Niamey, while Niger maintains an embassy in Abuja. == Commerce == The cities of southern Niger and Northern Nigeria have been linked in the Trans-Saharan trade going back to the medieval period. Cities such as Kano and Katsina have long been the southern terminus of trade networks which sustain much of Niger's economy. Nigeria benefits from the trade and agricultural sales (especially Nigerien cattle taken to Nigerian markets), while Niger's most direct routes to overseas trade are through Nigeria's and Benin's railway systems. == Agreements and organization == Each nation plays active roles in continental multilateral organizations, are members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) trade block, the African Union, African Development Bank, UEMOA, CILSS, Council of Understanding, and the ALG. Bilaterally, the two nations formed the Nigeria- Niger Joint Commission for Cooperation (NNJC), established in March, 1971 with its Permanent Secretariat in Niamey, Niger.INTEGRATED ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT IN SHARED CATCHMENTS BETWEEN NIGERIA AND NIGER EGEF Council Documents, MFA Regional Annex, 2006. == Ecology == Niger's water supply is almost entirely dependent of cross border sources, while northern Nigeria is almost as dependent on the waters of the Niger River and Lake Chad. Both areas face rapid desertification and increasing demands for water. The two nations are members of the Niger Basin Authority (successor to the 1964 Niger River Commission), the Lake Chad Commission, and the Niger-Nigeria Joint Committee has special focus on water and water development issues.Climate-Induced Water Conflict Risks in West Africa: Recognizing and Coping with Increasing Climate Impacts on Shared Watercourses .

The area was owned by his Croatian grandfather, J. G. Marinovich, who had supposedly been in the Russian Army and overseen the battlefield amputation of his own arm.Mike Sager, Todd Marinovich: The Man Who Never Was, Esquire, April 14, 2009, Accessed April 15, 2009. Marinovich attended Watsonville High School. ==College career== Marinovich went to Santa Monica College, where the team went undefeated and won the 1958 national junior- college championship. From there he transferred to the University of Southern California. While majoring in art at USC, Marinovich was a two-way lineman and a captain of the USC team that won the 1962 national championship; however, during the 1963 Rose Bowl he was ejected for fighting. Known for his passion, he was named Most Inspirational Player by his teammates. In college, he met his wife, Trudi (née Fertig), who was a sorority girl at USC, and the sister of USC quarterback Craig Fertig; she dropped out of college after her sophomore year to marry Marinovich. ==Professional career== Marinovich entered professional football during the era of NFL and AFL competitive drafts, and was drafted in the 12th round of the 1962 NFL Draft by the Los Angeles Rams and in the 1962 AFL Draft by the Oakland Raiders. After a disappointing three- year career, where he over-trained himself based on weight and bulk with little time for recovery, Marinovich left to focus on sports training. ==Strength and conditioning coach== Marinovich studied Eastern Bloc training methods and was hired by Oakland Raiders owner, Al Davis, as one of the NFL's first strength-and-conditioning coaches. Marinovich learned to focus more on training for speed and flexibility, and much of his work became the basis for modern core- and swimming-pool-based conditioning programs. He later worked for the MLB's St. Louis Cardinals, and then the Hawaiians of the World Football League. He eventually moved his young family in with his in-laws on the Balboa Peninsula of Newport Beach, California. He later opened his own athletic research center, and began applying the techniques to his children, Traci and Todd Marinovich, introducing sport training before they could leave the crib and continuing it throughout childhood and adolescence.Douglas S.

Todd Marinovich became a high school football legend, dominating all records in Orange County and coming to national attention when Sports Illustrated published an article, titled \\"Bred To Be A Superstar\\", that discussed his unique upbringing under his father who wanted to turn his son into the \\"perfect quarterback\\". The article declared Marinovich \\"America's first test-tube athlete\\", and mentioned his mother took him to museums, played him classical music and jazz while banning cartoons as too violent and instead viewing films by Alfred Hitchcock. Marv Marinovich had assembled a team of advisers to tutor him on every facet of the game.Douglas S. Looney, The Minefield, Sports Illustrated, September 3, 1990, Accessed October 2, 2015. In a noted passage, the article described that: Because of his strict upbringing and almost mechanical lifestyle under his father, some nicknamed him the \\"Robo QB.\\" Todd Marinovich went on to have a solid career at USC, but began to show signs of emotional rebellion against his strict upbringing under his father; by the time he entered the NFL as a first round draft pick, he soon became a major bust due to personal issues. As a result, an ESPN columnist named the elder Marinovich one of history's \\"worst sports fathers.\\" In 1997 Marinovich started training athletes privately.

In 2008 the gym name changed to Sport Science Lab (SSL) and was located at San Juan Capistrano, California. Under Sports Science Lab, Marinovich's unique training system was called the Neuromuscular Intensification System. At some point between 2008–2010 Marinovich stopped being associated with SSL. In May 2009, Marinovich became the strength and conditioning coach for MMA fighter BJ Penn for his August 8 title defense against Kenny Florian, at UFC 101 in the main event. Penn defeated Florian by a rear naked choke at 3:54 of the 4th round to retain the UFC lightweight title. and then following with another win against Diego Sanchez via 5th-round TKO due to a cut. In late 2011, Marv Marinovich along with his brother Gary trained either at Integrated Martial Sciences Academy (IMS Academy) in Live Oak, Santa Cruz County, California or at Noble- Moreno Boxing Gym in Watsonville, California. His training program is known as Marinovich Training Systems.

Since the early 1980s Balog has photographed such subjects as endangered animals, North America's old-growth forests, and polar ice. His work aims to combine insights from art and science to produce innovative, dynamic and sometimes shocking interpretations of our changing world. Balog's best-known project explores the impact of climate change on the world's glaciers. In 2007 he initiated the Extreme Ice Survey, the most wide- ranging ground-based photographic glacier study ever conducted. National Geographic magazine showcased Balog's ice work in June 2007 and June 2010, and the project is featured in the 2009 NOVA documentary Extreme IceSee Extreme Ice. as well as the 75-minute film Chasing Ice, which premiered in January 2012. Balog's book Ice: Portraits of the World’s Vanishing Glaciers summarizes the work of the Extreme Ice Survey through 2012. In January 2016, Balog began production on a feature-length documentary film, exploring the environmental effects of the Anthropocene. Released as The Human Element, the film debuted in April 2018, co-presented by Green Film Fest, part of the San Francisco International Film Festival. Balog has received many awards for his work. In 1996 he became the first photographer ever commissioned by the U.S. Postal Service to create a full set of stamps.James Balog, National Geographic He is the author of seven books, including Extreme Ice Now: Vanishing Glaciers and Changing Climate: A Progress Report (2009), Tree: A New Vision of the American Forest (2004), and Survivors: A New Vision of Endangered Wildlife (1990), described as a conceptual breakthrough in nature photography. He is a founding Fellow of the International League of Conservation Photographers. He lives in Boulder, Colorado, with his wife, Suzanne, and his daughter. == Background == Balog was born in Danville, Pennsylvania. His interest and fascination with nature originated in his early childhood in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. While working on his undergraduate degree in communications at Boston College, he became an avid adventurer. He made frequent trips to the White Mountains of New Hampshire and the wilderness rivers of Maine, and later larger climbing expeditions in the Alps and Himalayas, along with first ascents in Alaska. As his outdoor adventures evolved, Balog increasingly felt a need to document his experiences. He began carrying a camera on his trips and teaching himself photography. While working on a master's degree in geomorphology at the University of Colorado, he honed his photography skills during frequent climbing trips. In order to pursue a more direct connection with the natural world, he decided to switch from science to nature photojournalism. He began with a series of documentary photography assignments for magazines such as Mariah (the predecessor to Outside), Smithsonian and National Geographic, work he continues today. Later, he moved into self-directed projects, many of which would ultimately lead to large-format photography books. Balog's work has appeared in National Geographic, The New Yorker, Life, Vanity Fair, The New York Times Magazine, Smithsonian, Audubon, Outside and numerous trade publications such as American Photo, Professional Photographer and Photo District News. He was a contributing editor to National Geographic Adventure. Assignments and personal projects have included documenting the aftermath of the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, the 2004 tsunami that devastated Southeast Asia, Hurricane Katrina's collision with the U.S. Gulf Coast, and the 2010 Deepwater Horizon Gulf oil disaster.https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2010/08/bp-ocean-cover-up/ ==The Human Element== THE HUMAN ELEMENT is a 2018 documentary film directed by Matthew Testa and produced by Olivia Ahnemann. SYNOPSIS: \\"We humans are a force of nature. At the same time human activities alter the basic elements of life – earth, air, water, and fire – those elements change human life in turn. In this drama, blending art and science, we follow photographer James Balog as he explores wildfires, hurricanes, sea level rise, a struggling coal mining community, and our changing air supply. THE HUMAN ELEMENT highlights Americans who are on the frontlines of climate change, inspiring us to re-evaluate our relationship with the natural world.\\" ==Chasing Ice== Chasing Ice is a 2012 documentary film directed by Jeff Orlowski about the efforts of Balog and his Extreme Ice Survey to publicize the effects of climate change. It was released in the United States on November 16, 2012. The documentary includes scenes from a glacier calving event that took place at Jakobshavn Glacier in Greenland, lasting 75 minutes, the longest such event ever captured on film. Two EIS videographers waited several weeks in a small tent overlooking the glacier, and were finally able to witness of ice crashing off the glacier. The film received the 2014 News and Documentary Emmy award for Outstanding Nature Programming. ==Notable projects== Extreme Ice Survey. The Extreme Ice Survey (EIS) tells the story of a planet in flux. With methodology that combines time-lapse imagery with conventional photography and video, EIS, now in its second decade of field operations, is the world's most extensive ground-based photographic glacier study to date. Over a million time-lapse frames reveal the extraordinary retreat of glaciers and ice sheets due to climate change, providing scientists with vital insights on glacier dynamics. As of January 2018, 28 cameras were shooting at glaciers in Greenland, Iceland, Alaska, the Alps, Antarctica, and the Rocky Mountains of the U.S.; previously, as many as 43 cameras had been in the field at once. The cameras shoot year-round, every half-hour of daylight. EIS supplements the time-lapse record by occasionally repeating shots at fixed locations in Iceland, Bolivia, the Canadian province of British Columbia, Mt. Everest, Mt. Kilimanjaro and the French and Swiss Alps. A feature-length film, PBS documentary, National Geographic book, National Public Radio and numerous magazines and newspapers have shown the EIS team. In addition, EIS spreads the word of climate change and shrinking glaciers through public talks, a touring exhibition and displays in public venues, including Denver International Airport, Chicago O'Hare International Airport, and Atlanta Hartsfield International Airport. EIS has appeared before Congress and in multimedia presentations at science and policy conferences around the world. ANIMA series. Seeking to challenge humankind's ancient cultural perception about its place in the world, Balog paired chimpanzees with a diverse range of humans and photographed a series of portraits. The artwork draws on insights from a variety of fields, including visual arts, environmental philosophy and Jungian psychology. ANIMAA web page about it is here. asks readers to imagine a healthier, more integrated relationship between humans and nature. Holga series. Starting in 1997 and continuing intermittently through the present day, Balog has continued a series of photographs made with a Holga camera, a toy appreciated for its low-fidelity aesthetic. Balog enjoys working with the imperfections in the exposures, such as vignetting and blur, and makes it part of the finished \\"look.\\" makes them part of the pieces. He actually wants the camera to produce little defects that will inspire new creative revelations. Survivors series.A web page about it is here. Balog tried to change people's perception of endangered wildlife by altering the context in which the animals were viewed. Instead of capturing his subjects in nature with a telephoto lens, he photographed them in non- natural settings, often against white backdrops, to emphasize their vulnerability. Techno Sapiens series. Balog explored the increasing dependence of Homo sapiens on technology in his series \\"Techno Sapiens\\".A web page about it is here . Its images range from techno-fashion portraits to photographs depicting people's techno-habitats. Balog used a variety of techniques to create images that illustrate the changing features of human nature, as well as humankind's increasing detachment from the natural world. The duality of the pictures, a tension between beauty and horror, mimics the ambivalence most people feel for technology. Tree series. For the Tree series,A web page about it is here. Balog wanted to photograph some of world's tallest trees in their full grandeur, but he realized that his subjects were far too large to capture in a single frame. He devised a multi-frame approach of photographing the trees from the top down. The method was inspired by some of the lunar landing pictures from the NASA missions during the 1960s. Balog climbed each tree, and then photographed it in sections as he rappelled downward. Later, he created digital mosaics by stitching the images together using computer imaging software. Some images required up to four days of shooting, plus as many as six weeks of computer work to assemble the final composition. The tree images eventually became a 2004 book, Tree: A New Vision of the American Forest. == Style and inspiration == Balog's work has primarily evolved as a combination of art, science and environmental documentary. He views his imagery as exploring the \\"contact zone\\" between man and nature.

Among his many artistic influences Balog counts Irving Penn, Richard Avedon, Carleton Watkins, William Henry Jackson, Edward Weston, Robert Adams, Eliot Porter, Eugene Smith and Cornell Capa. Outside photography, he draws inspiration from the entire range of arts, including music, literature, painting, filmmaking, sculpture and architecture. Balog's photographs vary between very clean, simple representations of his subjects and more impressionistic interpretations that illustrate his unconscious feelings about a scene. He tends to alter his treatments and techniques based on emotional responses to a subject and the circumstances surrounding his shooting. Early in his career, Balog concentrated on man's direct impact on nature, producing a series on nuclear missile silos in the agrarian landscapes of the American West. In his first book project, Wildlife Requiem, Balog examined the killing of animals for sport. Published in 1984, Wildlife Requiem shocked the photography establishment with its brutally graphic images. > In a lot of my work I’m trying to make a commentary about humans encroaching > on nature through their presence.

This was the first film adaptation of the 1924 best-selling and controversial novel The Constant Nymph by Margaret Kennedy and the 1926 stage play version written by Kennedy and Basil Dean.https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-show/the-constant-nymph-2745 The theme of adolescent sexuality reportedly discomfited the British film censors, until they were reassured that lead actress Poulton was in fact in her 20s. Location filming took place in the Austrian Tyrol, and the film proved a commercial and critical success, being named the best British feature film of 1928. Jo Botting of the British Film Institute notes: \\"The progression through the film is from light to darkness, from space to enclosure and from hope to despair.\\" ==Plot== Young composer Lewis Dodd (Novello) travels to Austria to visit his mentor Albert Sanger (Georg Henrich). He meets Sanger's teenage daughters Tessa (Poulton), Antonia (Benita Hume), and Pauline (Dorothy Boyd) and Sanger's third wife Linda (Mary Clare), who does not appear to be liked by Sanger's daughters. The atmosphere is jovial and celebratory, until Sanger dies very suddenly. Lewis contacts the girls' uncle in Cambridge, who comes to Austria accompanied by his daughter Florence (Frances Doble). After a whirlwind courtship Lewis proposes to Florence, who eagerly accepts his offer of marriage. Tessa is distraught at the news. It is decided that Tessa and Pauline will be sent to a boarding school in England. Meanwhile, Lewis and Florence attempt to settle down in London, but find that in the home setting things are very different and Lewis comes to feel trapped by the superficiality of London society and the realisation of his wife's ambitious, pushy nature. Tessa and Pauline are unhappy at school and decide to run away, arriving at the home of Lewis and Florence on the evening on which Florence has arranged a musical recital designed to showcase Lewis' talents to her influential friends. Florence is extremely annoyed by the interruption to her evening and allows the girls to stay, but with ill-disguised bad grace. Lewis is angry at his wife's attitude, and ends up taking her to task in front of the gathering, leaving her humiliated. The atmosphere in the household deteriorates as the attraction between Lewis and Tessa becomes increasingly obvious. Lewis begins to treat Florence with increasing disdain and lack of respect. As the date of Lewis' first public performance draws near, he decides to leave Florence after the concert, and Tessa agrees to leave with him. Florence is suspicious that something is afoot, challenges Tessa and the two end up in a serious argument, after which Florence forbids Tessa from attending the concert. Left locked in alone at home on the evening of the concert, Tessa manages to escape through a window and makes her way to the theatre. Lewis' performance is a big success, but afterwards he ignores the congratulatory gathering Florence has assembled in his dressing room, and instead heads off with Tessa to catch the boat train for Belgium. Tessa begins to feel ill as she boards the boat and her condition deteriorates as the journey progresses. When they finally arrive at a dreary back-street lodging house in Brussels, it is clear that Tessa is seriously ill and the guilt- stricken Lewis begins to write a letter to Tessa's uncle begging for help and attempting to make it clear that he alone is responsible for the situation and Tessa has done nothing to merit reproach. Before he can finish the letter however, Tessa collapses and dies. ==Cast== * Ivor Novello as Lewis Dodd * Mabel Poulton as Tessa Sanger * Frances Doble as Florence * Mary Clare as Linda Sanger * Dorothy Boyd as Pauline Sanger * Benita Hume as Antonia Sanger * Georg Henrich as Albert Sanger * Tony de Lungo as Roberto * Evan Thomas as Ike * Yvonne Thomas as Kate Sanger * Clifford Heatherley as Sir Berkeley * Elsa Lanchester as Lady ==Preservation status== Thought to have been lost, the film was found as a result of a 1992 British Film Institute campaign to locate missing movies. ==ReferencesBibliography== * Low, Rachael.

She developed (along with other researchers around the world at IBM, Intel, Ghent University) silicon photonic components such as waveguide couplers, ring resonators, modulators, detectors, WDM wavelength sources and sensors on silicon platform. She published the first paper on a class of versatile waveguides known as Slot-waveguides in 2004,http://nanophotonics.ece.cornell.edu/Publications/voidNanostructure.pdf which has since been cited over one thousand times. In all her work has been cited 32373 times (as of January 18, 2018).https://scholar.google.com/scholar?start=0&q;=Michal+Lipson+&hl;=en&as;_sdt=0,5 She was also the first to demonstrate optical parametric gain in silicon, which was considered an important step towards building optical amplifiers in silicon. Lipson's McArthur fellowship citation mentions her work in ring modulators (circular waveguides) as the key contribution of Lipson via the continued refinement of both opto-electronic and purely optical circuits for smaller size, . increased efficiency, and accelerated switching speed . The resulting silicon-based photonic integrated circuits have the potential to improve signal transmission and processing dramatically. Lipson has received numerous honors, including being the recipient of a Fulbright Fellowship and an NSF Young Investigator Career award. She is also an elected fellow of Optical Society of America (OSA). Her current research interests include optical metamaterials, low-power and compact optical modulators, and slot waveguides. Her work has appeared in Nature, Nature Photonics, and other journals. ==Awards and honors== *2005: National Science Foundation Career Award *2010: Blavatnik Award * 2010: MacArthur Fellow *2013: Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers \\"For contributions to design and applications of nanoscale photonic devices\\" *2015: Thomson Reuters top 1 percent highly cited researcher in the field of Physics *2017: R.W.Wood Prize - Optical Society of Americahttps://www.osa.org/en- us/awards_and_grants/awards/award_description/rwwood/ *2018: Awarded an honorary doctorate by Trinity College Dublin *2019: IEEE Photonics Award * 2019: NAS Comstock Prize in Physics *2019: Elected Member of the NAS\\\\- National Academy of Sciences ==Selected works== *Slot waveguides: ** ** *Frequency combs **J.

His activities have taken him to Washington, DC and Wounded Knee, South Dakota. His family moved to Washington State from Montana when he was a child. Adams was instrumental in working to assert and protect Native American fishing and hunting rights on traditional territories as free of state restrictions and to seek change through protests and court challenges. The issue was settled by the United States Supreme Court ruling in United States v. Washington (1974), known as the Boldt Decision, generally affirming native treaty fishing rights, and effectively making the tribes co-managers with Washington State of salmon and other fishing resources. Adams participated in the American Indian Movement, including its occupation of the Department of Interior Building in Washington, DC in 1972 and in the Wounded Knee incident in 1973. In both cases Adams played important roles in negotiating peaceful resolutions of volatile situations. He continued his work to press for tribal sovereignty and to restore the role of elders in the tribes. In 2006 he was given the 'American Indian Visionary Award' by newspaper Indian Country Today. ==Early life== Henry Lyle (known as Hank) Adams was born to an Assiniboine family on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in Montana on May 16, 1943.Donald P. Baker, \\"Activist Tells of BIA Sacking; Brutality Movie Called Spark\\", Washington Post, p. A1, 25 November 1972, at Framing Red Power project, accessed 10 January 2016 His birthplace was Wolf Point, nicknamed as Poverty Flats. In 1944, his family moved to Washington State, seeking defense industry jobs during World War II, as military bases and related contractors had greatly expanded. They settled in Grays Harbor County, Washington, on the Olympic Peninsula south of the Quinault Indian Reservation. While growing up, Adams worked as a child and youth as a fruit and vegetable picker on nearby farms. Adams attended the nearby Moclips-Aloha High School in Moclips, from which he graduated in 1961. In school, he was student-body president, editor of the school newspaper and yearbook, and a starting football and basketball player.S. Robinson, \\"Hank Adams Receives 'Visionary' Award\\" , Spring 2006, NWIFC News, Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission, accessed 10 January 2016 He worked part of the time in a sawmill on the Quinault Reservation. He gained a strong work ethic from which he drew throughout the rest of his life. After graduating from high school, Adams became interested in politics. In 1964, Adams helped organize a march on Olympia, the capital of the state, to protest the state's attempt to limit Indian treaty fishing rights. After lengthy court cases, in 1974 the Native American fishing and hunting rights on traditional lands outside their reservations were upheld by the US Supreme Court. ==Early career== While in college at a campus in Walla Walla, Adams worked part time on the Quinault Reservation trying to deal with its problem of high rates of suicide. After two years, he dropped out of college to pursue this work full time. He became Special Projects Director of the National Indian Youth Council. This student organization was one of the most radical Native American institutions of the time. ==Activism== In April 1964 Adams attracted media attention by refusing to be drafted into the United States Army unless traditional Indian treaty rights were accepted and recognized by the federal government. His rebellion was not successful, and he had to serve his term. In 1968 Adams became the leader of the Survival of American Indians Association. This collection of 200 members was concerned with protecting traditional Indian fishing rights, which were under pressure from sports fishermen and local governments, which believed that their regulations applied to Native Americans. Native Americans said their right to fish superseded any state regulations. Near the end of 1968, Adams got more directly involved in the struggle. He fought against state fishing regulations of Native Americans on the Nisqually River in Washington. He was arrested often for protest actions between 1968 and 1971. He was shot in the stomach by white fishermen who acted as vigilantes against protesters. One of his sisters drowned in the course of another protest. From 1968 to 1970, Adams made a documentary about the fishing protests and what traditional fishing meant to the regional Native Americans. In 1968 and 1972 Adams sought the Republican nomination as candidate for the House of Representatives from Washington's Third Congressional District. He was unsuccessful but supported the Republican candidates. Adams continued to work on the fishing rights issue, also lobbying representatives in Washington. The issue made it to the United States Supreme Court, which ruled in what is known as the Boldt Decision of 1974. The federal court affirmed that Native Americans retained hunting and fishing rights in their historic territories unless specifically excluded by treaty; this included the right to fish at traditional grounds off the reservations, and to co-manage the salmon resource along with the state. During this period, Adams also became active in the American Indian Movement (AIM). He accompanied members of AIM on their Trail of Broken Treaties 1972 march across country and protest for more sovereignty. They concluded by occupying the Bureau of Indian Affairs offices at the Department of Interior headquarters in Washington, DC. Adams drafted a Twenty Point Proposal of demands. If the government met these demands, AIM was willing to evacuate the BIA quarters. The group asked for the tribes to be given treaty-making authority, for the federal judiciary to accept the Native American right to interpret treaties, and for abolition of laws that threatened Indian sovereignty and life. The list was not accepted, but it stands as a record of goals for Native American sovereignty and self- determination. Adams' leadership and commitment to the Native American cause helped change government policy. His work helped federally recognized tribes gain more sovereignty and power. Adams was instrumental in saving Indian lives in two of the major Red Power movements of the early 1970s. During the Bureau of Indian Affairs building takeover, Adams was the main negotiator on behalf of the Indians who occupied the Department of Interior headquarters. He was vital in gaining amnesty for protesters during negotiations with the White House for the events that occurred during the takeover. One year later Adams participated in the occupation of Wounded Knee. At the Wounded Knee incident, Adams helped to successfully end the two-months' long occupation in a peaceful manner. He was the intermediary between Frank Fools Crow, the head of the Lakota Occupation, and representatives of President Richard Nixon's White House.\\"Hank Adams as negotiator\\", Indian Country Today, accessed 10 January 2016 Leonard Garment, the lead White House aide in both of these events said: \\"Hank Adams' role in the peaceful resolution of some very difficult problems is still vividly clear in my mind.\\". Adams worked mainly behind the scenes on both of these issues. Adams said of his work: \\"Some of the things you prevent from happening are as important as many of the things you are able concretely to achieve.\\" ==Documentary work== In order to heighten awareness of the treaty disputes in the Northwest over fishing, Adams produced a documentary entitled As Long As The River Runs, filmed between 1968 and 1970. He dedicated this film to his sister-in-law, who died in a drowning incident while protesting fishing rights in the Northwest. The film was shown in 1972 to occupiers of the Department of Interior headquarters in Washington, D.C. Adams said that because the film showed violence against Native American women during protests, it might have contributed to the occupiers trashing the Interior building. The Indians at the BIA became more worried about the police who patrolled the exterior of the building during the occupation. ==Boldt Decision== Hank Adams helped to research information critical to making the case for Native American fishing rights; in the legal challenge settled by the 1974 United States v. Washington, known as the Boldt Decision; the US Supreme Court affirmed that Native Americans in the Northwest had the right to continue to fish in traditional territories and in traditional ways exempt from state restrictions. This included fishing at traditional grounds off the reservation. With the help of activist Billy Frank Jr., Adams played a major behind-the-scenes role. Frank continued to be active in preserving traditional fishing crafts and preserving culture.\\"Frank, Billy, Jr. (1931-2014)\\", History Link website, state of Washington Adams continues to work with issues surrounding the Boldt Decision to this day. ==Legacy== Hank Adams is considered by many in the Indian Community as one of the most influential people in the movement. Leonard Garment, the lead White House aide in resolving both the BIA occupation and Wounded Knee incident, said of Adams: \\"Hank Adams' role in the peaceful resolution of some very difficult problems is still vividly clear in my mind.\\" Vine Deloria, Jr., one of the most influential Native American writers, said Adams was the most important Indians of the last 60 years.\\"Hank Adams\\", Indian Country Today',Spring ==Honors== *Adams' papers are held by Princeton University in its Seeley G.

His father, who became a merchant in Liverpool, was born in Petersburg, Virginia, and his grandfather Hyman Samuels, was born in London in 1764. Samuelson was educated at the Rev. J Blezard's school at Skirlaugh, Yorkshire near Hull.Debretts House of Commons and the Judicial Bench 1881 He started work in his father's office at the age of 14 and was then apprenticed to a Swiss firm in Liverpool. He was exporting engineering machinery and became manager for a Manchester firm of Sharp, Stewart & Co. Samuelson bought a small factory in Banbury that was manufacturing agricultural equipment in 1848. He also built blast furnaces in Middlesbrough and Newport. ==Political career== In February 1859, after a by-election caused by the resignation of Henry William Tancred, Samuelson was elected as Member of Parliament for Banbury until displaced at the 1859 general election. In 1865 he was elected for Banbury again, but his defeated opponent Charles Bell petitioned against his return on the grounds that he was an alien. Samuelson was able to demonstrate that as his grandfather was born in England he was eligible under the British Nationality Act of 1772. He held the seat until 1895. His interests in Parliament were industrial and technical issues. He chaired committees on scientific instruction, railways and patents and was a member of the Royal Commission for the Paris Exhibition in 1878. Meanwhile, his industrial activities had grown significantly. By 1872, his Banbury works were producing over 8000 reaping machines and the production of iron, tar and other products from his ironworks had also grown. ==Professional career== Samuelson was a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers and a member of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers. A paper on the construction of blast furnaces won him a Telford Medal in 1871. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1881. He was adjudged a considerate employer and developed the institutions of Middlesbrough and Cleveland. He was a firm believer in technical education and presented a technical institute to Banbury in 1884. He received a Baronetcy in the same year for services to education. He was made a privy counsellor in the 1895 Resignation Honours. ==Personal life== Samuelson had married Caroline Blundell, daughter of Henry Blundell at Hull in 1844. Their son Henry, who succeeded to the baronetcy, was also an MP. After Caroline's death, he married Lelia Mathilda, daughter of Chevalier Leon Serena and the widow of William Denny of Dumbarton. A volunteer nurse with the Voluntary Aid Detachments, she died of an illness contracted on duty on 18 June 1915. thumb thumb Samuelson died in London in 1905 at the age of 84 and was buried in Torquay. A stone memorial and tomb to Bernhard Samuelson was erected by his eldest son: it lies hidden and overgrown in Hatchford Wood, close to Ockham, Surrey, and bears the motto of the second baronet.

He graduated from New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois, where he excelled on both the basketball team and, as a shortstop, on the baseball team.\\"Ex-coach Ben Braun recalls seeing Bartman's Wrigley reach\\" - The San Diego Union-Tribune Braun played one year of basketball at the University of Wisconsin–La Crosse. He then transferred to the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He earned a teaching degree in English, with a minor in African-American Studies, in June 1975. He earned a master's degree in guidance and counseling from Siena Heights in 1980. He and his wife, Jessica, have a son Julius and a daughter Eliza. ==Basketball coaching career== After graduating from Wisconsin in 1975, Braun began his career as an assistant coach at Washington Park High School in Racine, Wisconsin. After two years of coaching high school basketball, he accepted the head coaching job at Siena Heights University. Braun coached Siena Heights for eight years, taking the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) school to a 148–103 record and five postseason tournaments. Prior to the 1985–86 season, Braun took on the position of associate head coach at Eastern Michigan. Midway through the year, on January 15, 1986, he was elevated to interim head coach. Within two years his Hurons (Eagles from 1991 onwards) were in the NCAA Tournament for the first time in school history. During his 11 years at Eastern Michigan, he guided the Eagles to four postseason berths, including three NCAA appearances. Braun accumulated a record of 185–132 and was named Mid-American Conference Coach of the Year three times. His 185 wins are the most by a coach in Eastern Michigan Eagles men's basketball history. In the summer of 1989, he was the head coach of the U.S. men's basketball team at the 1989 Maccabiah Games.Ben Braun Bio - The University of California Official Athletic Site - CalBears.com  University of California Official Athletic Site The team lost to Team Israel in the final. Braun replaced Todd Bozeman as the head coach at Cal prior to the 1996–97 season. Expectations were low as the Golden Bears were predicted to finish in the bottom half of the conference. However, the team finished tied for second in the conference and reached the NCAA Sweet 16. The team finished the season 23–9 and gave Braun a school record for most wins by a Bear coach in his first year with the program. Braun went on to win the Pac-10 Coach of the Year - the first Cal coach to ever receive the award. In the 1998–99 season, Braun's club defeated North Carolina, UCLA, and Arizona during the course of the year to become the first team ever at Cal to beat three Top 10 schools in the same season. Then after entering the NIT, the Bears, led by Geno Carlisle, won five consecutive postseason games to capture the NIT title - Cal's first postseason tournament championship since the Bears won the 1959 NCAA title. Cal finished the 1998–99 campaign with a 22–11 record. In 2000–01, the Bears returned to the NCAA Tournament, finishing with a 20–11 record, and Sean Lampley - Braun's first recruit at Cal after NCAA sanctions were lifted from Bozeman's tenure - became the school's all-time leading scorer late in his senior campaign, finishing with 1,776 points. In 2001–02, the Bears again went 23–9 and tied for second in the Pac-10 standings. Cal earned a No. 6 seed in the NCAA playoffs, where the Bears toppled Penn before falling to Pittsburgh in the second round. In 2002–03, Cal again reached the second round of the NCAA Tournament behind All- Pac-10 forwards Joe Shipp and Amit Tamir. Shipp ended his career in the No. 3 position on the Bears' all-time scoring list, while teammate Brian Wethers finished in the No. 15 position. In 2005–06, Cal defeated USC and Oregon to reach the Pac-10 Tournament final for the first time ever. Leon Powe and the Bears then earned a No. 7 regional seed in the NCAA Tournament and finished the year with a 20–11 mark. On November 21, 2005, Cal defeated Long Beach State, 88-69, to give Braun his 500th career win. Two days after losing to Ohio State in the 2008 National Invitation Tournament, Braun was fired as head coach of the Golden Bears on March 26, 2008. During his tenure at Cal, Braun directed the Bears to more postseason appearances and more postseason victories than any coach in school history. His 219 wins in 12 years are second to Nibs Price (1925–54, 449–294) in both tenure and wins at Cal, while his Cal winning percentage (.606) is the best at the school since Hall of Famer Pete Newell guided the Bears to a 119–44 mark from 1955–60. Braun was hired as the head men's coach at Rice, replacing Willis Wilson in 2008.

In the same way, it calculates the structure factors and intensities of anomalous or resonant diffraction spectra (DAFS or RXS). The code uses two techniques of monoelectronic calculations. The first one is based on the Finite Difference Method (FDM) to solve the Schrödinger equation. In that way the shape of the potential is free and in particular avoid the muffin-tin approximation.

Released in the summer of 2005 without one single official appearance for the main squad, he joined Primeira Liga club F.C. Penafiel, but left after a couple of months and moved to Leixões S.C. in the second level, where he appeared very rarely over the course of two (incomplete) seasons. In late December 2007, Cristovão signed with AEP Paphos FC from Cyprus. In the 2009 off-season he joined fellow First Division team Anorthosis Famagusta FC, making his league debut on 30 August in a 0–0 away draw against Ermis Aradippou. On 3 February 2012, Cristóvão moved to Bulgaria with PFC Levski Sofia, signing a two-and-a-half-year contract. He scored on his first First Professional Football League appearance, helping his team to a 2–1 win over PFC Cherno More Varna; on 29 April 2012, he netted the only goal in a derby success against PFC CSKA Sofia. Cristóvão was released by Levski in summer 2013 (alongside some of the other foreign players) mainly due to his high salary, but he returned to the club after the winter break. ==Club statistics== {  style=\\"font-size:90%; text-align: center\\" - !rowspan=2Club !rowspan=2Season !colspan=2League !colspan=2Cup !colspan=2Europe !colspan=2Total - !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals -  rowspan=5Porto B 2001–02 41colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—41 - 2002–03 253colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—253 - 2003–04 359colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—359 - 2004–05 345colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—345 - ! colspan=1  Total ! 98!!18!!0!!0!!0!!0!!98!!18 -  rowspan=2Penafiel 2005–06 11010colspan=\\"2\\"—120 - ! colspan=1  Total ! 11!!0!!1!!0!!0!!0!!12!!0 -  rowspan=3Leixões 2005–06 6000colspan=\\"2\\"—60 - 2006–07 2010colspan=\\"2\\"—30 - ! colspan=1  Total ! 8!!0!!1!!0!!0!!0!!9!!0 -  rowspan=3AEP 2007–08 154??colspan=\\"2\\"—154 - 2008–09 254??colspan=\\"2\\"—254 - ! colspan=1  Total ! 40!!8!!0!!0!!0!!0!!40!!8 -  rowspan=4Anorthosis 2009–10 212??40252 - 2010–11 265??81346 - 2011–12 110??21131 - ! colspan=1  Total ! 58!!7!!0!!0!!14!!2!!72!!9 -  rowspan=2Levski Sofia 2011–12 1331000143 - ! colspan=1  Total ! 13!!3!!1!!0!!0!!0!!14!!3 - ! colspan=2  Career total ! 215!!33!!3!!0!!14!!2!!231!!35 } ==References * *National team data *Levski official profile Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:French people of Portuguese descent Category:Sportspeople from Lyon Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Association football wingers Category:Primeira Liga players Category:LigaPro players Category:Portuguese Second Division players Category:FC Porto B players Category:F.C.

Johnville House still exists today but does not use the earlier name. ==Johnville Bridge== The bridge still retains the original name of Johnville Bridge on all Ordnance Survey Ireland maps but is also unusual in design. This is because in close proximity to the Powerstown River, a branch tributary diverts water from the main stream closer to Johnville House before reconnecting with the Powerstown River. So the bridge is actually a set of two; one double arched bridge over the Powerstown River, and a single arched bridge over the tributary stream with the roadway being raised above the ground but still walled in on both sides. On the up-river side of the tributary there is a water filled depression known as the \\"Watering Hole\\" where a seasonal river joins onto the divert before flowing under the single arch section. ==See also== * List of townlands in County Kilkenny ==References== Category:Townlands of County Kilkenny ","title":"Jeanville"},{"id":"20547242","text":"Sphagnum angustifolium, the fine bogmoss, is a species of peat moss with a Holarctic distribution. ==References *USDA PLANTS profile *Sphagnum angustifolium @ Moss Flora of China angustifolium ","title":"Sphagnum angustifolium"},{"id":"20547249","text":"XiXi Yang (born February 16, 1989) is an American television personality.

His third name begins with an uppercase i, as opposed to a lowercase L. ==Life== Thomas John I'Anson Bromwich was born on 8 February 1875, in Wolverhampton, England. He was descended from Bryan I'Anson, of Ashby St Ledgers, Sheriff of London and father of the 17th century 1st Baronet Sir Bryan I'Anson of Bassetsbury. His parents emigrated to South Africa, where in 1892 he graduated from high school. He attended St John's College, Cambridge, where in 1895 he became Senior Wrangler. In 1897, he became a lecturer at St. John’s. From 1902 to 1907, he was a professor of mathematics at Queen’s College, Galway. In 1906, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1907, he returned to Cambridge and again became a Fellow and lecturer at St. John’s. He was a vice president of the Royal Society in 1919 and 1920. He died in Northampton on 24 August 1929, a suicide. ==Work== Bromwich worked in both algebra and analysis. G. H. Hardy called him \\"The best pure mathematician among the applied mathematicians at Cambridge, and the best applied mathematician among the pure mathematicians\\". Today, Bromwich is perhaps best known for justifying Oliver Heaviside's operator calculus. Part of this involved using a contour integral to do an inverse Laplace transform. This particular contour integral is now often called the Bromwich integral, although it is also called by other names. Other topics Bromwich investigated include solutions of the Maxwell's equations, and the scattering of electromagnetic plane waves by spheres. He also investigated, and wrote a book on, the theory of quadratic forms. In 1906 he derived Bromwich inequality in the field of matrices which gives narrower bounds to characteristic roots than those given by Bendixson's inequality. In 1908 he wrote An introduction to the theory of infinite series. A second edition appeared in 1926. G. H. Hardy praised the book highly, while criticizing the way in which it was laid out. The book is still in print.

In a gesture of clemency marking the 27th anniversary of the 1963 revolution, President Sassou Nguesso granted an amnesty to Gongarad Nkoua and other political prisoners on 14 August 1990.Bazenguissa-Ganga, Les voies du politique au Congo: essai de sociologie historique, page 396 . Gongarad Nkoua was a delegate to the February-June 1991 National Conference, which established transitional institutions in preparation for multiparty elections in 1992. At the National Conference, he was one of four candidates for the post of First Vice-President of the Higher Council of the Republic (CSR), which was being set up as the legislature for the 1991-1992 transitional period. After two of the other candidates withdrew, Gongarad Nkoua faced Jean- Michel Bokamba-Yangouma in a third round of voting; he received 331 votes against 491 for Bokamba-Yangouma. Although the necessary quorum of delegates was not reached, Gongarad Nkoua chose to withdraw at that point in favor of Bokamba-Yangouma.Bazenguissa-Ganga, Les voies du politique au Congo, page 396, note 81 . He was instead given the post of Minister of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry in the transitional government of Prime Minister André Milongo, holding that post until 1992.Bazenguissa-Ganga, Les voies du politique au Congo, pages 396, 399, and 442 . Leading his own political party, the UPDP, Gongarad Nkoua stood as a candidate in the August 1992 presidential election. He attracted little support, placing ninth with 0.69% of the vote.Mubuma Guma- Kanh'a Sheri, Partis et familles de partis au Congo-Brazzaville (2006), page 265 .Gaston-Jonas Kouvibidila, Histoire du multipartisme au Congo-Brazzaville: Les débuts d'une crise attendue, 1992-1993 (2000), L'Harmattan, page 153 .Xavier Bienvenu Kitsimbou, \\"La démocratie et les réalités ethniques au Congo\\", University of Nancy II, 26 October 2001, pages 104-105 . He received 6.3% of the vote in Plateaux Region, but in every other region his score was negligible.Dieter Nohlen, Michael Krennerich, and Bernhard Thibaut, Elections in Africa: A Data Handbook (1999), page 274. Subsequently, he and the UPDP supported Bernard Kolélas, the candidate of the Congolese Movement for Democracy and Integral Development (MCDDI), in the second round of the election, but Kolélas was defeated by Pascal Lissouba, the candidate of the Pan-African Union for Social Democracy (UPADS). The MCDDI, the UPDP, and five other parties then formed the Union for Democratic Renewal (URD) opposition coalition on 27 August 1992.Joachim Emmanuel Goma-Thethet, \\"Alliances in the political and electoral process in the Republic of Congo 1991-97\\", in Liberal Democracy and Its Critics in Africa: Political Dysfunction and the Struggle for Social Progress (2005), ed. Tukumbi Lumumba-Kasongo, Zed Books, page 111. After Lissouba took office as President, the Congolese Labour Party (PCT), which had briefly supported him, defected to the opposition.John F. Clark, \\"Congo: Transition and the Struggle to Consolidate\\", in Political Reform in Francophone Africa (1997), ed. John F. Clark and David E. Gardinier, pages 72-73, note 45. Together with other URD leaders, Gongarad Nkoua signed an alliance between the URD and the PCT in September 1992.Joël Nsoni, \\"L’accord M.c.d.d.i-P.c.t, augure-t-il d'un avenir pacifique?\\", La Semaine Africaine, N° 2690, 27 April 2007, pages 3 and 5 . That alliance gave the URD and PCT a parliamentary majority, and consequently President Lissouba dissolved the National Assembly in November 1992. His decision provoked a political crisis that was resolved through the formation of an opposition-dominated power- sharing government, led by Prime Minister Claude Antoine Dacosta. In that government, which was appointed on 25 December 1992, Gongarad Nkoua was included as Minister of Water and Forests.Africa Research Bulletin: Political, Social, and Cultural Series, volume 30 (1993), page 10,847.Kouvibidila, Les débuts d'une crise attendue, page 249 . The Dacosta government remained in office for six months; it was replaced by Lissouba following the early parliamentary election that was held in May-June 1993. Lissouba was later ousted by rebel forces loyal to Sassou Nguesso at the end of the June-October 1997 civil war. As President, Sassou Nguesso appointed Gongarad Nkoua to the government as Minister of State for Agriculture and Animal Husbandry on 2 November 1997.Marchés tropicaux et méditerranéens, issues 2,704-2,720 (1997), page 2,429 .Paul Soni-Benga, Les dessous de la guerre du Congo-Brazzaville (1998), L'Harmattan, page 275 .Calixte Baniafouna, Congo démocratie : La bataille de Brazzaville (5 juin-15 octobre 1997), page 184 .\\"Congo: Sassou- Nguesso forms new 32-member government\\", Agence France-Presse, 4 November 1997. After a little more than a year, Gongarad Nkoua was appointed as Minister of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry (without the rank of Minister of State) on 12 January 1999.\\"Le nouveau gouvernement du Congo\\", Les Dépêches de Brazzaville, 13 January 1999 . ==Political career since 2000== At the time of the January 2002 constitutional referendum, Gongarad Nkoua, who was still serving as Minister of Agriculture, headed the National Electoral Commission's operations for Ouenzé, the fifth arrondissement of Brazzaville. At a meeting in Ouenzé on 6 January 2002, he said that the new constitution was written with \\"past mistakes that led the country into a vicious cycle of tribal violence\\" in mind, and he urged the people to vote for it, saying that it would be conducive to good governance. He also stressed the importance of maintaining a peaceful atmosphere for the referendum.\\"Le ministre Auguste- Célestin Gongarad Nkoua mobilise la population de Ouenzé (Brazzaville) en vue du référendum\\", Les Dépêches de Brazzaville, 7 January 2002 . Gongarad Nkoua supported Sassou Nguesso's candidacy in the March 2002 presidential election. Along with other important allies of Sassou Nguesso, he was included on the support committee for Sassou Nguesso's candidacy when it was publicly launched on 6 February 2002.\\"Présentation officielle du comité de soutien à la candidature de Denis Sassou Nguesso\\", Les Dépêches de Brazzaville, 9 February 2002 . In the May 2002 parliamentary election, Gongarad Nkoua was elected to the National Assembly as the UPDP candidate in the Ngo constituency of Plateaux Region; he won the seat in the first round with 63.27% of the vote.\\"Elections législatives : les 51 élus du premier tour\\", Les Dépêches de Brazzaville, 5 June 2002 . After nearly five years in the government, he was dismissed from the government on 18 August 2002Jean-Paul Pigasse, \\"Réflexions et commentaires sur le nouveau gouvernement du Congo\\", Les Dépêches de Brazzaville, 19 August 2002 . and consequently sat as a Deputy in the National Assembly.\\"Le président de l’UPDP visite sa circonscription parlementaire de Ngo\\", Les Dépêches de Brazzaville, 27 December 2002 . A year after Gongarad Nkoua's dismissal from the government, President Sassou Nguesso appointed him as President of the Economic and Social Council on 13 August 2003.\\"Compte- rendu de la réunion du Conseil des ministres du 13 août 2003\\", Les Dépêches de Brazzaville, 18 August 2003 . The Council, a constitutional state institution,\\"L'aréopage démocratique congolais\\" , Les Dépêches de Brazzaville, 25 March 2008 . is intended to provide advice to the government and the two houses of Parliament on economic, social, and cultural policy. Speaking at the Council's inaugural session on 18 February 2004, Gongarad Nkoua told the other members of the Council that they \\"must participate effectively in the development of the nation's economic and social policy, advising the government in its decision-making to enable it to provide the people with better living conditions and the conditions of social peace.\\" He also emphasized the importance of investment, saying that domestic economic activity should be encouraged and that Western countries should work with the Council to facilitate development.\\"Auguste-Célestin Gongarad Nkoua préside les travaux de la session inaugurale du Conseil économique et social\\" , Les Dépêches de Brazzaville, 19 February 2004 . In the June 2007 parliamentary election, Gongarad Nkoua ran again as the UPDP candidate in Ngo constituency. Rally of Democratic Forces (RFD) candidate Joseph Miokono Hondjuila, who had won the seat in the 1992 parliamentary election, was considered Gongarad Nkoua's main competitor.Gankama N'Siah, \\"Le sort des poids lourds positionnés dans les circonscriptions électorales de l'hinterland\\", Les Dépêches de Brazzaville, 20 June 2007 . Nevertheless, Gongarad Nkoua won an easy victory in the first round, receiving 86.16% of the vote.\\"Elections législatives : les 44 élus du premier tour\\", Les Dépêches de Brazzaville, 2 July 2007 .\\"Les résultats des élections législatives, avant l'examen des contentieux électoraux\\", La Semaine Africaine, number 2,720, 21 August 2007, page 7 . He remained allied to Sassou Nguesso and was one of many party leaders participating in the creation of the Rally for the Presidential Majority (RMP), a coalition of pro-Sassou Nguesso parties, on 20 December 2007.Joël Nsoni, \\"Le R.m.p et les enjeux fondamentaux de la politique au Congo\\", La Semaine Africaine, number 2,755, 28 December 2007, page 3 . On 18 September 2009, President Sassou Nguesso appointed Jean-Marie Tassoua, another long-time ally, to replace Gongarad Nkoua as President of the Economic and Social Council. He instead appointed Gongarad Nkoua as Personal Representative of the President for Political Affairs on the same day.\\"Vie des institutions - Le Conseil économique et social doté d'un nouveau bureau\\", Les Dépêches de Brazzaville, 22 September 2009 . In the July-August 2012 parliamentary election, Gongarad Nkoua was re-elected to the National Assembly as the UPDP candidate in Ngo constituency. He won the seat in the second round of voting, receiving 56.46% of the vote against an independent candidate, Jean-Félix Nkoué.\\"Résultats du deuxième tour des élections législatives\\" , La Semaine Africaine, 11 August 2012 . As the oldest deputy elected in the 2012 election, Gongarad Nkoua had the traditional honor of presiding over the National Assembly when it met on 5 September 2012 to elect its bureau for the new parliamentary term.Roger Ngombé, \\"Assemblée nationale : Justin Koumba reconduit à la présidence\\", Les Dépêches de Brazzaville, 5 September 2012 .Cyr Armel Yabbat-Ngo, \\"Session inaugurale de la 13ème législature de l’assemblée nationale : Sans surprise, Justin Koumba de nouveau au perchoir\\", La Semaine Africaine, 7 September 2012 . Speaking on the occasion, he reflected on the role and the responsibilities of deputies: \\"As parliamentarians, you are the link between the local and the national level, between the national and the global level. ... When I look at this chamber, I always realize that behind every elected deputy there are thousands of Congolese. It is our honor to represent and respect everyone regardless of their vote and their political beliefs. Our mandate requires us to never lose touch with our fellow citizens.\\" Standing as a UPDP candidate, Gongarad Nkoua was elected as a local councillor in Ngo in the September 2014 local elections.\\"Résultats des élections locales du 28 septembre 2014\\", ADIAC, 6 October 2014 .

Roller is known as one of the most decorated athletes in his state's history, a standout at Bixby High School while competing in wrestling, baseball, and football, lettering in each, and was the Tulsa World's 1998 Male Athlete of the Year. In baseball, he was a two-time letterman, playing shortstop, hitting in the lead-off spot, and was twice selected for the All-Metro Honorable Mention Team. In football, Roller played quarterback, running back, free safety, and was a three-time letterman. Roller was selected to play in the Jim Thorpe All-Star Game and was also selected as the 1997 Oklahoma Football Coaches Association All-Star Running Back. In wrestling, Roller was his high school's first four-time state champion and was twice selected as the Most Outstanding Wrestler at the state tournament. He compiled a 141-3 record and was selected for the All-State team, being voted the Most Outstanding Wrestler at the All-State match. He was also an Asics First Team All-American and received the Junior Hodge Award which is given to the nation's most dominant high school wrestler. Roller also received the Dave Schultz award which is for academic and athletic excellence, as he was also his class' salutatorian and a member of the National Honor Society. He received a scholarship to continue competing in wrestling for Oklahoma State University and was a three-time NCAA All-American, three-time Academic All-American, and Big 12 Champion. Roller was also the captain of the 2003 NCAA Championship team, and earned a bachelor's degree in psychology. He later earned his master's degree from the school while working as an assistant coach, earning three NCAA championships. ==Mixed martial arts careerEarly career=== Roller made his professional mixed martial arts debut in 2007 and compiled a record of 3-1 before being signed by the WEC. ===World Extreme Cagefighting=== Roller made his WEC debut defeating Todd Moore at WEC 35 via submission (guillotine choke) at 3:00 of the first round. This was followed by another first round submission win over previously undefeated Mike Budnik at WEC 37. Roller faced future UFC Lightweight Champion Benson Henderson on April 5, 2009 at WEC 40. He lost the fight via TKO due to punches in the first round. Roller rebounded from his loss to Henderson defeating former Lightweight title challenger Marcus Hicks via unanimous decision on August 9, 2009 at WEC 42. Roller defeated Danny Castillo on November 18, 2009 at WEC 44 via submission in the third round, earning Submission of the Night honors. Roller faced Anthony Njokuani on April 24, 2010 at WEC 48. He won the fight via first-round rear-naked choke submission. Roller faced Anthony Pettis on August 18, 2010 at WEC 50. Following a back and forth battle, the visibly exhausted Roller was submitted by Pettis via triangle choke with seconds left in the bout. Roller faced former WEC Lightweight Champion Jamie Varner on December 16, 2010 at WEC 53. He won via submission in the first round. ===Ultimate Fighting Championship=== In October 2010, World Extreme Cagefighting merged with the Ultimate Fighting Championship. As part of the merger, all WEC fighters were transferred to the UFC. Roller defeated Thiago Tavares via second round KO on March 3, 2011 at UFC Live: Sanchez vs. Kampmann, earning Knockout of the Night honors. In his second UFC fight, Roller faced Melvin Guillard on July 2, 2011 at UFC 132. He lost the fight via KO in the first round. Roller faced TJ Grant on October 1, 2011 at UFC on Versus 6. Roller lost via controversial armbar submission in round 3. Roller faced Michael Johnson on January 28, 2012 at UFC on Fox 2, replacing an injured Cody McKenzie. Roller lost via unanimous decision (29-28, 29-28, 29-28). Roller defeated John Alessio on July 7, 2012 at UFC 148 via unanimous decision. Roller was expected to face Jacob Volkmann on September 1, 2012 at UFC 151. However, after UFC 151 was cancelled, Roller/Volkmann was rescheduled and instead took place on October 5, 2012 at UFC on FX 5. Roller was taken down early in the fight and eventually submitted via rear naked choke. Shortly after the event Shane announced his retirement from mixed martial arts competition. ==Personal life== Shane is married and the couple have four children. Roller's three brothers, Keith, Mike, and Jimmy all played sports at the collegiate level. Keith played football, while Mike and Jimmy wrestled. ==Mixed martial arts record== -  Loss  align=center 11–7  Jacob Volkmann  Submission (rear naked choke)  UFC on FX: Browne vs. Bigfoot   align=center 1  align=center 2:38  Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States  -  Win  align=center 11–6  John Alessio  Decision (unanimous)  UFC 148   align=center 3  align=center 5:00  Las Vegas, Nevada, United States  -  Loss  align=center 10–6  Michael Johnson  Decision (unanimous)  UFC on Fox: Evans vs. Davis   align=center 3  align=center 5:00  Chicago, Illinois, United States  -  Loss  align=center 10–5  TJ Grant  Submission (armbar)  UFC Live: Cruz vs. Johnson   align=center 3  align=center 2:12  Washington, D.C.

It is the first of five movements in Noble's \\"Indian Suite\\" (Cherokee, Comanche War Dance, Iroquois, Seminole, and Sioux Sue). ==Structure== The composition has a 64-bar AABA construction. The A-section harmony is straightforward by the standards of 1930s songs, but the B-section is more sophisticated. This is because \\"it cadences (via ii-7–V7–I progressions) into the keys of B Major, A Major and G Major before moving toward the B tonic.\\" ==Recordings== \\"Cherokee\\" has been recorded over the years by many jazz musicians and singers. Charlie Barnet and His Orchestra's 1939 version reached No. 15 on the pop charts; he later re- recorded it in Hi Fi stereo for Everest Records in 1958. It was later recorded by Charlie Parker, the Count Basie Orchestra, Duke Ellington, Sarah Vaughan (1955), Dakota Staton (1958), Art Tatum and Keely Smith. The song has also been covered as an instrumental by Bud Powell (1950), Clifford Brown, Don Byas, Stan Getz, Lionel Hampton, Harry James, Christian McBride, Chet Atkins, Kamasi Washington on his album The Epic (2015), and by Johnny Smith on his album Moonlight in Vermont. The difficulty of improvising on the harmony of the B-section meant that many early soloists avoided improvising during it. ==Influence== Charlie Parker used this song for the basis of his 1945 composition \\"Ko-Ko\\". While playing \\"Cherokee\\", he said that \\"I found that by using the higher intervals of a chord as a melody line and backing them with appropriately related changes, I could play the thing I'd been hearing.\\"Shapiro, Nat, and Hentoff, Nat.

It was the last Tibetan royal dynasty to rule in own name. The regime was founded by Karma Tseten, a low-born retainer of the prince of the Rinpungpa Dynasty and governor of Samdrubtsé (also called Shigatse) in Tsang (West-Central Tibet) since 1548. ==Superseding the Rinpungpa== During the 16th century Tibet was fragmented among rivaling factions, along religious as well as dynastic lines. The Phagmodrupa Dynasty lost any semblance of power after 1564 and its rival Rinpungpa was also unable to achieve unity. Among the traditions of Tibetan Buddhism, the Karma Kagyu school competed against the Gelug, which was headed by the Dalai Lama. According to tradition, Karma Tseten obtained a troop of horsemen by altering a document issued by his master, the Rinpungpa lord. He then raised the standard of rebellion in 1557 and managed to supersede the Rinpungpa by a surprise attack in 1565.Tsepon W. D. Shakabpa (1967), Tibet: A Political History. New Haven, p. 90. This was facilitated by the simmering discontent with the Rinpungpa among several vassals. Known as the Depa Tsangpa or Tsang Desi, he became the king of Upper Tsang and allied with Köncho Yenlak, the 5th Shamarpa of the Karma Kagyu. Wangchuk Dorje, 9th Karmapa Lama, met him on several occasions and transferred tutelary deities to the ruler. This was a ritually important act to legitimize the new regime. Karma Tseten also patronized the Nyingma, Sakya and Jonang sects. The rise of the dynasty should be seen against the anxiety for outside intervention in the deeply divided country. The alliance between the 3rd Dalai Lama and the Tumed leader Altan Khan (1578) likely aroused the fear of some aristocratic families in Ü-Tsang and of the non-Gelug schools. This motivated the Karmapa to seek protection from the Tsangpa rulers.B. Bogin (2014), 'The Red and yellow war: Dispatches from the field', in B. Bogin & A. Quintman (eds), Himalayan passages: Tibetan and Newar studies in honor of Hubert Decleer. Boston, p. 324. The new dynasty strove to keep Tibet free from the recurring Mongol incursions which plagued the land on several occasions in the late 16th and early 17th century.J. Gentry (2010), 'Representations of efficacy: The ritual expulsion of Mongol armies in the consilidation and expansion of the Tsang (Gtsang) Dynasty', in J.I. Cabezón (ed.), Tibetan ritual. Oxford, pp. 144-52. The further aim was to revive the glories of the old Tibetan Empire and create a peaceful and well-ordered Tsang.D. Templeman (2013), 'The 17th cent. gTsang rulers and their strategies of legitimation', p. 73 This was partly successful; the last remains of Rinpungpa authority vanished in 1590 as they were forced to capitulate their heartland Rong to Karma Tseten. There is nothing to suggest that the regime kept any relations with the declining Ming dynasty of China. ==Struggle against the Gelugpa== Our sources from this period are mainly concerned with religious affairs and do not disclose much about the administrative structure of the Tsangpa realm. The basis of their power is therefore still insufficiently understood. Nor is the history of Karma Tseten's closest successors well known, but in the early 17th century the dynasty is frequently mentioned as a competitor for power over Tibet. The family was generally opposed to the Gelugpa and Dalai Lamas, whose power meanwhile increased in Ü. The Tsangpa ruler Karma Tensung (or, in another account, his nephew Karma Phuntsok Namgyal) reacted by invading Ü from his base in Tsang in 1605 and attacking the Drepung and Sera Monasteries. 5,000 monks are said to have been massacred on this occasion.Ya Hanzhang (1994), Biographies of the Tibetan Spiritual Leaders Panchen Erdenis. Beijing, p. 26. The Tsangpa army expelled the Mongol troops that assisted the 4th Dalai Lama, himself a Mongol prince by birth. The Dalai Lama had to flee and the Tsangpa ruler was close to become the king of Tibet.J. Gentry (2010), pp. 151, 162-3. In 1612 and 1613, the Tsangpa ruler subjugated a number of local regimes in West Tibet: the Ngari Gyelpo, Lhopa and Changpa. There were also spectacular successes in the east. The new acquisitions included Dagpo in the far southeast, Phanyul (north of Lhasa) and Neu (southeast of Lhasa).D. Templeman (2008), Becoming Indian: A study of the life of the 16th-17th century Tibetan Lama Taranatha. PhD Thesis, Monash University. He was less successful against Bhutan, where his enemy, Ngawang Namgyal, the prince abbot of Ralung Monastery in Tsang and one of the reincarnations of the fourth Gyalwang Drukpa Kunkhyen Pema Karpo of the Drukpa Lineage, had taken refuge. ==Expansion and Mongol response== In 1618, the Tsangpa Gyelpo pushed further into Ü and defeated the local leaders of Kyishö and Tsal. By now Karma Phuntsok Namgyal was virtually the ruler of Central Tibet and was consecrated as such by Chöying Dorje, 10th Karmapa.G. Tucci (1949), Tibetan Painted Scrolls. Rome, Vol. II, p. 697. In the following year 1619, the West Tibetan kingdom of Mangyül Gungthang was conquered. In the next year again Karma Phuntsok Namgyal returned to Ü in order to eliminate the last possible obstacle to his authority. Nêdong, the seat of the impotent Phagmodrupa Dynasty, was besieged and forced to yield to his power. Tsang forces occupied the entire Yarlung Valley.O. Czaja, Medieval rule in Tibet. Wien, p. 314-5. The hegemony of Tsangpa was, however, only of a brief nature. Not least their position as an upstart family without aristocratic roots made their authority tenuous. After Yonten Gyatso's death, his successor, the 5th Dalai Lama (1617–1682), received help from the Mongols, who pushed into Ü in 1621. The new Tsangpa king Karma Tenkyong was defeated and besieged at Chakpori Hill by Lhasa, and his army only escaped annihilation through the intervention of the Panchen Lama. An agreement was made whereby the Gelugpa regained much of their former authority in Ü. The abbot of the important Drigung Monastery in Ü, allied to the Tsangpa, was abducted by the Tumed Mongols in 1623, which was a further blow. In retaliation Karma Tenkyong brought his troops to Ü and occupied the Lhasa region.O. Czaja (2013), pp. 317-8. The following years saw a lull in the fighting while both sides tried to attract allies. Karma Tenkyong sought the assistance of the Choghtu Mongols, and a troop under prince Arsalan invaded Tibet in 1635 in order to attack the Gelugpa positions. However, in the end Arsalan declined to actually support the Tsangpa, leading to an entirely unsatisfactory conclusion of the enterprise for Karma Tenkyong and the Karmapa and Shamarpa hierarchs.O. Czaja (2013), p. 322. At the same time, Karma Tenkyong was threatened by Ladakh in the west, although it never came to open warfare.L. Petech (1977), The Kingdom of Ladakh C. 950-1842 A.D. Roma, pp. 46-47. ==Triumph of the Dalai Lama== In 1641 the leader of the Khoshut Mongols of the Kokonor region, Güshi Khan, set out from his home area and attacked the king of Beri in Kham, who was a practitioner of the Bon religion and persecuted Buddhist lamas. Güshi Khan had been in contact with \\"the Great Fifth\\" since 1637 and was a major champion for his cause. After having defeated Beri, he proceeded to invade Tsang. Justification for this was found in the alliance between Beri and Tsang, which allegedly aimed at eradicating the Gelugpa. The Dalai Lama was opposed to a Mongol invasion which would have devastating effects on Central Tibet, but was not able to change the course of things. Güshi Khan's reputation as an invincible commander rendered resistance weak. The Tsangpa stronghold, Shigatse, was captured after a long and bloody siege in March 1642. Karma Tenkyong was taken prisoner with his foremost ministers and kept in custody in Neu near Lhasa. After a revolt by Tsangpa supporters in the same year, the incensed Güshi Khan ordered Karma Tenkyong placed in an oxhide bag and drowned in a river.Tsepon W.D, Shakabpa (1967), pp. 107-112; Ya Hanzhang (1994), pp. 39-41. Güshi Khan, who founded the Khoshut Khanate presented Ü, Tsang and part of East Tibet to the Dalai Lama to rule. In this way began the religious Ganden Phodrang regime that would last until 1950. ==List of rulers== * Karma Tseten 1565–1599 * Khunpang Lhawang Dorje c. 1582–1605/06 (son) * Karma Thutob Namgyal c. 1586–1610 (brother) * Karma Tensung 1599–1611 (brother) * Karma Phuntsok Namgyal 1611–1620 (son of Karma Thutob Namgyal) * Karma Tenkyong 1620–1642 (son) ==See also== * History of Tibet * List of rulers of Tibet * Sino-Tibetan relations during the Ming dynasty == References  Literature == * K.-H.

Forming part of his 1898 collection Wessex Poems and Other Verses, it is the most widely praised of his early poems. It is about the end of a relationship, and carries strong emotional appeal despite its \\"neutral tones\\". == Analysis == \\"Neutral Tones\\" by Thomas Hardy is very neutral in tone; its melancholic note is created by a narrator reflecting on the termination of a relationship. Throughout, a soothing yet depressing language illustrates this duality. Hardy uses a variety of techniques to highlight sadness and emotions in the narrator. In the first stanza the scene and atmosphere is set, \\"we stood by a pond that winter day\\".http://www.bartleby.com/121/8.html No harsh sounds are present and the sentence epitomizes the tranquility yet disheartening nature of the poem. In the second line we get even more of these very \\"neutral\\" monosyllabic words \\"the sun was white, as though chidden of God\\" in this sentence the poet's attempt to stay within his own themes are very explicit by the use of the adjective \\"white\\" to describe the sun, the sun normally represented by the color yellow and a symbol for happiness and life. The very dismal atmosphere is reinforced by the use of the alliteration of \\"L\\" creating a lazy yet unsatisfying tone. The further sibilance of \\"starving sod\\" creates a harsh sound, adding a further layer of hopelessness. The metaphor of the \\"few leaves\\" symbolizes the end of an era, hinting towards the dying of life. Yet, it is not life that died, but love. The next stanza explores deeper into the nature of their relationship: \\"Your eyes on me were as eyes that rove over tedious riddles of years ago.\\" This can be interpreted to mean the couple repeat the same fights without progress, the insignificance of their communication exposed through the tired and morbid undertone seen in lines such as \\"And some words played between us to and fro-\\". This shows fundamental flaws in their communication, making a meaningful relationship seem impossible. The first line of the third stanza, in describing her smile, contains a heart-wrenching juxtaposition. Normally a facial gesture associated with happiness and joy, a smile is described as \\"the deadest thing\\". This provokes strong emotion in the reader, as the cold causality of the gesture serves as reminder to the bitterness of the poem. This oxymoronic metaphor continues, having made an impression upon the reader; it is now described as only \\"alive enough to have the strength to die\\". This further enhances the emotional turmoil inside the reader, presenting a horrifying image of something that just has enough energy to die, without breaking \\"neutral tone\\". This is one of the reasons why this poem is so effective: distance and neutrality of its language serves as a perfect example of \\"less is sometimes more\\". Another interesting use of symbolism is the \\"ominous bird a-wing\\", a possible prolepsis to the final stanza, the ominous bird representing his now shattered trust, against an almost paganistic suggestion in \\"ominous\\". The fourth stanza is finally one of total despair; however this is done without breaking the neutral melancholic tone of the poem. The narrator begins using phrases like \\"love deceives\\", indicating an inner pain and turmoil yet to heal. He goes on to say that he was \\"shaped\\" by the \\"wrings with wrong\\", this alliteration shows how much mental anguish he has been through and we get to almost share his pain. The poem ends as it began, using neutral monosyllabic words. The change in the character becomes obvious, instead of referring to the sun as \\"white\\", he now refers to it as the \\"God-curst sun\\", reflecting the character's emotions changing from sadness to anger. The final line \\"And a pond edged with greyish leaves\\" echoes the pond the speaker recalls at the beginning. The fact that the poem ends with \\"a pond edged with grey leaves\\" makes it circuitous as it ends at the pond where the poem is set at the start. Also, the depressed mood of the poem reflects the pessimism shown by Hardy in much of his poetry work. This pessimism was caused by many things: the industrialization of Britain which meant that the traditional way of life in his country roots were lost; the expansion of the British empire which he opposed; his unhappy first marriage; and his fear and dislike of change. ==References External links == * Platonic view of the poem including general summary * Category:1898 poems Category:Poetry by Thomas Hardy Category:Victorian poetry ","title":"Neutral Tones"},{"id":"20547449","text":"The Basilicata regional election of 1995 took place on 23 April 1995.

In its most common usage, it is used for the period of time between 75,000 and 125,000 BP.Willman, H.B., and J.C. Frye, 1970, Pleistocene Stratigraphy of Illinois. Bulletin no. 94, Illinois State Geological Survey, Champaign, Illinois. This period of time is equivalent to all of Marine Isotope Stage 5 and the combined Eemian period and early part of the Weichselian glaciation in Europe. Less commonly, the Sangamonian Stage is restricted to the period between 122,000 and 132,000 BP, which is equivalent to Marine Oxygen Isotope Substage 5e and the Eemian period of Europe. It preceded the Wisconsinan (Wisconsin) Stage and followed the Illinoian Stage in North America. ==Definition== The Sangamonian Stage, originally the Sangamon interglacial stage, is defined on the basis of the Sangamon Soil, a paleosol, which is developed in contemporaneous colluvium and older glacial tills and loesses and overlain by Wisconsinan loesses or tills. Although originally described from water wells in northwestern Sangamon County, Illinois, the current type sections for the Sangamon Stage are the Rochester section in eastern Sangamon County and the Chapman section in Morgan County, Illinois. In the Rochester Section, the Sangamon Soil is developed in Sangamonian colluvial sediments, called “accretion gley”, that accumulated contemporaneously with the development of the Sangamon Soil. In the Rochester section, the Sangamon Soil is developed directly in Illinoian glacial till and overlain by Roxana Silt, the oldest of the two regional Wisconsinan loesses. ==Correlations== In its typical and broadest usage, the Sangamonian Stage is equivalent to all of Marine isotope stage 5 between 75,000 and 125,000 BP.McKay III, E.D., R.C.

Although it includes the same time span, the Sangamonian Stage (sensu lato) is not temporally equivalent to the Eemian in Europe. In its much less common usage, the Sangamonian Stage (sensu stricto) is equivalent to Marine Isotope Substage 5e and the Eemian. In case of this usage, Marine Isotope Substages 5a, 5b, 5c, and 5d are collectively referred to as the Eowisconsinan Stage.Richmond, G.M. and D.S. Fullerton, 1986, Summation of Quaternary glaciations in the United States of America, Quaternary Science Reviews. vol. 5, pp. 183-196. In its broadest sense (sensu lato), the Sangamonian Stage precedes the Wisconsinan (Wisconsin) Stage and follows the Illinoian Stage in North America.Willman, H.B., and J.C. Frye, 1970, Pleistocene Stratigraphy of Illinois. Bulletin no. 94, Illinois State Geological Survey, Champaign, Illinois. Research concerning the age and degree of development of the Sangamon Soil demonstrates that it actively developed, at the least, over all of Marine Isotope Stage 5, which is a period of time from 125,000 to 75,000 BP.Curry, B.B., and M.J.

Unlike Europe, the development of ice sheets in Canada was limited during Marine Isotope Substages 5b, 5c, and 5b and either completely disappeared or were greatly reduced in size during Marine Isotope Substage 5a.

Because of the continuous development of the Sangamonian Soil in the Midwest and the limited development of ice sheets in North America during this marine isotope stage, the Sangamonian Stage, unlike the Eemian in Europe, is regarded as encompassing all of Marine Isotope Stage 5. ==Dates== The start of the Sangamonian Stage is constrained by optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates obtained from fluvial deposits of the Pearl Formation and Illinoian glacial tills of the Glasford Formation, which fill an ancient and buried Mississippi River valley in north-central Illinois. The age of fluvial sediments overlying the youngest glacial till (Radner Member) of the Glasford Formation yield optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates that averaged 131,000 BP.McKay, E.D., 2007, Six Rivers, Five Glaciers, and an Outburst Flood: the Considerable Legacy of the Illinois River.

Elliott Avenue, Lafayette Street, and Waterloo Street in Detroit, Michigan. The district consists of three separate cemeteries: Mount Elliott Cemetery (Catholic, established 1841), Elmwood Cemetery (Protestant, established 1846), and the Lafayette Street Cemetery (Jewish, established 1850).Eastside Historic Cemetery District from Detroit1701.org The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. ==Mount Elliott Cemetery== Mount Elliott Cemetery Mount Elliott Cemetery is the oldest extant cemetery in the city of Detroit,Cecile Wendt Jensen, Detroit's Mount Elliott Cemetery, Arcadia Publishing, 2006, , preface and contains . It is located on Mount Elliott Avenue just north of Lafayette Street. ===History=== Detroit's Catholic community was originally heavily French in character. However, near the beginning of the 19th century, waves of immigration added other nationalities into the mix, notably Irish Catholics.Fern Freeman, Mt. Elliott Cemetery: A history, 1981 In time, these Irish Catholics departed from the French-speaking Ste. Anne's and established their own parish. By 1840, they decided they wanted their own cemetery. In 1841, the parish purchased of farmlandMount Elliott history: 1841 from the Mount Elliott website from the Leib farm for $400. The first burial in the cemetery occurred only twelve days after its establishment when Robert Elliott, an architect, judge, and founding member of the committee that created the cemetery, was laid to rest. He had been killed in a construction accident. The cemetery was christened \\"Mount Elliott\\" in his honor. A second parcel of land was purchased for the cemetery in 1865, and a third in 1881; this brought the size of the cemetery to its current .Silas Farmer, The History of Detroit and Michigan, S. Farmer & Co., 1884, pp. 53-54 A stone gateway into the cemetery was completed the same year. In 1869, remains from Detroit's Ste. Anne Cemetery were moved and re-interred at Mount Elliott. Among the remains moved was Colonel Jean François Hamtramck. ===Description=== Roads winding through the cemetery carry the names of religious leaders (Pope Pius Avenue, Bishop LeFevere Avenue and Place, and Bishop Borgess Avenue) or biblical themes (Calvary Avenue, Holy Cross Place, Trinity Avenue, and Resurrection Avenue). The entrance to Mt. Elliott Cemetery is through a stone gateway designed and built by Walter Schweikart in 1882 at a cost of $6,000. Schweikart also built the entrance to the nearby Elmwood cemetery. In 1872, Fireman's Fund bought large lots for $500 apiece in both Mt. Elliott and Elmwood Cemeteries for the purpose of burying firefighters. In 1889, the Fund erected a marker at the site for a cost of $2,965. ===Gravesites=== The following are some people buried in Mt.

Farmer & Co., 1884, p. 56 The first were purchased from the George Hunt farmHistory from the Historic Elmwood Cemerery using money from subscriptions in 1850. Over the years, additional land was purchased from the Hunt Farm and the neighboring D.C. Whitwood farm to increase the grounds to the current . A Gothic Revival chapel, designed by Albert and Octavius Jordan, was added in 1856. The limestone chapel blends into the natural ravine and landscaping. Gordon W. Lloyd designed the Gothic-inspired gatehouse in 1870. The 1856 chapel, which had fallen into disuse, was refurbished in the 1950s and is still used today. The chapel was extensively restored after a late 1900s fire. ===Description=== Elmwood Cemetery is one of the few places in modern Detroit where the \\"original\\" rolling terrain of the area can be seen. Parent Creek (renamed \\"Bloody Run\\" after the famous Indian battle) runs through the cemetery, serving as a focus of the landscape. Noted landscape designer Frederick Law Olmsted, inspired by the Mount Auburn Cemetery in Massachusetts, contributed to the redesign of the overall cemetery plan in 1891.Eric J. Hill, John Gallagher, American Institute of Architects Detroit Chapter, AIA Detroit, Wayne State University Press, 2002, , p. 254 The cemetery is also famous for its multiple monuments, creating a city in miniature.

Abraham Lincoln personally requested the hanging be delayed until the cases could be reviewed, but under pressure from advisors, he summarily decided that only rapists should be hanged.

The tournament underwent a name change in 1986, when it was titled the European Open until its discontinuation. It formed part of the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) Tour. When the WTA introduced the tiering format to its circuit, the event gradually moved up, from being a Tier V in 1988–1989, a Tier IV from 1990–1992, and a Tier III for its remaining years. The WTA announced that the tournament would return in Gstaad as a clay event on the 2016 Tour, replacing another clay court event held in Bad Gastein. Four Swiss players won the event: Viktorija Golubic in 2016 as well as Manuela Maleeva (who formerly represented Bulgaria) in 1991 won the singles, and Xenia Knoll (in 2016) as well as Christiane Jolissaint won the doubles, the latter on three occasions: 1983, 1984, and 1988.

Originally home to the Loftus Baronets the baronetcy being extinct since the death of the third Baronet in 1864. Mount Loftus near Goresbridge is a period property on 53 acres. The main house contains six-bedrooms and it also has an extensive range of outbuildings. The present owners are horse trainers and immersed in the busy country life of the area. When they bought the property, they completely refurbished the 11 stone-built stables and also created a range of guest accommodation for staff and visitors. As well as a gate lodge, there is a guest apartment - attached, but separate from the main house - an attractive looking coach-house and an apartment over one of the stables. A splendid set of entrance gates by William Turner of St Stephen's Green, Dublin can be seen on approach to the house. The house is impressive, it started out as the staff wing of an infinitely grander property. The original Mount Loftus was built in 1750 by the first Viscount Loftus. In 1906, that house was demolished and a more modest, although still grand house was built in its place. It was destroyed by fire in 1934 but the servants' wing was saved and was built up to become the present house. At the back of the house a set of granite steps, punctuated by pillars but now leading nowhere, are ghostly reminders of the property's past. Other grand features include a magnificent walled garden which has been redesigned by Irish landscape gardener Angela JupeAngela Jupe Garden Designer - http://www.angelajupe.ie/the-owner.html. There are a variety of stone outbuildings dotted around the land in varying states of repair and there is even one in the walled garden - this time a most unusual apple store. The house is very bright with uninterrupted views over the Barrow Valley as well as towards the Blackstairs Mountains.

LaTasha Arnt was charged with stabbing her husband to death on Incirlik Air Base in Turkey in May 2003. She was extradited to stand trial in federal court in California, and later she pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter. Also, Aaron Langston, a resident of Snowflake, Arizona, was formally charged with assaulting a fellow contractor in Iraq with a knife. Langston was indicted by a federal grand jury in Phoenix on March 1, 2007. He was sentenced to 26 months in federal prison for the offense. Steven Dale Green was successfully prosecuted under the MEJA for his participation in the rape and murder of an Iraqi girl, and the mass murder of her family. A private first class at the time of the killings, Green was honorably discharged just over two months after the incident due to a diagnosis of anti-social personality disorder. At that point his involvement in the crime had not yet come to the attention of the authorities. The federal district court ultimately sentenced him to five consecutive life sentences. While the death penalty was available, the jury was unable to unanimously agree on it. (Green died Feb 15, 2014 cause of death was ruled suicide by hanging.) Wednesday - 2/19/2014, 2:10pm ET BRETT BARROUQUERE Associated Press On April 13, 2015, four former employees of the private defense contractor Blackwater USA (now Academi) were convicted under the MEJA for the massacre of fourteen Iraqi civilians on September 16, 2007. Three of the defendants received sentences of thirty years, while the fourth, Nicholas Slatten, was sentenced to life imprisonment. The men were members of a Blackwater unit assigned to secure Nisoor square in central Baghdad when they opened fire on a crowd of unarmed civilians. In all, fourteen Iraqis were killed and seventeen were wounded. On August 4, 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit remanded the conviction of Nicholas Slatten for a retrial and held that the 30-year mandatory minimum sentences of the other three contractors constituted cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments and remanded their case for resentencing. ==References== Category:United States federal criminal legislation Category:United States federal defense and national security legislation Category:Extraterritorial jurisdiction ","title":"Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act"},{"id":"20547584","text":"Bruce Edwin Hines (born 7 November 1957, in Pomona, California) is a Major League Baseball coach. As a player, Hines was a switch hitter who primarily played second base. He attended Bonita High School in La Verne, California, and played college baseball for the University of La Verne. He was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in the 15th round of the 1979 amateur draft, but returned to La Verne where he was named First Team All-SCIAC in 1980. He was drafted by the San Diego Padres in the 18th round of the 1980 amateur draft, but his playing career peaked at the high-A level. He managed teams in the California/Anaheim/Los Angeles Angels and Oakland Athletics minor league systems, and worked as minor-league field coordinator for the Angels before being named the third base coach for the Seattle Mariners. On 19 October 2009, the Mariners announced Hines would be the only member of their coaching staff not retained for the following season. He then spent a few years as the Dodgers' minor league field coordinator. Off the field, Hines had a brief appearance in the 1996 film The Fan, in which he played an umpire who was presumably killed by the film's lead character. ==References * Player statistics and biographical information at The Baseball Cube Category:1957 births Category:California Angels coaches Category:Living people Category:Major League Baseball third base coaches Category:Minor league baseball managers Category:Sportspeople from Pomona, California Category:Seattle Mariners coaches Category:Grays Harbor Loggers players Category:San Jose Missions players Category:Utica Blue Sox players Category:Madison Muskies players ","title":"Bruce Hines"},{"id":"20547586","text":"NmVac4-A/C/Y/W-135 is the commercial name of the polysaccharide vaccine against the bacteria (specifically serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135) that causes Meningococcal meningitis. The product, by JN-International Medical Corporation, is designed and formulated to be used in developing countries for protecting populations during meningitis disease epidemics. Meningococcal meningitis is a bacterial infection caused by the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis, also known as meningococcus. The vaccine is made from bacterial capsular polysaccharides through fermentation of each individual serogroup of Neisseria meningitidis in bioreactors. After fermentation, the polysaccharides are purified, formulated, and lyophilized using preservatives and stabilizers to make a vaccine product. The vaccine cannot protect from other serogroups of N. meningitidis and cannot completely eliminate the chance of infection by these serogroups. ==Medical usesInitial vaccination of children=== Children two to ten years of age who are at high risk for meningococcal disease, especially those with certain chronic medical conditions and those who travel to or reside in countries with hyper-endemic or epidemic meningococcal disease. Although safety and efficacy of the vaccine have not been established in children younger than two years of age and under outbreak control, the unconjugated vaccine can be considered. Safety and efficacy of NmVac4 have not been established in children younger than 11 years of age; however, clinical studies in children 2–10 years of age have been recommended. ===Adolescents 11 years of age or older=== It is recommend that primary immunization against meningococcal disease with NmVac4 for all young adolescents at 11–12 years of age and all unvaccinated older adolescents at 15 years of age. Although NmVac4 is the preferred meningococcal vaccine in adolescents 11 years of age or older, NmVac4 is an acceptable alternative if the conjugated vaccine is unavailable. ===Adults=== College students who plan to live in dormitories receive primary immunization with NmVac4. Although the risk for meningococcal disease for is similar to 18–24 years of age that for the general population of similar age. The college students consider vaccination against meningococcal disease to reduce their risk for the disease and stated that college health-care providers should take a proactive role in providing information about meningococcal disease to students and their parents.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Meningococcal disease among college students: ACIP modifies recommendations for meningitis vaccination. Press release. 1999 Oct 20 Routine primary immunization against meningococcal disease is recommended for most adults live in endemic areas and planning to travel such areas Although NmVac4 is the preferred meningococcal vaccine in adults 55 years of age or younger, NmVac4 is an acceptable alternative for adults in this age group if the conjugated vaccine is unavailable. Since safety and efficacy of NmVac4 in adults older than 55 years of age have not been established to date, NmVac4 should be used for primary immunization in this group. ===Medical staff and laboratory personnel=== Health care workers and laboratory personnel who are routinely exposed to isolates of N. meningitidis are recommended to receive routine immunization against meningococcal disease. Laboratory personnel and medical staff are at increased risk of exposure to N. meningitidis or to people with meningococcal disease. Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) recommendations regarding immunization of health-care workers state that routine vaccination of health-care personnel is recommended. Any individual 11–55 years of age who wishes to reduce their risk of meningococcal disease may receive NmVac4 as can those older than 55 years of age. Under certain circumstances if unvaccinated health-care personnel cannot get vaccinated and who have intensive contact with oropharyngeal secretions of infected patients and who do not use proper precautions should receive anti-infective prophylaxis against meningococcal infection (i.e., 2-day regimen of oral rifampin or a single dose of intramuscular ceftriaxone or a single dose of oral ciprofloxacin). ===Military recruits=== Because the risk of meningococcal disease is increased among military recruits, all military recruits routinely receive primary immunization against the disease. US military recruits should receive routine vaccinations while in service in endemic disease areas ===Travelers=== Only Saudi Arabia requires that travelers to their country for the annual Hajj and Umrah pilgrimage have a certificate of vaccination against meningococcal disease issued not more than 3 years and not less than 10 days before arrival in Saudi Arabia. Travelers to or residents of areas where N. meningitidis is highly endemic or epidemic are at risk of exposure should receive primary immunization against meningococcal disease. Peaks of meningococcal disease (usually caused by serogroup A or C) occur regularly during the dry season (i.e., December through June) in that portion of sub- Saharan Africa known as the \\" meningitis belt,\\" which extends from Mali to Ethiopia. In addition, major epidemics occur every 8–12 years. Travelers to these high-risk areas may be at risk of meningococcal disease and many of these countries do not have established means for surveillance and timely reporting of epidemics Updates available from CDC website https://www.cdc.gov/travel/yb/index.htm). The vaccine (containing serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135) is currently required by Saudi Arabia for pilgrims visiting Mecca for the Hajj or for the Umrah.Requirement from Saudi govt. for the umrah and hajj: http://new.wales.gov.uk/dphhp/publication/protection/immunisation/hajj/english.pdf?lang=en ===HIV-infected individuals=== HIV-infected individuals are likely to be at increased risk for meningococcal disease; HIV-infected individuals who wish to reduce their risk of meningococcal disease may receive primary immunization against meningococcal disease. Although efficacy of NmVac4 has not been evaluated in HIV-infected individuals to date, HIV-infected individuals 11–55 years of age may receive primary immunization with the conjugated vaccine. Vaccination against meningococcus does not decrease CD4+ T cell counts or increase viral load in HIV-infected individuals and there has been no evidence that the vaccines adversely affect survival.Janoff EN, Tasker S, Opstad NL et al. Impact of immunization of recent HIV-1 seroconverters. Proceedings of ICAAC New Orleans 1996. Abstract No. I60Kroon FP, Bruisten S, Swieten PV et al.

Abstract No. I61Tasker SA, Treanor J, Rossetti R et al. Whole virion influenza vaccine has protective efficacy in the setting of HIV infection. Proceedings of ICAAC New Orleans 1996. Abstract No. I88 ===Close contacts of invasive meningococcal disease=== Protective levels of anticapsular antibodies are not achieved until 7–14 days following administration of a meningococcal vaccine, vaccination cannot prevent early onset disease in these contacts and usually is not recommended following sporadic cases of invasive meningococcal disease. ===Disease outbreak control=== NMVAC-4 can be used for large-scale vaccination programs when an outbreak of meningococcal disease occurs in Africa and other regions of the world. Whenever sporadic or cluster cases or outbreaks of meningococcal disease occur in the US, chemoprophylaxis is the principal means of preventing secondary cases in household and other close contacts of individuals with invasive disease. NMVAC-4 rarely may be used as an adjunct to chemoprophylaxis, but only in situations where there is an ongoing risk of exposure (e.g., when cluster cases or outbreaks occur) and when a serogroup contained in the vaccine is involved. It is important that clinicians promptly report all cases of suspected or confirmed meningococcal disease to local public health authorities and that the serogroup of the meningococcal strain involved be identified. The effectiveness of mass vaccination programs depends on early and accurate recognition of outbreaks. When a suspected outbreak of meningococcal disease occurs, public health authorities will then determine whether mass vaccinations (with or without mass chemoprophylaxis) is indicated and delineate the target population to be vaccinated based on risk assessment. ===Other=== Inherited properdin deficiency also is related with an increased risk of contracting meningococcal disease. People with a functional or anatomic lack of spleen function may not efficiently clear encapsulated Neisseria meningitidis from the bloodstream and are at increased risk of infection. Persons with other conditions associated with immunosuppression also may be at increased risk of developing meningitis disease. People with component deficiencies in the final common complement pathway (C3, C5–C9) are more susceptible to N. meningitidis infection than complement- satisfactory people, and it was estimated that the risk of infection is 7,000 times higher in such individuals. In addition, complement component-deficient population frequently experience frequent meningococcal disease, since their immune response to natural infection may be less complete than that of complement none-deficient people. ==Contraindications== The safety of the vaccine in pregnant women has not been established. The safety of this vaccine in the people with chronic medical conditions has not been established. ==PharmacodynamicsFormulation=== The vaccine contains 50 mcg of purified polysaccharide for each of the serogroups (A, C, Y, and W135) in a lyophilized form. The active pharmaceutical ingredient of the C, Y, and W-135 serogroups is sialic acid. Phosphate is an API for serogroup A. Lactose is used as a stabilizer. As a precautionary measure, mercury is not used in the vaccine formulation. The vaccine comes in 10 and 50-dose vials and is reconstituted using saline diluent.

O-acetylated polysaccharides influence the immunogenicity of meningococcal vaccines. It is well known that O acetylated at carbon 3 in serogroup A polysaccharide induces higher Serum Bactericidal Antibody (SBA) detectable anti- serogroup A antibodies in human. Serogroups C, W-135, and Y also have various degrees of O-acetylation, whereas, none O-acetylated of these serogroups can also produce protective immunogenicity against the disease. WHO/ICH requirement of O-acetylation positive for serogroups C, W-135, and Y is disadvantage for the vaccine manufacturers in the selection of high yielding polysaccharide producing O-acetylation groups. ===Chemical structures of polysaccharides vaccines=== Image:MenA.jpg  Fig.1 N. meningitidis group A Image:MenC.jpg  Fig.2 N. meningitidis group C Image:MenY.jpg  Fig.3 N. meningitidis group Y Image:MenW135.jpg  Fig.4 N. meningitidis group W-135 ==ReferencesNotes== *Product Brochure *Vaccine Clinical Trials multimedia presentation of clinical trial within the Meningitis Belt of sub-Saharan Africa. * http://www.jn-vaccines.org/NmVac4.pdf Category:Meningococcal vaccines Category:Subunit vaccines ","title":"NmVac4-A/C/Y/W-135"},{"id":"20547601","text":"Thomas Brock (died 23 March 1745) was the second of four Opperhoveds to run the Danish Gold Coast in 1745.

The difference is that no abnormalities in urine or serum porphyrin is noted on laboratories. Pseudoporphyria has been reported in patients with chronic kidney failure treated with hemodialysis and in those with excessive exposure to ultraviolet A (UV-A) by tanning beds. ==Presentation== Pseudoporphyria is clinically characterized by increased skin fragility; erythema; and the appearance of tense bullae and erosions on sun-exposed skin, which are identical to those seen in patients with PCT. However, a clinical pearl that may prove helpful in differentiating between pseudoporphyria and PCT is that the classic features of hypertrichosis, hyperpigmentation, and sclerodermoid changes found with PCT are unusual with pseudoporphyria. A second clinical pattern of pseudoporphyria has a similar presentation to erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP), an autosomal dominant porphyria resulting from a reduced activity of ferrochelatase. In contrast to PCT, EPP usually begins in childhood with a history of photosensitivity, often described as a burning sensation immediately after sunlight exposure. Clinically, EPP is characterized by erythema, edema, shallow scars, and waxy induration of the skin, particularly on the face. Pseudoporphyria that clinically mimics EPP has been described almost exclusively in children taking naproxen for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Naproxen-induced pseudoporphyria seems to have a dimorphic presentation with the PCT-like pattern more often seen in the adult population and the EPP-like pattern more commonly seen in children, although some overlap has been documented. ===Race=== Although pseudoporphyria has no predilection toward any one race, it has been shown that fair-skinned children who are highly prone to sunburn are more likely to develop naproxen-induced pseudoporphyria than those children with skin types III or higher. Wallace et al. demonstrated that even in the absence of a history of blistering, children with light skin and blue or green eyes are at an increased risk of developing shallow scars on the face while taking naproxen. ==Causes== Pseudoporphyria can be induced by a wide range of medications, excessive UV-A exposure, and hemodialysis. One frequently reported drug is naproxen. A frequent source of UV-A exposure is tanning booths. As recognition of pseudoporphyria increases and the number of new medications expands, the list of etiologic agents associated with pseudoporphyria will most likely continue to grow. Agents associated with pseudoporphyria are as follows:Suarez SM, Cohen PR, DeLeo VA. Bullous photosensitivity to naproxen: \\"pseudoporphyria\\". Arthritis Rheum. Jun 1990;33(6):903-8 * Propionic acid derivatives (NSAIDs) - naproxen, diflunisal, ketoprofen, oxaprozin, mefenamic acid, rofecoxib * Ketone NSAID-nabumetone * Antibiotics - nalidixic acid, tetracycline, oxytetracycline, ampicillin- sulbactam, cefepime, fluoroquinolones (M Poh, personal communication, June 1999) * Antifungals - voriconazole * Diuretics - furosemide, chlorthalidone, butamide, triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide * Antiarrhythmics - amiodarone * Chemotherapy - 5-fluorouracil * Immunosuppressants - cyclosporine * Sulfones - dapsone * Vitamins - brewers' yeast, pyridoxine * Vitamin A derivatives - etretinate, isotretinoin * Muscle relaxants - carisoprodol/aspirin * Nonsteroidal antiandrogens - flutamide * Other - hemodialysis, excessive UV-A, cola, oral contraceptive pills (levonorgestrel and ethinylestradiol), narrowband UV-B phototherapy (rarely) ==Pathophysiology== The precise pathophysiologic mechanism of pseudoporphyria is not fully understood. Some drugs, especially non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, can trigger pseudoporphyria in the presence of ultraviolet light. The pathophysiology of pseudoporphyria associated with hemodialysis has not been fully explained. Aluminum hydroxide has been implicated in hemodialysis-associated pseudoporphyria. Aluminum hydroxide is found in dialysis solution and has been shown to produce a porphyrialike disorder after long-term administration in rats. ==DiagnosisTreatment== Sun avoidance, avoidance of tanning booths, and usage of broad spectrum sunscreen that blocks both UVA and UVB. Identification and avoidance of the offending drug. == Frequency == Although fewer than 100 cases are documented in English language literature, pseudoporphyria is most likely underreported in the literature because it is only a symptom of some other affliction, e.g. side effect of medicine or symptom of liver problems. As the symptoms of pseudoporhphyra have other names, those symptoms are mentioned. The rarity of porphyria in modern times also makes the use of the term pseudoporphyria obscure. ==History== A careful history is of utmost importance when the diagnosis of pseudoporphyria is being considered. A personal and family history of hepatitis, porphyria, or photosensitivity disorder must be sought. Although a genetic factor has not been considered in pseudoporphyria, one case of monozygotic twins developing pseudoporphyria after excessive UV-A exposure from long-term tanning bed use has been documented. The patient should be thoroughly questioned regarding any symptoms of connective tissue disorder, which may be the underlying pathology of the photosensitivity. Recent reports suggest that a connective tissue disorder may be a predisposing factor in patients using nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) who develop pseudoporphyria. ==References External links == Category:Skin conditions resulting from errors in metabolism ","title":"Pseudoporphyria"},{"id":"20547801","text":"Amanullinic acid is a cyclic nonribosomal peptide.

Macdonald had previously been editor at Partisan Review from 1937 to 1943, but after falling out with its publishers, quit to start politics as a rival publication,TIME April 4, 1994 Volume 143, No. 14 – \\"Biographical sketch of Dwight Macdonald\\" by John Elson (Accessed 4 December 2008) first on a monthly basis and then as a quarterly. politics published essays on politics and culture and included among its contributors James Agee, John Berryman, Bruno Bettelheim, Paul Goodman, C. Wright Mills, Mary McCarthy, Marianne Moore, Irving Howe, Daniel Bell, Hannah Arendt. The journal reflected Macdonald's interest in European culture. He used politics to introduce US readers to the thinking of the French philosopher Simone Weil, publishing several articles by her, including \\"A Poem of Force\\", her reflections on the Iliad.Moulakis,Athanasios. Simone Weil and the Politics of Self-Denial Translated by Ruth Hein. University of Missouri Press, 1998 (pp. 2-3) He also printed work by Albert Camus. Another European, the Italian political and literary critic Nicola Chiaromonte, was also given space in the journal. politics was also Macdonald's vehicle for his repeated and energetic attacks against Henry Wallace and his Progressive Party campaign for President.\\"Dwight Macdonald: Godfather of One-Editor Journals\\" by Rene Wadlow(Accessed 4 December 2008) In a letter to Philip Rahv at the end of December 1943, George Orwell mentioned that Macdonald had written asking him to contribute to his forthcoming journal.Orwell, Sonia and Angus, Ian (eds.). The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell Volume 3: As I Please (1943–1945) (Penguin) Orwell had replied telling him he might \\"do something 'cultural'\\" but not 'political' as he was already writing his \\"London Letters\\" to Partisan Review. In his \\"As I Please\\" article for the 16 June 1944 issue of Tribune, George Orwell recommended politics. He stated that he disagreed with its policy but admired \\"its combination of highbrow political analysis with intelligent literary criticism.\\" He went on to add that there were no monthly or quarterly magazines in England \\"to come up to\\" the American ones, of which there were several. Macdonald, in an editorial comment for the November 1944 issue of politics referred to a letter from Orwell which cast interesting light on the 'russification' of English political thought over the last two years. Orwell had read the May issue's review of Harold Laski's Faith, Reason and Civilisation and mentioned that the Manchester Evening News, the evening edition of the Manchester Guardian, had refused to print his own review because of its anti-Stalin implications. Despite considering the book \\"pernicious tripe\\", Orwell had praised the author for being \\"aware that the USSR is the real dynamo of the Socialist movement in this country and everywhere else.\\", but criticized him for shutting his eyes to \\"purges, liquidations\\", etc. Macdonald pointed out that the fact that such a review should be considered \\"too hot\\" shows how much the feats of the Red Army had misled the English public opinion about Russia. He added that the \\"English liberal press had been far more honest about the Moscow Trials than our own liberal journals\\" and that Trotsky had been able to write in the Guardian. == Dwight Macdonald: Culture as politics – and politics as culture == As a prototypical \\"one-man magazine\\", politics bore the sensibility and characteristic preoccupations of its founding, and sole, editor, the literary and polemical journalist Dwight Macdonald (1906–1982), whose cantankerous past in the face of institutional authority of all kinds furnished a fitting prologue to his six-year tenure in the editor's chair. After his undergraduate years at Yale – during which he gained early notoriety for his critique in the student newspaper of William Lyon Phelps, a pillar of the university's English faculty, and a lecturer and media figure with a national following – and a brief stint in the Executive Training Squad at the R.H. Macy department-store company, Macdonald landed a position as a writer and associate editor in 1929 at Fortune, the business monthly launched the year of the American stock market crash by Henry Luce, a Yale alumnus eight years Macdonald's senior whose stable of iconic magazines had begun in 1923 with Time. Exposure to the many captains of industry whose works and ways he profiled, set against the deepening Depression, sharpened in him a disdain for capitalism which made common cause with an elitist, aristocratic artistic sensibility that admired the classical European past as a sustaining and shaming foil to what he saw as the cultural degradations attendant upon the ascendancy of mass society. As a result, much of Macdonald's outwardly political criticism would take puckish aim at one or another of the stylistic infelicities, whether verbal or in manners, of the reigning pundits and politicians of the day, along with a critical tendency, somewhat like that of an earlier journalistic-literary \\"rebel in defense of tradition\\"Wreszin, Michael. A Rebel in Defense of Tradition: The Life and Politics of Dwight Macdonald. New York: Basic Books, 1994. (to borrow the title of Macdonald's biographer Michael Wreszin), H.L. Mencken, more characteristically negative in tenor than constructive, programmatic or partisan – Mencken's claim that \\"one horse-laugh is worth ten thousand syllogisms\\" might well have been Macdonald's own.And it was no accident, to speak after the old-Marxist schema, that one whose satiric wit would often take the form of stylistic parody of his antagonists in both politics (e.g., Henry Wallace) and culture (the formulaic style of Time and others among what Macdonald called the \\"Lucepapers\\") would eventually, as of 1960, get round to editing one of the best-regarded collections of its kind, Parodies: An Anthology from Chaucer to Beerbohm – And After. Upon leaving Fortune in 1936, after a dispute over his epic four-part profile of U.S. Steel one of whose crescendoes was an epigram from Lenin on imperialism as the highest stage of capitalism, he immersed himself in the works of Marx, Lenin and Trotsky, a schooling which, against the backdrop of the Moscow Trials and the bitter divisions over their authenticity across the American left intelligentsia, led him to side with the Trotskyist faction against the Stalinists.In which political opposition style, again, shared center stage: \\"On the evidence of Stalin's barbarous oratorical style alone, one could deduce the bureaucratic inhumanity and the primitiveness of modern Soviet society.\\" Quoted in Geoffrey Wheatcroft, \\"From Trotsky to Midcult: In Search of Dwight Macdonald.\\" New York Observer, March 27, 2006. The New York social critic Paul Goodman, whose early essays in politics seeded his flowering into mainstream fame twenty years later, famously asserted that Macdonald \\"thinks with his typewriter\\", a restless, perpetually self-revising (and, often enough in rueful retrospect, self-mocking) quality that saw Macdonald studding the later book versions of his magazine essays with a sort of after-the-fact Greek chorus of second thoughts, self-recriminations and liberal, as it were, doses of l'esprit de l'escalier, that lent his writing a quality one criticPaul Berman in The New Republic, September 12, 1994: \\"The habit of heckling his own opinions was a main element in Macdonald's prose style, too. He was always posting footnotes or intruding parentheses into his own sentences in order to add a second point of view, normally quite skeptical of the first. You could almost imagine that 'Dwight Macdonald' was actually two persons: a Macdonald from Yale who was urbane, relaxed, witty and intelligent, and a second Macdonald from Yale who was even more urbane, relaxed and so forth. Delmore Schwartz's judgment was this: 'antagonism for its own sake is his appetite and neurosis, and none of his political predictions come true, but he is a master of expository prose.' And the source of that mastery was, I think, the doubleness in his approach. Macdonald No. 1 expressed judgments; Macdonald No. 2 judged expressions; and the writing came out stereophonic.\\" labeled \\"stereophonic.\\" === The Partisan Review prelude === Macdonald spent the years from 1937 to 1943 as an associate editor at Partisan Review, among the most famous of 20th-century American little magazines, founded as a Communist journal in 1933 but wrested four years later by a dissident faction led by its to-be veteran co-editors Philip Rahv and William Phillips, a journal synonymous with those \\"New York intellectuals\\" wedded equally to an independent radicalism in politics and the modernist avant-garde in literature. Macdonald's steadfast neutrality over the Second World War put him increasingly at odds with his fellow editors, and with much of left opinion following first the attack by Hitler upon Russia and then by the Japanese upon Pearl Harbor affording the Americans, along with Hitler's declaration of war upon the United States in turn, a casus belli unto the larger conflict, prompting him to resign from Partisan Review at the end of 1943, and to launch politics as a vehicle for his antiwar, pacifist, \\"third way\\" perspectives, arising from the belief that the developing crises would trigger soon or late an international worker's movement, socialist in form, equally bent on sweeping away both the capitalist status quo in the west and the Communist dictatorship usurping the revolutionary birthright in the Russian sphere. == Allied conduct of the Second World War == As a self-described pacifist and opponent of American entry into the Second World War, Macdonald in the early numbers of his magazine tracking the final year and a half of the war found much to criticize: the cynicism of Allied war aims, the bombing of civilian populations,'Gallicus' (pseud.), \\"Terror in the Air\\", politics, November 1945, pp. 338-342. the betrayal by the Russians of the Polish resistance in the wake of the crushing of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising,\\"Warsaw\\", an editorial whose grim title in Gothic script between black borders preceded its opening text on the cover of politics for October 1944, pp. 257-259. the internment of Japanese-Americans, racial segregation in the American armed forces, the sentimental belief of the \\"liblabs\\" – Macdonald's term of parodist art for the broad liberal and labor coalition across the Democratic party and the left intelligentsia – that the winning of the war would issue in the triumph of the \\"Common Man\\" and a \\"More Abundant Future for All\\" (parodic scare-capitals were among Macdonald's standard craftsman's tools), and the punitive ascription of collective guilt to civilian populations for the crimes and war policies of the governments to which they were subject. === Collective guilt === In a signature essay in the March 1945 issue of politics, \\"The Responsibility of Peoples\\", also issued as a pamphlet, Macdonald took up this latter subject at great length,Dwight Macdonald, \\"The Responsibility of Peoples\\", politics, March 1945, pp. 82 et. seq.; issue for March 1945 missing from archive at Unz.org. and extended into follow-up debates in the issues for May 1945 and July 1945.George Anthony, Solomon F. Bloom, Louis Clair, Gordon H. Clough, Jim Cork, Sebastian Franck, and Dwight Macdonald, \\"The Responsibility of Peoples: Further Discussion\\", politics, July 1945, pp. 203-204, 205, 206-209; issue for May 1945 missing from archive at Unz.org. In an editorial item in politics for April of that year, Macdonald took aim at the collective-guilt mentality as embodied in one of his favorite targets among liberal intellectuals, from which the passage below affords a prime sample of his wry, satiric style: :\\"The German people have let Max Lerner down. There is no other way to put it --they have failed him and damn near busted his big progressive heart. It seems that Lerner, all dressed up in his War Correspondent's Uniform (see cut), was scooting along behind the advancing Ninth Army in his jeep when he came across a large group of German civilians. 'It was a drizzly afternoon,' he writes (P.M., March 4), 'and they were clustered under a cement shed open at one end. There was a woman with a several-weeks old baby, and there was an old man of 87. Most were men and women in their middle 40's and above, with a scattering of children. They were almost all farmers.' They had been hiding in cellars for three days while American guns destroyed their village in the course of 'the war that they themselves had brought on.' (How 'they themselves had brought it on' not specified.) :\\"Descending from his jeep, Lerner asked them: Are You Guilty? He records no reply from the baby, but the others answer that they had never trusted or liked Hitler, that they had always considered the Nazis criminals, and that they were Catholics and hence opposed for religious reasons to Hitler's policies. Why then, asks Lerner with that imploacable logic he shows when he is baiting some one who can’t hit back, Why then did you allow the Nazis to do these things? 'With one accord they answered that they had yielded to force and to force alone. But this doesn’t go down with Lerner; he points out to the shivering, bomb-dazed farmers that the people of France, Belgium, Poland, and Russia didn’t yield to German force; so why did they?* *[According to reliable sources, the above countries were all engaged in a war against Germany.] This was a blockbuster: 'They were silent.' (Different interpretations might be put on this silence.) Even after this, some of these simple peasants apparently didn’t understand the kind of animal they were dealing with (see cut); they had been accustomed, after all, to the civilized society of hogs. So they asked Lerner to put in a good word for their local police chief, who had used his official post (probably at the risk of his neck) 'to shield them from the severity of the Nazi regime.' We will omit Lerner's reaction to that one. :\\"'I came away heartsick and discouraged,' writes Lerner. The crime of these people was cowardice and moral callousness rather than active criminality.... Nowhere did I find the moral strength to face the fact of guilt. Only protests that they were not responsible for what had happened.' Even the baby apparently lacked a sense of responsibility for Hitler, which shows how deeply ingrained this moral callousness is in the German national character. :\\"However, Lerner thinks there may be 'better material among workers than among the farmers and middle- class.' (You can’t keep a P.M. editor discouraged for long.)...\\"Macdonald, \\"Comment: Max Lerner and the German People\\", politics, April 1945, pp. 102-103.  Japanophobia and the military mind  Other ongoing interventions by Macdonald calling attention to the divers attributions of collective guilt to enemy civilians during wartime, if on rather a more exalted register of jingoist bloodthirstiness, included an essay, \\"My Favorite General\\", whose treatment of its iconic lead subject - :\\"My favorite general is George S. Patton Jr. Some of our generals, like Stilwell, have developed a sly ability to simulate human beings. But Patton always behaves as a general should. ... He writes bloodcurdling poetry apostrophizing the God of Battles. He slaps shell-shocked soldiers and curses them for cowards. When Italian mules obstruct the progress of his staff car, he has them executed on the spot ... He wears special uniforms, which, like Goering, he designs himself and which are calculated, like the ox horns worn by ancient Gothic chieftains, to strike terror into the enemy (and into any rational person, for that matter.)\\"Quoted in Vincent Canby, \\"A Salute to a Rebel\\", The New York Times, February 5, 1970, and David Futrelle, \\"Reading: Tales of Two Narcissists\\", Chicago Reader, December 17, 1992. preceded a report of an off-the-record dinner speech to Washington newspapermen by Navy Admiral William F. \\"Bull\\" Halsey, from which one characteristic passage, :\\"I hate Japs! I'm telling you men, that if I met a pregnant Japanese woman, I'd kick her in the belly!\\" led Macdonald to note that :\\"Bull is a top-ranking naval officer, which gives him the privilege of talking in public in a way which would get civilians locked up in the violent ward of Bellevue. ... A few more such generals and admirals, and militarism will be a dead issue in this country.\\"Macdonald, \\"Atrocities of the Mind\\", politics, August 1945, as reprinted in Macdonald, Memoirs of a Revolutionist: Essays in Political Criticism, New York: Farrar, Straus, and Cudahy, 1957, p. 93. In responding two months later to letters from two soldiers – one of whom signed himself \\"A DISGUSTED MEMBER OF OUR ARMED FORCES.\\" – defending the motivational tactics of Patton and Halsey, Macdonald clarified his views in noting that :. . . These apologies for Patton are based on two arguments: :(1) The war was a just one; therefore, it had to be won; to win it, good generals are needed; Patton is a good general; therefore, Patton is justified. (2) Army life is radically different from civilian life; therefore, it is foolish to criticise its values from a civilian standpoint. Both arguments raise the problem of means and ends. :(1)I never thought World War II was a just war. But accepting this premise for the sake of argument, I'd say that far from the justness of the war excusing Patton's barbarism, Patton's barbarism calls into question the justness of the war. There is something suspect about an end which calls for such means. As I have noted before, Patton is my favorite general because he expresses so naively the real nature of World War II. :(2) That life in the U.S. Army is more brutal and inhumane than civilian life is true, but this fact would seem to be something to be criticised and changed rather than accepted as a law of nature. If it cannot be changed, then, if we are serious about our humane values, we must reject the war which requires such instruments to achieve its ends. Also: my correspondents would wall off military from civilian society, whereas I would do just the opposite: extend civilian values throughout the armed forces. What is actually taking place is, of course, something worse than either of these alternatives: a breaking down, indeed, of the wall between military and civil society, but in the sense that the former is reshaping the latter.\\"The Intelligence Office: In Defense of Patton-Halsey\\", politics, October 1945, p. 317. === Conscientious objection === Given his pacifist sympathies during the war, it was natural for Macdonald to run many essays from and about conscientious objectors (C.O.s), with whose position he sympathized, but whose common preference for reassignment to civilian over military-support work he did not reflexively share – as an egalitarian with revolutionary hopes for the leavening educational function of the man of conscience upon the larger population, soldiers included, he felt that a more direct presence among the armed forces was a constructive means to the desired end, a subject debated at length within the magazine,.Don Calhoun, \\"The Political Relevance of Conscientious Objection\\", politics July 1944, pp. 177-179; Dwight Macdonald, \\"The Political Relevance of Conscientious Objection: By Way of Rejoinder\\", politics, July 1944, pp. 179-180; Frank Triest, \\"Conscription and Conscientious Objection: Conscription is the Issue\\", politics, June 1945, pp. 165-166; E.

Moral issues aside and assumed, Macdonald in one article questioned the very effectiveness for military ends of racial segregation in the armed services, at a time when it was a common assumption that it was no business of the military, given its overriding mission, to be bothering itself with the advancement of \\"utopian\\" social goals scarcely advanced elsewhere in a civilian realm scarcely able itself to boast of a shining record of omnichrome rainbow tolerance.Dwight Macdonald, \\"How 'Practical' is a Racially Segregated Army?\\", politics, July 1944, pp. 184-186. One article on race matters, by Wilfred H. Kerr, co-chairman of the Lynn Committee to Abolish Segregation in the Armed Forces, forecast one ironic effect in the postwar era of race strife, prophesying in its very title, \\"Negroism: Strange Fruit of Segregation\\",Wilfred H. Kerr, \\"Negroism: Strange Fruit of Segregation\\", politics, March 1944, pp. 212-217. the eventual rise of Black Power and other forms of black separatism. The African-American writer George S.

Exploding with the force of 20,000 tons of TNT, the bomb destroyed in a twinkling two-thirds of the city, including, presumably, most of the 343,000 human beings who lived there. No warning whatsoever was given. This atrocious action places 'us,' the defenders of civilization, on a moral level with 'them,' the beasts of Maidanek. And 'we,' the American people, are just as much and as little responsible for this horror as 'they,' the German people. :\\"So much is obvious. But more must be said. For the atomic bomb renders anticlimactical even the ending of the greatest war in history [which seems imminent as this goes to press]. [1] The concepts 'WAR' and 'PROGRESS,' ARE NOW OBSOLETE. Both suggest human aspirations, emotions, aims, consciousness. 'The greatest achievement of organized science in history,' said President Truman after the Hiroshima catastrophe--which it probably was, and so much the worse for organized science. Such 'progress' fills no human needs of either the destroyed or the destroyers. And a war of atomic bombs is not a war. It is a scientific experiment. [2] THE FUTILITY OF MODERN WARFARE SHOULD NOW BE CLEAR. Must we not now conclude, with Simone Weil, that the technical aspect of war today is the evil, regardless of political factors? Can one imagine that the atomic bomb could ever be used 'in a good cause'? Do not such means, instantly, of themselves, corrupt ANY cause? [3] ATOMIC BOMBS ARE THE NATURAL PRODUCT OF THE KIND OF SOCIETY WE HAVE CREATED. They are as easy, normal and unforced an expression of the American Standard of Living as electric iceboxes. We do not dream of a world in which atomic fission will be 'harnessed to constructive ends.' The new energy will be at the service of the rulers; it will change their strength but not their aims. The underlying population should regard this new source of energy with lively interest--the interest of victims. [4] THOSE WHO WIELD SUCH DESTRUCTIVE POWER ARE OUTCASTS FROM HUMANITY. They may be gods, they may be brutes, but they are not men. [5] WE MUST 'GET' THE MODERN NATIONAL STATE BEFORE IT 'GETS' US. The crazy and murderous nature of the kind of society we have created is underlined by the atomic bomb. Every individual who wants to save his humanity--and indeed his skin--had better begin thinking 'dangerous thoughts' about sabotage, resistance, rebellion, and the fraternity of all men everywhere. The mental attitude known as 'negativism' is a good start.\\" politics was one of several left-wing American publications to condemn the bombing (along with The Progressive, Common Sense and The Militant).Boller, Paul F. (c. 1992). \\"Hiroshima and the American Left\\". Memoirs of An Obscure Professor and Other Essays. Fort Worth: Texas Christian University Press. . == European intellectuals == Given Macdonald's interest in European intellectual life, and his blended interests in both political and literary matters in an age whose own most famous political essayists were among their respective nations' leading literary figures – George Orwell, Albert Camus, Ignazio Silone – it was natural that the onetime Partisan Review veteran Macdonald would feature such writers prominently throughout his controlling tenure atop the masthead of politics. In addition to contributions from those just mentioned, Macdonald published regular essays and columns by his exiled Italian friends Nicola Chiaromonte and Niccolo Tucci, who were among his most prolific contributors. French intellectuals, often in reprints from native journals, took center stage in a special number from July–August 1947 given over wholly to \\"French Political Writing,\\"politics, July–August 1947. whose stellar roster included Georges Bataille,Georges Bataille in politics, via Unz.org. Camus,Albert Camus in politics, via Unz.org. Simone de Beauvoir,Simone de Beauvoir in politics, via Unz.org. Maurice Merleau-Ponty,Maurice Merleau-Ponty in politics, via Unz.org. David Rousset,David Rousset in politics, via Unz.org. and Jean-Paul Sartre.Jean-Paul Sartre in politics, via Unz.org. == Toward a recovered humanism == The accumulated horrors of total war – from bureaucratic regimentation of the home front to concentration and death camps, racialist nationalism and genocide, atomic weapons, firebombing of civilian populations, and, not least, the replacement as ruling power over Eastern and Central Europe of one, defeated total state, that of Hitler's Germany, with the newly powerful one, that of Stalinist Russia, that had helped defeat it – combined with the ongoing fading of hopes across the anti-Stalinist left for a long- dreamed socialist dawn to put into wholesale question the sort of reflexive, confident nineteenth-century belief in an all-but-inevitable Progress that had long underwritten the political dimension of western intellectual life. As world war gave way to Cold War, a much-noted reactive turn among intellectuals in the west to such pre- and post-Marxist registers of thought as those offered by religion (Niebuhr, Barth, Tillich), existentialism (Camus, Sartre, Jaspers), or both at once (the newly modish Kierkegaard) provided regular fare in both the highbrow little magazines of the day and the books pages of the newsweeklies. This postwar turn from the old mechanistic secular faith of Marxism toward renewed ethical, if not always explicitly religious, commitments, took central, watershed root in politics as well, as the uneasy postwar peace agreements and zoned division of Europe, de-Nazification of German elites and war-crimes trials cemented the Allied victory after the summer of 1945. In the magazine's April 1946 number, Macdonald published the inaugural version of one of his signature essays, \\"The Root is Man\\",Dwight Macdonald, \\"The Root is Man\\", politics, April 1946, pp. 97-115. whose widely reprinted book version from seven years laterDwight Macdonald, The Root is Man, Alhambra, California: Cunningham Press, 1953. would eventually find its way almost fifty years later on the lists of an American publisher specializing in anarchist and other forms of radical literature.Dwight Macdonald, The Root is Man, Autonomedia, 1995. The inauguration of a regular department in the magazine, \\"New Roads\\", heralded the quest formally, as did a regular feature devoted to \\"Ancestors\\" from across the ranks of assorted pre-20th century anarchists (P. J. Proudhon), :\\"EDITOR'S NOTE: This is the first of a series of articles by and about such political thinkers of the past as Diderot, Condorcet, Tom Paine, Saint-Simon, Charles Fourier, Alexander Herzen, Kropotkin, Tolstoy, Daniel De Leon, and Rosa Luxemburg. The names, it will be noted, are mostly of non-Marxists. This is because (1) Marxism is already widely familiar to American intellectuals (perhaps disproportionately so); (2) the contemporary crisis of socialism demands that we supplement and reshape the Marxist heritage with the aid of 'Utopian' socialism; 18th century liberalism, anarchism, and pacifism.\\"J. Hampden Jackson, \\"Ancestors (1): Proudhon\\", Politics, October 1945, pp. 297-299. social and political philosophers (William Godwin),George Woodcock, \\"Ancestors (4): Godwin\\", politics, September 1946, pp. 260-262. reformers (Alexander Herzen),Dwight Macdonald, \\"Ancestors (5): Alexander Herzen\\", politics, Winter 1948, pp. 40-52. and the morally rebellious type among artists (Leo Tolstoy).Dwight Macdonald, \\"Ancestors (3): Tolstoy\\", politics, May 1946, pp. 161-164. And in the wake of the assassination in early 1948 of Mohandas Gandhi, politics devoted a full-court symposium to the life, ideas, and relevance both inspirational and practical of the slain leader of Indian independence,\\"Gandhi\\", politics, Winter 1948, pp. 1-7 with contributions from James Agee, Nicola Chiaromonte, Paul Goodman, Macdonald, Mary McCarthy, and Niccolo Tucci, followed by copious extracts from Gandhi's own weekly Harijan.\\"Harijan\\", politics, Winter 1948, pp. 7-12. == The counterculture of anarchist humanism: prologue to the 1960s== Macdonald's publishing in politics of some of the earliest essays by the young Columbia-bound sociologist C. Wright Mills and the young novelist, playwright, therapist, and New York social critic Paul Goodman helped seed their rise to national fame twenty years later as two of the signature theorists undergirding the New Left critique of postwar industrial society and mass culture. A debate between Mills and GoodmanUnder the inspired title \\"The Barricade and the Bedroom\\", politics, October 1945, pp. 313-316; this exchange arose from Goodman's earlier article, \\"The Political Meaning of Some Recent Revisions of Freud\\", politics, July 1945, pp. 197-203. over the proper locus for the critique of repressive structures in America, with Mills taking a broadly Marxist frame in examining above-ground social structures, and Goodman preferring instead to excavate the post-Freudian unconscious and the repression of instinct, with the social psychology of Karen Horney and Erich Fromm for supporting witness, prefigured the sorts of polemics that would soon crowd the American quality- paperback tables from Ann Arbor to Yale amid the renewal of campus activism and new modes of scholarship. Other harbingers of future cultural ferment may be discerned in a long poem by the English anarcho-pacifist physician Alex Comfort\\"A Legend of UNO\\", politics, September 1946, pp. 1-3. (ascended for all time into the global non-literary firmament since 1972 thanks to The Joy of Sex), an essay by the young San Francisco Beat-affiliated poet Robert Duncan on the internalized repression, thence redirected outward, too often afflicting \\"The Homosexual in Society\\",Robert Duncan, \\"The Homosexual in Society\\", politics, March 1944, pp. 209-211. and numerous essays by the Canadian-born London anarchist and conscientious objector George Woodcock, editor at the time of the anarchist cultural quarterly NOW, the raiding of the offices of whose publisher, Freedom Press, during the war by the political arm of the London police he chronicled in a letter\\"Persecution of British Anarchists\\", politics, April 1945, p. 127. to politics in all its unavoidable irony: :\\"One of the houses raided was that of a surrealist not even directly connected with the anarchist movement. The day after the raid a Special Branch detective appeared to say that he had always been interested in surrealism, and would like to join the surrealist movement!\\" And twenty years before his ideas on the \\"global village\\" made him a prophetic household name worldwide, the budding Canadian media theorist Marshall McLuhan weighed in as a contributor to politics with a discussion of the problems of women in modern bureaucratic society.Marshall McLuhan, \\"Out of the Castle into the Counting- House\\", politics, September 1946, pp. 277-279. The title of his first book, however, The Mechanioal Bride, may in the event be seen as pure coincidence. == Counteracting the Soviet myth == With the grim consolidation of Stalinist rule in Eastern Europe in the aftermath of the Second World War, and the ensnaring of a large part of the younger generation on the left by the Henry Wallace movement and what he felt to be common notions within of either a moral equivalence between Russia and the west, or an outright tipping of the moral scales in favor of the Soviet side, Macdonald, while still claiming adherence to the anarchist and pacifist labels, and upon re-immersion in the vast literature on recent Communist history, devoted a large opening sectionCf. politics, Winter 1948, pp. 75-119. of the Winter 1948 number of politics to the attempt to counteract the Soviet myth, among whose articles he included an extensive reading list of standard works chronicling forced labor in the Soviet Union, the Moscow trials, the Ukrainian famine of 1932–33, dating back to the early critiques of the Bolshevik experiment in its infancy published by the anarchist Emma Goldman and the eminent English philosopher Bertrand Russell.For an interesting view of the degree of cross-partisan overlap between the anti-Soviet readings suggested by Macdonald and those recommended over on the libertarian Right, see the dozens of titles on the Russian experience given favorable write-ups in the annotated bibliography of over 500 titles on political, economic and social topics published in 1956 by the eminent libertarian journalist and veteran Newsweek columnist Henry Hazlitt under the title The Free Man's Library (Van Nostrand). In the sphere of foreign and military policy in the developing Cold War, though the range of perspectives Macdonald published naturally did not include pro-Soviet or fellow-traveling writers, he did publish those advocating that the United States take the first, unilateral step toward an eventual mutual disarmament, in the belief the Soviets, assured of the good faith of their ostensibly stronger adversary, would be moved to follow suit.Cuthbert Daniel and Arthur M. Squires, \\"A First Step Toward Disarmament\\", politics, Winter 1949, pp. 28-32. Within the same symposium, Macdonald included a detailed response from the Deweyite pragmatist philosopher and militantly anti-Soviet social democrat, Sidney Hook, :\\"Messrs. Daniel and Squires are naive. The political kernel of their proposal is their hope that if the United States destroys its atomic bombs and plants, Stalin will be ashamed of himself and abandon his dictatorship ... I am not in favor of a preventive war because I am as confident as one can be in human affairs that so long as Stalin fears he will be blasted off the face of the earth once he strikes against the West, he will wait. We can see to it that he is never free of that fear. Even less than the romantic Hitler has he the demonic desire to bring the world down on him in a universal ruin.\\" in whose orbit Macdonald would travel in the next decade which saw him serve for a year as Associate Editor of the London-based monthly Encounter, founded in 1953 by the Congress for Cultural Freedom, whose own founding in Paris in 1950, with Hook among its leading intellectual lights, he prophesied at the end of the same essay:Sidney Hook, \\"Comment\\", Politics, Winter 1949, pp. 35-36. :\\"I speak in the first person only for purposes of expository emphasis. Give me a hundred million dollars and a thousand dedicated people, and I will guarantee to generate such a wave of democratic unrest among the masses—yes, even among the soldiers—of Stalin's own empire, that all of his problems for a long time to come will be internal. I can find the people. . . .\\" === The Henry Wallace campaign and \\"Wallese\\" === One natural cognate of Macdonald's status as a fiercely anti-Stalinist leftist lay in his ongoing critical attention to Henry Wallace, the final vice president (1941–1945) under Franklin Roosevelt whose tenure thus was bookended by respective terms heading up the Departments of Agriculture (1933–1940 and Commerce (1945–1946), followed by his nomination in 1948 atop the presidential ticket of the Progressive Party, who Macdonald saw as afflicted by a dangerously credulous and whitewashing attitude toward Stalinist Russia, along with a general-purpose timid banality and penchant for wooly idealist rhetoric divorced from concrete reality. Macdonald devoted the opening sections of the issue of politics for March 1947 to an extended look at Wallace,Dwight Macdonald, \\"Henry Wallace (Part 1)\\", politics, March-April 1947, pp. 33-44; Henry Wallace (Part 2), politics, May-June 1947, pp. 96-116. along with an \\"Autopsy\\" of the Wallace campaign after the 1948 election.Dwight Macdonald, \\"The Wallace Campaign: An Autopsy\\", politics, Summer 1948 (issue actually published in November)pp. 178-188. From \\"The Wallace Myth\\" from March 1947: :\\"Wallaceland is the mental habitat of Henry Wallace plus few hundred thousand regular readers of The New Republic, The Nation, and PM. It is a region of perpetual fogs, caused by the warm winds of the liberal Gulf Stream coming in contact with the Soviet glacier. Its natives speak 'Wallese', a debased provincial dialect. :\\"Wallese is as rigidly formalized as Mandarin Chinese. The Good people are described by ritualistic adjectives: 'forward-looking', 'freedom-loving', 'clear-thinking', and, of course, 'democratic' and 'progressive.' The Bad people are always 'reactionaries' or 'red-baiters'; there are surprisingly few of them, considering the power they wield, and they are perversely wicked, since their real interests would best be served by the Progressive and Realistic policies favored by the Good people. Wallese is always employed to Unite rather than to Divide (hence the fog), and to Further Positive, Constructive Aims rather than Merely to Engage in Irresponsible and Destructive Criticism. As George F. Babbitt of Zenith City, who had his own brand of Wallese in the twenties, used to say: It's Easy Enough to Criticise! There are other conventions in Wallese. Issues are always Clarified, Events invariably Exert Pressure, Problems are Faced (good) or Not Faced (bad), and the World is either On the March (good) or At the Crossroads (neutral) or Facing a Crisis (bad). No article may be composed in Wallese unless it includes at least one of the following terms: 'grass roots', 'integration', 'horizon', 'general welfare.' The frequent use of the 'should and will' or 'can and must' construction is also obligatory, as in the (imaginary) sentence: 'The American people can and must free the forward march of technology from the dead hand of monopoly.' The adjective 'new' is much used, as: 'new horizons', 'new frontiers', and 'the new democracy' (which means the old democracy minus all democratic elements). Like 'adventure', another important word in Wallese,* *[Cf. Wallace's 'the adventure of the Hebrew prophets', which sounds more like Edgar than Henry.] it suggests something Different (and God knows we're sick of what we've got now), Positive, Exciting—something to which the old critical categories, which have proved so lethal in the hands of Irresponsible and Destructive critics, cannot be applied. Thus many of us are by now somewhat leery of both democracy and The New Republic, but how about the new democracy and the new New Republic? Perhaps the greatest sentence ever composed in Wallese is the following, from the hand of the master himself: 'New frontiers beckon with meaningful adventure.'\\" == Culture, high, middlebrow and mass == As the 2011 reissue by New York Review Books Classics of his signature 1950s cultural essays, Masscult and Midcult: Essays Against the American Grain (most originally gathered in 1962 as Against the American Grain: Essays on the Effects of Mass Culture), may indicate, the phase of the career of Dwight Macdonald best known to the educated public came with his arrival in 1952 as critic on the staff of The New Yorker, there to assay with dialectical scalpel at the ready such characteristic products of postwar aspirational \\"middlebrow\\" – or \\"Midcult\\" to Macdonald – culture as the Great Books of the Western World book-sets, the Revised Standard Version translation of the Bible, the latter-day age-of- science penchant for facts over interpretative general ideas, and that hardiest of evergreens in the groves of the American book market, the how-to book. It was in politics, though, if not surprisingly, that Macdonald provided himself with a premonitory sounding board for such preoccupations, in and out of his regular roundup \\"Popular Culture\\", one of whose items also hints at Macdonald's dawn-to-decadence penchant for connecting the evolution of cultural forms to that of the stages of industrial development from which they issue: :Whatever Became of Addison Sims? :The kind of question it might be fruitful to answer is: why was self-education so much more popular several generations ago than it seems to be now? Pelmanism, Chatauqua, the Harvard Classics ('Fifteen Minutes a Day'), the International Correspondence Schools, the Roth Memory Course ('Why of course I remember you--Mr. Addison Sims of Seattle!'), Cooper Union--these have become innocent archaisms. At the turn of the century, book agents roamed the country ringing doorbells and selling sets of 'standard authors' (Dickens, Thackeray, George Eliot) encyclopedias and multi-volume historical works. The book-agent has vanished; people read for amusement, not instruction, and authors are no longer 'standard' or sold in sets. Does all this perhaps show the growth of a popular instinct that education is not the golden key to progress which the Victorians thought it was? Is the myth of the self-made man fading? Is the modern world at once so irrational and so totally organized that the mass-man simply gives up, no longer hoping to understand or 'improve' his situation? :A study of self- education in the last fifty years might be a good way to answer such questions --as Orwell in his 'Ethics of the Detective Story' (POLITICS, November 1944) was able to trace in that field the deterioration of ethical standards during the same period. I can't help feeling that American critics might more profitably concern themselves with such rich and relatively unexplored areas than with trying to find something new to say about Henry James.\\"Dwight Macdonald, \\"Popular Culture: Field Notes\\", politics, April 1945, p. 113. == Publishing and circulation == As is proverbial among small-circulation journals of intellectual opinion, the finances of politics ran at a deficit,\\"politics has had a deficit every year so far. It was $3,059 in 1944; $953 in 1945; $6,041 in 1946; and $2,020 in 1947 (only 4 issues put out) . These deficits are of some interest to Nancy and myself, since we have to make them up.\\" Dwight Macdonald, \\"A Report to the Readers\\", politics, Winter 1948, p. 58. much of it covered by Macdonald's first wife the former Nancy Rodman (m. 1934), sister of the poet, editor and author Selden Rodman, and the beneficiary on her mother's side of an ample trust fund; also proverbially among such magazines, circulation tended toward the 5,000 (c. 60 percent subscription, 40 percent newsstand) mark. Macdonald changed its original monthly frequency to quarterly early in its fourth year of six, and acknowledged in an aside\\"Note\\", politics, Summer 1948, p. 146. to subscribers his awareness of its chronic scheduling delays in a rueful aside in the issue for (in the best of all intended worlds) Summer 1948: :Note :For reasons not unconnected with the postal regulations governing second-class matter, the present issue, which appears early in November, is officially styled the Summer issue. The Editor extends his customary regrets, apologies and condolences to the readers. Nancy's humanitarian and philanthropic background played a key role in an ongoing project of the magazine after the war, that of \\"Packages Abroad\\",\\"Report on Food Packages\\", politics, December 1945, pp. 383-384; \\"Packages Abroad: Current Information\\", politics, April 1946, p. 136; \\"Fourth Report on Packages Abroad\\", politics, May 1946, pp. 171-174; \\"Fifth Report on Packages Abroad\\", politics, September 1945, pp. 294-295; \\"Sixth Report on Packages\\", Politics, November 1946, pp. 362-364; \\"Packages Abroad\\", politics, Summer 1948, pp. 206-208; \\"Report on Packages Abroad\\", politics, Winter 1948, pp. 71-72; by which regular appeals to readers, channeled directly or through such standard relief sgencies as CARE, enabled the donation of food, clothing, shoes and coal for heating to thousands of individuals and families across war-ravaged Europe deprived of them. == Reception and influence == In his column in the left-wing London Tribune, George Orwell wrote favorably of politics, as reprinted in a subscription advertisement in the latter paper in August, 1944: \\"One cannot buy magazines from abroad nowadays, but I recommend anyone who has a friend in New York to try and cadge a copy of politics, the new monthly magazine edited by the Marxist literary critic, Dwight Macdonald. I don’t agree with the policy of this paper, which is anti-war (not from a pacifist angle), but I admire its combination of highbrow political analysis with intelligent literary criticism... Politically, the paper in this country most nearly corresponding to politics would be, I suppose, The New Leader. You have only to compare the get-up, the style of writing, the range of subjects, and the intellectual level of the two papers, to see what it means to live in a country where there are still leisure and wood-pulp.\\" In her preface to a 1968 reissue of the full run of politics, the eminent German-American political theorist Hannah Arendt asserted that :\\"When I was asked to write a brief introduction to the reprint edition of politics I was tempted to yield to the rather pleasant melancholy of \\"once upon a time\\" and to indulge in the nostalgic contemplation that seems to be the appropriate mood for all recollection. Now that I have carefully reread the forty-two issues which appeared from 1944 to 1949—more carefully, I am sure, than I read them more than twenty years ago—this mood has vanished for the simple reason that so many of its articles, comments, and factual reports read as though they were written today or yesterday or yesteryear, except that the concerns and perplexities of a little magazine with a peak circulation of not much more than 5,000 have become the daily bread of newspapers and periodicals with mass circulation. For the issues, far from being outdated, let alone resolved, by the enormous changes in our everyday world, have only increased in urgency.\\"Arendt, Hannah, \\"Introduction\\" to Dwight Macdonald, politics. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Reprint Corporation, 1968. Published also as \\"He's All Dwight\\", The New York Review of Books, August 1, 1968. The Polish poet and 1980 Nobelist in Literature, Czesław Miłosz, whose renowned 1953 essay collection The Captive Mind, amplified a number of Macdonald's own themes regarding the effect of Stalinism on the European mind,And which Macdonald hailed upon its publication in 1953. See Dwight Macdonald, \\"In the Land of Diamat\\", The New Yorker, November 7, 1953, pp. 173-182. found in Macdonald's own independent, anti-authoritarian ethical humanism much to admire, seeing in him a successor to \\"Thoreau, Whitman, and Melville ... a totally American phenomenon--the completely free man, capable of making decisions at all times and about all things strictly according to his personal moral judgment.\\"This encomium from Miłosz, also appeared in 1953, in his review of Macdonald's revised pamphlet version of The Root is Man. See Czesław Miłosz, \\"Dwight Macdonald\\", in Beginning With My Streets, quoted in John Rodden, \\"Memorial for a Revolutionist: Dwight Macdonald, 'A Critical American'\\", Society, September 2007, pp. 51-61, reprinted in Rodden, The Unexamined Orwell (University of Texas Press, 2011), p. 53, and in Ethan Goffman and Daniel Morris, eds., The New York Public Intellectuals and Beyond (Purdue University Press, 2009), p. 121. Macdonald's friend the Hungarian-born American historian John Lukacs, like Macdonald a cultural traditionalist equally critical of standard-issue American politics either right-wing or pas d'ennemi à gauche progressive, in the Jesuit weekly America in 1958 christened him an \\"American Orwell\\", as John Rodden indicates: :\\"Noting that Macdonald's American 'reputation is rising,' Lukacs wrote that he was already known among British intellectuals 'as one of the most interesting American critics of these times.' In particular Lukacs lauded Macdonald's 'lonely and courageous positions' in the mid-1940s -- on Yalta, the Allied insistence on unconditional surrender, the mistreatment of Japanese-Americans -- and argued that Macdonald's political stance 'coincides with the often lonely positions taken by George Orwell amidst the leftist intelligentsia in Britain.'\\"John Rodden, \\"Dwight and Left\\", The American Prospect, March 2006. Along with the prominence among leading social critics of the 1960s of such early contributors to politics as Paul Goodman and C. Wright Mills, and Macdonald's role among the founding circle of Europhile New York literary and political intellectuals who wrote for the influential biweekly New York Review of Books (1963-), a mainstay of postwar intellectual life, among which Macdonald's impassioned critiques of Lyndon Johnson and American policy in Vietnam renewed his role as Second World War gadfly, mention might be made of such long-running little magazines founded in the wake of politics as MANAS (1948–88), a one-man weekly edited by Henry Geiger, a Los Angeles Theosophist, Indophile, commercial printer and Second World War C.O. indebted to the social philosophies of Mohandas Gandhi, Henry David Thoreau, Leo Tolstoy and Ortega y Gasset, and who published the 1953 pamphlet revision of Macdonald's The Root is Man; and Dissent (1954-), the quarterly founded by early politics contributor Irving Howe, a leading anti-Stalinist democratic socialist whose equal prominence as a critic of modern European literature found its cognate in Dissent in the prominent space devoted, much after the precedent of politics, to Continental thinkers and social developments. Chris Hedges recounts the story of Noam Chomsky reading at least most of all volumes of politics, in Chomsky's youth. == Notable contributors == The following is a selected list of notable contributors to politics, including those who wrote for it at least 3 times: * Lionel Abel (1) * James Agee (2) * Milton Babbitt (1) * George Barbarow (7) * Georges Bataille (1) * Bruno Bettelheim (3) * Don Calhoun (5) * Albert Camus (1) * Nicola Chiaromonte (6) * Louis Clair (5) * Alex Comfort (1) * Helen Constas (3) * Simone de Beauvoir (1) * Theodore Dryden (5) * Robert Duncan (1) * James T.

It also expanded and refined the first builds of each class (originally in the Player's Handbook) by giving new powers and paragon paths. ===Fighter=== The fighter, the martial defender, received two new builds to be used in conjunction with the builds in Player's Handbook. The battlerager fighter works as a berserker fighter, which utilizes the new Invigorating keyword, which grants the battlerager temporary hit points to make up for their lack of armor. The tempest fighter is a dual wielding fighter build with great mobility. ===Ranger=== The ranger, a martial striker, received one new build in Martial Power, the beastmaster. Instead of choosing an archery or a two weapon fighting benefit as detailed in the Player's Handbook, the ranger could instead gain a beast to fight alongside with. The beast is used with new beast powers, which grant it attacks and their own effects. ===Rogue=== The rogue, a martial striker, gained two new builds in Martial Power, the aerialist rogue and the cutthroat rogue. The aerialist rogue uses the Acrobatics skill to maneuver around enemies and the cutthroat uses the Intimidation skill to rattle and shake foes. ===Warlord=== The warlord, the martial leader, can use two new builds in conjunction with the two builds in Player's Handbook. The bravura warlord uses daring, and often brash, tactics that could harm the warlord but give great benefits to their allies. The resourceful warlord is a soldier on the battlefield that adapts to certain situations. ==Publication history== Martial Power was published in November 2008 and was designed by Rob Heinsoo, David Noonan, Chris Sims, and Robert J.

This audio drama was produced by Big Finish Productions. ==Synoposis== Lucie is safe back at home on Earth. The Doctor has washed up on an obscure water world called Orbis. And the Headhunter has a plan to reunite them. Her motive is a piece of unfinished business that lies at the bottom of the sea. ==PlotPart 1=== Lucie is at home when there's a ring on the doorbell. She opens the door and is shocked to find herself facing her old foe, the Headhunter. The woman raises an alien gun and warns Lucie that she’ll kill her if she makes a move. Lucie protests, but this is enough for the Headhunter and she opens fire. Lucie wakes up and finds herself back in the TARDIS. The Headhunter \\"un-shot\\" her using quantum-tipped time bullets. When she tells Lucie she needs her help in finding the Doctor, Lucie insists that he died six months ago. The Headhunter reveals that they’re heading for ’tweenspace’, a layer of cosmic sediment where the dregs settle. As the TARDIS begins to shake violently, she says the Universe is being destroyed and there's only one person in all of existence who can stop it… Far away on the ocean planet of Orbis, the Doctor is occupying his time by repairing the wreck of a tiny spaceship. He's approached by Selta, a female of the jellyfish-like Keltan race, who tells him there's a storm approaching, and the distraction is enough for the drive belt to snap and whip the Doctor‘s fingers. Selta can’t tell whether he's angry as he doesn’t share the Keltans’ iridescence, but his repairs have come to an end unless he can find a replacement. He tells her that if they were on Earth he could use a pair of tights, but he's unlikely to find any here as there are no bipeds on this planet. According to the stories told by the elders on Orbis, the Doctor was said to have come from the bottom of the sea many years ago. As they shelter from the storm, Selta asks him to tell her his story, but before he can begin, the atmospheric scanner from the spaceship starts activating. There's just enough power left in the cells to reveal that the entire composition of the planet's troposphere is changing. The Doctor has lived on Orbis for longer than any of the current inhabitants and he knows this isn’t normal as the storm season should have ended months ago. He believes something out in space must be having an effect on the planet. Secretary Saccostrea approaches the elderly and rather corpulent Molluscari leader Crassostrea with important news. She interrupts his feeding and he complains that his female organs can’t hope to develop if he continues to restrict himself to a diet of photo- plankton. His temper has been fiery of late, resulting in the massacre of the Tetraploids, the firing of the murk water vents and the broiling of his crocs, and she suspects it's because he's keen to start breeding. She tells him she's received word that the Barometer General's atmospheric survey of Orbis confirms what they’d already suspected about the changes to the planet‘s environment. This will be catastrophic news for the Keltan inhabitants, but good new for the Molluscari, so Crassostrea decides it's time to confront the Galactic Council with their findings. Despite having read all 17 volumes of the TARDIS manual, the Headhunter struggles to operate the controls and the ship continues to be buffeted around the Vortex. Lucie explains that these volumes constitute just the start guide and the manual itself has its own library a couple of miles down the corridor. The Headhunter reveals that she got the TARDIS from the Sisterhood of Karn who’d kept it as a trophy after they teleported the Doctor out of the canyon and sent him somewhere worse. She experiments by switching the controls over to ’slingshot mode’ and they’re both thrown to the floor from the extreme g-force. Back on Orbis, the Doctor responds to a cry for help and finds the young Keltan boy Vimix trapped in a deep well and unable to move. The Doctor summons help and is soon joined by Selta and Vimix's bloom-father Yanos. They realise the boy must have been scrumping for barnacles again and Vimix confirms that the water came flooding in when the storm broke and he couldn’t get out in time. The group lower down some seaweed lines which wrap themselves around the boy's limbs and then he's heaved back up to the shore. Yanos takes the Doctor aside and tells him Vimix's bloom-sisters have just died when the rain waters swamped the nursery pools. The Doctor is angry because he’d warned them the sea walls were inadequate. They’ll have to re-build them higher, so the Doctor suggests placing the whole town on stilts. Yanos congratulates him for the idea and says the Keltans owe him so much, but he‘s still worried the planet is turning against them. The Doctor acknowledges that Orbis is drowning, but reminds them of the time they defeated the invading Molluscari, a race of aggressive space oysters, by presenting a convincing argument to the Galactic Council by interspace radio. He's sure they can find a way to overcome this problem too. Secretary Saccostrea calls the Molluscari to attention for an address from their leader Crassostrea. He tells them he has great news, greater even than his conquest of the Tetraploids – his female organs are starting to develop. The oyster-like audience click their pincers in appreciation, but Crassostrea becomes angry and demands they applaud louder. Now mostly female, she then announces that the Galactic Council, a body for whom she has no respect, has considered the recent catastrophic changes to the environment on Orbis and has decided (subject to independent audit) that the Keltans’ claim to the planet is no longer tenable. This means the Molluscari claim takes precedence and Orbis is theirs for the taking…and not even the Doctor can stop them this time! As the TARDIS eventually settles down and the two occupants recover from the effects of their journey, the Headhunter rebukes Lucie for being sick inside the control room and tells her to clean up the mess. Unfortunately the TARDIS itself is sick too, having been separated from its owner for too long. The Headhunter says she's an old ship that‘s coming to the end of her natural life. Without the Doctor's influence she's leaking time waste, which is soiling the very fabric of the Vortex and rotting it away. With the Time Lords still in hiding, TARDISes are few and far between, which has inflated its value. The Headhunter has already sold the Doctor's TARDIS, but the buyer doesn’t want an ailing vessel that's belching out space-destroying matter in its wake, so she's come to find its former owner so he can regenerate the ship and transfer ownership to her. Lucie knows the Doctor would never do that – but the Headhunter reveals that Lucie still has a quantum-tipped time bullet inside her brain and she’ll only remove it if the Doctor co-operates. They’re due to arrive at their destination in tweenspace in 32 minutes… The Doctor tells Selta that Orbis's moon is unlike any other he's seen. Most satellites rise and wane, but this one tracks Orbis as if connected by an invisible thread that extends to a point 50 miles out to sea. Selta says there will be a funeral-feast later to celebrate the lives of the children they lost during the storm. It will follow a relatively new Keltan tradition which was formulated by the Doctor himself generations ago after he pointed out that their previous method of eating and regurgitating their own deceased wasn’t a very efficient way to compost the seabed. Selta invites the Doctor to accompany her to the dance, but before he can even change the subject, they’re interrupted by the arrival of a huge clam-ship, signifying the return of the Molluscari. Selta rushes off the raise the alarm… As the Molluscari ship comes in to land, Crassostrea declares her intention to blast the Keltan habitation to dust. Saccostrea reminds her that the Galactic Council have not yet granted them the rights to this planet and they are only here to give the Keltans notice of their plans. They see the panicking jellyfish people massing nearby and Crassostrea prepares to address them. Yanos is shocked to see the Molluscari return as everyone knows their claim on this planet had been comprehensively rejected years ago by the Galactic Council, but the Doctor says the Molluscari are bullies and people like that never like to be beaten. He offers to talk to the invaders and approaches the clam-ship, claiming to represent the Keltan species. Crassostrea emerges and mocks the Keltans, but the Doctor recognises her and remembers that she used to be male. He warns Crassostrea that he won’t tolerate any harassment of the Keltans, but the Molluscari leader reveals that she has in her possession a document from the Galactic Council confirming that the climate of Orbis is undergoing irreversible change and will shortly become inimical to the Keltan life. The Doctor acknowledges that the storm season shows no sign of ending, but that doesn’t mean the Keltans can’t adapt and thrive in their new environment. Unfortunately, it appears the Galactic Council don’t agree and in three day's time the Keltan claim on Orbis will expire and be passed to the Molluscari. Yanos demands to see the document for himself, but as Crassostrea hands over the data pearl, she snaps shut her pincer and removes one of Yanos's tentacles. Instead, she passes the pearl to the Doctor and advises him to study it well. In return, the Doctor switches on his sonic screwdriver, set to the exact pitch that will vibrate Molluscari from their shells. Crassostrea and Saccostrea retreat back to their ship in pain and seconds later the ship lifts off from the surface. Yanos is convinced the Keltans are doomed, but the Doctor urges him not to give up. Tonight they will dance and mourn their dead, but tomorrow they will start making stilts and building their town's defences. The TARDIS materialises and the Headhunter announces that they’ve arrived on the planet Orbis, the province of a species known as Keltans. Lucie struggles to accept that somewhere out there is the Doctor and she begins to worry about how scruffy she looks. She takes a deep breath and opens the door – only to find the ship is hovering in mid-air, several metres above a huge ocean. The Headhunter explains that the nearest land is about 50 miles away – then she pushes Lucie through the door and into the great expanse of water. As Lucie thrashes about in panic, the Headhunter says that because of the increased saline content, she should float easily, and the current will take her in the direction she needs. Unfortunately they’re in the middle of a rather hefty storm front, but she's sure Lucie will be fine providing she keeps her mouth shut. The Headhunter closes the door and returns alone to the control room. She then proceeds to make a phone call and sends her contact a sequence of co- ordinates, telling the recipient they will be diving at dawn… Sometime later, Lucie is woken up by a female voice calling her a \\"biped\\". She opens her eyes and finds herself on dry land – but with a huge tentacled jellyfish standing over her. She screams in panic, but Selta pleads with her not to be alarmed and explains that she pulled her out of the sea. Lucie apologises and says she has a thing about jelly after an unfortunate incident at a children's party in 1992. Lucie starts to complain about her sodden tights and Selta reacts instantly, recognising the word the Doctor used earlier. Without warning, she rips the tights from Lucie's legs and runs off, claiming she needs them urgently. The Doctor has returned to his repair work on the tiny wrecked spaceship, but even his sonic screwdriver is starting to pack up on him. He hears a commotion from nearby and sees Selta running towards him, waving a pair of tights, followed by a young woman screaming angrily at her. The Doctor is both amazed and delighted – but when Lucie races over and tries to hug him, he totally ignores her and she realises it was the tights that had grabbed his attention. He uses them to replace the snapped drive belt while Selta explains how she got them from a biped on the beach. When Lucie steps forward, the Doctor doesn’t seem to acknowledge her and says he’ll be with her later as he has important work to finish. When he reveals that it's been 600 years since he last saw a biped, Lucie tells him she thought he was dead and that she cried for weeks, but then the truth slowly dawns on her – the Doctor has completely forgotten who she is. ===Part 2=== The Doctor asks Lucie if they know each other. He admits that his long term memory isn’t what it was and the last 300 years or so have been a bit of a blur. He looks at her clothes and guesses Lucie comes from the 1980s, which infuriates her. She tells him they met in the early 21st century when she was dumped on him by the Time Lords on a witness protection scheme. She recounts some of their adventures and then tells him they were the best of mates, but the Doctor is struggling to keep up and thinks it‘s because he hasn‘t heard a Cockney accent for so long. Lucie slaps his face and is delighted when he says it really hurt. Selta tells Lucie she should leave, a suggestion that she readily agrees to. Once they’re alone, Selta wonders whether all Earth females are so aggressive. She turns the Doctor's attention back to more pressing matters such as the atmospheric scanner and the mystery of Orbis's moon. The Doctor suddenly realises that Orbis never actually had a moon before and recalls that he first saw it just a few decades ago. The TARDIS materialises and the Headhunter emerges to be greeted by her contact, Secretary Saccostrea. They’ve never actually met before and the Headhunter rebukes the Molluscari for being late. She then refuses to accompany Saccostrea to meet their leader and insists that Crassostrea be brought to meet her. The tights work and the Doctor starts to power up the crashed spaceship. Selta wonders if the Doctor is thinking of going back to Earth, but this just makes him laugh. She's been thinking about what happened with Lucie and suggests the Doctor tries talking to her, but the Doctor has discovered the storms are being caused because the moon is coming ever closer to the planet. This confirms what they learned from the Molluscari data pearl. He's sure it's no coincidence and decides to contact the Galactic Council to see if they can persuade the Molluscari to back off. What he really needs to do is visit the moon itself, and Selta suggests asking Lucie if she knows what happened to his TARDIS. The Doctor suddenly realises that in order for Lucie and Selta to have understood each other, the TARDIS must be here somewhere, translating their speech. He races off to find his old companion. From the safety of the Molluscari ship, the Headhunter and Crassostrea oversee an underwater expedition. The results of the search are negative, so Crassostrea insists that the whelks go deeper, even though Secretary Saccostrea warns that the pressure will cause their shells to crack. The Headhunter and Crassostrea have come to an arrangement – the Molluscari will retrieve something for her from the bottom of the ocean in return for her help persuading the Doctor leaving Orbis forever. The Headhunter has already arranged for the Doctor to be reunited with Lucie and once she gets what she wants, she’ll fulfil her side of the bargain. They listen to the screams over the communicator as the diving shoal finally succumbs to the pressures of the depths, but Crassostrea insists that Saccostrea sends down more of their people… The Doctor catches up with Lucie and apologises, explaining that he's had a lot on his mind recently. He asks her where the TARDIS is, and when she tells him the Headhunter has it, he vaguely recalls her as a part-recruitment consultant and part-assassin. The Doctor insists that Lucie slap him again and says that because she's just come from the TARDIS her fingertips are still charged with chronon particles. When she hit him earlier, it reinvigorated his dormant neurons which is helping him to remember things. There's still a lot of confusion in his head – he can remember shouting, screaming and doors being slammed – but it's a promising start. However, Lucie is shocked when he reveals that he won’t be leaving Orbis. He says he's happy here and he only needs the TARDIS to find out what's happening on the moon and stop the Molluscari. Lucie insists that he's a traveller by nature, but he tells her that's all in his past and Orbis is now his home. Angered by this, Lucie slaps his face several times, but the sight of her apparently attacking the Doctor just causes Selta to race over to stop her. Selta reveals that bloom-father Yanos has received a message from the Galactic Council so the three of them head for town to discover what the news is. Eventually the Molluscari's underwater search is successful and the crew pick up the signal that the Headhunter has been searching for. She orders them to trawl the object in and then Crassostrea prepares to confront the Doctor… Back at town, the Doctor has contacted the Galactic Council and learned that they’re not prepared to hear any appeals until six orbits have passed to allow for a cooling-off period. The Doctor tries to argue that there's more going on here than they know and says the passage of the Orbis moon is being adversely affected by an external agency. However, the Council refuses to engage in any further discussion and cuts him off. Just then, the sound of an approaching spaceship is heard, signalling the return of the Molluscari. The voice of Crassostrea breaks in on the radio, telling the Keltans their tenancy of the planet is over. She claims Orbis for their own, but adds that in the spirit of inter-species solidarity she will allow a select number of Keltans to be transported to an artificial enclave elsewhere in the galaxy. The selection will be based on weight and breeding potential and she asks for volunteers to assemble on the beach. The Keltans turn to the Doctor for ideas, but he says he needs more time to think. Just then, the Headhunter arrives and mocks the Doctor for being unable to save the Keltan race from extinction, despite living with them for 600 years. She tells Yanos that the Molluscari's offer is the best one they’re going to get and advises them to take it. Lucie starts to argue with her, but to everyone's surprise, Selta grabs hold of her and agrees with the Headhunter, assuring Yanos they have no alternative. Lucie bites her captor and is released, then the Doctor hands Selta his sonic screwdriver for protection and tells her to meet with the Molluscari and keep them talking as long as she can. Once the Keltans have gone, Lucie tries to punch the Headhunter – but the woman pulls out her gun and shoots her again at point blank range. Saccostrea informs Crassostrea that the Keltans are beginning to gather on the shore as requested. The leader laughs and summons more clam-ships to land on the beach and begin the processing. The Doctor tries to revive Lucie and is surprised when the Headhunter says she's been shot with a time bullet. It's currently burrowing its way into Lucie's chest at a rate of one millimetre every second, but she can speed it up, slow it down or even remove it entirely as she wishes. The Headhunter tells the Doctor she's reverse the damage and even return his TARDIS to him if he agrees to leave Orbis. However, he must also agree to switch off a device she's extracted from the seabed. It's encrusted in coral after resting at the bottom of the ocean for 600 years, but the Doctor recognises it as the remote activator for the Stellar Manipulator, which he took from Morbius and was holding when he fell into the canyon on Karn all those years ago. It was to protect this device that the Sisterhood transported him here in the first place. The technology can only be activated by a Time Lord, which is why the Headhunter arranged for Lucie to be brought here. She orders the Doctor to switch it off or else she’ll allow Lucie to die. He refuses to co-operate and accuses Lucie and the Headhunter of plotting this together. Until they reveal what their plan is, he intends to keep the activator safe in his pocket. Convinced that the Headhunter won’t let her ally die, he leaves them to their ‘act’ while he attends to those who genuinely need his help. Lucie cries out to him to help, but he isn’t listening… The Great Crassostrea addresses the Keltans and says that although the five clam- ships they’ve brought to Orbis can’t possibly carry all of them, a fleet fifty times the size will shortly be arriving here as back up. As she orders her troops to round the colony up into manageable groups, she's delighted to see Yanos turning green, the Keltan colour for fear. She reveals that green Keltans are said to make the best food, so in order to ‘prepare’ the prisoners, she gives her troops permission to terrorise them… Still believing that Lucie works for the Headhunter, he's not too surprised when she races out after him. She pleads with him to believe that she really is dying, but it's only when she inadvertently reveals that the TARDIS is also dying and is belching out time waste over the Vortex that she grabs his attention. The Headhunter joins them and points out that something‘s happening on the beach and it smells suspiciously like a barbecue… Crassostrea order her troops to be careful not to burn the Keltans with their electro-spears. She tells Yanos the Molluscari need the waters of Orbis in order to spawn, but before they can do that they need to feast. Selta protests, demanding that they release her bloom-father. She produces the Doctor's sonic screwdriver and activates it. As the Molluscari start to vibrate inside their shells, Selta concentrates its effects on Secretary Saccostrea and within moments the woman is dead. To Yanos's horror, Selta threatens to do the same to Crassostrea unless she honours their bargain. She activates the sonic screwdriver again – but this time the Doctor steps forward and takes the device from her hand, insisting it was meant to be used for protection, not as a weapon. Selta apologises for her actions, but it's too late and the Doctor can’t hide his disappointment in her. Crassostrea suggests they don’t waste any sympathy over Saccostrea as she was planning on eating her later anyway. The Doctor asks Selta to explain what she meant by \\"honouring their bargain\\", and although she avoids the question he already knows the answer. He points out that the readings on the Molluscari data pearl were identical to those shown on the atmospheric scanner, which means they were both taken from the precise same spot on the surface of Orbis. He denounces Selta as a Molluscari agent and she explains that she was forced to help as the Molluscari had predicted Orbis faced a catastrophe that even the Doctor couldn’t save them from and had offered to save a few of her bloom- kin. She herself had already decided to sacrifice herself and stay behind with the Doctor. She pleads with him to forgive her, but he says he only wanted a friend, not someone who was devoted to him. He orders the Molluscari to leave the planet and never return. The Headhunter arrives and points out how ridiculous the Doctor is for thinking he can hold of an entire alien army with one sonic screwdriver. She gives orders for the TARDIS to be brought out from the Molluscari ship and then Crassostrea tells the Doctor he must go and leave the Keltans to their fate. The Doctor insists that Orbis is his home now and he considers the Keltans to be his people, so he refuses to desert them. Lucie eventually joins them and is shocked to discover the Molluscari plan is to eat the jellyfish-people. Crassostrea has heard enough and orders her troops to kill the Doctor and Lucie, but the Headhunter interrupts, pointing out that the Doctor still has the Stellar Manipulator activator and he hasn’t switched it off yet. Lucie makes an impassioned plea for the lives of the Keltans and the Doctor seems to come to his senses, finally remembering who she is and realising how much she must have suffered when she thought he was dead. He also takes the opportunity to remind Selta that he's not really that old, considering how long-lived his race is. He admits that he long ago stopped counting the years and now tends to round his age up or down depending on which part of the Universe he's visiting. He places the Stellar Manipulator activator in his hand and orders the Headhunter to \\"un-shoot\\" Lucie. She agrees and Lucie is returned to normal, but then the Doctor tricks the Headhunter and instead of switching the activator off, he actually increases its power. At first nothing happens, but then suddenly there's a huge clap of thunder and then the entire sky goes completely white. The Keltans start to scream in panic, believing it's the end of their world, and they watch as the entire moon starts crashing towards Orbis. The Headhunter explains that the moon first appeared in tweenspace a few centuries ago when it was tiny. Since then it had been getting bigger and bigger as it was drawn to a spot 50 miles out to sea – where its controller was located. It's not a moon at all, but the Stellar Manipulator engineered by Morbius! It's been dormant for centuries until the Headhunter dragged its activator from the seabed and then the Doctor turned up the power. He tries to switch it off, but the controls are jammed and he can’t reverse the effect. As the oceans start boiling, the Doctor orders Crassostrea to evacuate everyone aboard the clam-ships, but it's too late – thanks to the increase in the ambient temperature, the Molluscari leader is starting to spawn! The rest of the oyster race go into a feeding frenzy and the Headhunter congratulates the Doctor on messing things up so well. She reveals that the Manipulator was being drawn closer to Orbis and was probably only days away from auto-igniting anyway, so all the Doctor has done is speed things up. She urges them to go back to the TARDIS, but the Doctor refuses to leave the Keltans behind. Unfortunately the effect has now become so great that the Keltans, including Yanos and Selta, start dying all around them before anyone can act. To the Doctor's surprise, the Headhunter takes the activator and throws it into the sea where it will be destroyed along with the entire planet. Horrified by what's happening, the Headhunter opens the door to the TARDIS and Lucie urges the Doctor to join them inside – but the Doctor says he gave up the life of a traveller a long time ago and his life here means everything to him. He knows he has to die some day and he seems prepared to accept that today is as good as any. Lucy grabs the gun from the Headhunter and shoots the Doctor with one of the time bullets. Back in the TARDIS, the Headhunter \\"un-shoots\\" the Doctor and he instantly recovers. He's angry with Lucie, who admits that she was acting selfishly. He tells her there are times when people don’t actually want to be saved and she should have respected his wishes, but she argues that she didn’t just do it for herself, but for Earth and the rest of the Universe. She reminds him that his sick TARDIS is destroying the Vortex, but the Headhunter laughs and admits that she made the whole story of time waste up in order to motivate Lucie. Lucie goes to attack her, but she raises the gun again and warns the girl off. The Doctor is determined to return to Orbis, but when he checks the controls he can’t find the planet anywhere. The Headhunter reveals that Orbis has been consumed by the Stellar Manipulator, but with its activator consumed too, the Manipulator has been destroyed as well. The Headhunter ignores the Doctor's anger and points out that while he was happily living on Orbis for 600 years, someone else had to take over saving the Universe. She and her associates are getting sick of it and they’ve now decided that the Universe can’t do without the Doctor. The Doctor insists that he's a different person now, but she says that's a problem he needs to sort out for himself. She says goodbye and teleports from the TARDIS back to her warp ship. Lucie apologises for being so easily tricked, but the Doctor is consumed by guilt for not saving the Keltans. Lucie is sad too, but she reminds him that he used to call Earth his ‘home’ too and there are still plenty of other planets that need saving. Reluctantly, and with nothing better to do, the Doctor sets to co-ordinates for Earth. ==Cast== *The Doctor — Paul McGann *Lucie Miller — Sheridan Smith *Crassostrea — Andrew Sachs *Selta — Laura Solon *The Headhunter — Katarina Olsson *Saccostrea — Beth Chalmers *Yanos — Barry McCarthy ==Production and casting== * This is the first Doctor Who audio to be made available as weekly downloads.

Gaffney was a Tammany Hall alderman and construction company owner. The two were intertwined. Gaffney made his fortune winning contracts that he'd obtained via Tammany and insider dealing. He was one of the closest friends and advisers of Charles Francis Murphy, Tammany's boss. Essie Gaffney was a dear friend of Murphy's wife, Margaret.Jim Gaffney biography at the SABR BioProject The \\"Miracle Braves\\" won the 1914 World Series under Gaffney's ownership. As team owner, he built Braves Field in Boston, which opened in 1915. Gaffney continued to own the stadium, although he never re-entered baseball after 1916 (despite various rumors). His primary pursuit became horseracing.Jim Gaffney biography at the SABR BioProject ==References== *Atlanta Braves owners Category:Baseball executives Category:Boston Braves (baseball) Category:1868 births Category:1932 deaths ","title":"James E.

A food system includes all processes and infrastructure involved in feeding a population: growing, harvesting, processing, packaging, transporting, marketing, consumption, and disposal of food and food-related items. It also includes the inputs needed and outputs generated at each of these steps. A food system operates within and is influenced by social, political, economic, and environmental contexts. It also requires human resources that provide labor, research and education. Food systems are either conventional or alternative according to their model of food lifespan from origin to plate.Development Policy Review, 2003, 21 (5-6): 531-553 Food Policy Old and New - Simon Maxwell and Rachel Slater∗ According to the IPCC, the global food system, including all of the various industries involved in sustainable and conventional food systems, provide employment for 1 billion people. This global food system is facing a number of challenges created by impeding global food security issues created by climate change and non-climate change stresses on the system. Between 21-37% of total greenhouse gas emissions are attributable to the global food system, and in 2020 an EU evidence review found that this is on course to increase by 30–40% by 2050 due to population growth and dietary change. Transitioning to sustainable food systems is an important step to addressing these global challenges. ==Conventional food systems== Conventional food systems operate on economies of scale. These food systems are geared towards a production model that requires maximizing efficiency in order to lower consumer costs and increase overall production, and they utilize economic models such as vertical integration, economic specialization, and global trade. The term “conventional” when describing food systems is in large part due to comparisons made to it by proponents of other food systems, collectively known as alternative food systems. ===History of conventional food systems=== The development of food systems can be traced back to the origins of in-situ agriculture and the production of food surpluses. These surpluses enabled the development of settled areas and contributed to the development of ancient civilizations, particularly those in the Fertile Crescent.(2004); Manning, R.; Against the Grain: How Agriculture Hijacked Civilization, New York:North Point Press The system of trade associated with the exchange of foodstuffs also emerged in East Asia, North America, South America, and Subsaharan Africa with common commodities of exchange such as salt, spices, fish, grains, etc.(1994); Toussaint-Samat, M. and Bell, A.; A History of Food ; Blackwell Publishing Through events in world history such as the conquests of Alexander the Great, the Crusades, the expansion of Islam, the journeys of Marco Polo, and the exploration and colonization of the Americas by Europeans led to the introduction and redistribution of new foods to the world at large, and food systems began to intermingle on a global scale. After World War II, the advent of industrialized agriculture and more robust global trade mechanisms have evolved into the models of food production, presentation, delivery, and disposal that characterizes conventional food systems today.(1998); Welch, R., Graham, R.; \\"A new paradigm for world agriculture: meeting human needs, Productive, sustainable, nutritious\\"; Field Crops Research #60,. ===Impacts of conventional food systems=== Lower food costs and greater food variety can be directly attributed to the evolution of conventional food systems. Agronomic efficiency is driven by the necessity to constantly lower production expenses, and those savings can then be passed on to the consumer. Also, the advent of industrial agriculture and the infrastructure built around conventional food systems has enabled the world population to expand beyond the \\"Malthusian catastrophe\\" limitations.According to the IPCC, food supply per capita has increased by more than 30% since 1961. However, conventional food systems are largely based on the availability of inexpensive fossil fuels, which is necessary for mechanized agriculture, the manufacture or collection of chemical fertilizers, the processing of food products, and the packaging of the foods. The increase in availability of food since 1961 has largely been driven by an 800% increase in use of nitrogen fertilizers (which are fossil fuel dependent) and high water usage (an increase of over 100% since 1961). The impacts of these resource intense processes are many a varied: food processing began when the number of consumers started growing rapidly. The demand for cheap and efficient calories climbed resulting in nutrition decline;Nestle, Marion. (2013). Food Politics: How the Food Industry Influences Nutrition and Health.\\" Los Angeles, California: University of California Press. and industrialized agriculture, due to its reliance on economies of scale to reduce production costs, often leads to the compromising of local, regional, or even global ecosystems through fertilizer runoff, nonpoint source pollution,(1993); Schnitkey, G.D., Miranda, M.; \\"The Impact of Pollution Controls on Livestock Crop producers\\", Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics and greenhouse gas emission. The need to reduce production costs in an increasingly global market can cause production of foods to be moved to areas where economic costs (labor, taxes, etc.) are lower or environmental regulations are more lax, which are usually further from consumer markets. For example, the majority of salmon sold in the United States is raised off the coast of Chile, due in large part to less stringent Chilean standards regarding fish feed and regardless of the fact that salmon are not indigenous in Chilean coastal waters.(2001); Bjorndal, T., \\"The Competitiveness of the Chilean Salmon Aquaculture Industry\\", Foundation for Research in Economics and Business Administration, Bergen, Norway The globalization of food production can result in the loss of traditional food systems in less developed countries, and have negative impacts on the population health, ecosystems, and cultures in those countries.(1996); Kuhnlein, H.V., Receveur, O.; Dietary Change and Traditional Food Systems of Indigenous Peoples; Centre for Nutrition and the Environment of Indigenous Peoples, and School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition, McGill University, Quebec, Canada As a result of these forces, 2018 estimates suggest that 821 million people are currently undernurished, and 2 billion adults are overweight and obese. The issue of having minimal access to food, or access to primarily unhealthy food, are often described in terms of food security. The 1996 World Food Summit defined food security as a state in which \\"all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. \\"Food and Agriculture Organization (November 1996). \\"Rome Declaration on Food Security and World Food Summit Plan of Action\\". Retrieved 26 March 2020. Many groups argue that food security is largely determined by a given person's socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, or other socially defined category, making food access a social justice issue. This has given rise to numerous social movements whose goal is to increase access to healthy and culturally appropriate foods, among a wide variety of groups. These movements are often described as belonging to a larger food justice movement. ==Alternative food systems== Alternative food systems are those that fall outside the scope of conventional agriculture, typically in order to create sustainable food systems. === Local food systems=== Local food systems are networks of food production and consumption that aim to be geographically and economically accessible and direct. They contrast to industrial food systems by operating with reduced food transportation and more direct marketing, leading to fewer people between the farmer and the consumer. As a result, relationships that are developed in local food systems emerge from face-to- face interactions, potentially leading to a stronger sense of trust and social connectedness between actors.Hinrichs, Clare. 2000. \\"Embeddedness and local food systems: notes on two types of direct agricultural market\\" Journal of Rural Studies 16: 295-303 In addition to this, consumers can also encourage farmers to be environmentally friendly by teaching them about practices such as organic farming. As a result, some scholars suggest that local food systems are a good way to revitalize a community.Feenstra, Gail. 1997. \\"Local food systems and sustainable communities\\" American journal of alternative agriculture 12(1) p. 28-36 The decreased distance of food transportation has also been promoted for its environmental benefits.Jones, Andy. 2002. \\"An Environmental Assessment of Food Supply Chains: A Case Study on Dessert Apples\\" Environmental Management 30(4) p. 560-576 Also, farmers can enjoy a better quality of life because producing healthier food will allow them to be paid more, and not live under the poverty line. Both proponents and critics of local food systems warn that they can lead to narrow inward-looking attitudes or ‘local food patriotism’,Bell and Valentine (1997). D. Bell and G. Valentine Consuming Geographies: We are Where We Eat, Routledge, London and New York and that price premiums and local food cultures can be elitist and exclusive.Guthman, Julie. 2004. Agrarian Dreams: the Paradox of Organic Farming in California. Berkeley : University of California Press In contrast, many food sovereignty activists argue that local production of food is essential to achieving food security, especially among indigenous communities, and thus are crucial to the public health of those communities.Murphy, Andi. (2019). Indigenous Food Security is Dependent on Food Sovereignty. Retrieved from https://civileats.com/2019/07/24/indigenous-food-security-is-dependent- on-food-sovereignty/ Examples of local food systems include community- supported agriculture, farmers markets and farm to school programs. They have been associated with the 100 Mile Diet and Low Carbon Diet, as well as the slow food movement. The food sovereignty movement is also related to local food production. Food sovereignty activists argue that local communities should not only have access to nutritious and culturally appropriate foods, but that those communities should also be able to define the means by which their food is produced.Declaration of Nyéléni (2007) Retrieved from https://viacampesina.org/en/declaration-of-nyi/ Various forms of urban agriculture locate food production in densely populated areas not traditionally associated with farming. Garden sharing, where urban and suburban homeowners offer land access to food growers in exchange for a share of the harvest, is a relatively new trend, at the extreme end of direct local food production. ===Organic food systems=== Organic food systems are characterized by a reduced dependence on chemical inputs and an increased concern for transparency and information. Organic produce is grown without the chemical pesticides and fertilizers of industrial food systems, and livestock is reared without the use of antibiotics or growth hormones. The reduced inputs of organic agriculture can also lead to a greater reliance on local knowledge, creating a stronger knowledge community amongst farmers.Morgan, K and J. Murdoch (2000) \\"Organic vs. conventional agriculture: knowledge, power and innovation in the food chain\\" Geoforum 31(2): 159-173Renkin, A.M., K. Lyons and R.C.N. Laurence (2002) in Proceedings from the 14th IFOAM Organic World Congress, Victoria, BC, August 2002 The transparency of food information is vital for organic food systems as a means through which consumers are able to identify organic food.Raynolds, L. (2000) \\"Re-embedding global agriculture: The international organic and fair trade movements\\" Agriculture and Human Values 17(3): 297-309 As a result, a variety of certification bodies have emerged in organic food systems that set the standards for organic identification. Organic agriculture is promoted for the ecological benefits of reduced chemical application, the health benefits of lower chemical consumption, the economic benefits that accrue to farmers through a price premium, and the social benefits of increased transparency in the food system. Like local food systems, organic food systems have been criticized for being elitist and inaccessible. Critics have also suggested that organic agriculture has been conventionalized such that it mimics industrial food systems while using pesticides and fertilizers that are organically derived Altieri, M. and P. Rossett. 1997. \\"Agroecology versus input substitution: A fundamental contradiction of sustainable agriculture\\" Society and Natural Resources 10(3): 283 - 296 ===Cooperatives in food systems=== Cooperatives can exist both at the farmer end of food production and the consumer end. Farming cooperatives refer to arrangements where farmers pool resources, either to cultivate their crops or get their crops to market. Consumer cooperatives often refer to food cooperatives where members buy a share in the store. Co-operative grocery stores, unlike corporate grocery stores, are socially owned and thus surpluses cannot be taken from the store as profit. As a result, food co-ops do not work for profit, potentially keeping prices more cost representative. Other forms of cooperatives that have developed more recently include community-supported agriculture, where community members buy a share in a farm’s harvest, and may also be engaged in farm labour, operating at both the consumer and producer end of food systems. Garden sharing pairs individual landowners and food growers, while variations on this approach organize groups of food gardeners for mutual assistance. The benefits of cooperatives are largely in the redistribution of risk and responsibility. For farming cooperatives that share resources, the burden of investment is disbursed to all members, rather than being concentrated in a single individual. A criticism of cooperatives is that reduced competition can reduce efficiencyDeininger, Klaus (1995) Collective agricultural production: A solution for transition economies?. WorldDevehpmenr, Vol. 23, No. 8, pp. 1317-1334 ===Fair Trade=== Fair trade has emerged in global food systems to create a greater balance between the price of food and the cost of producing it. It is defined largely by more direct trading systems whereby producers have greater control over the conditions of trade and garner a greater fraction of the sale price. The main goal of Fair Trade is to \\"change international commercial relations in such a way that disadvantaged producers can increase their control over their own future, have a fair and just return for their work, continuity of income and decent working and living conditions through sustainable development\\" Fairtrade Foundation (1999). \\"The Fairtrade Foundation.\\" <> Like organic food systems, fair trade relies on transparency and the flow of information.Raynolds, L. (2000) \\"Re- embedding global agriculture: The international organic and fair trade movements\\" Agriculture and Human Values 17(3): 297-309 Well-known examples of fair trade commodities are coffee and cocoa. == Effects of climate change == The IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land describes the current global food system as potentially having major food security risks due to changes created by climate change, including changing local weather conditions, socioeconomic effects of climate change, vulnerability of certain types of agriculture (such as pastoral) and changes in diets due to availability. The food system is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions, attributable for between 21-37% of global emissions.. In 2020, an evidence review for the European Union's Scientific Advice Mechanism found that, without significant change, emissions would increase by 30–40% by 2050 due to population growth and changing consumption patterns, and concluded that \\"the combined environmental cost of food production is estimated to amount to some $12 trillion per year, increasing to $16 trillion by 2050\\". Despite these challenges and the food system's central role in climate change, both the IPCC's and the EU's reports concluded that the food system could be adapted to reduce greenhouse gas emissions impacts and food security concerns, while shifting towards a sustainable diet. == Public policy  European Union === The European Union's Scientific Advice Mechanism has published a systematic review of all European policies related to sustainable food systems, and their analyses in the academic literature. In , the EU's Chief Scientific Advisors stated that adapting the European food system for the future should be a high priority for the EU: In , the EU put improvements to the food system at the core of the European Green Deal. The European Commission's 'Farm to Fork strategy for a sustainable food system', due to be published in spring 2020, is expected to lay out how European countries will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, protect biodiversity, reduce food waste and chemical pesticide use, and contribute to a circular economy. In , the EU's Scientific Advice Mechanism delivered to European Commissioners a Scientific Opinion on how to transition to a sustainable food system, informed by an evidence review report undertaken by European academies. ==Transparency== Transparency within food systems refers to full disclosure of information about rules, procedures and practices at all levels within a food production and supply chain.VonBailey, D., Jones, E., & Dickinson, D. L. (2002). Knowledge Management and Comparative International Strategies on Vertical Information Flow in the Global Food System. Amer. J. Agr. Econ. 87: 1337-1344. Transparency ensures that consumers have detailed information about production of a given food item. Traceability, by contrast, is the ability to trace to their origins all components in a food production and marketing chain, whether processed or unprocessed (e.g., meat, vegetables) foods. Concerns about transparency and traceability have been heightened with food safety scares such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and Escherichia coli (E. coli), but do not exclusively refer to food safety. Transparency is also important in identifying foods that possess extrinsic qualities that do not affect the nature of the food per se, but affect its production, such as animal welfare, social justice issues and environmental concerns.Unnevehr, L. & Roberts, T. (2002). Food safety incentives in a changing world food system. Food Control 13(2):73-76. One of the primary ways transparency is achieved is through certification and/or use of food labels. In the United States, some certification originates in the public sector, such as the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Organic label. Others have their origin in private sector certification (e.g., Humanely Raised, Certified Humane). There are also labels which do not rely on certification, such as the USDA's Country of Origin Label (COOL). Participation in local food systems such as Community Supported Agriculture (CSA), Farmers Markets, food cooperatives and farmer cooperatives also enhances transparency, and there are diverse programs promoting purchase of locally grown and marketed foods. ===Labeling=== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - valign=\\"top\\"  style=\\"width:30pt;\\" USDA Organic Label  style=\\"width:400pt;\\"Organic (USA) – The USDA Organic label indicates that the product has been produced in accordance with the USDA's Federal Organic Standard.

A Nisqually tribal member, Frank is known specifically for his grassroots campaign for fishing rights on the tribe's Nisqually River, located in Washington state, in the 1960s and 1970s. He is also known for promoting cooperative management of natural resources. The tribal nations in western Washington reserved the right to fish at all their usual and accustomed places in common with all citizens of the United States, and to hunt and gather shellfish in treaties with the U.S. government negotiated in the mid-1850s.http://nwtreatytribes.org/treaties/ But when tribal members tried to exercise those rights off-reservation they were arrested for fishing in violation of state law. Frank Jr. had his first run in with game wardens in 1945 at the age of fourteen. The teenager had been fishing as he always had for salmon, and as he was emptying his net he was accosted by two wardens who shoved his face into the mud as he struggled. The tensions from the declining fish populations in the 1940s had begun to boil over. The unregulated commercial boats and development of hydroelectric equipment had begun to take its toll on the salmon, and the white sportsmen laid the blame at the Native's feet. As the numbers of salmon continued to decline, in 1965 the pressure between Native and non-Native fishermen turned violent as women and children of the Nisqually tribe protested alongside the fishermen and several Natives were bloodied. For Frank Jr. the battle for the salmon was personal, treaty rights had to be recognized for not only the Native right to fish a guaranteed number of the salmon population, but the right to maintain ecosystems that would continue to guarantee a healthy yield of fish year after year. Frank was arrested more than 50 times in the Fish Wars of the 1960s and 1970s because of his intense dedication to the treaty fishing rights cause. The tribal struggle was taken to the courts in U.S. v. Washington, with federal judge George Hugo Boldt issuing a ruling in favor of the native tribes in 1974. The Boldt Decision established the 20 treaty Indian tribes in western Washington as co- managers of the salmon resource with the State of Washington, and re-affirmed tribal rights to half of the harvestable salmon returning to western Washington. What started as a war over numbers has morphed into a fight for conservation and habitat protection. Because of the trail blazing achieved by Frank Jr.'s activism tribes have begun to work more closely with government officials in a joint effort to conserve natural resources. The foundations that Frank Jr. laid, in conjunction with the acknowledgement of tribal rights as defined in their treaties with the United States of America, has allowed the beginnings of a working inter-government partnership between the two groups to develop. Frank was chairman of the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission, a position he held for more than 30 years. He died on May 5, 2014. In November 2015, President Barack Obama announced that Frank would receive a posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom. The following month, the Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge was renamed in Frank's honor. Billy Frank Jr. was and continues to be an important bridge between Western and Native American societies in a time where environmental sustainability affects us all, regardless of differences in cultural background and beliefs. ==Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission== The Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission (NWIFC) was created in 1975 to support the natural resource management activities of the 20 treaty Indian tribes in western Washington. The NWIFC is based in Olympia, Washington, with satellite offices in Forks and Mount Vernon. Frank has chaired the NWIFC since 1981. The commission's 65-person staff supports member tribes in efforts ranging from fish health to salmon management planning and habitat protection. The NWIFC also acts as a forum for tribes to address issues of mutual concern, and as a mechanism for tribes to speak with a unified voice in Washington, D.C. ==Titles== Frank has held several different titles his career. *1975-1988 - Fisheries Manager, Nisqually Indian Tribe. *1977, 1981–2014 - Chairman, Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission (NWIFC). *1977–2014 - Commissioner, Medicine Creek Treaty Area in the NWIFC. *1996-2003 - Member of Board of Trustees of The Evergreen State College. *2003-2014 - Founding Board Member, Salmon Defense (a 501(c)3 whose mission is to \\"protect and defend Pacific Northwest salmon and salmon habitat.\\") ==Awards== *Common Cause Award (1985), for his human rights efforts *Washington State Environmental Excellence Award (1987), on behalf of the State Ecological Commission and other tribes. *American Indian Distinguished Service Award (1989) *Martin Luther King Jr. Distinguished Service Award (1990), for humanitarian achievement *Albert Schweitzer Prize for Humanitarianism (1992) *American Indian Visionary Award (2004), from Indian Country Today for \\"exceptional contributions to Indian American freedom.\\" *Dan Evans Stewardship Award (2006) * Seattle Aquarium Medal (2011) * Medal of Merit (2015) ==Presidential Medal of Freedom== In November 2015, Frank was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama in a ceremony at the White House.Phil Helsel - \\"Obama honoring Spielberg, Streisand and more with medal of freedom,\\" NBC News, November 24, 2015.

Created and introduced by former head writer Maria Arena Bell, the character made her debut during the episode that aired on September 22, 2008. The role was originally portrayed by Erin Sanders, who was let go shortly after her debut due to the negative response her portrayal received. The role was recast with Vanessa Marano, who took over soon after and portrayed the role for two years until January 2010. In June 2011, the role was recast a second time with Jessica Heap, who also portrayed the role for two years until January 2013. Eden is the half-sister of Michael Baldwin (Christian LeBlanc) and the \\"defiant teenage daughter\\" of River Baldwin (Michael Gross). Her storylines have involved romances with Noah Newman (Kevin Schmidt), Daniel Romalotti (Michael Graziadei), and Kyle Abbott (Blake Hood), as well as a rivalry with Abby Newman (Marcy Rylan). == Casting == The character of Eden was first portrayed by former Zoey 101 star Erin Sanders. On her casting of the role, Sanders said, \\"I definitely wasn't expecting [the role to be so dramatic]. The audition sides were light and fun. I had no idea that this was all in store for me. I'm pleased, though, because I love this sort of thing.\\" Sanders departed shortly after her debut due to lack of positive reviews with her portrayal, and was last seen on November 19, 2008. The role was recast with Vanessa Marano, who debuted on December 3, 2008. Marano vacated the role just over a year later, and she was last seen as Eden on January 22, 2010. In June 2011, it was reported by multiple sources that the role has been recast again with Jessica Heap, who debuted on June 28, 2011. Of her first day, Heap stated: \\"When I worked my first day, I was shooting two episodes, all back to back. So it was a lot of dialogue, a lot of material and it really helped having someone there who was like 'Here's what's happening,' as it was going on. For me, I'm just loving it, because I’m learning from people like Christian and these other great actors and I’m learning new skills.\\" However, after a year in the role, it was announced that Heap was to exit the soap. Heap, who was let go by the show, confirmed on January 11, 2013 via Twitter that she had wrapped up filming, and described her experience as an \\"unforgettable ride\\". == Character development == When asked her take on Eden's character, Marano said: \\"Well, obviously, she's kind of tough, she has to be tough, with the life that she's been living on the Ashram with her dad, it can't be easy, but also, I think there's such a softness to her inside, because she grew up not really knowing her mom and the connection that she feels to her dad gives her a softness because he's the only one - yet she feels kind of abandoned by him. So, in the situation she's been thrown in with Michael and Lauren, she's very difficult at first with them, but she really, really, wants this situation to stick. She wants to find some way to connect and not feel abandoned by anybody.\\" When Eden returned to Genoa City in 2011, she was said to have come back as a \\"more mature, centered young woman.\\" Heap said: \\"Eden was in high school then, so she was obviously involved in all that angst teenage stuff. Now, she's a young adult, so that dynamic has changed, but Lauren and Michael are having a hard time not playing those guardian roles. I like that Eden wants to be her own person and I really enjoy bringing that feistiness to her. Since being in a relationship with Noah, living in Paris and then going to rehab for an eating disorder, she has to be a different person.\\" ==StorylinesBackstory=== River Baldwin, ex- husband of Gloria Bardwell and absentee father of Michael Baldwin, was first seen onscreen in 2008, and was rumored to have a daughter in which he raised on an Ashram. River's daughter arrived in town, operating under the alias Eden Gerick. She became acquainted with brother Michael, and his wife Lauren. Eventually, Eden began using Baldwin as her last name, and when River left town on the run, Eden stayed in Genoa City and began dating Noah Newman. ===2008–10=== While in Genoa City, Eden developed a romantic relationship with Noah Newman, but their families were against it. They continued seeing each other in secret until they gained the approval of their families. Upon being mysteriously contacted by estranged relatives, she decided to leave Genoa City to reconnect with them in Paris. Noah went with her on her trip to Europe. It was later revealed that Daisy Carter had framed Eden for sending Lauren Fenmore Baldwin a rat and for keeping newspaper clippings of Sheila Carter in her school binder. Daisy was also responsible for putting Eden and her relatives in contact in order to drive her away from Genoa City because of her suspicion that Daisy was not who she seemed. Noah and Eden continued their love affair in Paris, but at some point, the relationship fell apart off- screen; Noah returned to Genoa City, but Eden decided to remain in Paris. ===2011–13=== Later, it was revealed that Eden did not stay in Paris as long as she said she did. In reality, she went to rehab for an eating disorder that she developed while overseas. Eden was at the same rehab in Connecticut that Abby Newman was sent to by her father, Victor Newman. Even though Eden wanted to avoid Abby, she was forced to become her \\"buddy\\" and show her around. Abby told Eden that she should come back to Genoa City. After Abby left rehab only a few days after she checked in, Eden decided to cancel her flight back to Paris and book a new one to Genoa City. She was reunited with sister-in-law Lauren Fenmore Baldwin, and was also confronted by her ex-boyfriend, Noah. Eden being back in town was a happy surprise to her family, in particular Michael. Eden and Noah became friends, though it was obvious he still had feelings for her. Noah even attempted to kiss her—but Eden stopped him, feeling it wasn't the best thing for them to do. Eden, too, had feelings to Noah—she was often seen looking on jealously as Noah hung out with his new friend in town, Hunter. Eden later began working at Crimson Lights jealous that Noah had offered Hunter the job. Eden later became friends with Daniel Romalotti, bonding over sulking over their lost loves, Noah and Lily Winters. Daniel proposed that the two of them go out and have some fun. After seeing a movie, the pair went back to Daniel apartment. Eden commented on one of Daniel's paintings that he made while he was with Lily. The two began to destroy the painting by covering it in black paint. A paint fight ensued, leading to their first kiss. Eden and Daniel had sex on the floor of Daniel's apartment, even after Kevin told Daniel to stay away from his sister. Eden told Daniel that their relationship was \\"no strings attached\\". On Christmas Eve, Eden was present for Kevin's almost-wedding to Chloe, making sure to stay close to the best man, Daniel. Eden gets the shock of her life when she catches her new romance Ricky Williams cheating on her with Daisy Carter, unaware that Ricky had been recruited by Phyllis Newman to get close to Daisy so that Daniel can get full custody of his daughter, Lucy. Eden let Ricky move in with her after Kevin married Chloe, though she eventually asked him to move out as she felt he was dangerous and creepy; she told Ricky that an old girlfriend was coming from California and needed a place to stay. To her dismay, Ricky moved into Daisy's old apartment across the hall. Eden then let ex-boyfriend Noah move in temporarily as he needed a place to stay, and she needed to prove to Ricky that someone would be taking his place as roommate. When Daisy went missing, Eden was sure that Ricky was involved due to all the time they spent together. Others were skeptical of Ricky's involvement, and thus Eden went to his hotel suite and found Daisy's cell phone and wallet there. She text messaged Kevin to meet her as she had \\"big news,\\" though before they could do so Ricky found out Eden found Daisy's belongings, and said he now needed to kill her. He chased her into the bathroom where she hit her head on the bathtub. Ricky's father Paul Williams arrived and shot his own son to prevent him from killing Eden. Eden regained consciousness moments after, but suffered memory loss that could help exonerate Paul from Ricky's death. When Paul decided to plead guilty to killing his son, Heather Stevens suggested hypnosis to Eden to help her remember the night of Ricky's death, which proved unsuccessful. Eden later starts remembering bits and pieces of what happened the night of Ricky's death through her dreams. At the conclusion of the storyline, Eden simply stopped appearing with no mention of her current whereabouts. ==References *Character Profile at The Young and the Restless official site *Character Profile at Soap Central Category:The Young and the Restless characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2008 Category:Female characters in television Category:Fictional waiting staff ","title":"Eden Baldwin"},{"id":"20548616","text":"The Dominican Summer Phillies are a minor league baseball team in the Dominican Summer League.

It is distributed through the south-east of Australia, from southern Queensland to South Australia, as well as Tasmania.Wildlife of Sydney - Fact File - Red Eye Populations can vary greatly between years; one year they may be present in large numbers and the next they may be entirely absent. They feed primarily on eucalyptus but also on Angophora trees. As they feed on tree sap they expel small droplets of clear waste fluid. When numbers are high, this can form a constant stream. ==Taxonomy== The redeye was originally described by German naturalist Ernst Friedrich Germar in 1834 as Cicada moerens, and later transferred to the new genus Psaltoda, where it was designated the type species by Swedish entomologist Carl Stål. Walter Wilson Froggatt reported that the common name was used by Sydney children in his 1907 work Australian Insects, referring to the colour of the ocelli. ==Description== The typical wingspan is around 110–120 mm. The adult is a shiny black above and brown and finely hairy underneath. As the name implies, the eyes are a deep red colour, although pinkish- and brownish-eyed specimens are seen. Heard at any time of day, the call consists of two to twelve (often around six) revving sounds with a yodelling quality, followed by a rattling continuous call. The redeye makes the yodelling sound by flexing its abdomen upwards. ==Distribution and habitat== Encountered from November to February only, the redeye is found from the New England region of south-east Queensland through New South Wales and into Victoria and south-eastern South Australia, and Eastern and Northern Tasmania. It is found from the coast inland to Toowoomba and Inverell in the north, and the Grampians and Mount Lofty Ranges in the south. It is found at elevation in the northern parts of its range, and at low altitudes in the southern parts. It appears only irregularly, in some summers and not others, in western Sydney. The redeye prefers open sclerophyll forest, in particular smooth-barked eucalypts and Angophora species, but will settle for rough-barked species if more suitable trees are not available. Species favoured include Sydney red gum or smooth-barked apple (Angophora costata), scribbly gum (Eucalyptus racemosa), grey box (E. moluccana) and narrow-leaved apple (Angophora bakeri) around Sydney, Eucalyptus grandis in the vicinity of Taree, manna gum (Eucalyptus viminalis), and messmate stringybark (Eucalyptus obliqua) near Adelaide. It has also settled for introduced trees such as the liquidambar (Liquidambar styraciflua), Japanese maple (Acer palmatum), and weeping willow (Salix babylonica). Redeyes settle on the trunks of smoother barked trees, and wherever the bark is smoothest on rougher trees, and may gather in large numbers on some trees while ignoring others nearby. In some cases many thousands of redeyes may inhabit a few trees. ==Behaviour== They puncture the bark and may feed for hours at a time. They expel waste fluid which can fall in a constant shower if there are large numbers of redeyes. Redeyes are also attracted to light. The female lays eggs in dead or dying plant tissue only. The redeye and related black prince are favoured food items of the noisy friarbird, which swallows them head-first and whole. The width of its gape size is similar to that of the two cicada species. The redeye is preyed upon by the cicada killer wasp (Exeirus lateritius), which stings and paralyses the cicada before storing it in its burrow with the wasp egg. When the larva hatches it consumes the hapless insect.Moulds, p. 10 ==References== Category:Psaltodini Category:Hemiptera of Australia Category:Insects described in 1834 ","title":"Psaltoda moerens"},{"id":"20548738","text":"Palatrussardi, later known as PalaVobis, was an indoor arena located in Milan, Italy.

The film stars B. D. Wong and Bronson Pinchot. Its plot concerns a group of children who try to save an abused sea lion from a greedy circus owner. ==Plot== At prestigious private school Dartmoor Academy, Principal Morgan Brinway is forcing the second-graders to study opera appreciation. Five feisty kids (leader Sonny, contraption making Loaf, movie loving Domino, sympathetic albeit tough Lucy, and the reluctant participating Witz), nicknamed the \\"Stinkers\\" by Mr. Brinway, are secretly skipping class to create chaos on the school grounds. Witz becomes the test pilot for a flying chair, one of Sonny's newest ideas. The Stinkers go to Groundskeeper Roy's shed and steal his leaf blower. Before that, they stole Mr. Brinway's desk chair. The Stinkers fail to notice that the leaf blower was not entirely duct taped onto the desk chair. When turned it on, the leaf blower flew off the contraption but left Witz sitting in the chair. The leaf blower was heading straight for Mr. Brinway's new convertible, but the leaf blower ran out of gas before it could destroy the car. However, Roy accidentally obliterates the car's side door with his lawn mower's edging blade. Mr. Brinway warns the Stinkers they will be expelled if they mess up one more time, but they soon rebel while trying to keep a low profile and are involved in even more misadventures. When the kids discover sea lion Slappy during an aquarium field trip, Sonny and the others decide to free him by smuggling him back onto the school bus and hide him in Mr. Brinway's hot tub; as a form of celebrating their success, they have a party. After Mr. Brinway arrives home earlier than usual, the Stinkers retrieve Slappy and hide him at Witz's house. Roy mistakes the sea lion for a giant gopher and sets out to kill him. Animal broker Anthony Boccoli plans to steal Slappy and sell him to a Bulgarian circus, but some of his attempts to catch Slappy fail. The next day, the Stinkers take Slappy with them to the beach so they can set him free, but Slappy refuses to leave. The kids discover there was an orca (which they assume is Willy from Free Willy) swimming nearby and that's why Slappy didn't want to go in the water since orcas eat sea lions. Sonny decides they should return Slappy to the aquarium, but they have to first attend a festival at Dartmoor. Roy tries to dispose of Slappy which causes the festival attractions to get ruined. Assuming this was caused by the Stinkers, Mr. Brinway expels them. The Stinkers discover that Boccoli kidnapped Slappy, which prompts the kids to set off on a rescue mission. The group locates Boccoli's hideout and disposes of him by squirting him with water, blowing sawdust onto his body and shooting him with Roy's gopher bomb gun. After saving Slappy, the Stinkers get chased by Boccoli. Mr. Brinway and the class go on a hiking field trip to look at birds, which gets interrupted when the Stinkers crash through and Mr. Brinway becomes part of the getaway. After being chased to a log flume, the Stinkers and Mr. Brinway escape Boccoli by going down it; Boccoli tries to drown the group by turning on the flume, but the water is blocked by a beaver's nest and once he removes it, a beaver bites him and the water splashes him, causing him to slide down the spillway. The Stinkers, Slappy and Mr. Brinway safely land into the lake below, whereas Boccoli falls onto a floating log. Roy, who is also the school bus driver, ties a rope around Boccoli. Slappy is returned to the aquarium, Mr. Brinway withdraws the Stinkers' expulsion and they become heroes. ==Cast== *B. D.

By then the company had twenty-six licensed elevators, sixteen of which were in Saskatchewan. In 1921, Pioneer had expanded to over 100 country elevators. In 1931, forty-four elevators of the Saskatchewan and Western Elevator companies were amalgamated into Pioneer; these elevators had been operated by the Richardsons since the mid-1920s. In 1947, Pioneer acquired twenty-three elevators from the failed Reliance Grain Company. In 1952, Pioneer purchased 146 elevators when the Western Grain Elevator Company was sold; Federal Grain also took some of Western’s elevators. In 1953, Pioneer acquired another twenty-two elevators of the Independent line. In 1972, when Federal was sold in 1972, Pioneer became the largest private grain company. In 1979, a112,000-metric tonne Pioneer Grain port terminal was officially opened in Vancouver. It was capable of loading ships at 140,000-bushels per hour. In the 1990s, Richardson Pioneer built numerous concrete grain terminals across the prairies. These modern facilities were much larger and more efficient than the old wooden elevators. Most wooden elevators were closed and have since been torn down. In 1994 the first terminal was constructed at Glossop, Manitoba. Terminals were also constructed at Lamont, Carseland, Swift Current, North Battleford, Lloydminster, Saskatoon, Melfort, Tisdale, Southey, Balgonie, Weyburn, Whitewood, Foam Lake, Brunkild, Brandon. In 2005, a large growth and acquisition process began in 2005 with the purchase of 4 terminals from ConAgra Foods and 4 adjoining crop input centres were purchased from United Agri Products in 2006. In 2007, James Richardson International was involved in a bidding war with Saskatchewan Wheat Pool over the purchase of Agricore United in 2007. Although unsuccessful, through the deal Richardson acquired grain elevators in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, and was paid a $35 million termination fee from Agricore.Staff Writer. \\"Sask. Wheat Pool, Agricore agree on new takeover deal.\\" CBC. May 9, 2007. In a 2008 Rebranding, James Richardson International was rebranded as Richardson International and Pioneer Grain became Richardson Pioneer. From 2010 to 2012, Richardson Pioneer continued to expand the Western Canadian footprint with the purchase of 5 crop input centres and 1 grain terminal in Alberta plus 3 crop input centres and 1 grain terminal in Saskatchewan. The Saskatchewan purchases were all part Northeast Terminals a local farmer owned facility. In March 2012, Richardson International along with Glencore and Agrium announced they were purchasing Viterra in a 3-way split of that company. Richardson would acquire 19 grain elevators, the oat and wheat milling business in Canada and the US, a terminal in Thunder Bay and a share of Cascadia terminal in Vancouver. This deal closed May 1, 2013. In 2013, Richardson Pioneer celebrated their 100th year with celebrations across Western Canada. From 2013 to 2016, the company constructed new terminals were constructed in Estevan, Dauphin along with a large addition to the Vancouver export facility. In 2017, the company acquired Crop First Agro in Grenfell, SK, as well as European Oat Millers in Bedford, England; becoming Richardson Milling UK. Richardson International's first mill outside of North America. ===Richardson Oilseeds and Richardson Milling=== In 1999 Canbra Foods in Lethbridge was acquired. Canola crushing as well as packaging oils and margarine happen here. The Canola Harvest brand is Richardson's retail brand of products. In 2008, Canbra Foods was rebranded. The canola crushing operations became known as Richardson Oilseeds and the food manufacturing business became known as Richardson Nutrition. Richardson Oilseeds opened a new canola crushing plant in Yorkton, Saskatchewan in July 2010. At the time of opening this plant was designed for 2,300 mt per day. In 2014, an expansion will be completed for 3,000 mt per day to be processed. In 2011 Richardson Nutrition purchased Innovative Foods in Mississauga, Ont and Sussex, New Brunswick to further expand its canola oil packaged goods business. An $15 million expansion of the packaging plant in Lethbridge was started this same year. On May 1, 2013 a new division was formed as part of the Viterra transaction - Richardson Milling. In June 2015, Richardson purchased Golden Gate Margarine- a retail packaging business based on Oakville, Ontario adding to the Richardson Nutrition locations. ==References *Richardson International website *James Richardson & Sons website *Canola Harvest website Category:Companies based in Winnipeg Category:Agriculture companies of Canada Category:Grain elevators Category:Agriculture in Saskatchewan ","title":"Richardson International"},{"id":"20549071","text":"View of the steeple from the north Main portal View of the choir screen and the organ The Saint-Pierre-le-Jeune Protestant Church (Église protestante Saint-Pierre-le-Jeune) View of church is one of the most important church buildings of the city of Strasbourg, France, from the art historical and architectural viewpoints. It got its name, \\"Young St. Peter's\\", because of the existence of three other St. Peter's churches in the same city: Saint-Pierre- le-Vieux (\\"Old St. Peter's\\"), divided into a Catholic and a Lutheran church, and Saint-Pierre-le-Jeune catholique, a massive neo-Romanesque domed church from the late 19th century. The church has been Lutheran since 1524 and its congregation forms part of the Protestant Church of Augsburg Confession of Alsace and Lorraine. It is located on the Route Romane d'Alsace. ==Architecture and furnishings== *The oldest part of the church is the small lower church used as a burial crypt, which is the remains of a Columban church erected in the 7th century. *Three of the four arched galleries of the cloister date from the 11th century, the fourth arched gallery is from the 14th century.View of 14th-century arcade *The Gothic main building, with its numerous chapels and the lavish rib vaultView of nave dates from the 14th century.

Helmut Walcha recorded a large part of his performances of Bach's organ works here. The pulpit also dates from the same century, as well as another altar. *Between 1897 and 1901, the church, which had fallen into disrepair, was fundamentally overhauled by the Karlsruhe architect Carl Schäfer, one of the most important representatives of neo- Gothic sacred architecture in Germany. At that time, the entrance was moved to the side and a new main portal was created, a copy of the northern entrance of the facade of the Strasbourg Cathedral. The cloisters were painted in polychrome, following the example of the Hortus Deliciarum.View of polychrome painting in cloisters The life-sized baptismal angel statue, along with the chapel and the choir glass windows,View of glass windows also date from this time. An organ built in 1762 by Johann Andreas Silbermann in the Catholic part of the two-part church of that time was transferred in 1865 to the St. Moriz Church of the parish of Soultz-les-Bains. There, it has been restored to its 1848 condition, a compromise between the original baroque Silbermann settings and the later Romantic tone and harmonic extensions, by the family of Alfred Kern & fils between 2006 and 2008.

He is currently the leader of the opposition SPD party bloc in the Hessian state parliament. He lost his bid for the office of Minister-President of Hesse in the January 2009 Hessian state election, where he had challenged incumbent Roland Koch (CDU). Schäfer-Gümbel has been deputy leader of the SPD since December 2013. He is one of three ad interim successors of former SPD leader Andrea Nahles in the transition phase until a new leader will be voted in later in 2019. ==Life== Schäfer-Gümbel was born to a West German soldier stationed in the far south of Bavaria in Oberstdorf. However, he grew up in Hesse in the city of Gießen. He briefly studied Agrarian Science at Justus-Liebig-University Gießen, after which he changed to Political Science. Supported by a scholarship of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, he graduated with a Master's degree in 1997, he took various minor political positions. He is married and has three children. ==Career== Schäfer- Gümbel was involved with the Social and Youth department of Gießen from the late 1990s. He became a local adviser to the SPD, a party which he had joined at the age of 17, and was also a local delegate of the SPD in the local government (Kreistag) in Gießen. He quickly moved up the ranks in the Hessian SPD party machine, and was a candidate on the SPD party list during the 2003 Landtag election. He gained a seat in 2003, and has been a member of the Hessian Landtag ever since. He was re-elected in the 2008 Landtag election and in the 2009 special election; however he was elected as part of the party list and not on a direct mandate, as he lost his local race to the CDU candidate. In late 2008, following a political crisis and Andrea Ypsilanti's resignation, Schäfer-Gümbel became the SPD's party leader in Hesse and the SPD candidate for minister-president of Hesse. However, the SPD fared poorly in the subsequent 2009 special election, which allowed the CDU's Roland Koch to remain in office. Schäfer-Gümbel has been party leader of the opposition SPD since 29 January 2009. Schäfer-Gümbel was a delegate to the Federal Convention for the purpose of electing the President of Germany in 2009, 2010, 2012 and 2017. In the negotiations to form a Grand Coalition of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU together with the Bavarian CSU) and the SPD following the 2013 federal elections, Schäfer-Gümbel was part of the SPD delegation in the working group on energy policy, led by Peter Altmaier and Hannelore Kraft.Die SPD in den Arbeitsgruppen Social Democratic Party of Germany, press release of 23 October 2013.

Gastric tonometry has been introduced as a novel method of monitoring tissue perfusion in critically ill patients. Tonometry is based on the principle that at equilibrium the partial pressure of a diffusible gas such as CO2 is the same in both the wall and lumen of a viscus. The technique therefore can estimate gut mucosal PCO2 by measuring gut luminal PCO2 at equilibrium. A saline-filled balloon made of CO2 permeable silicone attached to a sampling tube is introduced into the gastric lumen as a nasogastric tube would be. After an equilibration period the fluid is sampled to measure PCO2. Because the mucosal and systemic bicarbonate concentrations are equal, a modified Henderson-Hasselbalch equation may be used to calculate the intramucosal pH: pHi = 6.1 + log [HCO3−/0.03 x PCO2]. Thus, only gastric luminal PCO2 is directly measured. Mucosal PCO2 is presumed to be proportional at equilibrium and mucosal pH is calculated. PO2 and luminal pH play no role in these calculations. Proponents of this technique maintain that it is a relatively inexpensive noninvasive, tissue-specific method to evaluate the adequacy of tissue perfusion. It is of special value when used in the gastric lumen because splanchnic circulation is one of the vascular beds that is subject to early blood flow redistribution in shock states. Critics of the technique caution that while directly measured factors are usually accurate and calculated factors correspondingly reliable, the assumption that gut mucosal pH alterations are uniquely a function of mucosal hypoxia is not. Tonometry may adequately reflect the degree of tissue perfusion, but its accuracy as an index of tissue oxygenation is less reliable. The measurement of gut mucosal carbon dioxide has been used to detect decreased blood flow. Accumulation of carbon dioxide is predominantly a result of hypoperfusion and not hypoxia. Because the introduction of a nasogastric tube is almost routine in critically ill patients, the measurement of gastric carbon dioxide can be an easy method to monitor tissue perfusion. The gastric mucosal pH is measured according to an equation that assumes that arterial bicarbonate is equal to intramucosal bicarbonate, an argument that is not always valid. Given that the gastric mucosal carbon dioxide is the directly measured value, whereas the gastric mucosal pH is the derived and possibly inaccurate value, studies that used gastric pH to monitor perfusion may be inherently flawed. Most studies have failed to effectively affect gastric pH and for this reason failed to produce improvements in outcome. One study, by Gutierrez and colleagues, has shown that therapeutic interventions guided by gastric tonometry improved survival in critically ill patients. In a direct comparison of splanchnic- oriented therapy as guided by gastric tonometry with conventional shock management of trauma patients, there was no difference in mortality rates, organ dysfunction rates, or length of stay. After a surge in popularity, the use of gastric tonometry waned and it is currently found with less frequency in surgical ICUs. ==See also== * Tonometry == References == Category:Medical tests ","title":"Gastric tonometry"},{"id":"20549324","text":"Justice Wayne Haylen Wayne Roger Haylen QC is a Judge of the New South Wales Industrial Court. ==Education== Haylen was educated at Canterbury Boys High School before attending the University of Sydney.

Sugarcane plantations were expected to make ethanol, possibly using fermentation of sugars from a fast-growing variety of sugarcane or cassava, or using cellulosic processed to convert fiber such as bagasse from other parts of the plant. Studies indicated that enough cane could be grown to meet the estimated ethanol demand of about 40 million gallons per year. Pacific West proposed to run an ethanol plant and a waste to electricity plant on Kauai and even reached a power agreement with Kauai Electric in 2008. ===University of Hawaii Algae Research=== The University of Hawaii is researching thermophilic algae by La Wahie to make ethanol. Sun makes algae grow faster in the tropics and animal feed may be available from process leftovers. is absorbed by the catalyst. ===Big Island proposal=== Several other ideas were proposed on the island of Hawaii where former cane fields lie fallow. One company wanted to use the wood grown in old cane areas that were planted with eucalyptus. High costs are an obstacle. ===Kimo Sutton and Diamond Head Renewables=== Diamond Head Renewable Resources LLC (DHRR) proposed to make alcohol fuels, including ethanol, from garbage, biomass green waste, or landfill methane. The syngas (synthesis gas) would be converted by catalysts to fuels, or the Syngas could be burned to generate electricity. The plant was projected to produce over 10 megawatts of power, for its own use and for the grid. The plant would have used 350 dry tons a day to make product and electricity, producing 12 million gallons of a mix of ethanol, methanol and other alcohols a year. The process and technology was similar to a proposal by Clear Fuels, without the sugar to ethanol element. ==Tax benefits and constraints== Food-based ethanol projects have had financial difficulty, because the incentives from the Farm act of 2008 emphasize cellulosic biomass to ethanol. Incentives include a $1/gallon tax credit, loan guarantees, and grants or funds available for small operations. State incentives include tax incentives and a business development department. ==See also== *Energy in Hawaii ==References== * DBEDT Hawai'i- energy * Websites of Gay and Robinson * Clear Fuels * US Dept. of Energy * La Wahie * Ethanol Producer Magazine Oct. 2008 * https://web.archive.org/web/20080624060143/http://www.hawaiiethanol.com/ * Pacific West Energy * Diamond Head Renewable Resources Category:Biofuel in the United States Category:Ethanol fuel Category:Energy in Hawaii ","title":"Ethanol fuel in Hawaii"},{"id":"20549353","text":"The Ontario Scotties Tournament of Hearts is the Ontario provincial curling championship for women's curling. The tournament is run by CurlON, the curling association for Southern Ontario. The winning team represents Southern Ontario at the national Scotties Tournament of Hearts. National champions are indicated in bold. Teams from Northern Ontario are indicated in italics, as prior to 2015, Northern Ontario did not have their own provincial championship. National champions get an automatic bye into the following years' national championships, so they cannot defend their provincial championship. A national championship has been held since 1962, although the provincial women's championship has been held since 1956. ==Winners== { - !
