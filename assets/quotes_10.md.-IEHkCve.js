In December 1969, Rivera teamed with Tony Marino at Madison Square Garden to win the WWWF International Tag Team Championship in 2 straight falls from Professor Toru Tanaka and Mitsu Arakawa. Rivera and Marino defended the belts successfully against teams like Killer Kowalski & Waldo Von Erich, as well as Kowalski & Krippler Karl Kovacs. They lost the championship against another undefeated team, The Mongols (Bepo and Geto Mongol) on June 15, 1970, 2 falls to 1 at Madison Square Garden. On May 13, 1975, Rivera and Dominic DeNucci won the WWWF World Tag Team Championship from The Valiant Brothers.

It is located at the southeast foot of the mountain group known as the Golden Ears and is about 16 km in length on a northeast-southwest axis. It and the Alouette River, formerly the Lillooet River, were renamed in 1914 to avoid confusion with the larger river and lake farther north, with \\"Alouette\\", the French word for \\"lark\\", being chosen as being melodious and reminiscent of the original name in tone. Most of the basin of Alouette Lake has never been logged and its north flank is protected as part of Golden Ears Provincial Park (formerly part of Garibaldi Provincial Park until that park's division). A small portion of the lake and its largely inaccessible northwestern shore, near its narrows, are actually part of the District of Mission due to the rectangular shape of that district's boundary. North of the portion of the lake that is in Mission, the rest of its northern end is not in either municipality. ==Alouette Dam== Originally only 2 km in length, the lake was considerably expanded by the 1928 construction of the Alouette Dam at , which is along the upper reaches of the South Alouette River. A long tunnel connects Alouette Lake and Stave Lake. At the end of the tunnel is a penstock which feeds the small Alouette Powerhouse, an 8 MW power station operated by BC Hydro, which lies midway along the west shore of Stave Lake. There is no powerhouse at the dam, however, as the point of the reservoir is to feed the tunnel through the flank of the ridge between Mounts Crickmer and Robie Reid. A former railway grade leading to the dam along the river was also used as a logging railway. ==Facilities== A large public beach, picnic site and campground that are part of the provincial park are located on the lake's western shore. ==References== * Category:Lakes of the Lower Mainland Category:Maple Ridge, British Columbia Category:Mission, British Columbia Category:Reservoirs in British Columbia ","title":"Alouette Lake"},{"id":"20334722","text":"Johann Georg Macasius (1617–1653) was a German physician.

It was to have its grand opening on 1 May 1986, in time for the May Day celebrations, but these plans were cancelled on 26 April, when the Chernobyl disaster occurred a few kilometers away. Several sources report that the park was opened for a short time on 27 April before the announcement to evacuate the city was made, and one site shows photos of the amusement park in operation.Article on Chernobyl by Graham Gilmore showing photos of the amusement park in operation Theories that the park was hurriedly opened in the aftermath of the accident to distract Pripyat residents from the unfolding disaster nearby seem to be substantiated by video showing that some of the rides were never fully completed (the Paratrooper was not fitted with canopies and the Ferris wheel's cladding was incompleteYouTube video taken shortly after evacuation in 1986. Retrieved 1 November 2017.). It is more likely and generally held that the video was taken in winter, due to clothing worn, and it was a test. Considering the lack of panic at the time of evacuation, there was no need to distract people. https://chernobyllab.com/discover/blog/ferris-wheel-of-pripyat In any case, the park—and its Ferris wheel in particular—have become a symbol of the Chernobyl disaster. == Attractions == Constructed under the Soviet Union as a \\"Парк культуры и отдыха\\" (Park of Culture and Rest) typical of many large cities in the then Soviet Union, the amusement park's attractions were manufactured by the Yeysk-based firm \\"Аттракцион\\" (Attraction), who were responsible for the construction of many of the amusement parks which remain to be seen around the former Soviet Union today in various states of repair. Located north-west to the Palace of Culture in the center of Pripyat, the park had five attractions: * The iconic 26m (85 ft.) Ferris wheel \\"Круговой обзор\\" ('Circular Overview') * Bumper cars \\"Автодром\\" ('Autodrome') * Paratrooper ride \\"Ромашка\\" ('Chamomile') * Swing boats \\"Русские качели\\" ('Russian Swing') * The park also contains a carnival shooting game The successor to the original company is still manufacturing the Ferris wheel, paratrooper and bumper cars to largely unaltered designs as of 2017. == Radiation == Radiation levels around the park vary. The liquidators washed radiation into the soil after the helicopters carrying radioactive materials used the grounds as a landing strip, so concreted areas are relatively safe. However, areas where moss has built up can emit up to 25,000 µSv/h, among the highest level of radiation in the whole of Pripyat.Article on Chernobyl by Graham Gilmore. Retrieved 31 October 2017. == Films, games, media and literature == The park plays significant roles in the video games S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl and Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, and the film Chernobyl Diaries. The park plays significant roles too in the Markiyan Kamysh novel about illegal Chernobyl trips, A Stroll to the Zone. The Ferris wheel made news in September 2017 when Polish tourists turned it mechanically for the first time since 1986, later returning it to its original position. The park appeared in Suede's music video clip, \\"Life Is Golden\\". In the horror novel trilogy The Strain, Chernobyl NPP was the birthplace of an ancient vampire and the nuclear accident was a test by The Master to destroy it. == References == The paratrooper in 2016 ==External links== * Graham Gilmore Photography  Chernobyl Exclusion Zone * Abseiling The ferris Wheel In Pripyat * Satellite photo of Pripyat ferris wheel, Google Maps * Obsidian Urbex Photography  Photos taken in 2016 Category:1986 establishments in Ukraine Category:1986 disestablishments in Ukraine Amusement Park Category:Chernobyl Exclusion Zone Category:Defunct amusement parks Category:Buildings and structures in Kiev Oblast Category:Abandoned amusement parks Category:Amusement parks opened in 1986 Category:Amusement parks closed in 1986 ","title":"Pripyat amusement park"},{"id":"20334799","text":"Riverside Church entrance on Claremont (foreground); a Union Theological Seminary dormitory is directly behind it Claremont Avenue is a short avenue in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City.

Zig and Zag left in 1993 but Zuppy remained to become one of the longest serving members of The Den team (alongside Don Conroy, a human). ===Zig and Zag=== Zig and Zag with original playmate Ian Dempsey in the early days. Zig and Zag, the first (and possibly the most famous), are ten-year-old alien twins from the planet Zog. They were a very successful franchise on their own, spawning parody tapes, comic books and car toys. A popular toy throughout the late 1980s were zogabongs, the unusual antennae on both Zig's and Zag's heads. Zig and Zag arrived from the Planet Zog hoping to collect jokes. They were adopted by the young television presenter, Ian Dempsey, and became regular features on Dempsey's Den whilst living at Number Ten Celebrity Square (it has since been demolished and now has a Lidl on it). At first they would appear separately on designated days of the week and once a week together, then their appearances became more frequent. Zag was responsible for introducing Dustin to celebrity acclaim when he won him in a golf game, however both he and Zig had a difficult relationship with the turkey. An offer arrived from Channel 4 and the two extraterrestrials left The Den in the summer of 1993. Zig and Zag received a presenting job on Channel 4's The Big Breakfast, whereas Zuppy, Soky and Dustin remained. Zig and Zag returned to Ireland in the late 1990s to host 2Phat, a music-quiz show along with their father, Ray D'Arcy, in which students had the chance to win a limited edition scooter. The show ran for two seasons and was well received. Other popular characters on the show were Velcro Girl, DJ Lee, Zag's alter ego Reverend Groove and Zag's alter ego Captain Pillowcase. After a period of disappearance, they returned to launch a multi-layered assault on the media in October/November 2008, first featuring on their own television special, Best Bitz From Back Den and later appearing on the prime-time chat show, Twiggery Tonight, and their old father's radio show, The Ray D'Arcy Show, to promote its release as a DVD. ===Zuppy=== Zuppy, a dog belonging to Zig and Zag, rarely appeared on screen but more often in comic books. Blue with pink zogabongs, he had tendency to make rather high- pitched yelping barking noises akin to dogs of Earthly origin (though towards the end of his run, Dustin's experimentation with hypnosis caused Zuppy to begin clucking, akin to a chicken). Zuppy would maul Zag for no apparent reason. Zag was repeatedly left smarting from these encounters, during which Zuppy would growl. The other members of The Den saw this as friendly play between the two, and Zag often seemed unsure of Zuppy's attitude towards him. Zuppy got his name from John Balfe after responding to a competition. In return he got a year's supply of lollipops from Chupa Chups. Zuppy occasionally still featured in programming during the 21st-century, alongside Soky in the early morning shows. ==Generation II== Generation II began to be introduced just before Zig and Zag's departure, most notably Dustin the Turkey, who was won by Zag in a game of golf. Characters such as Soky, Ted, Podge and Snotser were present throughout the D'Arcy era and, with the exception of Podge (who moved to late night television show A Scare at Bedtime with brother Rodge after both were thwarted in their evil attempts to ruin Christmas), into the McCaul era. ===Dustin=== Manchester United Dustin was originally introduced in December 1989 when Zag secured him as a prize for finishing last in a golf tournament against Ronan Collins. Originally intended to be cooked, Dustin remained unaware of his impending fate as Christmas approached. However, the cast were emotionally moved by this and could not bring themselves to kill and stuff him. There is also a school of thought that Dustin was originally conceived as a turkey vulture, which would be consistent with his rather large and most un-turkeylike beak. However, as he became increasingly involved with Christmas pantomime shows in Dublin, and releasing CDs aimed at the Christmas market, he seems to have mutated into a turkey (the usual bird for Christmas dinner in Ireland). Portrayed as a builder from Dublin's Northside, Dustin later spun off to his own programme, DDN (Dustin's Daily News), in the September 2005 re-launch and later had his own weekly show called The Once a Week Show. He represented Ireland at Eurovision Song Contest 2008 in Belgrade. On Today FM's The Ray D'Arcy Show on 14 November 2008, Dustin was co-erced into \\"doing the flap-flaps\\" for a live audience at Vicar Street The Ray D'Arcy Show. Today FM. 14 November 2008. \\\\- The Den team would regularly co-erce Dustin, through use of flattering comparisons, into doing the \\"flap-flaps\\" (a unique and humorous dance with his wings), the result of which was the collapse of all into convulsions of laughter. ===Snotser=== Snotser was an extremely high-voiced member of Dustin's construction crew. Initially left to the imagination of viewers as he was merely an offstage voice for many years, Snotser was finally seen in the closing seconds of the first episode of the \\"treehouse season\\" during Den TV. The rest of the cast (and the audience) had been awaiting his arrival for the whole day, yet D'Arcy, Dustin and Soky submissively exited for home, leaving the audience to think that Snotser would remain an unseen, offstage character. However, as that day's edition of The Den was about to conclude, Snotser entered the empty studio, accompanied by apologies for his late arrival. His appearance revealed him to be a rotund pink pig. Snotser was a fairly popular character and appeared on several tracks of Dustin's parody album Faith of Our Feathers. Possessing a deeply high-pitched voice he became recognisable for his catchphrase: \\"Ah yeah, top man!\\" and often sported a black leather jacket. His surname was Galligan. ===Soky=== Soky (sometimes spelt \\"Socky\\") the sock monster first appeared shortly after Zig and Zag's departure in late 1993. Soky was born when Dustin neglected to do the laundry for a number of weeks, despite constant nagging and complaints from Ray D'Arcy about the smell of the socks in the linen bin that could be seen at the back of the set, behind where D'Arcy was seated. After some time, the lid of the linen bin could be seen to lift at various times during the day, and a pair of big eyes would peek out. These eyes turned out to belong to Soky the sock monster, who then joined the gang, believing D'Arcy to be his mother and calling him \\"Mammy Ray\\". Possessing hair of old, smelly socks, viewers were invited to send their own samples to The Den as presents for Soky. His prized possession was his blue bucket. He would often mention his best friend Thomas from playschool. Presented as a pre-school character, his naivety increased his affection among younger viewers. Not ever-present, in later years he could more commonly be found during early morning broadcasts of The Den. A shot of Soky taken at Christmas time in 1998 One Christmas Soky, Damo and Dustin travelled to New York in search of a Mr. Micro Blue Bucket with Removable Arms, a present that Soky desired but which would not be available in Ireland until the following March. After persistently demanding that Soky be granted this gift and searching through the internet (overcoming Derek Davis's diet tips and Pat Kenny's guide on how to be \\"an insufferable bore\\"), Dustin discovered that 100 Mr. Micro Blue Bucket action figures would be delivered to F.A.O. Schwarz, the largest toy store in the world located in Manhattan, New York, on Christmas Eve (the following morning). He then persuaded Damo to bring himself and Soky there instead of surrendering to Damo's preferred option of buying LEGO for Soky. Despite Damo explaining that there was no way they could fly to New York with so little time left, they were soon inside F.A.O. Schwarz. The naive but kind-hearted Soky was exuberant, as Dustin pointed out Laa-Laa the Teletubby, and wanted to find presents for his Mammy (Geri Maye) his best friend (Thomas), and \\"all the boys and girls in playschool\\". Despite Soky being a preschooler, Damo and Dustin allowed him to wander off in the busy store, whilst they went in search of Mr. Micro Blue Bucket, Dustin mistaking a Furby for Anne Doyle along the way. Soky's pet cat is Charlie. Known for his jokes and sense of humour, he had a deathmatch with Zuppy. Charlie lasted to the show with the Big 3 — Dustin, Soky and Zuppy. ===Ted=== Ted was a running in- joke between Dempsey/D'Arcy and Zig and Zag. A soft plush panda, he rarely appeared, but every few days a photograph would be put on display of Ted in a famous location or launching an assault on a famous person or a viewer. He would often arrive in the studio during this time, but only upon the absence of the presenter. One running gag had Zig and Zag tell him to \\"Keep it down Ted!\\" Ted, of course, never actually made a sound. A (later) running joke had Ted wrestle with Ray D'Arcy, which involved the (impossibly large) plush panda hurling himself at D'Arcy (whether he expected it or not). An often exhausted D'Arcy then had to defend himself from these assaults by hurling Ted offscreen again, his exhaustion often becoming more emphasised when Ted hurled himself once more at D'Arcy to repeat the assault. Ted last appeared at a 2008 reunion to assault D'Arcy once more, this time on live radio. D'Arcy himself admitted on his radio show that Ted only tended to attack on days when he was hungover or not feeling the best. This always happened when Dustin was absent, and afterwards he would never believe D'Arcy when he tried to convince him that Ted had attacked him. Ted left after FBJ's departure, and later appeared in the opening credits of iD. He was last heard of breaking through security at Vicar Street to assault D'Arcy during a morning radio broadcast from the venue, about half an hour after the Today FM newsreader, Sinead Spain, ominously aired a newsflash that a UFO had been spotted flying over Drogheda with no sign of life on board. D'Arcy was heard to wrestle the bear to the ground; later comparisons seemed to indicate that this particular Ted was at least one foot taller than D'Arcy. ===Podge=== Podge, an evil little boy, who with every appearance caused mischief and instigated conspiracies, would initially only appear when Zag was there alone and fool him into some badness by convincing him to listen to his instructions, often saying: \\"All I want is a friend and a cuddle\\". Zag set up his own 5-minute feature titled The Podge and Zag Show and played around with Podge, only to be interrupted by a scornful Zig. In later years, Podge would terrorise the entire cast, humans and all. One year he took over The Den and fired everyone, renaming The Den as \\"Bun's Bungalow\\" and promising wall-to-wall Echo Island all day, every day. In the end, it transpired to have been a terrible dream... or was it? Another year, at the end of Dustin's presidential campaign, Podge fooled the cast into believing that Dustin had won the election. From this point onwards Podge was joined by his brother Rodge. Podge left The Den; however, his television career did not end there. He later reappeared on RTÉ Television co-hosting his own show called A Scare at Bedtime alongside Rodge. When that proved popular, the brothers were given their own late-night weekday talk show called The Podge and Rodge Show set in their country home, Ballydung Manor. ==Generation III== Generation III were introduced in the post-McCaul era, in particular through the use of spin-off shows. Martin Duck was a feature of the mock news episodes, Dustin's Daily News. ===Simon and Stephen Trowel=== The second most recent addition to the line of 'evil' puppets after Martin Duck, Simon Trowel (an obvious pun on Simon Cowell) is a miserable \\"twin\\" of Dustin, though he insists he is a troll rather than a turkey. Most recently, before Halloween 2005, he kidnapped Dustin and tried to take his place, so he could steal the prizes available in the special Halloween pumpkin game. He made Francis and Socky drink a special brew that made them think he was Dustin. When they went off set, the TV screen at the back would show Dustin locked away, begging the viewers to help him get out and tell Francis and Socky that Simon Trowel's out there instead of him. On some occasions Simon was there when this happened, and he sneered at Dustin, declaring to the viewers that they would never get him out. Dustin eventually escaped however and it was actually reported on RTÉ News that he has been spotted running down the M50 the day he escaped. However, Simon's 'character' now appears to have been rewritten, as on 2 October 2005 he appeared alongside Dustin in a sketch on Dustin's Daily News, in which they tried to get a rock music contract, and he was introduced to the record producer as being Dustin's cousin. Simon Trowel's brother, Stephen, never appeared. Presumably of his shy, sneaky nature. It's been suggested a picture of Simon Trowel be inserted ===Martin Duck=== Martin Duck on an appearance on Dustin's Daily News. In the background is the logo of his proposed takeover show Duck Daily News. A successor \\"evil\\" puppet to Podge, Martin Duck is a mysterious duck who began \\"hacking\\" into transmissions of the mock-news epic, Dustin's Daily News, from a makeshift studio in a garden shed in January 2006. He seems to have some sort of grudge against Dustin, who declared him a \\"wanted duck\\" and began distributing wanted posters to viewers who wrote, texted or e-mailed in to DDN. Eventually, Duck was tracked down to a shed in Blackpool, County Cork, on property believed to be owned by a P. Carleton. Duck then went on the run to elude capture. He soon resumed his pirate broadcasts from a \\"secret\\" location, giving viewers cryptic clues as to where that location was. A huge prize package was offered to the person who finally captured Martin, as he stepped up his campaign against Dustin by hijacking certain elements of his show, such as taking over one of the regional RTÉ studios to \\"play\\" the \\"Dustin's Masterbrain\\" game, and kidnapping Dustin's co-presenter, Sinéad and taking her place on one show. In the final show of the season, on 29 April 2006, Duck was located and forcibly removed from his underground hiding place in Limerick. Later he said he is now dustins biggest fan. In 2007, he returned again, now in a campervan driving all around the country and kidnapping Sinead again. Dustin and crew managed to capture him just as he was about to take over the RTÉ Newsroom. He has not been seen since. ===Magic Bunny=== Magic Bunny is a rabbit who lives in a hat. He talks in a high pitched voice, is a good friend of both Soky and Zuppy and usually appeared alongside Zuppy. ==Generation IV== Generation IV saw Soky, Zuppy, Dustin and Magic Bunny leave without explanation and The Den become something called \\"RTÉjr\\". ===Ogie=== Ogie is a blue, furry alien, rabbit like creature who comes from the planet Hubble. Ogie stays with Emma while trying to get home. Ogie frequently talks to his mother and father via computer. ===Mammy=== Ogie's mother, whom he calls Mammy is very similar to Ogie, she is pink instead of blue and wears pearls around her neck. She frequently talks to Ogie via computer ===Daddy=== Ogie's father, whom he calls Daddy, is similar to Ogie, although he does have a beard. He frequently talks to Ogie via computer. ===Bo=== Bo (the Irish for cow) is a brown and white calf who stays with Reuben, a friend of Emma. Although Bo was introduced at the same time as Ogie and his family, she is rarely seen with him. ==References * RTÉ archive footage of an early 1990s Christmas on The Den (included are Ray D'Arcy, Zig and Zag, Zuppy and Podge) Category:Lists of children's television characters Category:Lists of Irish television series characters Category:RTÉ- related lists ","title":"List of The Den cast members"},{"id":"20334825","text":"Anthony Bryan B. \\"Tony\\" dela Cruz (born August 24, 1978) is a Filipino- American former professional basketball player.

The population was 4,309 at the 2005 census. Its name honors Spaniard insurgent general Francisco Javier Mina, who fought for the Mexican side in the independence movement from Spain. Located at the northwestern part of the state of Nuevo León. Mina is a renowned tourist destination, for its mysticism and legends in the state of Nuevo León. ==History== The municipality is part of a historical region called Valle de Salinas (Spanish for 'Salinas Valley') which was an administrative area of the New Kingdom of León during the Spanish colonial period. It was founded in 1608 by Canarian captain Bernabé de las Casas along with other Spanish and Canarian's settlers establishing the San Francisco de Cañas settlement (Named for Saint Francis of Assisi and cañas, a Spanish word for \\"reeds\\"), as it was established in a place surrounded by water springs and reeds, possibly around the Salinas River (Nuevo León), which courses across the municipality. San Francisco de Cañas was part of the Valle de las Salinas (Spanish for 'Salinas Valley'). The Salinas Valley was one of the fourteen subdivisions of the New Kingdom of León. It comprised the present-day municipalities of Abasolo, El Carmen, Mina, Hidalgo and Salinas Victoria, being the last one the administrative seat of the Salinas Valley. San Francisco de Cañas, often referred as Cañas until it was created as a municipality on May 31, 1851, therefore it was separated from the Salinas Valley administrative region, and was renamed as Mina. In honor of Spanish general Francisco Javier Mina. Since its foundation in the Spanish colonial period and much of the 19th century, the municipality of Mina, and many other regions in Nuevo León and northeastern Mexico, remained isolated from the rest of Mexico, the centralist government of then, did not take up nor support many affairs and problems in the north, where there were a constant war against the Native Americans, in the first instance it was against the native Cuanales and Aiguales, subsequently in the late 18th and 19th century, the region was marked by violent Comanche and Apache raids from Texas, before and after it was annexed to the United States, those raiders often came to the region to steal cattle, livestock, properties, and attack the inhabitants. The region, especially the northern part of Nuevo León, where Mina is located, witnessed many cruelty and fierce battles against the Native Americans, this region was often known itself as tierra de guerra viva (Spanish: fierce war land). Several sites of historic battles took place in the region, such as in the Hacienda del Muerto, a former agricultural and livestock ranch, which also served as fort during many successful battles. By the late 1850s, New Leonese governor Santiago Vidaurri, claimed the war had finished and there were no Native Americans in the region, after the Native Americans in the region were exterminated and the Apache and Comanche raiders were defeated. However, in the subsequent years the raids still continued although with much less proportion, until these raids virtually disappeared by late 19th century. However, the short period of peace had finished when the Mexican revolution reached the region, New Leonese general Mariano Escobedo, achieved important victories against Porfirio Díaz forces, who was tremendously defeated in the Icamole fields, outside the Hacienda del Muerto. Although the victory was for the locals, this war attached a decreasing period for the Hacienda del Muerto, which did not fully recovered its golden age of several years ago, as well as, the Mexican revolution imposed a policy applied throughout all the country during the Mexican revolution which affected the state properties. The hacienda del Muerto, regarded as one of the most important historic sites in the state of Nuevo León, was sold in the early 20th century, later abandoned and it remained in ruins, almost isolated for many years. In 1989 were discovered a great mammoth fossil by an expedition of paleontologists in the municipality, which arose the interest of creating a paleontology museum in Mina, which is now the Bernabé de las Casas museum. In recent years has been an increasing interest in developing tourism in Mina as well as in the Salinas valley region, Nuevo León, and northeastern Mexico. ==Geography== Mina is the sixth- largest municipality in Nuevo León, though it has one of the lowest population densities among municipalities, being just ahead of Vallecillo and Parás. Mina borders north with the municipality of Candela, west with Castaños and southwest with Ramos Arizpe in the state of Coahuila, and northeast with the municipalities of Bustamante and Villaldama, east with Salinas Victoria and Hidalgo, and south with García, all in the state of Nuevo León. Vegetation in this region consists of several types of desert bushes, Huisache (Vachellia farnesiana var. farnesiana), mesquite (Prosopis spp.), Echinocereus enneacanthus, Opuntia spp., as well as Lechuguilla (Agave lechuguilla), Sotol (Dasylirion texanum) are abundant throughout the municipality, and there are several endemic plants, among them are Candelilla (Euphorbia antisyphilitica), Damiana (Turnera diffusa), La Gobernadora (Larrea tridentata), Hojasen (Flourensia cernua), Mariola (Parthenium incanum) and many other which have been less studied. Also, walnut, willow, pine, Oyamel (Abies religiosa), lantrisco, antelope bush (Purshia plicata), Tasajillo (Opuntia leptocaulis) are found in the highlands of the municipality close to Minas Viejas and Caja Pinta mountain range. According to recent excavations in the ejido Boca de potrerillos in this municipality, have been found at twelve meters underground, several rests of carbonized nogal, willow and several types of pine which contrasts with the present-day plants abundant in Boca de Potrerillos, which is predominantly desert, carbon 14 tests, pointed out the rests go back several centuries ago, this is an evidence about how vegetation and ecosystem has been changing through the years. Fauna includes nine-banded armadillo, coyote, American badger, rattlesnake, deer, fox, rabbit, greater roadrunner, raccoon, great horned owl, and prairie dog, there are also several other types of mammals, birds, and reptiles. ==References== *State of Nuevo Leon; Mina *Municipal government of Mina Category:Populated places in Nuevo León ","title":"Mina, Nuevo León"},{"id":"20334913","text":"John Calvin Fleming Jr. (born July 5, 1951) is an American politician, physician, military veteran, and businessman. After leaving Congress in 2017, he served for two years in the administration as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Health Information Technology Reform and then served as Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Economic Development from March 2019 to 2020. In March 2020, he was appointed to a position in the White House as Assistant to the President for Planning and Implementation, and Deputy Chief of Staff. From January 3, 2009, to January 3, 2017, Fleming was the representative for Louisiana's 4th congressional district. He resides in the city of Minden in Webster Parish in northwestern Louisiana.

He was the second Republican to hold his House seat since Reconstruction. ==Early life, education and family== LCDR Fleming receives award while serving in the Navy. Fleming was born in Meridian in Lauderdale County in eastern Mississippi. He was reared in a working-class home. While he was still young, his mother became disabled and could no longer work. Fleming graduated from Meridian High School in 1969. Just prior to Fleming's high school graduation, Fleming's father died of a heart attack. This forced him to finance his education with odd jobs and loans. Fleming attended the University of Mississippi at Oxford, where he was a member of the Phi Delta Theta Fraternity. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1973. He later attended medical school at the Jackson campus of the same university, earning an M.D. in 1976. In 1979, Fleming completed a Family Medicine residency with the United States Navy. Subsequently, Fleming stayed in the Navy another three years, serving until 1982 when he moved his family to and set up a private family medicine practice in Minden, Louisiana. He has served as a deacon, Sunday school teacher, and Sunday school department director at First Baptist of Minden. Fleming also trained for years in karate attaining the rank of third-degree black belt. He took his first piano lesson at age 43 and ultimately studied for 14 years afterwards, playing the occasional recital and concert. Fleming and his wife, Cindy, married in 1978. The couple has four children. ==Medical career== Fleming was chief resident in Family Medicine at the Naval Regional Medical Center in Camp Pendleton, California. He also trained at the drug and alcohol treatment unit at the Navy Regional Medical Center in Long Beach, California. Serving in the Navy after his residency, Fleming practiced family medicine on the island of Guam.Minden Press-Herald, November 18, 1982, p. 14 From 1979 to 1981, he was the director of drug and alcohol treatment and chairman of the Navy Family Advocacy Committee. He subsequently performed similar duties in Charleston, South Carolina. After leaving the Navy, Fleming established a practice in Minden in August 1982. His first clinic was on Pearl Street across from the United States Post Office. He chose Minden for his city of residence because, in his words, it \\"has small-town charm, warm essence of life, long, lazy summer days with watermelon cuts and family reunions.\\"Minden Press- Herald, August 10, 1982, p. 1 To attract patients to his new practice, Fleming announced evening and Saturday morning hours to accommodate working people and students.Minden Press-Herald, September 2, 1982, p. 10 Fleming is board certified by the American Board of Family Medicine He joined the staff of the Minden Medical Center. Fleming is also a member of the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) and the Louisiana Academy of Family Physicians (LAFP). In 2007, he was chosen as the LAFP \\"Louisiana Family Practice Physician of the Year.\\" Fleming previously worked with drug-dependent persons through the program called \\"New Beginnings\\" at the Minden Medical Center.\\"Dr. Fleming will help chemical dependents\\", Minden Press-Herald, October 18, 1987, p. 10 In 1994, the Minden Press-Herald revealed Dr. Fleming's call \\"to end violence and drug addiction. I link these two together because I believe most of the violence we see is caused by addiction to, or buying and selling of drugs.\\"Fannie Moore, \\"Citizens list top priorities for 1994\\", Minden Press- Herald, January 6, 1994, p. 1. In 2006, Fleming wrote Preventing Addiction: What Parents Must Know to Immunize Their Kids Against Drug And Alcohol Addiction. In the book, Fleming argues that alcohol, among other addicting substances, can serve as a gateway for broader and more problematic drug use, and that the immature brain development of children makes them vulnerable to drug addiction later in life. Therefore, delaying the use of alcohol and other addicting substances until later adolescence or adulthood can sharply reduce the risk of later addiction according to scientific studies initiated by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and others.Fleming, John C. (2006). Preventing Addiction: What Parents Must Know to Immunize Their Kids Against Drug And Alcohol Addiction. Hannibal Books: A Christian Evangelical Publishing Company. Garland, Texas. On August 22, 2019, Dr. Fleming was given the Distinguished Alumnus of the Year Award by the University of Mississippi Medical Center. ==Business career== Fleming started a suite of diverse businesses and commercial real estate ventures during the mid 1980s. His business interests stretch from Brownsville, Texas to Oxford, Mississippi with corporate centers in Killeen and Houston in Texas and Shreveport/Bossier City in Louisiana. He owns over thirty-six Subway individually franchised sandwich shops in north Louisiana employing over 500 Louisianans. Among several other franchised concepts, he also owns Fleming Expansions, LLC, a regional developer and master franchise for The UPS Store, with over 182 outlets in Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. ==Webster Parish coroner== In 1995, Fleming ran for coroner defeating the nonpartisan candidate, Dr. Carlos A. Irizarry, 7,842 votes (60.4 percent) to 5,143 (39.6 percent). Fleming succeeded Democratic incumbent Dr. Carl A. Hines, from Minden, who did not seek re- election. He served from 1996 to 2000. ==U.S. House of Representatives== Official House photo ===Elections=== 2008 Fleming entered the race for the District 4 House seat after the 21-year Republican incumbent Jim McCrery announced his retirement from the House. He received political support from the LAFP and the American Academy of Family Physicians' (AAFP) political action committee for his campaign. Fleming supported the FairTax, which would eliminate the federal income tax and replace it with a flat sales tax. In the October 4, 2008, Republican closed primary, Fleming ran against Jeff R. Thompson, a lawyer from Bossier City, and Chris Gorman. In the election, no candidate received a majority of the votes. Fleming led with 14,500 votes (35.1 percent), followed by Gorman with 14,072 votes (34.1 percent), and Thompson with 12,693 votes (30.8 percent). This established a primary runoff between Fleming and Gorman. In the runoff, Fleming defeated Gorman, 43,012 votes (55.6 percent) to 34,405 (44.4 percent) and carried all but one of the thirteen parishes in the district. Outgoing Vice President Dick Cheney appeared in Shreveport on November 21 to speak at a fundraiser for Fleming. Politico.com indicated that McCrery supports Fleming but had made no official endorsement and had not appeared at any of Fleming's campaign events. On December 2, McCrery spoke on Fleming's behalf in an appearance on The Moon Griffon Show radio program, which is syndicated in most Louisiana media markets. He used the argument that Carmouche, if successful, would cast his first vote for Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California.The Moon Griffon Show, syndicated radio program, December 2, 2008 On December 10, 2008, Paul Carmouche formally conceded the election to Fleming. 2010 Fleming was unopposed in the Republican primary in 2010 but was challenged by the Democratic nominee, David R. Melville. Governor Buddy Roemer, a former Democrat, then a Republican and later a failed candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination; supported David Melville, his brother-in- law, in the general election.KEEL Radio News, October 11, 2010 Fleming was reelected saying that Democratic policies were out of step with his district and most of America.\\"Republican John Fleming re-elected for Congress \\" KSLA News, November 2, 2010. Retrieved December 29, 2010. 2012 Fleming was unopposed by a Democratic candidate in his 2012 re-election bid in his district that is 2 to 1 Democratic registration but had a Cook PVI of R +11. In the November 6, 2012, general election, Fleming instead faced opposition from a Libertarian candidate, Randall Lord of Shreveport, a former chiropractor studying psychology at Louisiana State University in Shreveport.Bonnie Culverhouse, \\"Final candidate roster\\", Minden Press-Herald, August 20, 2012. Fleming defeated Lord, 187,790 (75.3 percent) to 61,587 (24.7 percent). Lord was subsequently sentenced to 46 months in federal prison for financial scams related to illegal narcotic drug distribution. 2014 On April 4, 2013, Fleming announced that he would not in 2014 seek the United States Senate held since 1997 by the Democratic Mary Landrieu. Instead his colleague, U.S. Representative Bill Cassidy of Baton Rouge, had announced on April 3 that he would challenge Landrieu. In his statement, Fleming said: \\"For me to enter the race now would risk a contest between two experienced Republican congressmen, potentially offering Senator Landrieu a path back to Washington. I can't let that happen.\\" On December 10, 2014, KTBS, a Shreveport based ABC television station, reported that Fleming was considering running for the Senate seat held by David Vitter, who ran in the 2015 gubernatorial election. Vitter would have had to vacate his seat had he been elected as governor. In a statement, Fleming said \\"If Senator Vitter is elected as Governor, I would certainly be interested in running for the seat he would vacate.\\" 2016 U.S. Congressman John Fleming of Louisiana speaking at the 2016 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland On December 7, 2015, Fleming officially announced his candidacy for the United States Senate. He was a candidate to succeed fellow Republican David Vitter, who did not seek a third term in 2016. Vitter lost the gubernatorial runoff election on November 21, 2015, to the Democrat John Bel Edwards. Others who sought the Senate seat that Vitter vacated were Fleming's House colleague and fellow physician, Charles Boustany of Lafayette, former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, Foster Campbell of Bossier Parish, a Democratic member of the Louisiana Public Service Commission and an advisor to John Bel Edwards, Democrat Caroline Fayard, and State Treasurer John Neely Kennedy of Madisonville, the ultimate winner of the position. \\"I not only fought the liberals in Washington, I also fought the leadership of my own party when they were all too willing to compromise on our conservative principles,\\" Fleming said in his statement of candidacy. Fleming finished in fifth place in the primary election with 204,026 votes (11 percent), just behind the Democrat Caroline Fayard. He amassed pluralities in seven parishes, six of which are in his House district: Bossier, Claiborne, Grant, Lincoln (Louisiana's 5th congressional district), Sabine, Webster, and Vernon. ==Congressional tenure== Mamie Love Wallace seen on Barack Obama's inauguration day bracketed by John and Cindy Fleming on 20 January 2009. Fleming served four two-year terms in the United States House of Representatives from January 3, 2009, to January 3, 2017. The Congressman was on stage with many other dignitaries and congressional members at the first inauguration of Barack Obama, on January 20, 2009. Mamie Love Wallace, one of Fleming's constituents who was an early activist in the Civil Rights Movement, was his special guest at the event. Fleming's wife, Cindy, gave Mrs. Wallace her spouse's seat on the platform in her honor. ===Legislation authored=== Federal Duck Stamp Fleming served on the Committee on Natural Resources and chaired the Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, Oceans and Insular Affairs. As such he introduced legislation to raise the price of the Federal Duck Stamp by $10 to $25, bringing the stamp in line with inflation as an increase had not occurred for many years. The purpose of the legislation was to preserve habitat in critical migratory waterfowl flyways to allow duck populations to grow. The legislation was supported by hunting groups, including Ducks Unlimited, the National Rifle Association, and the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership. For his work on the Committee on Natural Resources on behalf of migratory birds, Fleming was given an award by Ducks Unlimited and the 2014 North American Migratory Bird Joint Venture Champion award for a Legislator by the Association of Joint Venture Management Boards. The Fleming Duck Stamp bill passed the House and Senate by voice vote and was signed into law by President Obama on December 18, 2014, as it had broad bipartisan support. Hunters and conservationists liked it as it generated more revenue to preserve habitat for waterfowl. Conservatives supported it because all additional revenues were dedicated to land easements rather than federalizing private land. Amtrak Secure Transportation of Firearms On October 13, 2009, Fleming introduced the Amtrak Secure Transportation of Firearms Act. It was supported by the National Rifle Association. The bill passed the House and Senate and was signed into law by President Obama in December 2009. Conscience Protection Act of 2016 On March 22, 2016, Fleming introduced the Conscience Protection Act of 2016 which \\"amends the Public Health Service Act to codify the prohibition against the federal government and state and local governments that receive federal financial assistance for health-related activities penalizing or discriminating against a health care provider based on the provider's refusal to be involved in, or provide coverage for, abortion.\\" If enacted it would give access to courts (heretofore unavailable) by healthcare providers who feel they have been discriminated against because of their refusal (based on conscience) to provide abortion services. For legislative expediency the text was put into a Senate shell bill S. 304. It was ultimately passed by the House and Senate, but President Obama refused to sign it into law. The Abortion Non-Discrimination Act (ANDA) By federal law, federal funding is required to be withheld from states who do not enforce the Weldon Amendment that prevents discrimination against healthcare providers if they refuse to provide abortion services. In 2014, California began enforcing a 1975 state law requiring all insurance companies to charge and cover all subscribers for abortion services, even if they object based on religious or conscience beliefs. Fleming and other Republicans accused President Obama of failing to enforce the Weldon Amendment. Fleming introduced legislation to provide health insurance subscribers a choice to purchase plans that do not cover abortions. Seniors' Tax Simplification Act of 2015 With each congressional session, Fleming introduced this bill designed to improve convenience and lower tax-filing costs to seniors. Though a senior's income may be limited to only Social Security benefits, the IRS requires all senior citizens to use the long form 1040 to file taxes. This act was designed to reduce the senior taxpayer filing to one simple page saving time, complexity and cost. H. Res. 615 of 2009 In 2009, Fleming introduced H. Res. 615, \\"expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that members who vote in favor of the establishment of a public, federal government-run health insurance option are urged to forgo their right to participate in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) and agree to enroll under that public option.\\" The resolution created a public outcry, after an interview of Fleming by Fox News' Meghan Kelly, demanding that members of Congress should also be subject to Obamacare. Consequently, language was placed in the Affordable Care Act requiring members of Congress and their staff to leave the more affordable Federal Employees Health Benefits Program with much lower premiums and deductibles, and obtain healthcare insurance through the DC Exchange, a product of the Affordable Care Act. American Health Care Reform Act of 2013 Fleming was a vocal critic of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which was signed into law in 2010 and was the subject of more than 50 repeal attempts by the Republican-controlled House. Realizing that Democrats would ultimately demand the elimination of the private insurance market and demand a government-run, single-payer health care system, Fleming called the ACA \\"the most dangerous piece of legislation ever passed by Congress.\\" When asked about fixing the healthcare law instead of repealing it, he said it was \\"not fixable or repairable.\\"Bruce Alpert, Rep. Fleming gets attention for calling Obamacare 'most dangerous law ever passed by Congress', The Times-Picayune (October 28, 2013). Fleming helped write, cosponsored and introduced the Republican Study Committee's American Health Care Reform Act of 2013, which was re-introduced in 2015. The legislation would have repealed the ACA and the health care provisions of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and implemented different health care related provisions.  Tax cuts and increases  In a September 19, 2011, interview on MSNBC in which Fleming was critical of President Obama's proposed plan to increase taxes, he was questioned about the reported $6.3 million of gross revenues his private restaurant company received the previous year. Fleming responded to host Chris Jansing by saying, \\"that's before you pay 500 employees, you pay rent, you pay equipment, and food\\" (business overhead); \\"the actual net income was a mere fraction of that...It is more like $600,000 of that $6.3 million...So by the time I feed my family I have, maybe $400,000 left over to invest in new locations, upgrade my locations, buy more equipment.\\" When Jansing asked Fleming if he thought the \\"average person\\" might be unsympathetic to Fleming's position, Fleming responded, \\"Class warfare never created a job...This is not about attacking people who make certain incomes. You know in this country, most people feel that being successful in their business is a virtue, not a vice, and once we begin to identify it as a vice, this country is going down.\\"Alpert, Bruce. \\"Rep. John Fleming of Louisiana catches flak for income remarks.\\" The Times-Picayune, September 20, 2011. Fleming's remarks were widely reported and resulted in considerable commentary. Bruce Alpert, of Louisiana newspaper The Times-Picayune, reported that \\"on liberal blogs, Fleming was portrayed as insensitive to millions of working Americans who are struggling to meet expenses in the face of high unemployment and stagnant wages.\\" Conservative sources including Bill O'Reilly and the Drudge Report defended Fleming's remarks.The O'Reilly Factor. Fox News. September 22, 2011. Transcript. Josh Beavers, publisher of the Minden Press-Herald in Fleming's hometown, wrote an editorial which stated, \\"[Fleming's] sentiment was only that the more taxes he pays the fewer people he can employ. High taxes on business owners thwart economic activity.\\"Beavers, Josh. \\"Congressman Fleming Said Nothing Wrong.\\" Minden Press-Herald, September 21, 2011. ===Activities in Congress led by Fleming=== Co-founder of the House Freedom Caucus Fleming, in addition to being among the nine founding members of the House Freedom Caucus, also served on the first Freedom Caucus board of directors and led the effort to impeach the Commissioner of the IRS. Attempt to impeach the Commissioner of the IRS Soon after the Tea Party Movement began in 2009, local and national Tea Party organizations began to complain that the IRS would not approve their applications for tax exempt status, a certification necessary for the viability of nonprofit organizations. In 2013, Lois Lerner, a high level IRS employee, disclosed as Director of Rulings and Agreements in the Exempt Organizations, that the conservative Tea Party organizations were targeted by the IRS to be denied tax exempt status while liberal groups were given the appropriate certifications. This created the appearance that Lerner was using her power in the IRS for political and ideological benefit. Because of the IRS targeting controversy, Lerner was forced to retire and John Koskinen was appointed to replace the acting Commissioner to restore integrity of the IRS. Investigations into the IRS targeting controversy were held by the House Oversight Committee, chaired by Jason Chaffetz. Koskinen was instructed to protect and turn over all records relating to the controversy. However, under Koskinen, the vast amount of documentation, including computer backup tapes, were destroyed. Chaffetz issued a document to begin impeachment proceedings against Koskinen saying, \\"he failed to comply with a congressionally issued subpoena, documents were destroyed on his watch, and the public was consistently misled. Impeachment is the appropriate tool to restore public confidence in the IRS and to protect the institutional interests of Congress.\\" However, Republican House leadership did not bring the impeachment to the floor for a vote. With the support of the House Freedom Caucus, Fleming utilized a rarely used parliamentary procedure called a privileged motion to force a vote on impeachment of Koskinen. Fleming went to the floor of the House and read the motion on July 13, 2016, after filing it in writing the day before. Though the motion required a vote on impeachment, House leadership and the Freedom Caucus negotiated a compromise for Koskinen to return for an additional hearing to learn more about his actions in the scandal. Koskinen returned, voluntarily, on September 21, 2016, to face an impeachment hearing during which he admitted to his \\"failings\\" in getting to the bottom of the IRS targeting controversy.Richard Rainey, Louisiana Rep. John Fleming calls for vote to impeach IRS commissioner, Times- Picayune (September 13, 2016).Richard Rainey, Rep. John Fleming-led vote to impeach IRS commissioner on hold, Times-Picayune (September 15, 2016).  Social media to connect with constituents  As Fleming entered Congress in 2009, use of social media such as Facebook and Twitter emerged as methods for members to connect directly with their constituents. In 2010 the House Republican Conference created the \\"New Media Challenge\\" to spur Republican members to acquire more followers. Fleming was awarded first place in both 2010 ad 2011 by his Republican peers. Work on religion in the military Beginning about 2005, critics claimed that Christians in the military caught proselytizing should be court-martialed. Subsequently, military members came forward claiming they were being punished by their military superiors for what they viewed as reasonable religious expression, a violation of the First Amendment. In June 2013, Fleming sponsored an amendment to the 2014 National Defense Authorization Act requiring the military \\"to accommodate, except in cases of military necessity, actions and speech, reflecting the conscience, moral principles, or religious beliefs of the member.\\" The amendment drew objections from the White House, with a spokesman saying that commanders need discretion to, \\"address potentially problematic speech and actions within their units\\" and that the measure would \\"have a significant adverse effect on good order, discipline, morale and mission accomplishment.\\" The amendment passed with a bipartisan vote by the House Armed Services Committee. A similar measure passed the Senate and compromise language was adopted into the final NDAA signed into law. During 2013, attempts were made by an atheist to join the military as a chaplain. In July 2013, the U.S. House passed a measure, sponsored by Fleming, that bars the Defense Department from appointing atheist chaplains. Fleming said, \\"The notion of an atheist chaplain is nonsensical; it's an oxymoron.\\" Democratic Congressman Rob Andrews of New Jersey said that it was \\"wrong\\" to tell an irreligious service member that they \\"must go to a mental health professional in order to receive counseling, rather than someone who comes from their philosophical faith or tradition.\\" Fleming ended the debate by saying, \\"an atheist chaplain is the last person in the world that a dying soldier should meet with when they need that last moment of counseling in their life.\\" The amendment passed into the 2014 House DOD appropriations bill For his work on religious freedom and material support of the military chaplaincy during his tenure on the House Armed Services Committee, Fleming was given the first ever Torchbearer for Religious Freedom award in 2014 by the Chaplain Alliance for Religious Liberty. Israel Fleming, while in Congress, was a strong supporter of Israel. Like most members of Congress during their freshman term, he visited Israel courtesy of the American Israel Education Foundation, a non-profit affiliate of the AIPAC. However, he returned to Israel in November 2011 with a small group of Congressmen as a member of the Congressional Israel Allies Caucus, meeting with high level Israeli leaders and learning more about important issues impacting Israel and the Jewish people courtesy of the US Israel Educational Foundation. Long Range Strike Caucus In 2009 Fleming co-chaired this bipartisan congressional caucus to \\"sustain both the land- and sea-based long range strike capabilities.\\"  Addiction, Treatment and Recovery Caucus  Fleming, based on his training, experience and interest, was the Republican co-chair of this bipartisan congressional caucus that promotes addiction treatment and prevention. House Values Action Team (VAT) Fleming served as co-chair of VAT, a House caucus, that met regularly with interest groups in support of legislation and court decisions that are pro-life and pro-traditional family. 2012 abortion post  In 2012, Fleming attracted attention when an article from the satirical news source The Onion (titled \\"Planned Parenthood Opens $8 Billion Abortionplex\\") was posted on his Facebook page with the apparently sincere message, \\"More on Planned Parenthood, abortion by wholesale\\". The post was deleted after commenters highlighted the article's satirical nature. Budget Control Act of 2011 and budget sequestration of 2013 After Republicans took control of the United States House of Representatives In 2011, a debate emerged over how to bring deficit spending under control after it ballooned to over $1.3 trillion annually from 2009-2011. A compromise deal was struck, called the Budget Control Act of 2011, between Republican Speaker John Boehner and President Obama that would create a bipartisan and bicameral \\"super committee\\" in Congress to decide how to equitably lower discretionary spending. According to the act, automatic and substantial cuts would be made to both national defense and non-defense discretionary spending in the federal budget if the committee did not come to an agreement to specific and targeted budget cuts. The \\"super committee\\" could not come to an agreement leading to the automatic cuts to national defense and domestic spending. Fleming opposed and voted against the Budget Control Act of 2011 as he feared it would ultimately lead to devastating cuts to national defense, which it did. Fleming was quoted in Forbes as saying: \\"Republicans in general, we desperately want a reduction in spending to get government back into balance. We would rather take some cuts in areas that we are not comfortable with than have no cuts at all.\\" Forbes noted that Fleming's district includes Barksdale Air Force Base and Fort Polk, both major military installations. At a discussion in February 2013 in DeRidder; Fleming, a military veteran, stated he would not vote to allow the government to cut $600 million from the defense budget.Fleming speaks about budget, Fort Polk at town hall meeting – News – Beauregard Daily News – Beauregard, LA Fleming was well known to be a supporter of the military and its personnel and the need to reverse the devastating cuts since the Budget Control Act of 2011 was implemented. He was quoted as saying, \\"One way my service in the military changes the way I do my job is that I understand our next conflict is not a matter of 'if' but 'when,' and that we need to equip our military with the resources and tools they need to protect our nation at home and abroad.\\" Fleming voted against the Budget Control Act of 2011, that caused the automatic budget sequestration in March 2013. On November 21, 2011, Fleming criticized the Budget Control Act because of what he called \\"devastating cuts to military spending.\\"Fleming Responds to Failure of Debt Reduction Committee  Congressman John Fleming ===Political positions=== Abortion Fleming was a staunch opponent of abortion. Fleming voted to bar federal funds from being used for any health benefits coverage including coverage of abortion. Fleming also voted to remove federal funding from Planned Parenthood (which does not use federal money to fund abortions, but accepts federal Title X funds for non-abortion family planning programs). Fleming was a cosponsor of the Sanctity of Human Life Act, which declared that \\"each human life begins with fertilization.\\" He also sponsored legislation that, among other things, would have made it a crime to \\"perform an abortion that is sought based on the sex, gender, color or race of the child.\\" Affordable Care Act Fleming supported the company Hobby Lobby in its legal challenge to the application of the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive mandate to the company; the Supreme Court of the United States ultimately ruled in favor of the company in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.. Other social issues Fleming, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, proposed an amendment to the fiscal year 2014 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) providing that \\"Except in cases of military necessity, the Armed Forces shall accommodate the beliefs, actions, and speech\\" of members of the armed forces.Corrie Mitchell, Conservatives say religious freedom is 'under attack' in military, Religion News Service (July 10, 2013). This amendment was supported by Christian Conservative groups such as the Family Research Council, which asserted that religious freedom was under attack in the military, and opposed by atheist groups such as the Military Religious Freedom Foundation and the Military Association of Atheists and Freethinkers, which asserted that the amendment was unconstitutional and would enable harassment of LGBT people in the military. Same-sex marriage In 2012, before the Obergefell v. Hodges Supreme Court decision, Fleming condemned a marriage-like ceremony that took place at Fort Polk, Louisiana, between an enlisted woman and civilian woman. (Fort Polk, a U.S. Army base, lies within Fleming's congressional district.) Fleming said that the ceremony \\"should not have occurred at Fort Polk, especially since the people of Louisiana have made it abundantly clear that our state does not recognize same-sex marriages or civil unions\\" and characterized the event as part of a \\"liberal social experiment with our military.\\"Alan Duke, Same-sex ceremony on Army post draws fire, CNN (June 7, 2012). Fleming condemned the Supreme Court's 2015 decision of Obergefell v. Hodges, which found a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. Fleming stated that he was \\"greatly disappointed\\" and disagreed with the decision.Bruce Alpert, Louisiana GOP congressional members condemn ruling for gay marriage, Democrats say it advances freedom, The Times-Picayune (June 26, 2015). Fleming was also a co-sponsor of The First Amendment Defense Act, a bill designed to protect religious institutions from being forced to perform marriage or other ceremonies that violate their teachings. Donald Trump  In August 2016, Fleming made the case that Donald Trump was a true conservative candidate for President and ultimately endorsed him in September 2016. On August 15, 2016, Fleming said, “I just have to say based on what I’ve seen and witnessed in the campaign, I’d say he fits much closer to the values of conservatives and the Republican party than anybody who’s run for office in the past several decades.” ===Committee assignments=== Upon his election to the United States House of Representatives, Fleming was assigned to these committees: * Committee on Armed Services, ** Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces ** Subcommittee on Strategic Forces; * Committee on Natural Resources, ** Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources ** Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, Oceans and Insular Affairs (Chairman) ===Caucus memberships=== * The Republican Study Committee * The Tea Party Caucus * The Israel Allies Caucus * Co-chair of the Congressional Addiction, Treatment and Recovery Caucus *Co-chair of the House Values Action Team (VAT) * Co-founder of the House Freedom Caucus * Co-chair of the GOP Doctors Caucus *Co-chair and founder of the Long Range Strike Caucus * Congressional Constitution Caucus *Congressional Arts Caucus ==Department of Health and Human Services tenure== After completing four terms in the United States House of Representatives, Fleming was appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary of Health Technology Reform in Health and Human Services on March 23, 2017 by President Donald Trump. On being appointed, Fleming said that his goals were to remove barriers to health care innovation and to promote greater usability and interoperability of healthcare information technology systems. Fleming lamented the fractured nature of electronic health record technology and said that he supported \\"every American having a single, unified health record that resides in the cloud.\\" Fleming advocated the use of accountable care organizations in addition to the fee for service system still dominant in U.S. health care, and called for more pay-for-value systems tied to the collection and use of data. He said he planned \\"to advocate policies that would encourage physicians to use technology in their medical practice.\\" He hoped \\"to remove barriers to data transfer.\\" He was assigned to the Office of the National Coordinator, an agency within HHS. Not only was Dr. Fleming among few physicians in Congress during his tenure, but he implemented the first private practice EHR in Louisiana in 1997. His private medical practice was fully paperless by 1999. As a result it was felt by the Trump administration that he would be a perfect fit for ONC. Fleming's work was primarily focused in the area of streamlining required workflow in the use of technology and the reduction of health care clinician burden. He noted that various studies have shown that as much as 50% of clinician work flow is spent inputting data into EHRs. He explained that the cause of this burden is due primarily to three major areas: outdated clinical record guideline requirements designed for billing purposes, prior authorization requirements, and health care quality measurement and reporting. He anticipated that a new, rapidly developing clinician burden in response to the nationwide opioid crisis, PDMPs, will need better design and streamlining as they are being implemented. While serving in the Office of the National Coordinator Fleming led an effort, working with CMS, to modernize CMS's 2019 physician fee schedule to reduce the need for low value, time consuming, potentially inaccurate, and excessively documented medical records primarily for billing purposes. He also worked closely with government and private sector organizations to bring automation to the prior authorization process. Finally, he called for merging state and regional PDMPs into a single national database, easily accessible by clinicians with proper authorization and privacy security. ==Department of Commerce tenure== On June 20, 2018, President Trump nominated Fleming to serve as Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Economic Development, leading the Economic Development Administration. His appointment was approved by a vote of 15–5 in the United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on August 1, 2018. On March 7, 2019, his nomination was confirmed by a vote of 67–30 in the full senate. After assuming office, Fleming promoted the benefits of the new tax law, Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017; especially the Opportunity Zone portion as a new EDA tool to enhance the agency's effectiveness in revitalizing economically depressed communities. His stated goal for the EDA: \\"We don't try to make successful communities more successful. We want to make uncertain, unsuccessful communities successful, and hopefully even more successful over time.\\" Fleming left his position in March 2020 upon his appointment to a position at the White House. ==Potential candidate for governor, 2019== Sources close to Fleming said that he considered entering the nonpartisan blanket primary on October 12, 2019 against Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards, a candidate for a second term. Columnist Sam Hanna, Jr., of the Ouachita Citizen weekly newspaper in West Monroe, said that Fleming could run because neither of the two announced Republican candidates, U.S. Representative Ralph Abraham of Louisiana's 5th congressional district or Baton Rouge businessman Eddie Rispone, had yet to make much impact toward unseating Edwards. Fleming ultimately chose not to run, however. ==Assistant to the President== On March 23, 2020, Fleming was appointed as Assistant to the President for Planning and Implementation, and Deputy Chief of Staff at the White House. Dana Gartzke was named acting in his place at EDA. Dr. Fleming also served on the White House Coronavirus Task Force. ==Awards and acknowledgments== * In 2007, Fleming was chosen as the Louisiana Academy of Family Physicians' \\"Louisiana Family Practice Physician of the Year.\\" * For both 2010 and 2011, the first two years the award was given, Fleming was given first place by the House Republican Conference in the \\"New Media Challenge\\" for highest performance in the then new digital/social media platform. * In 2014, For his work on religious freedom and material support of the military chaplaincy during his tenure on the House Armed Services Committee, Fleming was given the first ever Torchbearer for Religious Freedom award by the Chaplain Alliance for Religious Liberty. * In 2014, Fleming was given the North American Migratory Bird Joint Venture Champion award for a Legislator by the Association of Joint Venture Management Boards and Ducks Unlimited. * On August 22, 2019, Fleming was given the Distinguished Alumnus of the Year Award by the University of Mississippi Medical Center. ==See also== * Physicians in the United States Congress ==References* Category:1951 births Category:21st-century American politicians Category:Activists from California Category:American coroners Category:American family and parenting writers Category:American health care businesspeople Category:American military doctors Category:American primary care physicians Category:Baptists from Louisiana Category:Baptists from Mississippi Category:Living people Category:Louisiana Republicans Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Louisiana Category:Politicians from Charleston, South Carolina Category:People from Long Beach, California Category:Physician-politicians Category:Politicians from Meridian, Mississippi Category:Politicians from Minden, Louisiana Category:Republican Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:Sons of the American Revolution Category:Southern Baptists Category:Tea Party movement activists Category:United States Department of Commerce officials Category:United States Navy officers Category:University of Mississippi alumni ","title":"John Fleming (American politician)"},{"id":"20334921","text":"Spectrum Academy The Spectrum indicates the welcome of students of every race, ethnicity, color, gender, and every color of the rainbow.

The property is owned and operated by the University of California, Hastings College of the Law. The tower includes mixed-use offices on various floors, and the Art Deco-styled \\"Sky Room\\" with a panoramic view on the 24th floor. Conceived as an unusual combination of a large church surmounted by a hotel, construction of the building brought architectural dispute. Initially designed by Timothy L. Pflueger in the Gothic Revival style, the investors fired his firm and hired Lewis P. Hobart, who changed little of Pflueger's design. In a resulting lawsuit, Pflueger won nearly half the damages he asked for. The building opened in 1930 as the William Taylor Hotel and Temple Methodist Episcopal Church. However, extra construction expenses had put the congregation at greater financial risk, and the church-hotel concept did not prove popular. No profit was made in six years, and the church left, losing their investment. In the late 1930s the building housed the Empire Hotel, known for its Sky Room lounge, then from World War II to the 1970s, 100 McAllister served as U.S. government offices. Reopening as university housing and offices in 1981, McAllister Tower is home to some 300 law students and their families. \\"The Tower\\" is sited one block from the administrative and scholastic center of Hastings College of the Law, and is the most prominent building in the district. ==HistoryChurch and hotel=== The skyscraper at 100 McAllister began in 1920 with a plan formulated by Reverend Walter John Sherman to merge four of the largest Methodist Episcopal congregations in San Francisco, sell their various churches and properties and combine their assets to build a \\"superchurch\\" with a hotel on top of it. From their initial $800,000 they bought property at McAllister and Leavenworth streets and hired the architectural firm of Miller and Pflueger to design the edifice. Timothy L. Pflueger was chosen as the designer. The new hotel, intended to be \\"dry\\" (serving no alcoholic beverages) in the \\"sinful\\" city, was to be named after William Taylor, a Methodist Episcopal street preacher and missionary who formed the first Methodist church in San Francisco. The large church was named Temple Methodist Episcopal Church, or simply \\"Temple Methodist\\". Beginning in 1925, Pflueger designed a , 28-story, step-back skyscraper made of brick framed with steel, along the lines of his just-completed Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Company Building. Its main decorative theme was neo-Gothic, expressed strongly in the three Gothic arches which formed the main street- level entrance for the church. The Great Hall, the large worship area located within the second, third and fourth floors was to seat 1,500 churchgoers and a smaller chapel was designed for 125 more. A grand pipe organ from Skinner Organ Company was installed with four manuals controlling 3,881 pipes. A stained glass window was placed 80 feet above the sanctuary, representing Faith, Love and Hope in three tall, narrow panels. Two assembly halls could be combined to hold 1,100 attendees for theatrical or athletic events. Some 500 guest rooms and 32 tower apartments were intended to bring a steady flow of visitors and a source of profit to the church. Though never the tallest building in San Francisco, it was to be the tallest hotel on the Pacific Coast for many decades. In a dispute, the architectural firm of Miller and Pflueger was fired from the project, and was replaced by Lewis P. Hobart. Miller and Pflueger sued for $81,600, alleging that Hobart's design was little changed from Pflueger's original. Three months after the hotel and church opened in January 1930, Miller and Pflueger won $38,000 in a favorable court decision. Dedication of the church's pipe organ took place August 31, 1930. It was E. M. Skinner's opus 819 of Boston, Massachusetts.https://pipeorgandatabase.org/OrganDetails.php?OrganID=23624 The combined congregation was very satisfied with their new place of worship. Eventually costing ($ million in current value), the building's completion required several rounds of new financing from its investors in order to overcome unanticipated expenses. Unfortunately for the congregation, the idea of a hotel above a church didn't attract the requisite number of guests and the venture failed to turn a profit. From 1990 through 2001, the church housed the theater of George Coates Performance Works – an experimental multi-media theater troupe that utilized the 60 foot high vaulted ceiling for projections. ===Empire Hotel=== By November 1936, enough debt had accumulated that a bondholder's protective committee foreclosed on the property, buying it back for $750,000. The Temple Methodist congregation lost its investment and was asked to leave. The Skinner Opus pipe organ was removed to be sold to Occidental College in Los Angeles and rebuilt in their Thorne Hall. The three- piece stained glass window was removed and exhibited, eventually making its way to Stockton, California where it was installed in the Morris Chapel at the University of the Pacific. The 100 McAllister building itself was refurbished: the church's floor area was given over to parking, a coffee shop was built in part of the first floor lobby and the new enterprise opened again as the Empire Hotel, noted for completing, in 1938, the first view lounge in the area, the Sky Room on the 24th floor. With plush carpeting, a large Art Deco- style oval bar, and plate glass windows on all sides, the Sky Room provided a panoramic view of the city. Architect & Engineer wrote of the luxurious bar in April, 1938, that it \\"has no prototype west of New York\\", referring to Manhattan's Rainbow Room which opened three-and-a-half years earlier. ===Federal offices=== At the beginning of direct American involvement in World War II, the U.S. government bought the building and converted it to federal offices, officer billets, spaces used by the Army's Ordnance Procurement department, a passport agency and an induction center run by the local draft board. The high vaulted ceiling of the Great Hall worship center was hidden by a dropped ceiling. After the war, the Internal Revenue Service moved offices into the building. Many federal groups at 100 McAllister moved their offices in 1959–1960 to the newly built federal building at 450 Golden Gate Avenue, later named the Phillip Burton Federal Building. Occupancy at 100 McAllister was low, though the United States Army Corps of Engineers moved their San Francisco District offices there in the 1960s, and local draftees were still required to appear there through the late 1960s. The San Francisco Selective Service System offices were located in the lower floors of the building during the Vietnam War. ===UC Hastings=== In 1978, the University of California, Hastings College of the Law bought the building, the most prominent in the Tenderloin district, and began two years of refurbishment and redesign. Calling it \\"McAllister Tower\\", 248 units were modernized for residential use by law students, and the building opened in 1981 with a combination of compact studio units as well as larger one- and two-bedroom apartments taking up a total of 17 floors. The building, home to about 300 law students and their families, is casually referred to as \\"the Tower\\" by Hastings residents and faculty, who have but a one-block commute to the law school's main building at 200 McAllister. The old Sky Room with its spectacular 360-degree view reopened in 1999 as the James Edgar Hervey Skyroom, in honor of alumnus James Edgar Hervey, Class of 1950, a prominent San Diego trial lawyer. It is used as a space for student study by day (no alcohol allowed) and is available for special events in the evenings. Other floors of the building hold offices, apartments and residential conveniences. The mezzanine level contains a compact fitness center, the third and fourth floors contain classrooms and offices for political action groups and legal assistance organizations, and the 22nd and 23rd floors hold publishing headquarters for a number of scholarly journals. The Great Hall remains un-refurbished and has been judged by UC Hastings to be in need of substantial repair and improvement, including major architectural engineering work. The college has plans to create a 400-seat performing arts venue within the Great Hall.

To combat the guerrilla war raging in the two Boer republics, Kitchener employed sweep-and-scour columns, farm burning and a policy of forcing Boer women and children into concentration camps. However, using such harsh methods in the loyal Cape Colony was politically impossible. Instead, the British commander in the Cape Colony, General Sir John French resorted to a three-pronged strategy: first, to prevent Boer commandos from combining, second, to chase them constantly in order to prevent them from collecting new followers and supplies, and third, to tire them out so that they could be hunted down. One historian notes, \\"How simple an antidote to guerilla warfare, compared with that immense operation of burning farms and carting off the whole civilian population of the countryside into the camps!\\"Pakenham, p 558 ==Battle== Lötter's commando being escorted into Graaff Reinet by the Coldstream Guards Armed with information from French's excellent Field Intelligence Department and led by African Intelligence scouts, Scobell pursued Lötter's commando in the Tandjesburg mountains. Scobell, whose command included the 9th Lancers, the Cape Mounted Rifles and Imperial Yeomanry, was reputedly one of the most efficient British column commanders. On the fifth day of a six-day mission, the British officer found his quarry in a mountain gorge called Groenkloof, near the village of Petersburg. Believing that Lötter's men occupied a farm building, Scobell ordered a night march and deployed his 1100 soldiers on some ridges overlooking the farm. Actually, Lötter and his 130-man commando had taken shelter in a nearby 30-by-15 foot stone sheephouse or kraal, which was topped with a corrugated iron roof.Pakenham, p 559 At dawn, a squadron of lancers was sent to investigate the kraal. The commanding officer, Lord Douglas Compton dropped his pistol near the entrance. As he dismounted to fetch his weapon, the Boers opened fire. Compton escaped, but the six men behind him were mowed down. Immediately, a thousand rifles opened up on the fearfully outnumbered Boers in the sheephouse. After a half-hour of the unequal contest, the Boers surrendered. They suffered 13 killed and 46 wounded, while 61 unwounded survivors were hustled into captivity. Scobell's force lost 10 men killed. A British combatant said, \\"The sight was horrible in the extreme ... In fact the place was like a butcher's shop, some men making awful noises groaning clutching the ground and rolling in the dirt in their agony.\\"Pakenham, p 560 ==Aftermath== Middleburg Lötter and seven others were later executed by the British authorities as rebellious subjects.Minnaar, SA Military History Journal Jan Smuts turned the tables on the British in the Battle of Elands River which followed ten days later. But as one historian points out, \\"In losing Lotter, the Boers had lost more than a tenth of the guerillas in the Colony south of the Orange, and their élite commando at that ... the British Empire was a bottomless well, when it came to replacing lost troops.\\" ==NotesReferences== * Pakenham, Thomas.

The hurricane formed on October 14 in the western Caribbean, slowly organizing as it tracked northwestward. By October 16, the storm attained hurricane status to the east of the Yucatán Peninsula, and subsequently executed a small counterclockwise loop. On October 18, the hurricane began undergoing rapid deepening and, on the next day, reached an estimated peak intensity of 165 mph (270 km/h). Shortly thereafter, it struck extreme western Cuba at peak intensity, becoming the strongest hurricane on record to hit the country. Later the hurricane weakened greatly, striking southwestern Florida with winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) in a sparsely populated region. While crossing the state it weakened to tropical storm status, and after accelerating east-northeastward, it was absorbed by a cold front on October 23, to the south of Bermuda. Across the western Caribbean Sea, the developing storm produced heavy rainfall and increased winds. Strong winds in western Cuba caused severe damage, with two small towns nearly destroyed. About 90 people were killed in the country, all in Pinar del Río Province. Later, the hurricane brought heavy rainfall to southern Florida, which caused flooding and crop damage. Damage was light in the state, and there were no casualties. ==Meteorological history== On October 14, a tropical depression was first observed over the western Caribbean Sea, just off the eastern Honduras coast. It was a large and weak tropical cyclone, moving slowly northwestward and gradually intensifying. On October 15, it is estimated the depression attained tropical storm status, and its strengthening became more steady. The next day, the storm reached hurricane status about 130 mi (215 km) southeast of Cozumel, Quintana Roo. Around that time, it began to execute a small counterclockwise loop off the east coast of the Yucatán Peninsula. By October 18 the hurricane completed the loop, during which its winds increased to 115 mph (185 km/h); this is the equivalent of a major hurricane, or a Category 3 on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. The estimation of its strength at this point was based on subsequent analysis of peripheral recordings of atmospheric pressure and maximum sustained winds by ships and land stations. Beginning late on October 18, as the system tracked north- northeastward toward Cuba, the hurricane underwent rapid deepening, evidenced by a ship wind report of 120 mph (193 km/h). This wind report was initially thought to be the peak intensity of the cyclone; however, subsequent research confirmed further deepening, based on very low pressures recorded across the region. A ship in the radius of maximum winds reported a reading of 922 mbar; the barometer on the ship was found to be 5 mbar too high, resulting in a pressure of 917 mbar. Additionally, a station on land reported a pressure of 932 mbar (27.52 inHg). Based on the readings, the Hurricane Research Division estimated the hurricane attained a minimum central pressure of 910 mbar very near the western coast of Cuba; this suggested peak winds of 165 mph (270 km/h). Late on October 19, the hurricane made landfall in extreme western Cuba in Pinar del Río Province. José Carlos Millás, director of the National Observatory at Havana, believed that \\"this hurricane [was] one of the most severe ever experienced in our latitudes.\\" After exiting Cuba into the Gulf of Mexico, the hurricane weakened greatly. On October 20, it passed a short distance west of Key West, Florida, and very early on October 21, the hurricane moved over Marco Island, with winds of 90 mph (150 km/h). The cyclone weakened further as it turned eastward through the state, deteriorating to tropical storm status as it passed near or over Miami. It then accelerated east-northeastward, moving over the Abaco Islands in The Bahamas. Gradually weakening, the storm began interacting with an approaching cold front; late on October 23, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, and was absorbed by the front shortly thereafter. ==Impact and records== As a developing tropical cyclone, the storm produced increased winds and lower pressures in the Swan Islands, off the coast of Honduras. Heavy rainfall occurred throughout Jamaica, causing street flooding and several mudslides, but little damage. No disruptions were reported to communications or railway travel. The storm brushed eastern Belize while located off the coast, producing 3.62 inches (91.9 mm) of rainfall and light winds. In extreme western Cuba, damage was very severe from the strong winds, likened to the impact of a tornado. Severe damage was reported in Los Arroyos and Arroyos de Mantua. In the latter location, around a dozen people were killed, 50 were injured, and nearly every building in the town was severely damaged; heavy losses also occurred to the tobacco crop. Across western Pinar del Río Province, the hurricane destroyed all communication links. Further from the center, the capital city of Havana recorded southerly winds of 72 mph (116 km/h), as well as a minimum pressure of about 999 mbar (29.50 inHg). Around the country, the hurricane capsized several ships, primarily fishing vessels. The death toll in the country was estimated at around 90. In the days after the storm, Cuban President Zayas authorized about $30,000 in relief aid to send to hurricane victims in Pinar del Río. Several days prior to striking Florida, the outer circulation began producing rainfall across the state. Storm warnings were issued along the east and west coastlines northward to Cedar Key and Titusville. Later, hurricane warnings were issued for much of the same area, and schools in the Tampa area were closed as the storm was expected to move ashore. The hurricane first affected Florida when it passed west of Key West, where sustained winds of 66 mph (107 km/h), along with gusts to 74 mph (120 km/h), were reported. Little damage occurred in the region, limited to downed trees; this was due to advance warning by the U.S. Weather Bureau, which advised ships to remain at port and for residents to secure property. Later, the hurricane moved ashore in a sparsely populated region of southwestern Florida. Damage was reported in Fort Myers and Punta Gorda and communications were temporarily cut, although no deaths were reported. Heavy rainfall was reported along its path, and one location accumulated 23.22 inches (590 mm) in a 24‑hour period; this established a new one-day rainfall record in the state. A station in Miami recorded 12.18 inches (309 mm), and wind gusts in the area approached hurricane force. The combination of winds and rain damaged 5% of the local citrus and avocado crop. The rainfall flooded streets, homes, and commercial buildings in the Miami area, and hundreds of people were left without telephone access. No impact was reported in the Bahamas. After a reanalysis of hurricanes between 1921 and 1925, the National Hurricane Centers Atlantic reanalysis project determined that this hurricane attained maximum sustained winds of 165 mph (270 km/h), making it a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. The hurricane is the earliest known to have attained the intensity, besting the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane, which was previously thought to be the earliest storm of this intensity. It is also one of only two on record to make landfall in Cuba at Category 5 status, with the other being Hurricane Irma of 2017, which also made landfall with maximum sustained winds of 165 mph (270 km/h). A hurricane in 1846 that hit the country was also thought to have struck at Category 5 status, although the storm existed prior to the start of the Atlantic hurricane database. When the steamship \\"Toledo\\" recorded an atmospheric pressure of 922 mbar (27.22 inHg) during the 1924 Cuba hurricane, it was the lowest pressure recorded in an Atlantic hurricane, breaking the previous record of 924 mbar (27.28 inHg) in the Atlantic hurricane of 1853. The record during this storm lasted until the 1932 Cuba hurricane, when a minimum pressure of 915 mbar (27.02 inHg) was reported. The reading of 932 mbar (27.52 inHg) at Los Arroyos in Mantua, Pinar del Río remains the lowest pressure recorded on land in Cuba. ==See also== * List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes * List of Florida hurricanes (1900–1949) * 1932 Cuba hurricane * Hurricane Irma ==References== C (1924) 1924 1924 1924 C (1924) C (1924) Category:1924 natural disasters in the United States Category:1924 meteorology ","title":"1924 Cuba hurricane"},{"id":"20335196","text":" The Lycoming T55 (Company designation Lycoming LTC-4) is a turboshaft engine used on American helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft (in turboprop form) since the 1950s.

It was published by Shapiro, Bernstein & Co. in 1925. In the largely comic song, a man sings that he knows a certain woman named Susie to be much wilder and more passionate than most people realize. The song, which was originally written for Al Jolson, became Eddie Cantor's best-known success of the 1920's, recorded on April 6, 1925 CD liner notes: Sony Music 100 years: Soundtrack for a Century: Pop Music: The Early Years 1890 - 1950, Columbia, Epic, Legacy, 1999 and the bestseller for five weeks during the year.CD liner notes: Chart-Toppers of the Twenties, 1998 ASV Ltd. Years later, Jolson told Cantor \\"If I knew it was that good, you dog, I'd never have given it to you!\\". ==In popular culture== * Eddie Cantor (Buddy Doyle) sings this in The Great Ziegfeld (1936). * The melody is used as a musical theme in the film The Affairs of Susan (1945). * The song is sung by Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly in the film Anchors Aweigh (1945). * The song is sung in Ziegfeld Follies (1946). * A film by the same name, starring Cantor, was released in 1948. * The song is sung in the biopic The Eddie Cantor Story (1953). * The song is arranged and performed by John Serry Sr. and his ensemble for RCA Victor on \\"RCA Thesaurus\\" (1954). * The song was used in the 1966 film The Silencers, the first of several spy thriller/spoof films starring Dean Martin as Secret Agent Matt Helm. In the opening scenes of the movie, Martin’s character “thinks” an altered version of the lyrics, as he imagines romancing one of the film’s several lovely ladies. Martin’s rendition of the song (with the accurate lyrics) also appeared on the movie’s soundtrack album. * In the film Arthur, Dudley Moore sings the trope “If you knew Susan like I know Susan...”. Susan was Moore’s character’s unfated bride. * Ruth Cracknell sings the song in several episodes of the television series Mother and Son. * The song is sung by Adam Driver in the film The Man Who Killed Don Quixote (2018). ==References== Category:1925 songs Category:Songs with lyrics by Buddy DeSylva Category:Songs written by Joseph Meyer (songwriter) Category:Eddie Cantor songs == External Links == Album cover and sheet music for the song ","title":"If You Knew Susie"},{"id":"20335241","text":"\\"En karusell\\" was originally released in 1972 as a 7\\" single in Sweden which was sung in Swedish and also in Japan where the song was titled \\"En Carousel\\" and sung in English.

This English version was titled \\"Merry- Go-Round (En Karusell)\\" for the Swedish market and titled \\"Merry-Go-Round\\" for other releases. \\"Merry-Go-Round\\" was included as the b-side song to the single \\"People Need Love\\" which was also released in 1972. The single \\"People Need Love\\" was included on the album \\"Ring Ring\\" which was released in 1973 under Artist name Björn & Benny, Agnetha & Anni-Frid. \\"Merry-Go-Round\\" made its CD debut on the 1994 \\"ABBA\\" compilation \\"Thank You For The Music (box set)\\" as track 5 on disc 4. The song also appeared as a bonus track on the 2001 re- issued and re-mastered album \\"Ring, Ring\\" under the artist name \\"ABBA\\".

All four individuals had other commitments and therefore were not considering forming a permanent group. An example of this is the crediting; the single in most of the territories is credited to \\"Björn & Benny, Agnetha & Anni-Frid\\". The women were simply guesting as backing vocalists on the new \\"Björn & Benny\\" single. However, the positive audience reaction was unexpected. The single made the Top 20 of the combined Swedish singles and albums chart, and \\"People Need Love\\" reached No. 3 on the Swedish radio chart show Tio i topp (The Top Ten). It was the foursome's first charting record in the United States where it peaked at No. 114 on the Cashbox singles chart and No. 117 on Record World singles chart - impressive for unknown Swedish artists in America at the time. The Playboy Records U.S. release was credited to \\"Bjorn & Benny (with Svenska Flicka)\\" and according to ABBA's manager Stig Anderson, the single could have been a much bigger American hit if not for the limited distribution resources of the label that was unable to meet the demand from retailers and radio programmers. At the time of the single's release, the Ring Ring album had not been planned since there was no intention to form a permanent group. ===Chart positions=== {  !align=\\"left\\"Chart (1972) !align=\\"center\\"Position - - align=\\"left\\"Swedish Combined Singles/Albums Chart align=\\"center\\"17 - align=\\"left\\"Cashbox Singles Chart - USA align=\\"center\\"114 - align=\\"left\\"Record World Singles Chart - USA align=\\"center\\"117 } == References == Category:Songs written by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus Category:1972 songs Category:Anita Lindblom songs ","title":"En karusell"},{"id":"20335289","text":"Patrick Clibborn Larkin (born June 14, 1960) is an American former professional baseball pitcher.

He produced work in the United States including the Emmy-winning series The Men Who Built America, telling the story of Vanderbilt, Canergie and their fellow “robber-barons,” Pearl Harbor - The Heroes Who Fought Back, Sacred Sites, a series exploring the mysteries of the ancient world and The Ghosts of Duffy’s Cut, a film that examines the mysterious deaths of 57 railway workers in the 1850s. In 2003, he filmed the story of Riverdance's first performance in China's Great Hall of the People. As producer and editor, Magan has collaborated widely including with human rights activist, Deeyah Khan, as she worked for seven years producing her documentary film, Banaz - A Love Story and with Mark McLoughlin in the making of Blood Rising and Outsider. He created documentary projects exploring Irish history. Among these, On God’s Mission, Lifers and The Nazarene examine the experience and effects of Irish missionaries and NGOs in Africa, South America, and Asia. He directed the drama-documentaries Waterloo’s Warriors and Death or Canada which explore the participation of Irish soldiers in the Battle of Waterloo and the experience of migrants fleeing the famine for Canada during the Great Famine 1847. He collaborated with broadcaster Gay Byrne making two documentaries, My Father’s War revealing the terrible experiences of Irish soldiers during World War I and Last Orders, which charts the rise and fall of the Irish Christian Brothers and the effects of child abuse scandals in Ireland. Magan has written and directed two documentary series and feature length documentaries examining Ireland’s struggle for independence from 1913 to 1923. Both 1916 – The Irish Rebellion and The Irish Revolution. 1916 – The Irish Rebellion reached audiences of over 40 million people around the world. === Drama === In 2019, he worked in the eastern Gobi Desert for several months filming Dunhuang - Mysteries of the Sands. Written and directed by Magan in collaboration with Colm Whelan and Lu Bo, the historical drama series tells the story of the Silk Road city of Dunhuang, which, though long forgotten, was once one of the most important cities on China’s western frontier. The series will air in 2021. Magan directed the pilot episode for the long-running true crime investigation Discovery series Redrum. The series avoids traditional mystery programming by starting the stories at the scene of the crimes and working backward to reveal the killers. In 2016, Magan directed the award-winning comedy-drama series, Wrecking the Rising, starring Peter Coonan and Eoin McDonnell. This irreverent comedy series charting the adventures of feckless time-travelling amateur historians has been selected by the Irish Department of Education to be part of the Irish secondary school curriculum. Magan directed the Irish-language film, Éoinín na nÉan (2015) and the multi-award-winning short film, Angel. He has written several screenplays including The Noticer (2015), No Fury (2019) and, with writer Mark Doherty, The Trouble with Charlie (2019). Magan is set to produce Devil In The Feet, a cinema-documentary revealing the origins of Irish dance, due for international release in 2021. === Theatre and stadium events === Collaborating with Professor Chris Fitzpatrick, Magan wrote and directed the experimental play, And Spring Shall Come. In 2018, Magan was Creative Director of the World Meeting of Families, a music, song, and dance show held in Croke Park in Dublin to celebrate the visit of Pope Francis to Ireland featuring Andrea Bocelli, Shaun Davey, and a choir of a thousand. The event featured 1,500 performers and played to a record-breaking full house and television audiences around the world. He fulfilled a similar role, as Creative Director of the Gaelic Athletic Association's 1916 Commemoration show, Laochra. In recent years, he has made a series of short films in collaboration with Irish state bodies and the Department of the Taoiseach. They include This Is Ireland, Here We Live, and Ireland’s campaign video for a UN Security Council seat. ==Selected awards and honours== * Delhi International Film Festival (2020) for The Irish Revolution * Prix Europa (2019) for The Irish Revolution * Accolade Award (2018) for Sacred Sites * Programming Excellence Award, American Public TV (2016) for 1916 – The Irish Rebellion * Silver Sabre, World Military Film Festival (2016) for 1916 – The Irish Rebellion * Irish Film and Television Academy Award (2016) for 1916 – The Irish Rebellion * New York Film festival, Gold Award, World Media Festival (2015) for Waterloo’s Warriors * World Religious Film Festival (2014) for Lifers * Radharc Award (2014) for Lifers * Outstanding Contribution Award from the Screen Directors Guild of Ireland (2013) * Emmy Nomination Best Documentary (2013) for The Men Who Built America * Irish Film and Television Academy Award (2013) for The Radharc Squad * Milan International Film Festival (2013) for Angel * Best Drama, Fastnet Film Festival (2012) for Angel * Overall Winner, Fastnet Film Festival (2012) for Angel * Gemini Awards (2010) for Death or Canada * Irish Film and Television Academy Award (2007) for The Pope's Children ==See also== *Manchán Magan ==References *Official website * *Screen Directors Guild Ireland Category:1968 births Category:20th-century Irish people Category:21st-century Irish people Category:Living people Category:Irish documentary filmmakers Category:Irish documentary film directors Category:Irish film directors Category:Alumni of University College Dublin Category:People from Dublin (city) ","title":"Ruán Magan"},{"id":"20335699","text":"The Enchanted Island of Oz is a children's novel written by Ruth Plumly Thompson and illustrated by Dick Martin, and first published in 1976.Ruth Plumly Thompson, The Enchanted Island of Oz, Kinderhook, IL, The International Wizard of Oz Club, 1976. As its title indicates, the book is an entry in the series of Oz books created by L. Frank Baum and his successors.Paul Nathanson, Over the Rainbow: The Wizard of Oz as a Secular Myth of America, Albany, NY, State University of New York Press, 1991.Suzanne Rahn, The Wizard of Oz: Shaping an Imaginary World, New York, Twayne, 1998.Michael O'Neal Roley, Oz and Beyond: The Fantasy World of L. Frank Baum, Lawrence, KS, University Press of Kansas, 1997. It is the last (and shortest) of Thompson's 21 novels about the Land of Oz.The International Wizard of Oz Club published The Cheerful Citizens of Oz, a short collection of Thompson's Oz poetry, in 1992. Thompson's book tells the story of David Perry, a boy from Pennsylvania who, on a visit to a circus, wishes that a camel can talk. He is amazed when his wish is granted. (Only later does David learn that he possesses a magic wishing button, which enables and empowers the action of the story.) David nicknames the talking camel Humpty Bumpty; together the boy and camel embark on a whirlwind tour of strange lands, including Somewhere, Dwindlebury, and the flying island of Kapurta (which is the enchanted Island of the title). They meet the range of strange characters typical of Oz literature—among them, Water Lily, Queen Else of Somewhere, and a dragon named Dismocolese. Eventually the boy and camel make their way to the Emerald City in time for a birthday party for the Cowardly Lion. The Enchanted Island of Oz shows strong resemblances with Thompson's previous Oz book, Yankee in Oz. It also bears clear relationships to a larger context of fantasy works; Jonathan Swift's flying Island of Laputa in Gulliver's Travels is one of the most obvious of these links. The original edition of the book contains maps of the fantasy territories drawn by Martin and James Haff, and an afterword by Dorothy C. Maryott. ==References * On The Enchanted Island of Oz Category:Oz (franchise) books Category:1976 fantasy novels Category:1976 American novels Category:Novels set on islands Category:1976 children's books ","title":"The Enchanted Island of Oz"},{"id":"20335750","text":"Corporation$ is an EP by British death metal band Cancer, released after the band reunited in 2004. ==Track listing== # \\"Oil\\" – 4:19 # \\"Witch Hunt (Hardcore live in the studio 2003)\\" – 2:33 # \\"Dethroned Emperor (Nasty Nasty live in the studio)\\" – 4:51 # \\"Oxygen Thieves (Don't Breathe My Air Mix)\\" – 4:01 # \\"Oil (Severed Satchel Hairy Scary Mix)\\" – 5:29 Category:Cancer (band) albums Category:2004 albums ","title":"Corporation$"},{"id":"20335753","text":"Giraffoidea is a superfamily that includes the families Climacoceratidae, Antilocapridae, and Giraffidae.

He has served in the New Zealand Foreign Service for sixteen years, and lectured at the University of Canterbury and Victoria University of Wellington. He is the brother of Sir Douglas Graham, a former National Party MP (1984–1999) and cabinet minister (1991–1999). He is also a great-grandson of Robert Graham, an MP from 1855 to 1868. ==Education== Graham has a Bachelor of Commerce (BCom) from the University of Auckland, a Masters of Arts (MA) in International Relations from The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts, and a PhD from Victoria University of Wellington. He received Fulbright and Fletcher scholarships (1972), a McCarthy Fellowship (1986) and a Quatercentenary Fellowship at Emmanuel College, Cambridge University (1995). ==Career== As a New Zealand diplomat, Graham was involved in the negotiation of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone in the mid-1980s, and represented New Zealand's nuclear-free policy in the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva in the late 1980s. He worked as secretary-general of Parliamentarians for Global Action in New York (1989–1994), where he developed the concept of the \\"planetary interest\\" for promotion in parliaments around the world. From 1996 to 1998, Graham worked in Stockholm at the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, holding the position of director of planning and coordination. Graham was also a United Nations official working as a director at the UN University Leadership Academy (Amman, Jordan) from 1999 to 2002, and later as senior consultant in the Department of Political Affairs (2005–2006). He was also a visiting professor at the College of Europe in Bruges/Belgium, teaching International Relations at MA level. In 2007, after returning to New Zealand, he became adjunct senior fellow at the University of Canterbury School of Law, and was a senior lecturer at Victoria University of Wellington. Graham is founding director and trustee for the New Zealand Center for Global Studies, which commenced in 2013. ==Member of ParliamentFirst term: 2008–2011=== After standing in the Ilam electorate during the 2008 election, Graham was elected as a list MP after counting of the special votes. In his maiden speech, Graham noted that: \\"We are drawing down on Earth's natural resources, borrowing forward on the human heritage, irretrievably encroaching on our children's right to inherit the Earth in a natural and sustainable state.\\" In July 2009 Graham's International Non- Aggression and Lawful Use of Force Bill was drawn from the member's ballot. The bill would have outlawed the crime of aggression in New Zealand domestic law, with imprisonment for any New Zealand leader involved, and also required the government to table a legal opinion in Parliament before committing any forces to overseas military operations.New Zealand Parliamentary Debates 656 5740. The bill was voted down at its first reading, 64 to 58.New Zealand Parliamentary Debates 657 6818. ===Second term: 2011–2014=== Graham at the Cross-party Climate Change Vivid Report launch in Parliament in March 2017 In 2011, Graham stood again in Ilam and was re-elected as a list MP. In June 2013, Graham organised a public one-day climate change conference which was held at the old Legislative Council chamber at Parliament. The conference explored the state of climate science, the link between international action and domestic responsibility, the roles of civil society and businesses, available policy mechanisms, and ended with a political panel of MPs discussing climate change. ===Third term: 2014–2017=== At the 2014 general election, Graham was listed at number 7 on the Green party list. The ranking was two places lower than his 2011 ranking of number 5. Graham contested the Helensville electorate and was re-elected as a list MP. Graham holds the Green caucus portfolios of Assoc. Social Development: Veterans Affairs, Global Affairs (including Defence and Disarmament), and National Intelligence and Security (including NZSIS and GCSB). He serves on the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Privileges Committee. In October 2015, Graham formed a cross-party group, GLOBE-NZ, working on climate change. GLOBE-NZ is a national chapter of GLOBE-International, and has 35 MP's as members drawn from all seven political parties represented in the 51st Parliament. As chairman of the national chapter, Graham contracted a London-based consultancy, Vivid Economics, to prepare a report on \\"transformational pathways to carbon neutrality for New Zealand\\". The report, Net Zero in New Zealand: Scenarios to achieve domestic emission reduction the second half of the century, was launched in the New Zealand Parliament in March 2017. The initiative is regarded as a major step forward in clarifying inter-party discourse and debate on New Zealand's national climate change policy. On 7 August 2017, Graham and Party whip David Clendon announced that they were planning to resign as Green Party candidates for the 2017 election, after revelations that Party co-leader Metiria Turei committed benefit and electoral fraud. Graham and Clendon stated that their resignations were due to the public positions she had taken regarding her offending, and her subsequent refusal to step down from her leadership role. The next day, both Clendon and Graham resigned from the Party caucus, after there were moves to remove them involuntarily. On 9 August 2017, Turei resigned as Co-Leader of the Party and as a list candidate for the 2017 election. After Turei announced her resignation, Graham asked to be returned to the Green Party list, however co-leader James Shaw said he felt it unlikely to happen though acknowledged it was up to the party's executive to ultimately decide the issue. On 12 August it was announced that Graham's appeal to rejoin the list had been declined by the party executive. He gave his valedictory speech in Parliament on 16 August. He said he was leaving without \\"hard feelings\\", and said that: \\"If politics transgresses conscience, politics must cede.” Graham noted he was proud of the cross-party group on climate change he formed at Parliament (\\"Globe-NZ\\"), which produced a plan for New Zealand to reach zero net carbon emissions by 2050. ==Publications== * Graham, Kennedy (2008).

A major theme in the mathematical and computational analysis of GDSs is to relate their structural properties (e.g. the network connectivity) and the global dynamics that result. The work on GDSs considers finite graphs and finite state spaces. As such, the research typically involves techniques from, e.g., graph theory, combinatorics, algebra, and dynamical systems rather than differential geometry. In principle, one could define and study GDSs over an infinite graph (e.g. cellular automata or probabilistic cellular automata over \\\\mathbb{Z}^k or interacting particle systems when some randomness is included), as well as GDSs with infinite state space (e.g. \\\\mathbb{R} as in coupled map lattices); see, for example, Wu. In the following, everything is implicitly assumed to be finite unless stated otherwise. ==Formal definition== A graph dynamical system is constructed from the following components: > * A finite graph Y with vertex set v[Y] = {1,2, ... , n}. Depending on the > context the graph can be directed or undirected. * A state xv for each > vertex v of Y taken from a finite set K. The system state is the n-tuple x = > (x1, x2, ... , xn), and x[v] is the tuple consisting of the states > associated to the vertices in the 1-neighborhood of v in Y (in some fixed > order). * A vertex function fv for each vertex v. The vertex function maps > the state of vertex v at time t to the vertex state at time t + 1 based on > the states associated to the 1-neighborhood of v in Y. * An update scheme > specifying the mechanism by which the mapping of individual vertex states is > carried out so as to induce a discrete dynamical system with map F: Kn → Kn. The phase space associated to a dynamical system with map F: Kn → Kn is the finite directed graph with vertex set Kn and directed edges (x, F(x)). The structure of the phase space is governed by the properties of the graph Y, the vertex functions (fi)i, and the update scheme. The research in this area seeks to infer phase space properties based on the structure of the system constituents. The analysis has a local-to-global character. == Generalized cellular automata (GCA) == If, for example, the update scheme consists of applying the vertex functions synchronously one obtains the class of generalized cellular automata (CA). In this case, the global map F: Kn → Kn is given by F(x)_v = f_v(x[v]) \\\\;. This class is referred to as generalized cellular automata since the classical or standard cellular automata are typically defined and studied over regular graphs or grids, and the vertex functions are typically assumed to be identical. Example: Let Y be the circle graph on vertices {1,2,3,4} with edges {1,2}, {2,3}, {3,4} and {1,4}, denoted Circ4. Let K = {0,1} be the state space for each vertex and use the function nor3 : K3 → K defined by nor3(x,y,z) = (1 + x)(1 + y)(1 + z) with arithmetic modulo 2 for all vertex functions. Then for example the system state (0,1,0,0) is mapped to (0, 0, 0, 1) using a synchronous update. All the transitions are shown in the phase space below. 326 == Sequential dynamical systems (SDS) == If the vertex functions are applied asynchronously in the sequence specified by a word w = (w1, w2, ... , wm) or permutation \\\\pi = ( \\\\pi_1, \\\\pi_2,\\\\dots,\\\\pi_n) of v[Y] one obtains the class of Sequential dynamical systems (SDS). In this case it is convenient to introduce the Y-local maps Fi constructed from the vertex functions by : F_i (x) = (x_1, x_2,\\\\ldots, x_{i-1}, f_i(x[i]), x_{i+1}, \\\\ldots , x_n) \\\\;. The SDS map F = [FY , w] : Kn → Kn is the function composition : [F_Y ,w] = F_{w(m)} \\\\circ F_{w(m-1)} \\\\circ \\\\cdots \\\\circ F_{w(2)} \\\\circ F_{w(1)} \\\\;. If the update sequence is a permutation one frequently speaks of a permutation SDS to emphasize this point. Example: Let Y be the circle graph on vertices {1,2,3,4} with edges {1,2}, {2,3}, {3,4} and {1,4}, denoted Circ4. Let K={0,1} be the state space for each vertex and use the function nor3 : K3 → K defined by nor3(x, y, z) = (1 + x)(1 + y)(1 + z) with arithmetic modulo 2 for all vertex functions. Using the update sequence (1,2,3,4) then the system state (0, 1, 0, 0) is mapped to (0, 0, 1, 0). All the system state transitions for this sequential dynamical system are shown in the phase space below. 326 == Stochastic graph dynamical systems == From, e.g., the point of view of applications it is interesting to consider the case where one or more of the components of a GDS contains stochastic elements. Motivating applications could include processes that are not fully understood (e.g. dynamics within a cell) and where certain aspects for all practical purposes seem to behave according to some probability distribution. There are also applications governed by deterministic principles whose description is so complex or unwieldy that it makes sense to consider probabilistic approximations. Every element of a graph dynamical system can be made stochastic in several ways. For example, in a sequential dynamical system the update sequence can be made stochastic. At each iteration step one may choose the update sequence w at random from a given distribution of update sequences with corresponding probabilities. The matching probability space of update sequences induces a probability space of SDS maps. A natural object to study in this regard is the Markov chain on state space induced by this collection of SDS maps. This case is referred to as update sequence stochastic GDS and is motivated by, e.g., processes where \\"events\\" occur at random according to certain rates (e.g. chemical reactions), synchronization in parallel computation/discrete event simulations, and in computational paradigms described later. This specific example with stochastic update sequence illustrates two general facts for such systems: when passing to a stochastic graph dynamical system one is generally led to (1) a study of Markov chains (with specific structure governed by the constituents of the GDS), and (2) the resulting Markov chains tend to be large having an exponential number of states. A central goal in the study of stochastic GDS is to be able to derive reduced models. One may also consider the case where the vertex functions are stochastic, i.e., function stochastic GDS. For example, Random Boolean networks are examples of function stochastic GDS using a synchronous update scheme and where the state space is K = {0, 1}. Finite probabilistic cellular automata (PCA) is another example of function stochastic GDS. In principle the class of Interacting particle systems (IPS) covers finite and infinite PCA, but in practice the work on IPS is largely concerned with the infinite case since this allows one to introduce more interesting topologies on state space. ==Applications== Graph dynamical systems constitute a natural framework for capturing distributed systems such as biological networks and epidemics over social networks, many of which are frequently referred to as complex systems. ==See also== *Chemical reaction network theory *Dynamic network analysis (a social science topic) *Finite state machines *Hopfield networks *Kauffman networks *Petri nets ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * ==External links== *Graph Dynamical Systems – A Mathematical Framework for Interaction-Based Systems, Their Analysis and Simulations by Henning Mortveit Category:Dynamical systems Category:Algebra Category:Graph theory Category:Combinatorics ","title":"Graph dynamical system"},{"id":"20335870","text":"Progress and Perfection is a promo album by Swiss electronic duo Yello, released on 21 September 2007.

The marriage was deeply unpopular with the king's subjects and when a daughter, Costanza, was born, the king had to pretend to have her killed while secretly sending her to be brought up by Prince Corrado of Apulia. Now, faced with another rebellion from the Sicilians, Gualtiero is forced to renounce Griselda and promises to take a new wife. The proposed bride is in fact Costanza, who is unaware of her true parentage. She is in love with Corrado's younger brother, Roberto, and the thought of being forced to marry Gualtiero drives her to despair. ===Act 2=== Griselda returns to her home in the countryside where she is pursued by the courtier Ottone, who is in love with her. She angrily rejects his advances. Gualtiero and his followers go out hunting and come across Griselda's cottage. Gualtiero foils an attempt by Ottone to kidnap Griselda and allows her back to the court, but only as Costanza's slave. ===Act 3=== Ottone still resolutely pursues Griselda and Gualtiero promises him her hand as soon as he himself has married Costanza. Griselda declares she would rather die and, moved by her faithfulness, Gualtiero takes her back as his wife. He reveals the true identity of Costanza and allows her to marry Roberto. ==Sources *Libretto Category:Operas Category:Operas by Antonio Maria Bononcini Category:1718 operas Category:Italian-language operas Category:Operas based on literature Category:Operas based on works by Giovanni Boccaccio ","title":"Griselda (Antonio Maria Bononcini)"},{"id":"20336314","text":"Danny Gilmore (born December 2, 1949) was a Republican Assemblymember from California's 30th State Assembly district.

Leavitt as a young man at the wheel of the coasting schooner Alice S. Wentworth John Faunce Leavitt (1905-1974) was a well-known shipbuilder, writer on maritime subjects, painter of marine canvases, and curator of Mystic Seaport in Mystic, Connecticut. John F. Leavitt was born to the sea.John F. Leavitt at the wheel of the coasting schooner Alice S. Wentworth, South Norwalk, Connecticut, ca. 1920, Mystic Seaport His Maine family were sailors, as reflected in early photographs showing his seven-year-old sister Syrena and him at the wheel of the Alice S. Wentworth in Lynn, Massachusetts.Syrena Leavitt at the wheel of the coasting schooner Alice S. Wentworth, Lynn, Massachusetts, Mystic Seaport Leavitt himself was a crew member on several coastal schooners in Maine beginning in 1918 until about 1925, the tail end of the schooner era.Wake of the Coasters, Cape Cod History, capecodhistory.us/books Later in life, the boatbuilder and artist began working for the esteemed Mystic Seaport museum, where he continued painting and writing about his love: the sea and the boats built to withstand it. At Mystic, Leavitt worked as an assistant curator, applying his knowledge of sailing vessels to the museum's collection. He continued to paint and write, and his watercolor and oil paintings are in the collection of the Peabody Essex Museum, Salem, Massachusetts, and other museum and private collections. Leavitt painted everything from Old Ironsides to the Gloucester fishing schooner L. A. Dunton. In 1952 the maritime artist's works were the subject of a one-man show at the William A. Farnsworth Library and Art Museum, Rockland, Maine. Leavitt continued to write about the technical aspects of the shipbuilding industry, including the monograph Shipbuilding in Colonial Connecticut. Leavitt's best-known work was Wake of the Coasters, published in 1970 by Wesleyan University Press. Drawing on his work for the Maritime Historical Association of Mystic, Connecticut, Leavitt sketched a biography of the smaller New England coasting schooners in a work now considered a classic among aficionados. On the opening page of his work, Leavitt's elegiac tone towards the noble wind-driven ships of the past was evident. \\"The dude cruisers are only maritime ghosts in an atomic world\\", Leavitt wrote wistfully of the old schooners.The Schooner: Its Design and Development from 1600 to the Present, David Roy MacGregor, Naval Institute Press, 1997 In his works, both on canvas and paper, Leavitt's passion for the old schooners was palpable. \\"There was a time when spars and rigging made a commonplace pattern against the Maine sky\\", Leavitt wrote in Wake of the Coasters. \\"It was in 1938 when the last cargo-carrying schooner was launched in the State of Maine, yet today there seem to be very few who remember when the reaches and thoroughfares swarmed with coasting schooners. Perhaps that is because the sight was so taken for granted.\\"Maritime Landmarks: Large Vessels, Maritime Heritage Program, National Park Service Leavitt's books were often the exception in the world of cool rigging-and-spars nautical writing. In Wake, for instance, Leavitt revisited the sinking of the 1928 sinking of the schooner William Booth by its much larger counterpart, the Helen Barnet Gring, an enormous four-masted coasting schooner built in 1919 by Robert L. Bean in Camden, Maine, for the Boston shipping firm of Crowell and Thurlow. The three-masted Booth, according to Leavitt, was cut down and sunk by the Gring. In Leavitt's hands, these arcane tales of the sea were rendered with the passion of Herman Melville.Helen Barnet Gring (Schooner), G.W. Blunt White Library, Mystic Seaport Leavitt published a number of other books, most accompanied by his own artworks of the great coasting schooners. The Charles W. Morgan, published in 1973, delineated the history of the restored Morgan, the last wooden whaling ship, anchored at Mystic Seaport. The work included more than 80 photographs of the restored vessel, documenting the ship's crew at work on the vessel. In an unblinking assessment of the hazards of sea travel, Leavitt noted the number of crew deaths aboard the schooner. \\"The late author John F. Leavitt chronicled the life of the vessel\\", wrote Leslie Rule in her Ghost in the Mirror, \\"referencing archived ship logs to provide much of the information, including many fatalities.\\"Ghost in the Mirror, Andrews McMeel Publishing LLC, 2008 The papers of John Leavitt from 1966-74, during his time at Mystic as the Seaport's Associate Curator, are collected at the G. W. Blunt White Library at the Mystic Seaport Museum. The artist, writer and curator's photographs are in the collection of the George Eastman House in Rochester, New York. John Leavitt died on May 25, 1974, in Mystic, Connecticut. ==Fate of the Schooner John F. Leavitt== During the early 1970s a fan of the coasting schooners of New England, Ned Ackerman, became empassioned with a dream to build such a vessel, and to prove that commercial sail could still work. He had read all the books and talked with as many authorities as he could find. Among these was the master, John F. Leavitt. At the inaugural Schooner History Symposium held at the Bath Marine Museum in the summer of 1972, Mr. Leavitt and Mr. Ackerman were present. There were many living in Maine at the time who were tremendous experts in the history of the wooden schooners, and also there were many who owned these boats and were rebuilding them for use in the sail passenger trade. It was the perfect place to nurture an interest in the old working boats. Ackerman had commissioned a design for the vessel from the renowned naval architect, Pete Culler, the author of Skiffs and Schooners.Skiffs and Schooners, International Marine Publishing, c. 1974 R. D. \\"Pete\\" Culler had designed several schooners of note for the Concordia Company in South Dartmouth, Massachusetts. He was also the designer of the sail training vessel R. Tucker Thompson of New Zealand. Ackerman engaged to have this vessel built at Newbert & Wallace Shipyard in Thomaston, Maine. The keel was laid in 1976 of the 97-foot two-masted, centreboard schooner John F. Leavitt, named in honor of the author of Wake of the Coasters (1970). When finished she was painted white with a distinctive red waist, and her figurehead depicted a fox with feathers gripped in his mouth. The schooner was launched in late summer, 1979, and almost immediately began to encounter difficulties, running aground in the Saint George River and having to sit out a tide on her launching day. She made her maiden voyage down the coast to Quincy, Massachusetts, in November. It was late in the season for a North Atlantic voyage, but here again she had to wait for her cargo. One of her best crew was injured climbing a fence and could not sail with her. Leaving Quincy heavily laden, she sank a few days later following a heavy winter three-day North Atlantic gale near the Gulf Stream. Her crew were taken off the vessel by the Air National Guard, by rescue helicopter.Tall Ships Down, Daniel S. Parrott, McGraw Hill Professional, New York, 2004 The building and the eventual sinking of the John F. Leavitt was the subject of a film dubbed Coaster, some six years in the making.Filmmaker brings his true sea adventure to Newport, Providence Journal-Bulletin, Providence, R.I. Critics gave the film glowing reviews, and it won the Best Adventure Film Feature at the American Film Festival. \\"A thrilling story\\", said The Boston Phoenix. \\"Endowed with the beauty of an heroic epic\\", raved The Washington Post. The schooner, carrying a cargo to Haiti on her maiden voyage, foundered in a gale off Delaware, an event captured on film. Many in the schooner community, however, felt that throughout the sinking Ackerman was more concerned with saving face than saving his vessel. This view lead to a persistent joke at the time: (told with a Maine accent) \\"Called that boat the John F. Leave-It... and that's just what they did!.\\"Tuning the Rig: A Journey to the Arctic, Harvey Oxenhorn, Zoland Books, 2000, Charles W. Morgan, last wooden whaling ship, profiled by author and painter John F. Leavitt The 83-ton schooner with 6,441 feet of sail, built by enthusiast Ned Ackerman and carrying a cargo of lumber, was seen to founder in heavy seas.There was some speculation on the eventual fate of the vessel as it was never recorded actually vanishing beneath the waves but simply laboring in the gale's heavy seas. Sailors who viewed the film footage were not convinced that the conditions were as bad as had been claimed. Some believed that the schooner's lumber cargo might have kept her half-afloat for some time. The topic became a subject of such controversy that it prompted a story \\"The Abandonment of the John F. Leavitt\\" in Wooden Boat magazine of March/April 1980. Adding to the drama was the fact that the John F. Leavitt was the first sailing cargo ship built for more than 40 years in the United States and went to her grave on her maiden voyage. The ship was financed by a single enthusiast owner who was eager to demonstrate that wind power still had a place in the modern world. In Maine: A Bold Launching Into the Past, TIME magazine, September 3, 1979 The topsail schooner was built to demonstrate that a modern wooden schooner under sail could carry cargo and compete with the engine-driven ships of the twentieth century. ==References * Marine Paintings of John Faunce Leavitt, Peabody Essex Museum Category:1905 births Category:1974 deaths Category:Leavitt family Category:People from Lynn, Massachusetts Category:People from Maine Category:People from Mystic, Connecticut Category:20th-century American painters Category:American male painters Category:American sailors Category:Whaling ships Category:Museum ships in Mystic, Connecticut Category:Tall ships of the United States Category:20th-century American non- fiction writers ","title":"John Faunce Leavitt"},{"id":"20336397","text":"UHCC may refer to: *University of Houston, a university in the United States *Upper Hutt City Council, a city council in New Zealand ","title":"UHCC"},{"id":"20336410","text":"Location-based authentication is a special procedure to prove an individual's identity on appearance simply by detecting its presence at a distinct location.

Plagiarism in music now occurs in two contexts—with a musical idea (that is, a melody or motif) or sampling (taking a portion of one sound recording and reusing it in a different song). For a legal history of the latter see sampling. ==Overview== Any music that follows rules of a musical scale is limited by the ability to use a small number of notes. All forms of music can be said to include patterns. Algorithms (or, at the very least, formal sets of rules) have been used to compose music for centuries; the procedures used to plot voice-leading in Western counterpoint, for example, can often be reduced to algorithmic determinacy. For these reasons, accidental or \\"unconscious\\" plagiarism is possible. As well, some artists abandon the stigma of plagiarism altogether. Composer Dmitri Shostakovich perhaps commented sarcastically on the issue of musical plagiarism with his use of \\"We Wish You a Merry Christmas,\\" an instantly recognizable tune, in his Prelude No. 15 in D Flat, Op. 87. In some instances, it was also erroneously assumed that songs are still in copyright such as \\"Happy Birthday to You\\". In 2015, a lawsuit which challenged the copyright, found this was not the case. Many songs are in public domain. For example, the work of Robert Johnson (1911 – 1938) is public domain in the European Union because Johnson died more than 70 years ago (1938 + 70). Some songs of W.C. Handy (1873 – 1958) are public domain in the USA because they were published before 1922 (e.g. \\"Memphis Blues\\"), but they are normally not public domain in the European Union until 2028 (1958 + 70). But the \\"Rule of the shorter term\\" (i.e. where copyright law overlaps, the law with the shorter term is upheld) makes them public domain in the states of the European Union. According to U.S. copyright law, in the absence of a confession, musicians who accuse others of stealing their work must prove \\"access\\"—the alleged plagiarizer must have heard the song—and \\"similarity\\"—the songs must share unique musical components. though it is difficult to come to a definition of what is \\"similarity\\". ===Folk tradition=== The issue of plagiarism in folk music is problematic as copying and not crediting songs was common. Noted blues author and producer Robert Palmer states \\"It is the custom, in blues music, for a singer to borrow verses from contemporary sources, both oral and recorded, add his own tune and/or arrangement, and call the song his own\\". Folklorist Carl Lindahl, refers to these recycling of lyrics in songs as \\"floating lyrics\\". He defines it within the folk-music tradition as \\"lines that have circulated so long in folk communities that tradition-steeped singers call them instantly to mind and rearrange them constantly, and often unconsciously, to suit their personal and community aesthetics\\".Carl Lindahl, \\"Thrills and Miracles: Legends of Lloyd Chandler\\", Journal of Folklore Research, Bloomington: May–December 2004, Vol. 41, Issue 2/3, pp. 133–72. In 2012, when Bob Dylan was questioned over his alleged plagiarism of others music he responded, \\"It's an old thing – it's part of the tradition. It goes way back.\\" Princeton University professor of American history Sean Wilentz defended Dylan's appropriation of music stating \\"crediting bits and pieces of another's work is scholarly tradition, not an artistic tradition\\". In 1998, B.B. King stated on the issue, \\"I don't think anybody steals anything; all of us borrow.\\"Newman, Richard (1998). African American Quotations. Oryx Press. pp. 98. ===Musical ideas=== Plagiarism is relevant to different musical styles in different ways. In classical music, software exists that automatically generates music in the style of another composer, using musical analysis of their works. Most notably, David Cope has written a software system called \\"Experiments in Musical Intelligence\\" (or \\"EMI\\") that is capable of analyzing and generalizing from existing music by a human composer to generate novel musical compositions in the same style. EMI's output is convincing enough to persuade human listeners that its music is human- generated to a high level of competence. For this reason, Cope's work has been said to not produce original music. A different approach is being followed by Melomics, a technology focused on teaching computers the rules of music composition, not the works of previous composers. This technology has opened the way to truly creative computer-composers, like Iamus and Melomics109. The records produced (Iamus' album and 0music) are in the computer's own style, so they cannot be considered a pastiche or plagiarism of previous works. According to Theodor Adorno's highly controversial view, popular music in general employs extensive plagiarism: variety in the musical material occurs in details whereas genuinely original musical content tends to be sparse when compared to classical or art music. Contradicting this claim is classical music critic Mark Swed of the Los Angeles Times who said that many composers used material from previous composers—for example, \\"John Williams all but lifted the core idea of his soundtrack score from the Scherzo of Erich Korngold's Symphony in F-sharp Major, written 25 years earlier.\\" ===Sampling=== Sampling has long been an area of contention from a legal perspective. Early sampling artists simply used portions of other artists' recordings, without permission; once hip hop and other music incorporating samples began to make significant money, the original artists began to take legal action, claiming copyright infringement. Some sampling artists fought back, claiming their samples were fair use (a legal doctrine in the USA that is not universal). International sampling is governed by agreements such as the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works and the WIPO Copyright and Performances and Phonograms Treaties Implementation Act. Today, most major artists obtain prior authorization to use samples, a process known as \\"clearing,\\" by gaining permission to use the sample and, usually, paying an upfront fee and/or a cut of the royalties to the original artist. Independent musicians, lacking the funds and legal assistance to clear samples, are at a disadvantage unless they seek the services of a professional sample replay company or producer. Recently, the free culture movement, started mainly by Lawrence Lessig, has prompted many audio works to be licensed under a Creative Commons license that allows for legal sampling of the work provided the resulting work(s) are licensed under the same terms. ==Cases== Usually cases of alleged plagiarism are settled out of court, due to the expense of litigation. Most artists try and settle for costs that will be less than defending costs. Since the 1850s federal courts have published fewer than 100 opinions dealing with this issue. The Columbia Law School Library's Music Plagiarism Project provides information on many cases over the decades, with a few dating back to the 19th century. ===Led Zeppelin=== Led Zeppelin has been successfully and unsuccessfully accused of music plagiarism several times. *On Led Zeppelin's album Led Zeppelin II (1969), parts of the song \\"Bring It On Home\\" were copied from Sonny Boy Williamson's 1963 recording of \\"Bring It On Home,\\" written by Willie Dixon. On the same album, \\"The Lemon Song\\" included an adaptation of Howlin' Wolf's \\"Killing Floor.\\" In 1972, Arc Music, the publishing arm of Chess Records, brought a lawsuit against Led Zeppelin for copyright infringement over \\"Bring It On Home\\" and \\"The Lemon Song\\"; the case was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. Earlier UK pressings of the album listed the song as \\"Killing Floor\\" and part credited it to Burnett, Howling Wolf's real name. *Led Zeppelin's song \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" contained lyrics that were derivative of Willie Dixon's 1962 song \\"You Need Love.\\" In 1985, Dixon filed a copyright infringement suit, resulting in an out-of-court settlement. Later pressings of Led Zeppelin II credit Dixon as co-writer.Goldstein, Patrick. \\"Whole Lotta Litigation\\". Los Angeles Times, 3 February 1985: N72 *Led Zeppelin also paid a settlement to the publisher of Ritchie Valens' song \\"Ooh! My Head\\" over \\"Boogie with Stu\\" (from their album Physical Graffiti) which borrowed from Valens' song, although they had already listed Mrs Valens in the credits.Lehmer, Larry. The Day the Music Died: The Last Tour of Buddy Holly, the Big Bopper and Ritchie Valens (2004): 166 *Led Zeppelin's song \\"Dazed and Confused\\" was derived from a 1967 Jake Holmes song of the same name, which had been performed by Jimmy Page when he was with The Yardbirds.Fast, Susan. \\"Dazed and Confused\\".

New York Post. Retrieved 6 July 2010. The case was dismissed with prejudice in January 2012 following a stipulation filed by both parties. The 2012 Led Zeppelin release Celebration Day credits the song to \\"Jimmy Page, inspired by Jake Holmes\\". *The Led Zeppelin song \\"Black Mountain Side\\" sounds similar to Bert Jansch's version of the traditional folk song \\"Down by Blackwaterside\\". No legal action was ever taken against Led Zeppelin, because it could not be proved that the recording in itself constituted Jansch's own copyright, as the basic melody is traditional.Mick Wall (2008), When Giants Walked the Earth: A Biography of Led Zeppelin, London: Orion, p. 56 *A number of people have put forth the opinion that the introduction, and opening guitar arpeggios, of Led Zeppelin's \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" bears a close resemblance to the 1968 instrumental \\"Taurus\\" by the group Spirit.\\"Whammy Bar\\" Guitar World April 1997: 19 \\"But California's most enduring legacy may well be the fingerpicked acoustic theme of the song \\"Taurus,\\" which Jimmy Page lifted virtually note for note for the introduction to \\"Stairway to Heaven.\\" In May 2014 an attorney hired by Randy California's heirs announced plans to file a copyright infringement suit that will seek a co-writing credit for California on \\"Stairway to Heaven.\\"Los Angeles Times, 21 May 2014 A Los Angeles jury ruled in favor of Led Zeppelin in June 2016.

No legal action is known to have been taken. ===Successful suits and settlements=== *Solomon Linda was a South African musician, singer and composer best known as the composer of the song \\"Mbube\\", which later became the popular music success \\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\\". Despite the popularity and wide use of the song, Linda died impoverished in 1962 of renal failure. In February 2006, Linda's estate attained a legal settlement with Abilene Music company, which had the worldwide rights and had licensed the song to Disney. The primary outcomes of the settlement of February 2006 were: **The Linda estate will receive payment for past uses of The Lion Sleeps Tonight and an entitlement to future royalties from its worldwide use. **The Lion Sleeps Tonight is acknowledged as derived from Mbube. **Solomon Linda is acknowledged as a co-composer of The Lion Sleeps Tonight and will be designated as such in the future. *In March 1963, the Beach Boys released \\"Surfin' U.S.A.\\" When the single was released in 1963, the record listed Brian Wilson as the sole composer although the song was published by Arc Music, Chuck Berry's publisher. Later releases, beginning with Best of The Beach Boys in 1966, listed Chuck Berry as the songwriter. Later releases list both writers although the copyright has always been owned, since 1963, by Arc Music. Under pressure from Berry's publisher, Wilson's father and manager, Murry Wilson, had given the copyright, including Brian Wilson's lyrics, to Arc Music.Pegg, Bruce. Brown Eyed Handsome Man (2002): 162–163 *George Martin's score for the Beatles' \\"All You Need Is Love\\" (1967) contained melodies from several songs thought to be public domain, including \\"In the Mood,\\" written by Joe Garland and Andy Razaf. While the song was in the public domain, the Glenn Miller arrangement used was not and EMI made a royalty payment to KPM Publishing in July 1967.Lewisohn, Mark. The Beatles: Recording Sessions (1988): 120 * John Lennon's use of a line from Chuck Berry's \\"You Can't Catch Me\\" (\\"Here come up flat top / He was movin' up with me/\\") the 1969 Beatles' song \\"Come Together\\" (\\"Here comes ol' flat-top / He come groovin' up slowly\\") led to a lawsuit from Berry's publisher, Big Seven Music Corp. In 1973, a settlement was reached whereby Lennon agreed to record three of Big Seven's songs on his next album. Big Seven Music Corp. again sued Lennon for breach of contract, when his 1974 album, Walls and Bridges, failed to contain all three of the songs, with the court awarding the company US$6,795. *George Harrison was successfully sued in a prolonged suit that began in 1971 for plagiarizing The Chiffons' \\"He's So Fine\\" (1963) for the melody of his own \\"My Sweet Lord\\" (1970). In the ruling, the judge stated that he believed Harrison had not intentionally copied the song, but more than likely experienced an episode of cryptomnesia.The \\"My Sweet Lord\\"/\\"He's So Fine\\" Plagiarism Suit *In 1971, Johnny Cash paid songwriter Gordon Jenkins an out-of-court settlement of US$75,000 for plagiarizing liberally from Jenkins' 1953 song \\"Crescent City Blues,\\" for Cash's 1955 single \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\" (re-released in 1968).Streissguth, Michael. Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison: The Making of a Masterpiece (Da Capo Press, 2004): 21 *Rod Stewart was successfully sued by Brazilian songwriter Jorge Ben Jor, over \\"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?\\" melody and chorus similarities to Ben's 1972 song \\"Taj Mahal\\". *In autumn 1984 and throughout 1985, Huey Lewis sued Ray Parker, Jr., for plagiarism, alleging that Parker stole the melody of the song \\"Ghostbusters\\" (the theme from the movie of the same name), from Lewis's 1983 song \\"I Want A New Drug.\\" Lewis dropped the lawsuit after the two parties settled out-of- court in 1995.

In 2001, Guy came across the lyric book to \\"Nikita\\" and noticed similarities with his song. Despite repeated attempts by Guy to contact John over the issue, he never heard from him, and commenced legal action in 2012. On 31 October 2012, a federal judge granted John and Taupin's motion to dismiss, finding that the song did not infringe Hobbs's copyright because the only similar elements were generic images and themes that are not protected under copyright law. *Braham v Sony Music Publishing.

Like the previous season, the Lions started 1-4, but unlike 1983, the Lions couldn't come back. In a Lions season littered with numerous key injuries, the most painful was star running back Billy Sims suffering a career-ending knee injury in a game against the Minnesota Vikings during the season.

U.S. President James A. Garfield was assassinated in this station in 1881. Wilson Brothers & Company was a prominent Victorian-era architecture and engineering firm established in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, that was especially noted for its structural expertise. The brothers designed or contributed engineering work to hundreds of bridges, railroad stations and industrial buildings, including the principal buildings at the 1876 Centennial Exposition.Wilson Bros. & Co.'s 1885 Catalogue lists 432 railroad bridges, 42 highway bridges, 141 railroad stations, and almost 200 industrial buildings. Wilson Brothers & Company, Catalogue, pp. 9–29. They also designed churches, hospitals, schools, hotels and private residences. Among their surviving major works are the Pennsylvania Railroad, Connecting Railway Bridge over the Schuylkill River (1866–67), the main building of Drexel University (1888–91), and the train shed of Reading Terminal (1891–93), all in Philadelphia. ==History== Joseph M. Wilson, 1901 The firm's founders were Joseph Miller Wilson (1838–1902), architect and civil engineer, John Allston Wilson (1837–96), civil engineer, and Frederick Godfrey Thorn (c. 1837–1911), architect and civil engineer. Youngest brother Henry W. Wilson (1844–1910), civil engineer, joined the firm in 1886, and was promoted to partner in 1899. All three Wilson brothers attended Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY. Joseph also studied metallurgy at the University of Pennsylvania. Joseph worked in the construction department of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) from 1860 to 1876, designing bridges and railroad structures, including several commuter stations on the Main Line. For a PRR subsidiary, he designed the Baltimore & Potomac Railroad Passenger Terminal in Washington, DC (1873–77, demolished 1908), the station in which U.S. President James A. Garfield was assassinated in 1881. The National Gallery of Art now occupies its site at 6th Street & Constitution Avenue on the National Mall. John did engineering work for several railroads, including the PRR and the Reading Railroad. Wilson Brothers & Company was founded on January 1, 1876. For the 1876 Centennial Exposition, Henry Petit and Joseph M. Wilson co-designed the Main Exhibition Building—the largest building in the world, in length and enclosing 21-1/2 acres. The pair also designed Machinery Hall, and oversaw construction of the other principal buildings.George E. Thomas, \\"Design for the Main Exhibition Building, Philadelphia Centennial Exposition,\\" in James F. O'Gorman, et al., Drawing Toward Building: Philadelphia Architectural Graphics, 1732–1986 (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1986), pp. 140–42. Joseph co-authored a 3-volume history of the Philadelphia World's Fair.Earl Shinn, Walter Smith & Joseph M. Wilson, Masterpieces of the Centennial International Exhibition Illustrated (Philadelphia: Gebbie & Barrie, 1876–78). Joseph's commission for Philadelphia's Presbyterian Hospital (1874), may be related to later work on Presbyterian churches, nursing homes and an orphanage. The firm's extensive work for financer Anthony J. Drexel, the city's wealthiest citizen and a Roman Catholic, may have led to subsequent commissions for convents and Catholic hospitals. In Philadelphia, the firm designed the headquarters for the Baldwin Locomotive Works (pre-1885, demolished); and, in Beach Haven, NJ, the Baldwin Hotel (1883, burned 1960), Holy Innocents Episcopal Church (1881–82), and a number of summer homes for company executives. In 1881, the PRR hired the firm to design its main passenger terminal at Broad & Filbert Streets in Center City Philadelphia, directly west of City Hall. This was one of the first steel-framed buildings in America to use masonry not as structure, but as a curtain wall (as skyscrapers do).Thomas, Drawing Toward Building, pp. 140–42. The station was widely admired; 15% of the architects in an 1885 poll voted it one of \\"The Best Ten Buildings in the United States.\\"American Architect and Building News, June 13, 1885, pp. 283–85. Philadelphia City Hall was the only other Philadelphia building listed in the top 20. Eleven years later, the Wilson Brothers' Gothic Revival station was incorporated into Frank Furness's far larger Broad Street Station. The Wilsons designed its new train shed, at the time (1892), the largest single-span train shed in the world. In 1885, the Wilsons designed a high-ceilinged, 2-story banking house for Drexel & Company, on the southeast corner of 5th & Chestnut Streets in Philadelphia. Four years later, Drexel wished to expand, but Independence National Bank next door refused to sell. In response, Joseph Wilson designed the Drexel Building, a 10-story, H-shaped addition that surrounded Independence National Bank on the east, west and south sides, permanently depriving the neighbor of sunlight. The iron-skeletoned addition was built atop Drexel's banking house, and was one of the first examples of X-bracing. One of the buildings demolished for this was Library Hall, the Library Company of Philadelphia's headquarters, that had been design by William Thornton (1789–91). In an ironic turn of events, the Drexel Building itself was demolished in 1959, and a replica of Library Hall was built on its original site by the American Philosophical Society. Following the deaths of the two older brothers, the firm continued as Wilson, Harris and Richards. ==List of buildings== Max Schmitt in a Single Scull by Thomas Eakins (1871).

PBA Commissioner Chito Salud made a strong rebuke on Allado's tweet, saying, \\"these accusations that games are fixed, that we control who goes into the semis/finals/eventual champion are baseless and unfounded it came from someone who has lost his mind and a sore loser\\". He immediately deleted his comment and made a public apology on Twitter, saying \\"It was an error in judgement on my part to let my passion for this game get the best of me. As a professional I should've known better. I understand my statement may be construed by many as discrediting the PBA. Let it be known, however, that such is not my intention. Again, my sincerest apologies to the Comm Salud, Board of Governors & entire PBA.\\".

With hopes of improving the offense the Oilers won the bidding war to sign CFL star Quarterback Warren Moon. However, with Earl Campbell in full decline, the Oilers decided to trade him to the Saints after a 1–5 start.

Their second and last studio album, World Comes Calling, was released in October 2011. They played their last show on 2 March 2013. ==HistoryEarly beginnings=== Midnight Youth came together while at Rangitoto College in Auckland's North Shore with three members of the band playing together in New Zealand's high school Rockquest competition. Jeremy Redmore and Nick Campbell completed the group in mid-2006. The band released two independent singles, \\"Supernatural\\" and \\"A New Day\\", in 2007 and played opening slots for Incubus, OK Go and a re-formed INXS in their New Zealand shows. In 2008 they self-funded a trip to New York City to lodge and record with producer Terence Dover. With Hotbed Studios (vocals and bass) as their quarters and home base, Dover recorded them at studios across New York. Skyline Studios (drums) in Manhattan, GödelString (guitars, drums, vocals, bass) in Brooklyn, The Buddy Project (guitars and vocals) in Queens and (Grand Piano) City College's Sonic Arts Center concert hall were all unique recording environments Dover selected for their debut record The Brave Don't Run. ===Signing & debut album=== After recording the album, the band signed with Warner Music NZ in September 2008 and released their third single, \\"The Letter\\", to widespread acclaim across New Zealand. The song became the band's first Top 40 hit in New Zealand in January 2009, eventually peaking at #19 on the NZ singles chart and spending 17 weeks in total inside the NZ Top 40. Their follow-up single, \\"All On Our Own\\", debuted at #18 on the New Zealand RIANZ Singles Chart in March, 2009, and peaked at number six, after twelve weeks on the chart.

As of July 2018, the song has amassed over 8 million streams between Spotify and YouTube. Midnight Youth's debut album, The Brave Don't Run, was released in New Zealand on 27 April 2009, and peaked at number two on the New Zealand Album Chart.

CPG) or Color Media International, is a Serbian media company based in Novi Sad, Serbia. CPG publishes periodical print media such as lifestyle magazines, weekly tabloids, and glossy publications. Its various publications sell over two million copies each month, amounting to an annual revenue stream of over 20 million euros. CPG is registered as a limited liability company (LLC) and contains assets in Serbia, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro, and North Macedonia. Currently, the company publishes 84 periodicals, including its centerpiece publications, weekly tabloid Svet and monthly health/lifestyle magazine Lepota i zdravlje. The company is owned by Velibor Đurović and Robert Čoban. ==History== 1992-1995 The company was founded in April 1992 when Robert Čoban and Velibor Đurović began publishing a biweekly student paper called Index at the University of Novi Sad. After initial political and financial hardships, the paper grew into a biweekly magazine called Svet (The World), focused mainly on politics, war in the Bosnia and Croatia region, and crime growth in Serbia. The circulation ranged from 3,000 to 10,000 copies and was printed by the printing house Forum in Novi Sad. Simultaneously, a company called Svet Press, owned by Coban and Djurovic, was created to oversee the magazine. 1996–1999 The magazine changed its format from Berliner to tabloid after transferring to the printing house Borba in Belgrade. These changes caused a gradual shift in concept, Svet became a magazine focused on entertainment and celebrity lifestyles, and published some of the first paparazzo photographs in the history of Serbian publishing. In the following years, as a part of the publishing house Svet Press, the following editions have been started: Zona (The Zone), Moja tajna (My Secret), Moja romansa (My Romance), Moje srce (My Heart) and Teen Story, the first magazine printed abroad (Revai Nyomda, Budapest) on glossy paper. In December 1996, in cooperation with the Open Society Fund, a special edition of Svet was published dedicated to the crime growth and the police torture over citizens in Serbia. At the beginning of the NATO bombing in March 1999, the magazines were not issued for a few days. However, in April the complete production continued with a reduced number of pages and material adapted to the new circumstances. In the months following the NATO bombing, Svet Press published their first two enigmatic magazines, Skandi svet and Sfinga (The Sphynx), and culinary magazines, Tajne kuhinje (Kitchen Secrets) and Slatke tajne (Sweet Secrets). These magazines are no longer published. In August 1999, Svet Press established their first daughter company, Svet Print (The World Print), in Banjaluka. Four months later, an additional daughter company, Monte Color, was established in Podgorica. At the Frankfurt book fair in 1999, Svet Press concluded its first license contract and started publishing the British children's magazine Junior, which is still published today. 2000–2001 At the beginning of the new millennium, Svet press started several of its own brands, including Lepota i zdravlje (Health and Beauty), Moja beba (My Baby) and a variety of enigmatic magazines and love stories. The company further expanded into Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Svet magazine, the company’s basic publication, increased the number of colour pages and introduced glossy covers, which resulted in a rise in circulation. A New Year's edition from December 2001 published 250,000 copies. By the end of 2001, Svet Press established the company Svet Verlag with headquarters in Hamburg and began a European issue of Svet. 2002–2003 In the summer of 2002, negotiations were made with the German company Heinrich Bauer Verlag from Hamburg. This resulted in the publishing of Bravo, a biweekly magazine for teenagers that has gained the highest circulation in Europe. At the same time, magazines Joy and Lea were introduced at a party celebrating ten years of CPG. Joy, the first women's monthly licensed magazine in Serbia, was started in cooperation with Swiss company Marquard Media AG and still has the highest circulation in this sector today. Biweekly magazine Lea is no longer published. In 2003, CKM, the first licensed male magazine in Serbia, and Bravo Girl, a monthly magazine for teenage girls, began in cooperation with Marquard Media AG. CPG further expanded with companies in Macedonia and Croatia and founded a small printing house called Color Print as part of the Color Press Group. Color Print began by publishing only crossword puzzles and love stories but now publishes over 2,000,000 magazine copies from the company’s portfolio. 2004–2006 In 2004, CPG had a dynamic development, starting several dozens of new domestic and licensed editions in Serbia and the region including: TV Novele (TV Novellas), Bravo ScreenFun, FHM, Auto Start, Brava Casa, Lekovito Bilje (Medicinal Plants), Astro, Mobi and a large number of children's, enigmatic and love magazines. In association with Video Top, a company from Maribor, Color Press Group established JV companies in Slovenia and Croatia, which jointly published Bravo, Brava Casa, FHM, Lepota i Zdravlje, and numerous love stories and children's publications. 2007–2008 In January 2007, a party celebrating 15 years of the company and the 500th issue of Svet magazine was held at MB Brewery for 1,200 employees and guests. It was also the occasion for filming a five-minute promo clip about company history and publishing a special edition of Svet magazine celebrating the Jubilee. On July 19, 2007, a launch party at Beli dvor celebrated the first issue of Hello!, the oldest celebrity magazine. Additionally, a variety of magazines were issued in 2007 including a specialized magazine, Moja kosa (My hair); a monthly health magazine with high circulation Top zdravlje (Top Health); magazines Kuhinjica and Dobra hrana (in cooperation with a production company, Skorpion); Bauer's biweekly female magazine, Tina; Burda; Moje dete; and specialized bimonthly magazine, Beauty Expert. In 2007, CPG published six out of the 12 magazines with the highest circulation in Serbia with Svet, their basic publication, at the top. In June 2008, Hello! magazine, a biweekly publication, began being published weekly and CPG received a June Award from the Regional Chamber of Commerce in Novi Sad. In 2008, CPG reached a record for circulation in the region after issues of Lepota i zdravlje were released for the market of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Slovenia. The Macedonian (May) and Croatian (July) issues were also published. In July, the circulation of Lepota i zdravlje in Bosnia-Herzegovina reached more than 31,000 copies, hitting a new record. The project Lepota i zdravlje went international at the fair of magazine licenses in Moscow (organized by FIPP) and for the first time, CPG offered one of its licenses at the international market. In September 2008, company headquarters in Novi Sad were relocated to a new commercial building (owned by CPG) on Temerinska street for the first time in 16 years. In December, the company launched their regional website, which became the most popular show business website in the region within a couple of months. By the end of 2008, CPG had daughter companies from Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro, Slovenia, Croatia and Macedonia as well as correspondence offices in Frankfurt, Wien, Basel, Paris and many other European cities. They company had over 350 permanent employees and approximately 150 part-time associates. 2009 - 2010 In the first quarter of 2009, when economic crisis had already swept through all sections of society including the media industry, CPG was the only publisher among the great publishers in Serbia that recorded a rise in advertising income amounting to 33%. However, the recession forced CPG to close down several magazines, such as Moje dete (My Child), Pony, Lepe princeze (Pretty Princesses) and Junior, as well as limit publication of FHM and Bravo Girl to tri-monthly. In the first half of 2010, CPG launched the sixth regional issue of their most successful magazine, Ljepota i zdravlje (Beauty and Health), a Montenegrin issue, and a female lifestyle website. By the end of 2010, Italian fashion magazine Grazia had taken over in Croatia with the license of publishing house Mondadori. A beauty website was launched and, apart from the Serbian edition, a Croatian edition of The Economist yearbook \\"The World in 2011\\" was published including the licensed quarterly magazine Savršeno venčanje (Perfect Wedding). 2011 In the first months of 2011, CPG launched the Bosnian, Croatian and Macedonian edition of magazine Pošalji recept (Send The Recipe). In Serbia, new interactive magazines Mamina škola (Mother's School) and Moja priča (My Story) were also published. ==Publications== *Svet (since 1992, weekly) *Magična zona (since 1997, monthly) *Moja beba (since October 2000, monthly) *Lepota & Zdravlje (since 2001, monthly) *Bravo (foreign licensed Serbian edition of the German teen magazine, since 2002, bi-weekly) *Alan Ford (Italian comic strip, since 2003, monthly) *Joy (foreign licensed Serbian edition, since April 2003, monthly) *Bravo Girl (foreign licensed Serbian edition, since 2003, quarterly) *Mobitech (since 2004, monthly) *Bravo ScreenFun (foreign licensed Serbian edition, since April 2005) *TV Novele (since 2005, monthly) *Bravacasa (foreign licensed Serbian edition of the Italian interior design magazine, since 2006, monthly) *Astro (since 2006, monthly) *Lekovito bilje (since 2006, monthly) *Hello!

The opera uses a revised version of the 1701 Italian libretto by Apostolo Zeno that was based on Giovanni Boccaccio's The Decameron (X, 10, \\"The Patient Griselda\\").The Oxford Dictionary of Opera, by John Warrack and Ewan West (1992), 782 pages, The Italian poet Paolo Antonio Rolli was hired to revise the text. Bononcini's opera premiered in London at the King’s Theatre on 22 February 1722. From the opera, an aria \\"Per la gloria d'adorarvi\\" is nowadays a famous and popular concert piece, with opera singers such as Oleg Ryabets (performed in 2001, at Kasals Hall, Tokyo, and in 2005, at Festival Die Metamorfosen by Georges-Emmanuel Schneider, Interlaken), or Ramon Vargas (recording in 2002, Arie Antiche). Bononcini's brother, Antonio Maria Bononcini, also composed his own opera to Zeno's libretto four years earlier.Lowell Lindgren: \\"Griselda (iii)\\", Grove Music Online ed. L. Macy (Accessed November 22, 2008), (subscription access) ==History== Paolo Antonio Rolli (1687 -1765) The plot of Zeno’s libretto was for the most part retained in Bononcini's opera but the text was almost entirely rewritten by Paolo Antonio Rolli. The character Corrado was eliminated entirely and three of the main characters were renamed: Ottone became Rambaldo, Costanza became Almirena, and Roberto became Ernesto. The work was received well at its premiere and was successively performed numerous times over the next four months. One of the major reasons for this success was the prodigious acting and singing talent of Anastasia Robinson, who portrayed the title role. The opera was later revived by Handel and Heidegger’s company on 22 May 1733 under the urging of Francesco Bernardi, called Senesino, who portrayed Gualtiero in the original production. Griselda is one of only two London operas for which Bononcini published the overture and all the arias. Charles Burney owned a score of Griselda, but neither it nor any other score including recitatives is extant. ==Music== Bononcini's music, although well crafted, is at times strangely juxtaposed to the opera's plot and text. The opera is filled with dulcet arias which are reminiscent of a pastoral opera rather than a story about a vindictive tyrant. Regardless, the music is enchanting and is largely responsible for the success of the work. Richard Steele wrote in The Conscious Lovers (1722), this about the opera's music: \\". . . something in that Rural Cottage of Griselda, her forlorn Condition, her Poverty, her Solitude, her Resignation, her Innocent Slumbers, and that lulling Dolce Sogno that’s sung over her; it had an Effect upon me, that—in short I never was so well deceiv’d at any [other Opera].\\" Probably the most famous song from the opera is Ernesto's aria, \\"Per la gloria d’adorarvi,\\" which remains to this day a popular selection for concert and recital performance. Other notable pieces include \\"Dolce sogno, deh le porta\\" and \\"Volgendo, a me lo sguardo\\" for Gualtiero. These three arias were very popular and were reprinted, for example in Richard Neale’s A Pocket Companion for Gentlemen and Ladies (London, 1724) and in The British Musical Miscellany (London, 1735). ==Roles== {  !Role !Voice type !Premiere Cast, 22 February 1722 - Griselda, wife of Gualtiero contralto Anastasia Robinson - Gualtiero, King of Thessaly contralto (originally a castrato) Senesino - Ernesto, lover of Almirena soprano (originally castrato) Benedetti - Almirena, missing daughter of Griselda and Gualtiero soprano Salvai - Rambaldo, a Sicilian nobleman bass Boschi - } ==Synopsis== Place: Near Palermo in Sicily. Detail from The Story of Patient Griselda, painted circa 1500 King Gualtiero has married Griselda, a peasant woman and his longtime mistress, and fears that she will not be accepted among the nobility. Concerned that a rebellion might arise, the king decides he must prove that Griselda is worthy to be their queen and the mother of their future king. He tests her virtue and steadfastness with a series of cruel ordeals, including telling her a lie that their long-lost daughter was killed on his orders. Gualtiero banishes Griselda from the court and announces that he intends to take another wife, the young woman Almirena, who is, unknown to all, their missing daughter. Almirena is highly upset over the king's proposal as she is in love with Ernesto.Malcolm Boyd, Lowell Lindgren: \\"Griselda (i)\\", Grove Music Online ed. L. Macy (Accessed November 21, 2008), (subscription access) Meanwhile, Griselda has returned to the humble cottage where she once lived. A beautiful woman, she has caught the attention of Rambaldo, a Sicilian nobleman, who attempts to woo her. After refusing him, Rambaldo threatens to kill her infant son, Everardo, unless she agrees to marry him. Griselda refuses and flees to the palace where she is permitted to stay as a servant to Almirena. Gualtiero, as a final test, orders Griselda to marry Rambaldo, which she refuses to his satisfaction. The king reveals his true motive for tormenting her and accepts her again as his queen to the satisfaction of Almirena and Ernesto who can now be reunited. Rambaldo, who confesses to have stirred up the nobles in the hope of winning Griselda, is forgiven. ==Sources== Category:Operas by Giovanni Bononcini Category:Italian-language operas Category:1722 operas Category:Operas Category:Operas based on works by Giovanni Boccaccio ","title":"Griselda (Giovanni Bononcini)"},{"id":"20336761","text":"Harvey Carey (born March 18, 1979) is a Filipino-American professional basketball player for the TNT Tropang Giga of the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA). ==PBA career statistics== Correct as of October 3, 2016Player at PBA-Online! ===Season-by-season averages=== -  align=left   align=left  Talk 'N Text  56  29.6  .487  .083  .507  8.5  1.3  .7  .3  10.7 -  align=left   align=left  Talk 'N Text  27  19.4  .513  .000  .500  4.7  1.0  .3  .0  6.7 -  align=left   align=left  Talk 'N Text  41  23.6  .514  .000  .505  7.2  .7  .5  .6  7.7 -  align=left   align=left  Talk 'N Text  62  30.8  .580  .000  .523  7.6  1.5  .4  .2  11.4 -  align=left   align=left  Talk 'N Text  34  24.1  .401  .000  .587  4.7  1.7  .5  .4  5.6 -  align=left   align=left  Talk 'N Text  46  30.2  .545  .000  .604  9.7  1.7  .3  .8  8.6 -  align=left   align=left  Talk 'N Text  46  26.9  .562  .000  .579  8.2  1.6  .5  .4  10.8 -  align=left   align=left  Talk 'N Text  65  21.8  .476  .000  .639  8.0  1.4  .3  .3  8.5 -  align=left   align=left  Talk 'N Text  45  18.3  .445  .200  .648  6.3  1.0  .2  .2  6.4 -  align=left   align=left  Talk 'N Text  55  13.8  .419  .000  .804  4.6  .6  .3  .1  3.8 -  align=left   align=left  Talk 'N Text  47  15.7  .406  .000  .542  4.8  .5  .2  .3  3.7 -  align=left   align=left  Talk 'N Text  46  16.0  .446  .000  .608  5.4  .5  .3  .4  4.2 -  align=left   align=left  TNT  39  13.7  .450  .000  .569  5.3  .7  .2  .4  3.9 -class=sortbottom  align=center colspan=2  Career  609  22.2  .496  .044  .574  6.7  1.1  .4  .3  7.3 == References == Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:American men's basketball players Category:Basketball players from California Category:Filipino men's basketball players Category:Philippine Basketball Association All-Stars Category:Power forwards (basketball) Category:Small forwards Category:Sonoma State Seawolves men's basketball players Category:Sportspeople from San Francisco Category:TNT Tropang Giga players ","title":"Harvey Carey"},{"id":"20336783","text":"Smiling Kelly is the third album released by Singaporean singer Kelly Poon.

The standard supports two configurations: symmetric, operating at 10 Gbit/s data rate in both directions, and asymmetric, operating at 10 Gbit/s in the downstream (provider to customer) direction and 1 Gbit/s in the upstream direction. It was ratified as IEEE 802.3av standard in 2009. EPON is a type of passive optical network, which is a point-to-multipoint network using passive fiber optic splitters rather than powered devices for fan-out from hub to customers. == Standardization== The Ethernet in the first mile task force of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.3 standards committee published standards that included a passive optical network (PON) variant in 2004. In March 2006, the IEEE 802.3 held a call for interest for a 10 Gbit/s Ethernet PON study group. According to the CFI materials, representatives from the following companies supported the formation of the study group:10Gb/s PHY for EPON – Call For Interest Presentation Advance/Newhouse Communications, Aeluros, Agilent, Allied Telesyn, Alloptic, Ample Communications, Astar-ODSM, Broadcom, Centillium Communications, China Netcom, China Telecom, Chunghwa Telecom, Cisco Systems, ClariPhy Communications, Conexant Systems, Corecess, Corning, Delta Electronics, ETRI, Fiberxon, FOTEK Optoelectronics, ImmenStar, Infinera, ITRI, KDDI R&D; Labs., K-Opticom, Korea Telecom, NEC, OpNext, Picolight, Quake Technologies, Salira Systems, Samsung Electronics, Softbank BB, Teknovus, Teranetics, Texas Instruments, Telecom Malaysia, TranSwitch, UNH-IOL, UTStarcom, Vitesse. By September 2006, IEEE 802.3 formed the 802.3av 10G-EPON Task Force to produce a draft standard. In September 2009, the IEEE 802 Plenary ratified an amendment to 802.3 to publish 802.3av amendment as the standard IEEE Std 802.3av-2009. Major milestones: {  border=\\"1\\" - ! Date !

Working Group balloting began. -  November 2008  Cut-off date for last technical change -  January 2009  Draft D3.0 produced. Sponsor balloting began. -  September 2009  Standard approved. } The work on the 10G-EPON was continued by the IEEE P802.3bk Extended EPON Task Force, formed in March 2012. The major goals for this Task Force included adding support for PX30, PX40, PRX40, and PR40 power budget classes to both 1G-EPON and 10G-EPON. The 802.3bk amendment was approved by the IEEE-SA SB in August 2013 and published soon thereafter as the standard IEEE Std 802.3bk-2013. On June 4, 2020, the IEEE approved IEEE 802.3ca, which allows for symmetric or asymmetric operation with downstream speeds of 25 Gbit/s or 50 Gbit/s, and upstream speeds of 10 Gbit/s, 25 Gbit/s, or 50 Gbit/s over the same power-distance-splitter budgets. == Architecture  Symmetric (10/10G-EPON) === Symmetric-rate 10/10G-EPON supports both transmit and receive data paths operating at 10 Gbit/s. The main driver for 10/10G-EPON was to provide adequate downstream and upstream bandwidth to support multi- family residential building (known in the standard as Multi Dwelling Unit or MDU) customers. When deployed in the MDU configuration, one EPON Optical Network Unit (ONU) may be connected to up to a thousand subscribers. The 10/10G-EPON employs a number of functions that are common to other point-to- point Ethernet standards. For example, such functions as 64B/66B line coding, self-synchronizing scrambler, or gearbox are also used in optical fiber types of 10 Gigabit Ethernet links. === Asymmetric (10/1G-EPON) === The asymmetric 10/1G-EPON appear less challenging than the symmetric option, as this specification relies on fairly mature technologies. The upstream transmission is identical to that of the 1G-EPON (as specified in IEEE standard 802.3ah), using deployed burst-mode optical transceivers. The downstream transmission, which uses continuous-mode optics, will rely on the maturity of 10 Gbit/s point-to-point Ethernet devices. === Efficiency === Like all EPON networks, 10G-EPON transmits data in variable-length packets up to 1518 bytes, as specified in the IEEE 802.3 standard. These variable-length packets are better suited to IP traffic than the fixed-length, 53-byte cells used by other Passive Optical Networks, such as GPON. This can significantly reduce 10G-EPON's overhead in comparison to other systems. Typical 10G-EPON overhead is approximately 7.42%. Typical GPON overhead is 13.22%. This high data-to- overhead ratio also enables high utilization with low-cost optical components. === Power budgets === The 802.3av defines several power budgets, denoted either PR or PRX. PRX power budget describes asymmetric–rate PHY for PON operating at 10 Gbit/s downstream and 1 Gbit/s upstream. PR power budget describes symmetric–rate PHY for PON operating at 10 Gbit/s downstream and 10 Gbit/s upstream. Each power budget is further identified with a numeric representation of its class, where value of 10 represents low power budget, value of 20 represents medium power budget, and value of 30 represents high power budget. The 802.3av draft standard defines the following power budgets: {  border=\\"1\\" - ! Power Budget ! Downstream Line Rate (Gbit/s) ! Upstream Line Rate (Gbit/s) ! Channel Insertion Loss (dB) ! Notes - ! PRX10  10.3125  1.25  20  compatible with PX10 power budget defined for 1G-EPON by 802.3ah - ! PRX20  10.3125  1.25  24  compatible with PX20 power budget defined for 1G-EPON by 802.3ah - ! PRX30  10.3125  1.25  29  compatible with PX30 power budget defined for 1G-EPON by 802.3bk - ! PR10  10.3125  10.3125  20  compatible with PX10 power budget defined for 1G-EPON by 802.3ah - !

PR30  10.3125  10.3125  29  compatible with PX30 power budget defined for 1G-EPON by 802.3bk } The 802.3bk added support for a new 10/10G-EPON and 10/1G-EPON power class for PR or PRX PMDs, respectively, as shown below: {  border=\\"1\\" - ! Power Budget ! Downstream Line Rate (Gbit/s) ! Upstream Line Rate (Gbit/s) ! Channel Insertion Loss (dB) ! Notes - ! PRX40  10.3125  1.25  33  compatible with PX40 power budget defined for 1G-EPON by 802.3bk - ! PR40  10.3125  10.3125  33  compatible with PX40 power budget defined for 1G-EPON by 802.3bk } === Forward error correction === The 10G-EPON employs a stream-based forward error correction (FEC) mechanism based on Reed-Solomon(255, 223). The FEC is mandatory for all channels operating at 10 Gbit/s rate, i.e., both downstream and upstream channels in symmetric 10 Gbit/s EPON and the downstream channel in the 10/1 Gbit/s asymmetric EPON. Upstream channel in the asymmetric EPON is the same as in 1 Gbit/s EPON, an optional frame-based FEC using Reed- Solomon(255, 239). === Usable bandwidth === 10G-EPON uses 64B/66B line coding, thus encoding overhead is just 3.125% compared to 25% encoding overhead that 1G-EPON has due to its use of 8b/10b encoding. The usable bandwidth in 10G-EPON is 10 Gbit/s out of a raw bandwidth of 10.3125 Gbit/s. == Backward compatibility == The 10G-EPON standard defines a new physical layer, keeping the MAC, MAC Control and all the layers above unchanged to the greatest extent possible. This means that users of 10G-EPON can expect backward compatibility of network management system (NMS), PON-layer operations, administrations, and maintenance (OAM) system, DBA and scheduling, and so on. === Coexistence with 1G-EPON === The 802.3av standard places significant emphasis on enabling simultaneous operation of 1 Gbit/s and 10 Gbit/s EPON systems on the same outside plant. In the downstream direction, the 1 Gbit/s and 10 Gbit/s channels are separated in the wavelength domain, with 1 Gbit/s transmission limited to 1480–1500 nm band and 10 Gbit/s transmission using 1575–1580 nm band. In the upstream direction, the 1 Gbit/s and 10 Gbit/s bands overlap. 1 Gbit/s band spreads from 1260 to 1360 nm; 10 Gbit/s band uses 1260 to 1280 nm band. This allows both upstream channels to share spectrum region characterized by low chromatic dispersion, but requires the 1 Gbit/s and 10 Gbit/s channels to be separated in time domain. Since burst transmissions from different ONUs now may have different line rates, this method is termed dual- rate TDMA. Various OLT implementations may support 1 Gbit/s and 10 Gbit/s transmissions only downstream direction, only upstream direction, or in both downstream and upstream directions. The following table illustrates which ONU types are simultaneously supported by various OLT implementations: {  border=\\"1\\" - ! OLT Implementation ! Supported ONU types -  Downstream: two wavelengths Upstream: single rate  (1) 1G-EPON ONU (2) 10/1G-EPON ONU -  Downstream: single wavelength Upstream: dual rate  (1) 10/10G-EPON ONU (2) 10/1G-EPON ONU -  Downstream: two wavelengths Upstream: dual rate  (1) 1G-EPON ONU (2) 10/1G-EPON ONU (3) 10/10G-EPON ONU } == See also == * Ethernet in the first mile == References  External links == * Category:Broadband Category:Network architecture Category:Fiber-optic communications Category:IEEE 802 ","title":"10G-EPON"},{"id":"20336790","text":"Tarsistes philippii is a taxonomically dubious species of guitarfish, family Rhinobatidae. It is known only from a dried head from the Juan Fernández Islands off Chile. The head had a long, thin, flat snout, rounded at the tip like that of the goblin shark, and the underside covered with small stellate prickles except for the base. The head was covered with larger spinules, with six still larger ones forming a curve around the eye. The original specimen was assigned to the genus Rhynchobatis without a species name by Philippi in 1858; David Starr Jordan considered that genus name preoccupied (by Rhynchobatus) and coined the new scientific name Tarsistes philippii for it in 1919. However, the holotype has never been studied or described since, so the status of this species is uncertain. In their revision of the generic alpha- taxonomy of Rhinobatidae, Last et al.

Williams Jones Cup championship in Taipei.http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/165096/ali-peek-like-the- incredible-hulk-without-the-attitude ==PBL== In 1996, he played with AMA Cybertigers, as a 21-year-old amateur player in the Philippine Basketball League (PBL). ==PBA career== Peek entered the PBA in 1998 after being drafted third overall by the now-defunct Pop Cola Panthers. Because of his height, standing only at 6 ft 4, despite his perceived presence in the low post as a top player in the PBA and judging by his stats, he remains not to be selected by the Philippine national team. He was the Panther's leading scorer, rebounder and shot-blocker. At the start of the 2001 PBA season, he was traded along with Jon Ordonio, to the rebuilding Alaska Aces for then-Alaska franchise player Johnny Abarrientos and Poch Junio. During his time with the Aces, Peek's career blossomed despite the team falling short of winning a championship. In his first two years with the Aces, Alaska's decision to go \\"younger\\" paid off. Surrounded by talented youngsters John Arigo, Mike Cortez and Brandon Cablay during the 2003-04 Season, Peek won Best Player of the Conference honors in the 2003 Invitational Cup including a championship against his former team which is, during that time, named the Coca-Cola Tigers. He was also included in the Mythical first team twice. During the third conference of the 2004-05 Season, Peek was traded back along with John Arigo to his former team, the Coca-Cola Tigers in exchange for former Alaska player Jeffrey Cariaso and Reynel Hugnatan. In the 2007-08 Season, the Tigers traded Peek and a first round draft pick to Talk N Text in exchange for disgruntled star Asi Taulava. Before the 2010-11 PBA Season ended, the Sta.Lucia Realtors announced that the team had been put on sale and Peek was dealt to the Realtors in a controversial trade that involved Sta. Lucia stars Kelly Williams and Ryan Reyes. Peek played the few remaining games in Sta. Lucia before going back to Talk N Text at the start of the 2010-11 PBA Season. On November 7, 2011, Peek was shot in the neck by an unidentified gunman at the parking lot of the RFM Sports Center in Pioneer in Mandaluyong City.http://sportspinas.com/pba-ali-peek-shooting-suspect-identified- charged.html He was rushed to the hospital and was out of danger. He has since returned to active play from the incident. On February 26, 2014, Ali Peek announced on Twitter his retirement from the PBA. Peek played for about 16 years in the league. He currently works as a color commentator in the league. ==References *\\"Who's afraid of Ali Peek?

He went on to represent Zamboanga in the Palarong Pambansa. Despite being a high-school standout, he was not recruited by any Metro Manila programs. Chia went on to major in computer science in Ateneo de Manila University, where he was an intramurals legend for the CERSA team in the intramurals. He was noticed by then-coach Joe Lipa and was added to the Blue Eagles roster in the 2001 season. He rode the bench, substituting for players such as LA Tenorio and Wesley Gonzales. He played three games and scored a grand total of 10 points throughout the 2001 season. With Ateneo failing to win the Finals, Ateneo fired Lipa and hired former Mapúa Cardinals coach Joel Banal. The Blue Eagles advanced to the playoffs in 2002 as the third seed after beating the rival De La Salle Green Archers in the end of the elimination round denying them of a 14-0 sweep. As the third seed, Ateneo had to beat #2 seed UE Red Warriors twice in the semifinals in order to advance to the Finals. LA Tenorio, who had just returned from an injury, led the Eagles to a Game 1 triumph to set a winner-take-all game to face La Salle who had just eliminated the UST Growling Tigers. With 7.8 seconds left in Game 2, and the score tied at 70-all, UE player Paul Artadi turned over the ball. Tenorio raced towards the other end of the court but was well covered by the bigger James Yap. Tenorio passed the ball to Chia, who shook off Ronald Tubid, and made the shot over the outstretched hands of Olan Omiping. The shot brought Banal to his knees and he later described the shot as \\"a miracle.\\" In the Finals, Chia scored 5 points in a Game 1 win, fouled out with 4 points in a Game 2 loss, and 11 points in Ateneo's title-clinching Game 3 win. ==Professional career== Chia was selected twenty-eighth overall in the 2003 PBA Draft by the Coca-Cola Tigers.

Russell - U.S. Department of State biography Before that, she was chief of staff to the Second Lady of the United States, Jill Biden. == Early life and education == Russell was born in Jersey City, New Jersey, to Paul Russell and Ann (née McCaffery) Russell. She grew up in Reading, Pennsylvania, with four siblings. Russell graduated from Boston College, magna cum laude, with a degree in philosophy, and received her Juris Doctor from George Washington University. ==Career== After law school, Russell began working in Democratic politics. In 1984, Russell worked on Walter Mondale’s presidential campaign, on which she met her husband, Tom Donilon. In 1988, Russell worked on Joseph Biden’s presidential campaign. On Capitol Hill, Russell was Counsel and then Senior Counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee's Technology Subcommittee, chaired by Senator Patrick Leahy. She served as Staff Director to the Senate Judiciary Committee under Chairman Joseph Biden (D-DE). In that role, Russell worked on the successful passage of the Violence Against Women Act, and the Supreme Court nominations of Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer. Russell later served as Associate Deputy Attorney General to Janet Reno. In 2007, Russell returned to work part- time for then-Senator Biden who was the Chair of the Foreign Relations Committee. She drafted the International Violence Against Women Act of 2007, modeled on the American legislation Biden introduced in 1994. === Obama Administration ===  Office of the Vice President  Russell is a longtime adviser to both Vice President Biden and his wife Dr. Jill Biden. During the 2008 presidential campaign, Russell was tapped to serve as chief of staff to then-second lady-elect Jill Biden—a position she held from 2009 to 2013. In that role, Russell managed the second lady's staff and worked on her initiatives to increase access to community college education and to support military families, through the Joining Forces program. Russell also oversaw a process to develop the government's first global gender-based violence strategy.  Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women’s Issues  thumb President Obama created the position in 2009, and made it a permanent ambassador-level position in 2013. Senator Patrick Leahy, for whom Russell had worked as a staffer, spoke at her confirmation hearing and recalled her “brilliant mind” and “uncanny ability…to take the most complex issues, get them down to where even a Senator like myself and others could understand it.” Russell was confirmed unanimously by the Senate on August 1, 2013. Vice President Biden swore her into office on January 17, 2014. In her nomination hearing, Russell said that, if confirmed, she would focus her work on six areas: first, ensuring that the State Department adopted gender issues into “all aspects of diplomacy”; second, promoting women's economic participation; third, implementing the National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security; fourth, combatting gender-based violence; fifth, expanding political participation; and sixth, investing in women and girls’ health and education. As part of that effort, Russell designed the U.S. Global Strategy to Empower Girls, released in March 2014. It enlisted the State Department, USAID, Peace Corps, and Millennium Challenge Corporation to pursue the same goal: “to ensure adolescent girls are educated, healthy, socially and economically empowered, and free from violence and discrimination.” This marked the first time a country had produced an adolescent girls’ strategy. Under Russell's leadership, the Office of Global Women's Issues worked with Secretary Kerry to secure $7 million for adolescent girls’ empowerment programming in Afghanistan in March 2016. Her office also worked with USAID and UNICEF to produce a three-year, $5 million program to reduce gender-based violence in schools. One of Russell's priorities was ending child marriage globally, which she outlined to the Senate in a 2016 testimony. As Ambassador, Russell traveled to dozens of countries during her time as Ambassador, including Afghanistan in November 13 and the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2014. Russell's first trip was to Bali for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. ==Personal life== Since 1991, Russell has been married to Thomas E. Donilon, who is the former National Security Advisor to President Barack Obama. They have two children, Sarah (born 1996) and Teddy (born 1999). Her brother-in-law is Mike Donilon, a lawyer and political consultant who served as Counselor to Vice President Joe Biden. ==References * Category:1961 births Category:American women ambassadors Category:American women diplomats Category:Boston College alumni Category:Clinton administration personnel Category:George Washington University Law School alumni Category:Living people Category:Obama administration personnel Category:United States Department of State officials Category:United States Ambassadors-at-Large Category:Joe Biden ","title":"Catherine M.

Coppola headed many Genovese family criminal operations from the late 1930s until the early 1960s. He should not be confused with the Michael \\"Mikey Cigars\\" Coppola, a current mobster of the Genovese crime family. Michael was born to Giuseppe and Angelina. He was the brother of Ralph, John, Vincent, Louis, Helen, Amelia, Josephine and Mary. He stood at 5'5 and weighed 155 pounds. He was first arrested in 1941 for burglary, then later assault, murder and drug dealing. Coppola entered the ranks of the New York mafiosi with a reputation as a sadistic and violent gunman during Prohibition. Following the end of the Castellammarese War gang war in New York, Coppola became a high-ranking member of Charles \\"Lucky\\" Luciano's family. In 1936, following the conviction of Luciano on prostitution charges and later underboss Vito Genovese's fleeing the country on a murder charge, Coppola was left in charge of the Luciano crime family criminal operations including a monopoly on New York's artichoke supply and Harlem's numbers racket, worth over $1,000,000 a year. He controlled Mason Tenders Locals 47 and 13 of the Laborers Union. Local 13 secretary-treasurer George Cervone was murdered in 1961 during a bitter struggle for control of the local. Shortly thereafter, his brother, Basil Cervone, assumed control, and eventually Basil's sons, Joseph and Basil, Jr. Despite the former Luciano gunman's rise to power, Coppola's trouble in his personal life would be a source of ongoing problems throughout his life. After his marriage to his first wife Doris Lehman in 1943, according to Coppola's second wife Ann Coppola, her death was claimed to have been the result of overhearing Coppola's plans to assassinate New York Republican Party political activist Joseph Scottoriggio in response to his opposition to Vito Marcantonio. Reportedly murdered by her husband a day after giving birth to prevent her from testifying against him (her scheduled testimony was postponed due to her pregnancy); Scottoriggio would later be murdered in 1946. In 1960, Coppola was one of eleven men officially listed in the Black Book by Nevada state officials, barring his entry into Nevada casinos. That same year, Ann Coppola filed for divorce, supposedly due to Coppola supplying drugs to her daughter, and later agreed to testify against Coppola in an income tax investigation. As a result, Coppola ordered several gunmen to kidnap and assault her. Found severely beaten on an isolated beach, Ann Coppola continued with the investigation. In April 1961, Coppola was indicted on four counts of income tax evasion. Following a mistrial, Coppola pleaded guilty and was fined $40,000 and sentenced to four years in prison. Ann Coppola herself, who claimed she also suffered mental and physical abuse from Coppola, fled to Europe with $250,000 of the crime families’ money following Coppola's imprisonment for tax evasion in 1962. While staying in Rome, Italy, she sent a letter to the Internal Revenue Service (with certain portions addressed to then-U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy) detailing the criminal activities of the Luciano crime family as well as a letter to the incarcerated Coppola before committing suicide by taking an overdose of sleeping pills. Following his release from Atlanta Federal Prison in 1963, Coppola was unable to regain his previous power and lived in obscurity until his death at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts three years later. ==References== Category:1900 births Category:1966 deaths Category:Genovese crime family Category:American mobsters of Italian descent Category:American people convicted of tax crimes ","title":"Michael &quot;Trigger Mike&quot; Coppola"},{"id":"20337082","text":"Vito D'Ancona, Gioacchino Rossini, 1874.

Result -  Sister Fa (Fatou Diatta)  Senegal  Sister Fa has taken enormous personal risks to champion the rights of women and girls in West Africa. One of the most widely recognised female rap artists in Senegal, she has devoted her life's work to raising awareness of the dangers of female genital mutilation, a practice, in theory, has been outlawed by the state, but which in fact, continues across Africa and infringes on the basic rights of women and girls. Using her music to speak out, Sister Fa encourages women to educate themselves and to create a movement for social change.  bgcolor=gold  First Prize -  Ayat Al-Gormezi  Bahrain  Ayat Al-Gormezi, a poet and student at the Faculty of Teachers in Bahrain, was arrested in February 2011 because she recited a poem which criticised government policy in Pearl Square. Ayat was subjected to harassment, defamation, intimidation and threats of rape and murder whilst in prison, where she served two months of a one-year sentence as the first female prisoner of conscience in Bahrain. Ayat has become a symbol of resistance to repression in Bahrain, encouraging thousands of young people and women to take to the streets to express their opinions and stand up for justice.  bgcolor=silver  Second Prize -  Ramy Essam  Egypt  Ramy Essam began the 25th January Revolution in Egypt purely as a participant, but was soon called upon by his fellow protesters to provide a soundtrack to their struggles and was quickly labelled as the ‘singer of the revolution’. He rose to prominence during the revolution with a collection of songs that captured the fear, optimism and defiant demand for change that was sweeping across the country. Ramy spent 18 days in Tahrir Square as an integral part of the revolution, writing music and performing songs to motivate the protesters, risking his life and suffering threats and attacks from the military police, but refusing to leave until Mubarak's regime collapsed.  bgcolor=cc9966  Third Prize -  Rachelle Agbossou  Benin  Rachelle is the first female dance choreographer in Benin, one of the smallest and most densely populated regions in Africa.

Before escaping for South Korea, he endured torture at the hands of the regime after being captured while attempting to cross into China to secure food for his starving family. Now dedicated to promoting freedom, he paints acrylic pieces as satires of Kim Jong-Il. Song's art represents a global call for reconciliation between North and South Korea and a demand for the Kim regime to reveal the truth about the situation in North Korea.  Finalist -  Tarik Samarah  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Tarik Samarah is a Bosnian photographer who works in artistic and documentary photography. His ‘Srebrenica’ billboard campaign exhibited images of the Srebrenica massacre on large commercial billboards as a way of raising awareness about events that took place during the Srebrenica Genocide.

Almost 8,000 innocent men were killed, during only the fourth genocide to be officially recognised by the UN. Tarik took numerous risks to get to the heart of where these events took place to take these disturbing images, and his work has been censored and banned numerous times.

She died at a young age at the Georgetown Visitation Monastery (Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School) in Washington, D.C.. ==Biography== Juana was born in New Spain, when the colony was still under the control of King of Spain and ruled by the Viceroy of New Spain. Her birth year coincided with the Mexican War of Independence, which would catapult her father to fame and secure his place on the Mexican imperial throne. The Iturbides originated from minor Spanish nobility of Basque descent, who came to Mexico in the mid-18th century. Juana had two elder siblings, Agustin Jeromino and Sabina, and several younger siblings: Josefa, Ángel, María, Dolores, Salvador, Felipe and Agustín Cosme. She was baptised as a Roman Catholic. She was designated Princesa de México upon her father's accession in 1822. She was referred to as Her Highness rather than Imperial Highness, which was reserved for the Prince Imperial. In 1823, during the last days of the Mexican Empire, Juana was the sixth in line to the throne, after her four brothers and elder sister. Her father abdicated his throne after less than 10 months reign and the royal family was exiled from Mexico. On May 11, 1823, the royal family and some servants boarded the English ship \\"Rawlins\\", bound for Livorno, Italy. There her father rented a small country house and began to write his memoirs. Under pressure from Spain, Italy expelled the Iturbide family, and they moved to England. Iturbide returned to Mexico and was executed July 9, 1824, in Padilla, Tamaulipas. The Dowager-Empress Ana Maria moved her family, including Juana, to the United States. They lived in Washington, D.C. and in Philadelphia on Spruce St. near 13th, and later at 226 Broad St. Juana became a novice in the Visitation Monastery at Georgetown in Washington, D.C. On her deathbed, she professed herself a nun and took the name \\"Sister Margarita of Jesus, Marie and Joseph\\". She died at the age of 16 at the monastery, where she is also buried. == Decree == The Sovereign Mexican Constituent Congress decreed on June 22, 1822Digital UANL Studies of the General History of Mexico.

It was recorded at The Matrix in San Francisco on March 7 and 10, 1967 by club co-owner Peter Abram (the other co-owner was Marty Balin). The recording is notable as one of the earliest live recordings of the band known to exist, played to a mostly empty venue. By March 1967, the Doors had recorded only their debut album (released January 4, 1967) and \\"Light My Fire\\" had yet to be released as a single (on April 24, 1967), and they were still relatively unknown outside Southern California. The release was mastered by long-time Doors' sound engineer/producer Bruce Botnick. The album was released from the Bright Midnight Archives collection which contains a number of previously unreleased live concerts by the Doors. ==Recording equipment== On November 22, 2008, recording engineer Peter Abram revealed in an online posting the equipment he used to record the Doors at The Matrix, \\"I used an Akai tape recorder (tubes), 4 Calrad mics on the stage and a Calrad mic mixer on the instrumental channel. On the vocal channel: a Knight mixer with 3 Electrovoice 676 and Shure mics. The Calrad mics that I used on the instrumental track were model DM-21\\". The original master quarter-inch track stereo tapes were recorded at 7.5 ips on Abram's Akai reel-to-reel vacuum tube tape recorder. ==Master tape issues== PopMatters music critic Steve Horowitz observed in his review of Live at the Matrix 1967, entitled \\"Money...That's What I Want,\\" that the Rhino CD was not sourced from Peter Abram's master tapes; Rhino's press release stated that \\"first generation tapes\\" were used. On December 2, 2008, Peter Abram allowed photos to be taken of his master tape boxes. These photos were published online at the Steve Hoffman Forums on December 4, 2008. Abram's notations on the master tape boxes indicate that a 'jam' was performed between \\"Soul Kitchen\\" and \\"Get Out of My Life, Woman\\" during the March 7, 1967 show. For Record Store Day 2017, 10,000 condensed version CDs were released to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Doors. ==Track listingDisc one=== All songs written by Jim Morrison, Robby Krieger, Ray Manzarek and John Densmore, except where noted. # \\"Break On Through (To the Other Side)\\" (Jim Morrison) – 3:47 # \\"Soul Kitchen\\" (Morrison) – 5:51 # \\"Money\\" (Janie Bradford, Berry Gordy) – 3:02 # \\"The Crystal Ship\\" (Morrison) – 2:50 # \\"Twentieth Century Fox\\" (Morrison) – 2:46 # \\"I'm a King Bee\\" (James Moore) – 3:48 # \\"Alabama Song (Whisky Bar)\\" (Bertolt Brecht, Kurt Weill) – 3:16 # \\"Summer's Almost Gone\\" (Morrison) – 3:46 # \\"Light My Fire\\" (Robby Krieger, Jim Morrison) – 8:14 # \\"Get Out of My Life, Woman\\" (Allen Toussaint) – 3:58 # \\"Back Door Man\\" (Willie Dixon, Chester Burnett) – 5:14 # \\"Who Do You Love\\" (Bo Diddley) – 4:31 # \\"The End\\" – 13:54 ===Disc two=== # \\"Unhappy Girl\\" (Morrison) – 3:56 # \\"Moonlight Drive\\" (Morrison) – 5:39 # \\"Woman Is a Devil/Rock Me Baby\\" (Morrison), (B.B.

It also became popular in European fashions in the 19th century. In modern times, it is still an aspect in various traditional clothing in Hispanic cultures, and is particularly prominent as part of the costume (traje de flamenca) of flamenco dancers (bailaoras) and Gitana women. ==Description== A flamenco dancer (bailaora) with a Manila shawl Manila shawls are square pieces of silk embroidered in chinoiserie-style motifs. The shawls were folded in half like a triangle and worn over the shoulders. ==History== Traditional shawls in the Philippines were known as alampay, these were head and neck coverings among pre-colonial Tagalog women. Like the later Manila shawls, they were square and were folded in half into a triangle to be worn over the shoulders. These were carried over into the Spanish colonial period and acquired European design motifs like floral embroidery (using techniques like calado, sombrado, and deshilado). In addition to the native abacá fiber, they were also made from piña fiber, acquired from pineapples introduced by the Spanish. They also featured borders of lace or knotted fringes, a Spanish element which itself were acquired from the Moors. These Spanish-style shawls were known as pañuelos in Philippine Spanish, and were an integral part of the traditional traje de mestiza fashion of aristocratic Filipino women, as they brought modesty to the relatively low neckline of the traditional camisa shirts. They were also luxury goods exported via the Manila galleons to Nueva España and Europe, sometimes as gifts to royalty. Filipina mestizas from the early 1800s with pañuelos over baro't saya, by Paul de la Gironiere Mexican painter Saturnino Herrán (1915) Detail of typical floral embroidery and fringes from a Spanish-made Manila shawl Silk, though attempted numerous times, never became an established industry in the Philippines. Silk fabrics remained a Chinese monopoly, prompting the Spanish Empire to restrict silk trade with China in 1535, then banning it altogether in 1718, due to the worries about the depletion of silver in Spanish treasuries. However, following protests by the middlemen in Manila, the silk ban was lifted in 1734, though it required silk to pass through Manila. This monopoly of Manila was later consolidated with the creation of the Royal Company of the Philippines in 1795. Capitalizing on this new demand, Chinese factories in Canton (modern Guangzhou) and Macau started producing large quantities of painted or embroidered silk in the 18th century, for the sole purpose of exporting them to the Philippines and from there to further Spanish colonies and to Europe. Silk in domestic Chinese markets were usually reserved for clothing, and the designs had symbolic significance based on social status. But these silk exports by China during the 17th to 19th centuries were non- traditional items tailored to the tastes of the European market. In particular, they mass-produced religious vestments for the Catholic clergy, tapestries, and pañuelo-style shawls. Although these early Chinese-made shawls typically featured Chinese motifs in the embroidery, like dragons, birds, butterflies, toads, lotus, flowers, and Chinese people and scenes, they also adapted non-Chinese conventions like the fringes that the Chinese observed from the Philippines. These silk shawls became immensely popular in the Philippines and were quickly adopted into the local fashions of upper class Luzon women in the 18th and 19th centuries. Similarly, they became widely sought-after luxury exports soon after they reached the Americas. They are believed to have influenced later designs of the rebozo of Latin America. Their popularity in Spain increased after Mexico's independence in 1815. The trade ships from Manila, which previously had to stop over in Acapulco, now had direct routes to Seville. During part of the 19th century, romanticism took over and Parisian fashions dictated that the shoulders of women should be left uncovered. Spanish women copied the fashion and they found that the Manila shawl was a very good thing to wear with these dresses, as the shawl provided some warmth to the bare shoulders. The Manila shawl was also used to decorate grand pianos in houses, as can be seen in the recently reopened Museo del Romanticismo in Madrid. Besides pianos, the shawl was also used to decorate sofas in elegant houses. Many Spanish houses today still use the Manila shawls to decorate pianos and sofas. However, with the loss of the Philippines in 1898 in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War, Spain finally lost access to the silk trade. This spurred local weavers to recreate the embroideries in chinoiserie, favoring designs suited for European tastes while doing away with undesirable motifs like toads (a symbol of wealth in China) and pagodas. Their embroideries became denser and more colorful, with larger flowers resembling chintz. The knotted fringes also gradually became longer, accentuating movements by women as they walked or danced. ==Modern cultural significancePhilippines=== Dancers from the Philippines performing Jota Manileña. The woman is wearing a mantón de Manila over her traditional traje de mestiza dress. The men are wearing barong tagalog with salakot headgear Mantón de Manila are still worn in the Philippines as a rarer alternative to the pañuelo. They are part of the traje de mestiza ensemble (the aristocratic version of the national dress, the baro't saya). They may also be worn with the modern terno, a unified gown version of the baro't saya. ===Spain=== Today, the Manila shawls are still very popular in Andalusia for festive occasions. Women use the shawls for dressing up and going to parties. During the Festival of the Crosses of May in Cordoba, balconies are dressed up with the shawl that add a bright look to the plazas. During the April Fair in Seville, most of the women in Gypsy dress (flamenco dress) use the shawl as an accessory. The Manila shawl is also used by female flamenco dancers during their dance, as it is a great dance enhancer and adds drama when the flamenco dancer twirls it around her body and in the air. Sara Baras and Maria Pages are two of the most best flamenco dancers in Spain and they are experts in twirling their shawls during the dance. Famous Spanish singers who sing the copla, a traditional form of song, also are dressed in the Manila shawl. One of the most popular singers of this genre is Isabel Pantoja, and she has a great variety of beautiful Manila shawls. Many of the cheaper modern Manila shawls are imported from China, and they may range in price from 20 to 300 euros, depending on the amount of embroidery used. The cheaper ones are made of polyester, and the more expensive ones are made of silk. The best Manila shawls found in Spain today are made of silk and are made in Seville, and they are priced from 300 to 2000 euros. One can see the most beautiful Manila shawls by walking along Calle Sierpes, one of the principal pedestrian streets in Seville. The Manila shawl is an integral part of Spanish culture today. ==See also== *Pañuelo *Rebozo *Mantilla *Baro't saya *Barong tagalog *Guayabera ==References * esflamenco online store * Borca, S.A. * Almacenes del Pilar * El mantón de Manila (The Manila silk shawl) * Spanish Passion Category:Shawls and wraps Category:Spanish clothing Category:Philippine clothing Category:Culture in Manila ","title":"Manila shawl"},{"id":"20337174","text":"Alfredo Campoli (20 October 1906 – 27 March 1991) was an Italian-born British violinist, often known simply as Campoli. He was noted for the beauty of the tone he produced from the violin. Campoli spent his childhood and much of his career in England. ==Biography== Campoli was born in Rome in 1906 where his father was leader of the orchestra at the Accademia di Santa Cecilia, taught the violin and was Alfredo’s first teacher. His mother was a dramatic soprano who had toured with Scotti and Caruso, but a retired performer at the time of Campoli's birth. His family moved to England in 1911,(Google Books snippet view) pp. 03 & 120 and 5 years later Campoli was already giving public concerts. In 1919 he entered the London Music Festival and won the gold medal for his performance of the Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto. Campoli made his professional debut in a recital at the Wigmore Hall in 1923. He toured with such singers as Dame Nellie Melba and Dame Clara Butt. Although he appeared in the standard repertoire with symphony orchestras, during the depression there was little demand for a soloist and Campoli formed his Salon Orchestra and the Welbeck Light Quartet playing at restaurants in London, and other such venues. He appeared at a Prom concert in 1938. During World War II he gave numerous concerts for Allied troops. After the war, he had extended tours of Europe, Southeast Asia, New Zealand, and Australia, and continued his work with the BBC, eventually achieving over 1,000 radio broadcasts. He made his American debut in 1953, playing Lalo's Symphonie espagnole with the New York Philharmonic under George Szell. In 1955 he gave the first performance of Sir Arthur Bliss's Violin Concerto, which was written for him. In 1956 he twice toured the Soviet Union. Campoli owned two Stradivarius violins, the Baillot- Pommerau of 1694 and the Dragonetti of 1700 (see also List of Stradivarius instruments). However, it was his 1843 Rocca that he used predominantly, the Dragonetti being housed in the bank for security. He considered the phrasing of each passage he played and if he could achieve ‘bel canto’ by shortening or lengthening a note then he would do so. He was not afraid to lift the bow from the strings, an act that seems to be completely avoided today. Brief breaks of sound can add tremendous drama and power to a performance, even when not indicated by the composer. Campoli's recorded legacy was enormous, including a renowned recording of Elgar’s Violin Concerto in B minor. Previously unpublished recordings, including material recorded at Campoli's home, are referred to on Brightcecilia Classical Music Forums. There is a compact disc of a recording of Vivaldi's The Four Seasons made by him taken from acetates of a French radio broadcast; these are thought to date from early in 1939, predating the first electrical recordings of the work.Pearl GEMM CD 9151 At the beginning of the 1960s, Campoli was living in Southgate, London. In 1961, a private recording of him playing the Beethoven concerto with the Hayes Orchestra (Bromley, Kent) was made by his friend Geoffrey Terry. There is also a recording by Terry of Campoli in rehearsal with British pianist Peter Katin (with whom he had earlier formed a duo), Daphne Ibbott and Valerie Tryon. Terry promoted and recorded Campoli's last Queen Elizabeth Hall recital, and a 1963 recital of Mozart and Beethoven by Campoli and Katin at Croydon. Two sonatas from that recital had been released together with a Brahms sonata, recorded 1973 by the same duo in Alfredo Campoli’s Southgate home. The sound in such an environment is quite different from that in a concert hall. It is intimate, and this recording provides an historic document of the great maestro in his own home. Campoli appeared in a number of films.

It was then held for the next 36 years until 2010. The largest party was held in 1979 at Navy Pier with 5,000 participants. ==New York== The New York City White Party was first held at the private gay disco \\"Flamingo\\" on Broadway and Houston, on Presidents' Day weekend. The white theme derived from the snow often to be found that time of year. It was then adopted by the East Village disco \\"The Saint\\" during the month of February of each year usually coinciding with the full moon. Dress requirement was always white. After the closing of \\"The Saint\\" in 1988, The White Party became the norm for other cities around the country in the current circuit party system to host such events. ==Miami== The Miami White Party is an annual fundraiser party for HIV/AIDS research. The all-white clothing theme was chosen by co- founders Frank Wager and Jorge Suarez. The first White Party began as AIDS began decimating the gay population. Wager and Suarez began planning an event they hoped would raise awareness and money to reduce HIV/AIDS in South Florida. Wagner, Suarez and their friends dropped leaflets outside gay bars in Miami and Fort Lauderdale, got businesses to donate food and liquor and promoted the party. Sixteen hundred guests, asked to wear white, attended on Sunday night, December 1, 1985. Each paid $10. Wager, a Salvadoran-born real- estate agent, hadn't yet been diagnosed with HIV when the first White Party was held, which benefited Health Crisis Network (now known as Care Resource). Through the years, White Party attendees have included Nell Carter (who sang at the first White Party), Madonna, Calvin Klein, Jennifer Lopez, Yoko Ono, Crystal Waters, Exposé, Lorna Luft and Cyndi Lauper, and in 2013 Estonian singer Kerli performed. The one-night fundraiser became a week of events held annually on November 27 with events in Miami and Miami Beach. Most of the parties are geared to gay men, but there are several events for lesbians and mixed crowds as well. In 1994 Keith Cromley the Assistant Director of Development at Health Crisis Network and Alain Berrebi, Founding Chair of White Party Week, worked together to create White Party Week in Miami, first as a fundraiser for Health Crisis Network then for Care Resource. Lark Bennett, Director of Development at Care Resource and Keith Cromley we’re both instrumental as staff members in making sure that this huge event ran like a well-oiled machine. White Party Week started off in 1995 with six events and grew to 23 events by the year 2000. In 1995, more events were added, including \\"White Dreams\\" and \\"Muscle Beach\\". In 1998, the Health Crisis Network merged with Community Research Initiative, and the White Party Week brought in over $2 million. It is now the largest HIV/AIDS fundraiser in the world, with DJs, performers and artists attending from several countries. White Party CDs have been produced since 1996 with White Party remixes appearing on dance charts. Care Resource, the producers of White Party Week, is a 501(c)(3) non profit medical agency operating with over 200 employees in Miami-Dade, Miami Beach and Broward County providing medical, counseling, testing, psychosocial, food bank services and more to their clients. White Party Week Miami attracts thousands of participants with a week of dance and events, mostly for an LGBT demographic. The main White Party event is customarily held at Vizcaya Museum and Gardens, the renaissance mansion in Coconut Grove, with other events held at venues elsewhere in South Florida. In 2013 DJ Offer Nissim performed. Muscle Beach Party and women's events were also held. White Party Week Miami was the subject of documentaries on Bravo, The Travel Channel, and the BBC, with the documentary film \\"Fabulous\\" in 1999, Playboy Channel, and in two episodes of Queer as Folk. It is the setting for the 2001 documentary film When Boys Fly. ==Palm Springs== Palm Springs, California, has held an annual White Party since 1990.History: World has caught up with White Party, Desert Sun The event was featured in the 2001 film Circuit, a 2004 episode of the television series The L Word, and a 2006 episode of the reality television series The Janice Dickinson Modeling Agency. The Palm Springs White Party was described by Frommer's Travel Guide as \\"one of the biggest and best on the US party circuit ... [with] over 20,000 gay men dressed in white. The Palm Springs White Party Sunday Tea Dance features a Ferris Wheel and a fireworks display.\\"\\"White Party Spring Break\\", Frommer's Online Travel Guide. Retrieved 2007-03-22. In 2004, The New York Times travel section featured an in-depth look at The White Party in Palm Springs in conjunction with staff members of Noizemag. ==Other countriesMontreal=== Every Easter Sunday in Montreal, a white party (Bal en Blanc) catering to both straight and gay attendees is held. It usually attracts over 16,000 attendees with previous performers including Armin Van Buuren, Above and Beyond, Offer Nissim, Peter Rauhofer, Deep Dish, Tiësto, and David Guetta. ===Pattaya=== A white party was held for Sunee Plaza in Pattaya, Thailand, on November 15, 2009, as part of their Pride event.

She served in the Oklahoma Senate, representing District 48, which encompasses portions of northeastern and northwestern Oklahoma County until 2014. She was first elected to the state senate in a special election in September 2005. Johnson became the first African American woman nominated for a major statewide office in Oklahoma and the first woman US Senate nominee from Oklahoma of any party when she won the Democratic primary run-off of the 2014 U.S. Senate election. Johnson is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America. ==Early life== Born in Holdenville, Oklahoma, in 1952, she graduated from Frederick A. Douglass High School in Oklahoma City and earned a bachelor's degree in French from the University of Pennsylvania, where she also completed coursework for a Masters of Science in Education. After college she worked for the Oklahoma Community Action Director's Association, the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) within the City of Oklahoma City, and as the personnel assistant within the General Administrator's office of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission.Constance Johnson, Women of the Oklahoma Legislature Oral History Project . (accessed July 8, 2013) She graduated from Langston University's master's in Rehabilitation Counseling Program Langston University. ==Career in the Oklahoma State Senate== Johnson worked for the Oklahoma State Senate as a legislative analyst from 1981 to 2005 when she won the Senate seat representing District 48 in a special election. She was re-elected in 2006 and 2010. ===Senate committees=== * Chair, Committee on Select Agencies * Co- Chair, Criminal Jurisprudence Committee * Full Appropriations * Appropriations Subcommittee on Health & Human Services * Appropriations Subcommittee on General Government and Transportation * Health and Human Services * Transportation * Veterans and Military Affairs * Energy * Finance * Rules * General Government ===Stance on Senate Bill 1433=== Senate Bill 1433, which sought to define human life as beginning at fertilization, would have offered full legal protection to all human embryos. In the words of the bill, “the unborn child at every stage of development (has) all the rights, privileges, and immunities available to other persons, citizens, and residents of this state.” Johnson submitted an amendment of her own to the bill, which would have added the words: :However, any action in which a man ejaculates or otherwise deposits semen anywhere but in a woman’s vagina shall be interpreted and construed as an action against an unborn child. She explained that the amendment was intended to \\"draw attention to the absurdity, duplicity and lack of balance inherent in the policies of this state in regard to women\\".Johnson, Constance. \\"About my 'spilled semen' amendment to Oklahoma's Personhood bill,\\" The Guardian, February 9, 2012. (accessed July 8, 2013) Her efforts were used as part of a skit that was featured on the Daily Show with Jon Stewart entitled \\"Bro Choice,\\" and, in conjunction with a rally organized by the newly created Oklahoma Coalition for Reproductive Justice, led to the defeat of the proposed legislation. At the rally, Johnson was joined by fellow state senator Judy Eason McIntyre, who was pictured holding up a protest sign that read \\"If I wanted the government in my womb, I'd fuck a senator.\\" ==Campaign for U.S. Senate== On April 8, 2014, Johnson announced she was running in the 2014 United States Senate special election in Oklahoma. Johnson faced Patrick Hayes and perennial candidate Jim Rogers. Johnson finished first in the Democratic primary with a plurality, and faced Rogers in a runoff election. Rogers had an advantage with name recognition heading into the runoff election, having appeared numerous times on the ballot in Oklahoma. Johnson, having spent 8 years in the Oklahoma State Senate as an outspoken critic of the Republican legislature, was able to acquire experienced campaign staff to secure a runoff election victory. Controversy would later surround a successful lawsuit with Johnson staff member Rico Smith. Smith filed a suit claiming Johnson did not properly pay him according to a contract signed by Johnson's campaign staff. That suit was sustained by the court. Campaign Manager Bailey Perkins, succeeded by Colletta Harper, along with Communications Director James Cooper, an Oklahoma City journalist and professor, and Political Director David Roberts, a veteran political operative and former 2008 Obama for America staff member rounded out the organizational structure. Rogers' name recognition did little to combat Johnson's growing notoriety and campaign organization. Johnson won the runoff election, defeating Rogers by 14 percentage points, to face Rep. James Lankford in the general election campaign. Johnson lost the election for the unexpired term of Tom Coburn to James Lankford, by a margin of 237,923 29.0% to Lankford's 557,002, 67.9%, with independent candidate Mark Beard collecting 25,965 votes, 3.2% of the total., Oklahoma State Elections Board, November 4, 2014. Retrieved 14 July 2015. Oklahoma had the lowest voter turnout in the country in the 2014 midterm elections with only 29% of registered voters casting a ballot. ==Comprehensive marijuana reform== Johnson introduced legislation legalizing medical marijuana in 2007, and each subsequent session, in conjunction with efforts to change Oklahoma's harsh sentencing guidelines. In June 2014, Senator Johnson and attorney David Slane announced the filing of an initiative petition for a proposed amendment to the Constitution of Oklahoma which would legalize the possession of up to one ounce of recreational marijuana and three ounces of medical marijuana. According to Johnson, \\"We’re putting forth Genesis 1:29 as the basis of this campaign. God created this wonderful, miraculous plant and we know that it has been vilified for the last 100 years, and it’s time to change that in Oklahoma.\\" While the petition drive for the 2014 effort failed, Johnson has continued to work towards marijuana reform. She assisted with the petition to place SQ 788 legalizing medical marijuana on the ballot in 2018, and circulated a full legalization petition focused on use for agricultural, medicinal and recreational purposes. == Death penalty reform == Elected to chair the Oklahoma Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty (OK-CADP) in 2015 and again in 2016, Johnson led the Say No To SQ 776/Think Twice Oklahoma campaign to keep the death penalty out of Oklahoma's state constitution. While the state question was predicted to pass with overwhelming support, the \\"Say No\\" effort successfully kept the win margin at 66%, vs the projected 75%, via an advocacy and education campaign that focused on conservative fiscal concerns. == Work with the Oklahoma Democratic Party == Johnson was elected vice chair of the Oklahoma Democratic Party (ODP) in May 2015 based on her belief that the party should do more to increase voting participation using specific voting strategies and more voter education. She supported the decision to allow Independents to participate in the Democratic Primary and has worked to re-invigorate the process for clubs representing diverse groups to have a voice on the ODP Central Committee. She was the whistle blower on a gag order that prohibited Democrats from discussing key Democratic issues such as women's reproductive health rights, immigration, death penalty abolition, and marijuana policy reform. Johnson was the only super delegate from Oklahoma to support Sen. Bernie Sanders at the Democratic National Convention. Senator Sanders won Oklahoma by 10+ percentage points, and carried 75 of 77 counties in the Oklahoma Democratic Primary in 2016. == 2018 Oklahoma gubernatorial campaign == Johnson ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for Governor of Oklahoma in 2018. She won 38.6% of votes to elect a Democratic candidate for governor in the Oklahoma statewide primary held on June 26, 2018, losing to former Oklahoma attorney general Drew Edmondson who won 61.4% of votes. ==See also== *List of Democratic Socialists of America who have held office in the United States == References  *Constance N.

The game officials ruled otherwise, and the Buckeyes suffered a 16-13 loss that cost them the no.1 ranking. Ohio State entered the game at 8-0 and the Spartans were 4-3-1. The frantic, final play occurred after Champ Henson was stopped within inches of the goal line with 13 seconds remaining. Ohio State was out of timeouts, and Michigan State's players were slow getting off the pile. The Buckeyes scrambled and snapped the ball, but it went through QB Cornelius Greene's legs. Baschnagel picked it up and ran into the end zone. Head linesman Ed Scheck signaled touchdown, but field judge Robert Dagenhardt ruled that time had run out before the play began. Fans of each school climbed atop the goalposts, uncertain which team had won. 46 minutes later, with about 40,000 of the 78,533 fans still in the stadium, the public address announcer told the half-empty stadium that Big Ten commissioner Wayne Duke had decided the officials were correct in ruling that time has expired. Referee Gene Calhoun also said the Buckeyes would have been penalized if time had not run out because they didn't come to a one-second set before the snap of the ball. ===Iowa=Michigan=Rose Bowl=Awards and honors== * Archie Griffin, Heisman Trophy ==1975 NFL draftees== { width=\\"80%\\" - align=\\"center\\" C0C0C0;\\"  Player  Round  Pick  Position  NFL Club - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\"  Kurt Schumacher  1  12  Guard  New Orleans Saints - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\"  Doug France  1  20  Tackle  Los Angeles Rams - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\"  Neal Colzie  1  24  Defensive back  Oakland Raiders - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\"  Peter Cusick  3  66  Nose tackle  New England Patriots - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\"  Steve Luke  4  88  Defensive back  Green Bay Packers - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\"  Champ Henson  4  89  Running back  Minnesota Vikings - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\"  Bruce Elia  4  100  Linebacker  Miami Dolphins - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\"  Jim Cope  5  119  Linebacker  Cleveland Browns - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\"  Dave Hazel  11  261  Wide receiver  Baltimore Colts - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\"  Steve Myers  11  275  Guard  Detroit Lions - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\"  Doug Plank  12  291  Defensive back  Chicago Bears - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\"  Larry O'Rourke  14  354  Defensive tackle  Philadelphia Eagles - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\"  Mike Bartoszek  17  430  Tight end  New York Jets } ==References== ;Win/Loss statistics * Ohio State Historical Scores ;Draft data * Ohio State Drafted Players Ohio State Category:Ohio State Buckeyes football seasons Category:Big Ten Conference football champion seasons Buckeyes ","title":"1974 Ohio State Buckeyes football team"},{"id":"20337238","text":"Dorra () is a village in Djibouti in the mid-north of Tadjoura Region, the largest region.

Both Sreekovils are round (vatta). It is an age old temple whispering several fascinating legendary fables of the bygone eras. The first Sreekovil of this temple is dedicated to a deity named as Vadakkumnathan. The day to day pooja procedure of the deity consider the lord as a representation of Lord Subramanya or Murugan,i.e. Lord Kartikeya. But some worshippers believed that the Lord installed in this Sreekovil is a form of Lord Shiva. Anyway, the concept of Lord Murugan is more famous. The worshipers believe that the deity in the second Sreekovil (known as Thekkumnathan) is Balamurugan. It is believed that this deity was worshiped by Sakthibhadra the author of Acharya Chudamani (a drama for Koodiyattam). The Sreekovil has been adorned with magnificent mural paintings that augment its beauty. The important festivals that are celebrated in this temple include Uthrada Maholsavam (Thiruvutsavam - yearly celebration) Sreemath Bhagavatha Sapthaham, Mahashivarathri, Thaipooyam, Vishu, Onam, etc. The Uthrada Maholsavam is celebrated in the Uthradam star of Malayalam month Meenam. ==Design== The general form of Thumpamon Sree Vadkkumnatha temple is based on the Pancha- Prakara Layout-scheme of the traditional Kerala temples. The Bhakti movement and resurgence of Hinduism also marked the revival of temple construction. According to Kularnava Tantra human body itself is a temple and Sadashiva or Paramathma is the deity in this temple. This Sidhantha (theory) is adopted in the construction of Kerala Temples. Sreekovil or Garbhagruham (sanctum sanctorum) is considered as the head of the deity, Antharalam or inner Balivattom is considered as the face, Mukhamandapam or Namaskara mandapam is considered as the neck, Nalambalam is considered as the hands, Pradakshinaveethi is considered as the Kukshi Pradesa (stomach), compound wall is considered as the legs and the main Gopuram is considered as the foot of the deity. That means Panchaprakaras (Prakaram or compound wall, Bahyahara or Sheevelippura, Madhyahara or Vilakkumadam, Anthahara or Nalambalam and Antharalam or inner Balivattom) of the temple is the Sthoola Sareera (visible part of the body) of the deity. The Deva Prathishta or idol inside the Sreekovil or Garbhagriha and the Shadaadharas (Aadharashila, Nidhikumbham, Padmam, Koormam, Yoganaalam and Napumsaka Shila) under the Prathishta is the Sookshma Sareera (soul) of the deity. The Dwajam (flag staff) or Kodimaram is the spinal code of the deity. Hence a typical Kerala temple resembles a human body in all aspects. Fully realising the need to create places of worship that would attract devotees, the Pancha-Prakara scheme became the standard for temple architecture. The dimensions of the five components of the temple architecture are laid out in Tantra Samucchaya, a treatise on temple architecture, compiled and written in ca. 1300 AD. The five (Pancha) enclosures (Prakaras) around the Sanctum of the Thumpamon Sree Vadkkumnatha temple is as follows: ===Pancha-Prakaara layout=== 1\\\\. Akatthe-Balivattam - (a) The innermost enclosure, which includes two Sreekovils for building housing of the principal deities Vadakkumnathan and Thekkumnathan. (b) Anthar- Mandala: Space outside the Sreekovil occupied by protective deities in the form of small stone platforms - Bali-Kall (c) Namaskaara-Mandapa: A raised platform for prostrations 2\\\\. Naalambalam / Chuttambalam - Area around the sanctum which consists of (a) Valia-Ambalam: Covered spaces around the Sreekovil for rituals and prayers (b) Thittapalli: A small temple kitchen (c) Mulayara: Storage space for grains, fruits, utensils, firewood 3\\\\. Madhya Haara / Vilakku Madom - The Vilakkumadom galaxy of lamps around temple, lost in the \\"dark ages\\", was reconstructed recently. 4\\\\. Puratthe-Balivattam / Sivelippura - Outer enclosure and cirumambulatory pathway consists the following: (a) Agra-Mandapa: Pathway leading to the Naalambalam (b) Valiya- Balikall: Large decorated stone platform for sacrificial offerings (c) Bali- Peetha: Positions for protective deities outside the temple (d) Kshetra-Paala: Positions for temple guardians (e) Kovil of minor deities: Sub-shrines within the temple compound The temple had lost the Sivelippura and Koothamabalam (the enclosure for temple musicians) in the \\"dark ages\\". 5\\\\. Maryaada / Puram Mathil - The outer boundary wall consists the following: (a) Gopuram - Tower marking the main gateways (b) Reconstructed Oottu-Pura: Lunch-hall (c) Puram- Mathil: Outer-wall ==History== The evolution of Thumpamon Sreevadkkumnatha temple is closely related to the evolution of other great temples in Kerala and the Kerala’s social and cultural history. Historians divide the history of Kerala temples into four stages: 1\\\\. Earliest shrines (Before 300 BC) 2\\\\. Age of Jain temples (ca. 300 BC to 500 AD) 3\\\\. Age of Buddhist temples (ca. 200 BC to 800 AD) 4\\\\. Revival of Hinduism & the 'new' Brahminical temples (ca. 800 AD onwards) According to this classification, Thumpamon Sree Vadkkumnatha temple belongs to the third and fourth stages. This temple consists two Sreekovils (Sanctum Sanctorum). Both Sreekovils are round (Vatta) in shape. The deity in the first Sreekovil is called Vadakkumnatha. Some worshipers believe that this deity is Shiva. Some another worshipers believe that this deity is Muruga and another opinion is that the deity is Vishnu. Not too much evidence is remaining about the deity in first Sreekovil, i.e., Vadakkumnatha. In between 300 BC and 800 AD the Hinduism was dominated by Jainism and Buddhism. Both these religions are originated from the revival movements in Hinduism. Buddhism was introduced in Kerala by the missions sent out by emperor Ashoka. For more than 700 years, Buddhism flourished in Kerala. The Paliyam copper plates of the Ay King, Varaguna (885-925 AD) shows that at least in South Kerala, Buddhists continued to enjoy royal patronage even until 1000 AD. According to some of the historians in Kerala, many Hindu temples were once Buddhist shrines, including Vadakkunathan temple of Thrissur. So Thumpamon Sree Vadkkumnatha temple might also have a close relation to the Buddhist tradition. Shankaracharya and the Revival of Hinduism by Brahmin scholars in 800-1000 AD gradually wiped out Buddhism from Kerala. Royal patronage by the Vaisnavite Kulashekara dynasty hastened this process. The Vedic Brahmins arrived in Kerala only in 700-800 AD, along the west coast Tulu-nadu and from Andhra Pradhesh (Thazhamom madom, the Thanthris of Thumpamon Sree Vadkkumnatha Temple belongs to Andhra Pradesh). But unlike in North India, the Brahmins in Kerala adopted the Tantric form of temple ritual-worship. During the time of Maurya Sharman, a Kadamba King, large colonies of Brahmins from North India were invited to settle in Tulu and Kerala. In 792 AD, King Udaya Varman of Mooshika dynasty settled 237 Brahmin families in Kerala. One tradition has it that six outstanding Brahmins came with these immigrants, defeated Buddhist leaders in public debates and established the intellectual supremacy of Hinduism. (Nearby Thumpamon Sree Vadkkumnatha temple there are house names like Velenikkal Madom, Onpalli Madom, Thazhamon Madom etc.). The Brahmin scholars like Guru Prabhakara and Shankaracharya (788-820 AD) reinforced the supremacy of Hinduism. It is believed that the deity (Balamuruga) in the second Sreekovil of the Thumpamon Sree Vadkkumnatha temple (known as Thekkumnathan) was worshiped by Sakthibhadra, the author of Acharya Chudamani. Sakthibhadra was a contemporary of Shankaracharya and after completing Achrya Choodanani he had given it to Sankaracharya for his opinion. That time Shankaracharya was at Chenganoor Mahadeva temple and was in Munavritha. So he did not give the opinion and Sakthibhadra thought that Shankarachrya does not like his text. So he burned it. But after some times Shankara visited Shakthibhadra and said that the text was remarkable. But Shakthibhadra informed Shankara, that he had burned the text. Then Shankara recaptured the full text from his memory and gave it to Shakthibhadra. All these stories relate the Thumpamon Sree Vadkkumnatha temple to Shankara and Shakthibhadra. During the reign of the Chera King Rama Varma Kulashekara (1090-1102 AD), Kerala was overrun by the mighty Cholas, led by Koluthunga I. The Cholas burnt down Mahodayapuram (1012 AD), the capital of the Cheras and destroyed Kollam (Quilon), the capital of Venad. Defeated in conventional warfare, the famous warrior class of Kerala, the Nairs, formed suicide squads - Chavar - against the invaders. Numerous Kalaris (gymnasia giving training in attack and self- defence) were established, turning Kerala into one large insurgent military camp. Though the Cholas could not make enduring conquests, they did manage to smash the Chera empire and turn it into numerous, small independent principalities. The Nairs had lost huge numbers of men in battles. The Nair households, the Tharavaads totally lost it glory. The rulers also lost their economic power. Without royal patronage, the powers of the temples too declined. The king handed over the temple to the local Namboothiri Brahmins. The temples then began to be owned and managed by the Namboothiri Brahmins. So we can assume that from this time onwards the Thumpamon Sree Vadakum Nathan temple was owned by Velinikal Illom. Break-up of joint families led to the weakening of Brahmin communities and the Nair Tharavaads. This age could be called the Dark Ages for Kerala (from late 1300 AD to early 1700 AD) - the Hindu society had created for itself the most difficult citation in the history. At this stage the Thumpamon Sree Vadkkumnatha temple also lost it glory. During this time it might have lost Vilakkumaadam, Sheevelippura, Dwaja-Sthamba (Kodimaram) etc. ==Gallery== Image:Thumpamonvadakkumnathan_1.JPGThumpamon Vadakkumnathan Temple Image:Thumpamonvadakkumnathan_2.JPGThumpamon Vadakkumnathan Temple Image:vdn1.jpgThumpamon Vadakkumnathan Temple Image:vdn2.jpgThumpamon Vadakkumnathan Temple Image:vdn3.jpgThumpamon Vadakkumnathan Temple Image:vdn4.jpgThumpamon Vadakkumnathan Temple Image:vdn5.jpgThumpamon Vadakkumnathan Temple Image:Thumpamonvadakkumnathan_3.JPGThumpamon Vadakkumnathan Temple Image:Thumpamonvadakkumnathan_4.JPGThumpamon Vadakkumnathan Temple Image:Thumpamonvadakkumnathan_5.JPGThumpamon Vadakkumnathan Temple Image:Thumpamonvadakkumnathan_6.JPGThumpamon Vadakkumnathan Temple Image:Thumpamonvadakkumnathan_Kettukazhcha.jpgThumpamon Vadakkumnathan Temple Image:Thumpamonvadakkumnathan_Kettukazhcha1.jpgThumpamon Vadakkumnathan Temple Image:thumpamonnathan.jpgSreekovil of Vadakkumnathan Image:Thekkumnatahn.jpgSreekovil of Thekkumnathan Image:Vmandapa.jpgMandapam of Vadakkumnathan Image:Tmandapa.jpgMandapam of Thekkumnathan Image:nadapanthal.jpgNadapanthal of Vadakumnatha temple Image:Gopuram.jpgGopuram of Vadakumnatha temple ==See also== * Pathanamthitta District * Temples of Kerala ==References * https://www.facebook.com/thumpamon.temple * http://www.thumpamonvadakkumnathan.in Category:Hindu temples in Pathanamthitta district ","title":"Thumpamon Vadakkumnatha Temple"},{"id":"20337422","text":"Devipada is a densely populated area in East Borivali, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.

They were introduced in 1902 and were a larger version of the E4 Class intended for semi-fast secondary passenger work. ==History== As the weight of passenger trains continued to grow steadily during the 1890s and 1900s Robert Billinton decided to enlarge his radial tank classes still further by introducing a wheeled version incorporating the C2 class boiler. Thirty E5 locomotives were built by Brighton Works between November 1902 and November 1904. In addition to more power and a higher top speed, they also had more fuel capacity than the E4 class. The E5s were deemed to be fairly successful and locomotives achieved high mileages, but in 1911 four examples were rebuilt by D. E. Marsh with the larger C3 class boiler and were re-classified E5X. This experiment was not however a success and the performance was not greatly improved and higher centre of gravity made for rougher running at speed. E5 No. 32585 at Three Bridges, 1948 All of the class survived the transfer to Southern Railway ownership in 1923. One E5 was however withdrawn in 1936 and another in 1944 following a collision. The remainder continued in regular use following the nationalisation of the Southern Railway to become a part of British Railways in 1948. However, many of the class were now worn out and the arrival of a large number of new 2-6-4T locomotives in Southern England enabled the withdrawal of the remaining members of the class between 1949 and 1956. No examples have been preserved. ==Numbering== British Railways (BR) numbers were 32399-32406, 32567-32576 and 32583-32594. The E5X locomotives were 32401, 32570, 32576, and 32586. ==Sources== * Bradley, D.L. (1974) Locomotives of the London Brighton and South Coast Railway, Part 3.

The four-story, Italian Renaissance Revival sourced Mediterranean Revival style structure was built in 1927 and operated initially as a luxury apartment building catering to the entertainment business. In the 1930s, it became the \\"most famous brothel in California.\\" The building declined in prestige in the 1950s and 1960 and was acquired by rock star Rod Stewart in the 1970s. After Stewart's plans to redevelop the building as a luxury hotel ended in a legal dispute, the building was nearly destroyed in a 1983 fire that was found to be of suspicious origin. It was extensively renovated and, since 1986, has been known as the Piazza del Sol. It now houses the offices of several production companies, including Miramax Films. The restaurant Katana, co-owned by Ryan Seacrest and Tori Spelling and described by Newsweek as \\"so hip it hurts,\\" also operates at the building. ==Hollywood apartment house== Built in 1927 for $382,000, the building was originally known as Hacienda Arms Apartments and became the home of wealthy Hollywood families. The Hacienda Arms was the home to motion picture actors, including Marie Dressler, James Dunn, Grant Withers, Loretta Young, Jeanette MacDonald,1930 US Census US child star Leon Janney, and the film composers Josiah Zuro and Oscar Potoker. ==Classiest brothel on the Sunset Strip== During the 1930s, the building gained notoriety as the site of the \\"House of Francis,\\" described as the \\"most famous brothel in California,\\" and the \\"classiest brothel on the Sunset Strip\\" The \\"House of Francis\\" was featured in a 2005 book about Hollywood's \\"fixers,\\" the men who worked to shield Hollywood's Golden Age stars from public scandal. The fixers reportedly had their \\"hands full\\" trying to cover for events at the high-class brothel. The establishment was run by famed madam Lee Francis, who wrote the book Ladies on Call. The brothel was staffed largely by young women who had come to Hollywood to become movie stars but ended up as highly paid prostitutes, making as much as $1,000 a week—a fortune in the Depression era. In his 1981 book, Hidden Hollywood, Hollywood historian Richard Lamparski reported that Francis entertained \\"married men and movie stars world-famous for their sexual attractiveness.\\" Regular customers at the \\"House of Francis\\" included Jean Harlow, who visited the house and paid Francis $500 to take customers home with her. Francis' prostitutes and customers reportedly \\"complained about Harlow's rough sexual appetite.\\" Clark Gable, Errol Flynn, and Spencer Tracy were also regular customers, and the \\"fixers\\" often had to retrieve the ill-tempered Tracy from the establishment. The MGM studio was reported to have maintained a business charge account at the brothel under an assumed name. Francis reportedly paid 40% of her profits to police and politicians, and occasional vice squad \\"raids\\" reportedly resulted in no arrests, as police were greeted with cash, Russian caviar and French champagne. However, in 1940, Francis was arrested in a police raid and convicted of operating a house of ill repute. Upon her arrest, Francis reportedly told the arresting officer, \\"You are a sly one you are. In 31 years in business, this is the first time anyone ever got me.\\" ==Years of decline== The famed Ciro's night club opened next door in 1940. At that time the building was known as Coronet Apartments. From the 1940s through the 1970s, the building changed hands many times and fell into decline. The Los Angeles Times reported in 1983 that the decline of the building \\"roughly paralleled the decline of Hollywood,\\" and the building had an \\"unremarkable history\\" in the 1950s and 1960s. The sales of the building during this period include the following: * In 1941, the Coronet was acquired by G.E. Kinsey. * In 1950, the building was sold by K.L.M., Inc., to Lee Herman and Victor S. Herman for a reported price of $275,000. * In 1952, the building was purchased by Mr. and Mrs. Isidor Tumarkin for $280,000. * Frank Sennes, who also owned Ciro's, bought the building in 1960. Sennes noted that, for a time in the 1960s, there were \\"a lot of hippies\\" living there. Sennes emptied the building in the late 1970s with plans to renovate it. ==Rod Stewart years== Rock star Rod Stewart purchased the building in the late 1970s along with partner Barry Monzio. Stewart invested or loaned more than $1.6 million (equivalent to $ million in ) to convert the blighted and deserted building into a European-style luxury hotel. As the costs escalated, Stewart and Monzio became engaged in a bitter legal dispute, and the renovation work was halted. Monzio sued in 1980, accusing Stewart of trying to squeeze him out. Stewart counterclaimed for dissolution of the partnership, and Stewart became the sole owner of the building after settling the suit with Monzio. In April 1982, Stewart was robbed at gunpoint upon leaving the building in broad daylight with his three- year-old daughter. The gunman stole Stewart's Porsche Carrera. In July 1983, the Coronet, which was vacant at the time, was nearly destroyed in a fire. The interior of the building was completely gutted, and the exterior was charred. Investigators believed the fire was set intentionally, because it started in three places, and its rapid spread suggested it had been \\"boosted\\" with a flammable liquid. Some reports blamed the fire on \\"vagrants\\" living in the building. ==Historic designation and architecture== The building was designed in an Italian Renaissance revival style, described by some as \\"reminiscent of a classic Italian villa.\\" After the building was nearly destroyed by fire in 1983, the Los Angeles Conservancy led an effort to have the building designated as a historic site. The Conservancy's executive director, Ruthann Lehrer, noted: \\"The building is a beauty ... You find period revival buildings in a variety of places, but this one is really palatial. It's like a European palace.\\" The application to have the building added to the National Register of Historic Places noted its ornamented cream-and-tan plaster facade, its \\"grand entrance stairway and fountain, elaborate cast-stone decorations and arched entryway.\\" The building also retains original antique Italian marble and stonework, plaster edifices and wrought iron. The building was added to the National Register in December 1983. ==Piazza del Sol== Before the 1983 fire, San Francisco-based Westcap Financial Group had agreed to purchase the building for $4.2 million, and Westcap went forward with the acquisition despite the fire. Westcap converted the space into of luxury office space, and changed the building's name to the Piazza del Sol. In 1986, the West Hollywood Chamber of Commerce honored the remodeled building with an architectural award. The building's leasing agent states that the Piazza del Sol is a \\"Class A Office Building\\" offering a full range of office spaces from to full floor, spaces. The Piazza del Sol houses the offices of several movie production companies, including Miramax Films,http://start.cortera.com/company/research/k3m7krq5m/miramax-films/ and The Film Department.http://www.filmdept.com/ The celebrity-owned restaurant Katana Robata & Sushi Bar is also located within the building.

Renouncing the status as a crown prince and family life, Siddhārtha Gautama set out on a perilous path through the jungle to seek release from the cycle of birth and death - the ever-perpetuating suffering of existence - and became a Buddha, \\"the Enlightened One\\" through his practice of askēsis and meditation. A thangka of Milarepa (1052-1135), a great yogi and poet of Tibet. His poetry is quite probably inspired by Indian Tantric Buddhist poetry, such as dohas by Mahasiddha Saraha, to mention one among many other examples.

Dōgen, the founder of the Japanese Sōtō Zen school and a celebrated poet. Miyazawa Kenji (1896-1933), a modern Japanese Buddhist poet. Buddhist poetry is a genre of literature that forms a part of Buddhist discourse. ==Origins== The first examples of Buddhist poetry can be found in traditional scriptures such as the Dhammapada, according to which, Siddhārtha Gautama (the founder of Buddhism), upon his reaching enlightenment, proclaimed: Through the round of many births I roamed without reward, without rest, seeking the house-builder. Painful is birth again & again. House-builder, you're seen! You will not build a house again. All your rafters broken, the ridge pole destroyed, gone to the Unformed, the mind has come to the end of craving.\\"House\\" = selfhood; house- builder = craving. Thanissaro Bhikkhu, Commentary to the Dhammapada, Verses 153-154. ==Form== Traditionally, most Buddhist sutras have a prose component supplemented by verses (known as gatha) that reiterate and poetically summarize the themes of preceding prose passages. Gatha functions as a mnemonic device helping the Buddhist practitioner commit to memory a certain doctrinal maxim. And in fact, the earliest extant forms of Buddhist discourse appear in verse, which is hardly surprising, considering that the texts were not originally written, but memorized. Linguistic analysis shows that the prose component of the sutras is likely to have been modified by later editing, while the poems often contain earlier forms of language. This view is confirmed by Japanese Buddhist scholar Hajime Nakamura, who states that the verse components of the Pali Canon actually predate the prose components, the former being a way of facilitating memorization, as the Pali Canon was transmitted orally for the first 300 or so years. Current Buddhology generally maintains that even the liturgical scriptures are products of literary composition. Hence, the study of Buddhist text in general and Buddhist poetry in particular cannot be disengaged from the literary field. But for the sake of classification it is useful to distinguish between # Buddhist poetry that is attributed to the Buddha himself, which forms a part of \\"Buddha Speech\\" (Sk. Buddhavacana), and # Buddhist poetry written by Buddhists, which is not included in the sutras. ==Buddhist poetry in Sanskrit== A significant number of Buddhist poets composed their works in Sanskrit. One of the first and best known is Aśvaghoṣa, of whom two complete \\"Great Poems\\" (mahākāvya) survive, i.e. the \\"Acts of the Buddha\\" (Buddhacarita.Johnston (1998)) and \\"Handsome Nanda\\" (Saundarananda Johnston (1928)). The first tells the life-story of Śākyamuni Buddha, while the second tells the story of Nanda, the Buddha's handsome cousin, who was guided towards liberation by turning his greatest weakness - desire - into a motivating factor for practice. Fragments of a drama called Śāriputraprakaraṇa (Lüders (1911) ) are also extant, and these may be some of the oldest, perhaps even the oldest example of Sanskrit drama. Aśvaghoṣa's verses are often simple yet very suggestive, casting key Buddhist teachings, such as impermanence, in evocatively paced similes: Other verses of Aśvaghoṣa capture in vivid images human indecision, uncertainty and sorrow. The following verse describes Nanda at the door of his house, torn between the wish to remain with his beloved wife and the sense of respect that prompts him to leave and meet the Buddha to make amends for neglecting the Buddha's alms- round in front of his house: Sanskrit poetry is subdivided into three types: verse works (padya) prose works (gadya) and mixed works (campū); nowhere in the Indic tradition is versification taken as the distinguishing feature of literary diction, as all sorts of works, whether philosophical, medical, etc., were composed in verse, for ease of memorization. Several Buddhist authors specialized in mixed verse-prose compositions, often re-telling traditional stories about the Buddha's previous births (jātaka). Among the authors writing on the basis of the Jātakas, most prominent is perhaps Āryaśūra;Kern (1891)Vaidya (1959) Speyer (1895) Mukhopadhyaya (2007) Hanish (2005) other beautiful collections of literary Jātakas are those of Haribhaṭṭa Hahn (2011) and Gopadatta. Haribhaṭṭa's collection includes a concise version of the life story of Śākyamunibuddha; he describes Māra's dejection after understanding the Buddha's victory and superiority in the following verse: This is reminiscent of a famous verse from Kālidāsa's Kumārasaṁbhava, Kale (1917), Smith (2005) and the (probably intended) contrast between the two verses is itself suggestive. Kālidāsa celebrates the budding presence of the God of Love in Pārvatī’s mind, as she is thrilled to hear a discussion about her future husband; Haribhaṭṭa describes the Love God’s defeat at the time of the Buddha’s Awakening. Pārvatī is holding lotus-petals; Māra is holding a wooden stick. Another important type of mixed verse/prose works is Sanskrit drama (nāṭaka), and here king Harṣadeva deserves special mention. The patron of the great Chinese monk Xuanzang composed the Nāgānanda, Skilton (2009) an outstanding drama based on the traditional story of Jīmūtavāhana, prince of the Vidyādharas. While perfectly at ease within the conventions of court poetry, including the depiction of love and attraction, Harṣadeva's Nāgānanda is suffused with Buddhist reflections on compassion and on the futility of hatred, and on impermanence and the inevitability of death. The following words are spoken by a brave Nāga boy to his mother, who is suffering from extreme sorrow as her child will soon be sacrificed to the voracious bird Garuḍa: Another genre where Buddhist poets excelled is the \\"good-sayings\\" (subhāṣita), collections of proverb-like verses often dealing with universally applicable principles not so specific to the Buddhist tradition. One such collection of verses is attributed to the Buddha himself, and preserved in different versions as the Udānavarga (Sanskrit), Bernhard (1965) Dhammapada (Pāli), Dharmapada (Prākr̥t and Gāndhārī). This collection often uses similes (upamā) to exemplify key Buddhist teachings: Other significant collections are Ravigupta's Āryakośa, Vararuci's Gāthāśataka, Ratnamati's Prakaraṇa, Dimitrov (2016: 52-67) and several others. One of the largest anthologies of good sayings extant in Sanskrit is by a Buddhist abbot, i.e. Vidyākara's Subhāṣitaratnakośa. Ingalls (1968) The Subhāṣita genre became also well- established in Tibet, one of the greatest examples being Sakya Paṇḍita, an early and influential master of the Sakyapa school, known to have been fluent in Sanskrit from an early age. Ārya Śāntideva's \\"Entrance into the practice of the Bodhisattvas\\" (Bodhicaryāvatāra) Crosby & Skilton (1998) partly resembles a collection of good sayings, yet in many ways defies classification. It is written in a number of rather different literary registers, resembling court poetry in places, while being very dramatic in others; some verses are indeed \\"good-sayings\\", in both content and style, while an entire chapter is written in the confident and terse tone of a Madhyamaka philosophical text, with the usual alternation of objections and rebuttals. The work is a compendium of Mahāyāna practice, covering the six perfections (pāramitā) which may be said to function as its main structural guideline. The \\"Compendium of Perfections\\" by Āryaśūra is another such guide, containing numerous excellent verses and organized even more systematically in terms of the six perfections. Other guides to Buddhist practices were written in the form of versified letters; among these, the \\"Letter to a Friend\\" (Suhr̥llekhā) and the \\"Garland of Gems\\" (Ratnāvalī Hahn (1992) ) of Nāgārjuna deserve special mention, not just for their content and style, but also for being very influential in India and Tibet; another remarkable epistle extant in Sanskrit is Candragomin's \\"Letter to a disciple\\" (śiṣyalekhā Hahn (2000) ), also outlining the Buddhist path for a disciple. These letters exemplify the friendly and respectful relationship between Buddhist masters and their patrons, who received advice on a number of different topics, both worldly and supramundane. Buddhist poets wrote very many praises of the Buddha, Dharma and Saṅgha, and of Bodhisattvas and meditational deities. Pandey (1994) The One Hundred and Fifty Verses of Mātr̥ceṭa seem to have been particularly popular; Nandipriya's extensive commentary on this work still survives in the Tibetan Tangyur (Śatapañcaśatkanāmastotraṭīkā, Brgya lṅa bcu pa źes bya ba’i bstod pa’i ’grel pa, Tg bstod tshogs ka 116a5-178a1.). Mātr̥ceṭa's verses use accessible language, with strong echoes from different types of Buddhist literature, and transmit a sense of great devotion all the more highlighted by the poet's restrained and measured diction: Buddhist praises often have didactic purposes; some of them (like Nāgārjuna's Catuḥstava) expound philosophical ideas of specific schools, while praises of Bodhisattvas and meditational deities often facilitate readers/listeners in acquiring familiarity with important features that become the focus of recollection and or formal meditative contemplation. Buddhist authors also wrote on prosody (chandas), offering their own poetic examples for different types of Sanskrit meter. Two notable works on Sanskrit poetry are the Chandoratnākara of Ratnākaraśānti Hahn (1982) and the Vr̥ttamālāstuti of Jñānaśrīmitra, Hahn et al. (2016) by two great contemporary Vikramaśīla masters who were active on several intellectual fronts and well-known exponents of Yogācāra thought. The Vr̥ttamālāstuti is particularly striking: it consists in verses of praise of the Bodhisattva of Wisdom, Mañjuśrī, which at the same time offer information about the verse that is being exemplified, such as its name and the position of the caesura (yati). A simple example, for the śaraṇa meter: Pāli poetry follows very similar patters as Sanskrit poetry, in terms of prosody, vocabulary, genres, and poetic conventions; indeed several Pāli authors were well conversant with Sanskrit and even composed works in that language (such as, for example, the Anuruddhaśataka). Sanskrit meters and poetic conventions were more broadly very influential throughout South-East Asia even in respect to vernacular languages (Thai, Burmese, etc.), also thanks to the popularity of literary aesthetic ideas from the tradition of Alaṁkāraśāstra (\\"The science of ornaments\\") regarding the purposes and nature of literature. While discussing praises, literary praises of meditational deities have been briefly mentioned; this brings us into the fold of Buddhist Tantric poetry, which is esoteric in character and thus often laden with evocative symbols meant to be understood only thanks to one's relationship with a living master. Notable are the \\"Songs of Practice\\" (Caryāgīti Kvaerne (1986). See especially pp. 7-8 for a discussion of the genre ), written in Apabhraṁśa rather than Sanskrit, and including among their authors the \\"Great Accomplished Ones\\" (mahāsiddha), such as Saraha, Śāntipā, and many others. ==Buddhist poetry in Asia== Buddhist poetry - like the bulk of the scriptures produced by Buddhists - is not limited to compositions in Pali and Sanskrit; it has flourished in practically every language that Buddhists speak. *Notable examples in the Tibetan tradition are works of Milarepa.Chang (2006). *Chinese Buddhist Tradition is particularly rich in poetic expression. In the poetry of Bai Juyi,B. Watson (1988, 2000). for instance, we see a tension between the secular and Buddhist poetic expression: many Buddhists considered poetry as an attachment and advocated against it, despite the fact that the scriptures revered by them were abundant in poetic forms. Bai is credited with the coinage of the expression kyōgen kigo (狂言綺語, lit. \\"deranged words and embellished language\\"), which, to his view, referred to futility of poetic expression in comparison to Buddhist practice. Perhaps, the most successful Chinese Buddhist poet to resolve this paradox was Jiao Ran 皎然 (730-799), who proposed treatment of poetry as an intellectual instrument of Buddhist practice.Nienhauser (1985: 270-2). Chan Buddhism (Ch. Chan; Jap. Zen) provided a rich ground for Buddhist poetry. Chan Buddhists created a complex language in which indirection, suggestion, ambiguity, paradox, and metaphor are prized over straightforward explanation. This complex language of Chan literature is also applied in Chan poetry. Chan Buddhists asserted that though enlightenment cannot be explained in ordinary terms, poetry, as a special language, can point the way. As the Chan monk Juefan Huihong (1071–1128) wrote, “The subtleties of the mind cannot be transmitted in words, but can be seen in words.” In Chan poetry, images as simple as the moon, clouds, boats, reflections in water, plum and lotus, bamboo and pine took on complex connotations based in Chan ideas, famous verbal exchanges, and Chan and Buddhist texts.Egan, Charles, and Charles Chu (2010). To exemplify the use of specialized Buddhist metaphor, this well-known poem by Hanshan (Tang Dynasty) will suffice: *Korean poets wrote mostly in Classical Chinese. *Japanese poets also contributed to Buddhist poetic tradition in classical Chinese (e.g. the poetic genius of Kūkai inspired many poets of later generations.)Gibson and Murakami (2008). Kūkai, in turn was influenced by Jiao Ran's Shi shi 詩式, as the latter is included in Kūkai's magnum opus of poetics, the Bunkyō hifuron 文鏡秘府論.More on Kukai's poetry, cf. R.Green: http://ww2.coastal.edu/rgreen/kukaipoetry.htm In medieval Japan, Buddhist poetry was accorded a special status of a separate genre within the corpus of the waka collections. ==Japanese Buddhist Poetry== 1\\\\. The earliest extant collection of the Japanese poetry, the Man'yōshū, contains a preface (Jp. jo 序 or daishi 題詞) to two poems on the love of parents towards their children: \\"Sakyamuni expounds truthfully from his golden mouth, 'I love all things equally, the way I love my child, Rahula.' He also teaches that 'no love is greater than the love for ones child.' Even the greatest of saints cherishes his child. Who, then, among the living creatures of this world could fail to love children claimed as one's own?\\"Preface to MYS 806 tr. in Konishi & Miner (1984: 399). There are several prefaces and poems in the Man'yōshū that mention the name of Buddha Śākyamuni (Jp. Shaka Nyorai 釋迦如来 /an honorific title of Siddhārtha Gautama), Buddhist temples (Jp. tera 寺), monks and nuns.E.g. MYS 3862, 3863; prefaces to MYS 155, 339, 394, 798, 806, 997, 1023, 1561-3, etc. Numbers of the Man'yōshū (MYS) poems follow the new system of the Shinpen Kokka taikan. \\"Shinpen Kokka Taikan\\" Henshū Iinkai (hensha). Tōkyō: Kadokawa Shoten, 1983-1992. (Shōwa 58 - Heisei 4). 新編国歌大観. 「新編国歌大観」編集委員会(編者). 東京: Kadokawa Shoten, 1983-1992. (昭和58 - 平成4). 2\\\\. Among the treasures of Yakushi-ji Temple in Nara there are stone blocks dating from the Nara period modeled as \\"the footsteps\\" of the Buddha (Jp. Bussokuseki 佛足石). These blocks contain poems in man'yōgana that may be considered the oldest Buddhist waka (Japanese language poems) known to date. These poems are usually referred to as bussokusekika (lit. \\"poems on stone imprints of Buddha's feet\\": 仏足石歌). Consider the following example: Both examples above have one trait in common. Namely, the focus on the physical characteristics of the Buddha is prominent: \\"the golden mouth\\" of the Buddha in the Man'yoshu and the \\"feet of the Buddha\\" in the stone inscriptions relate to the marks of perfection of the Buddha's body / speech (Skt. mahāpuruṣa, lit. [signs of] \\"a great person\\").for detailed information on the marks of the Buddha's body cf. http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/lam-rim/refuge/the-32-major- marks-of-a-buddha-s-physical-body In the Heian period, Buddhist poetry began to be anthologized in the Imperial Anthologies (Jp. chokusenshū 勅選集. Among the 21 Imperial Anthologies, 19 contain Buddhist tanka (lit. short waka) starting with the Shūi Wakashū, compiled between 1005 and 1007 C.E. The first Imperial Anthology to treat Buddhist tanka as a separate genre, i.e. shakkyōka （lit. \\"Poems of Śākyamuni's Teaching\\": 釈教歌）, is the Senzai Wakashū, which has an exclusive section dedicated to the Buddhist Poems in Volume 19 (第十九巻). Among the most famous poets who wrote shakkyōka are: Saigyō; Jakuren; Kamo no Chōmei; Fujiwara no Shunzei; Jien; Nōin; Dōgen, Ton'a, etc. Many of the so- called \\"Thirty-six Poetry Immortals\\" wrote Buddhist poetry. Shakkyōka can be subdivided according to the ten following motifs: # Buddhas and bodhisattvas; # Eminent monks / nuns; # A passage from a sutra; # A passage from commentatorial corpus of the Buddhist canon; # Buddhist Experience (meditative / devotional states); # Mental states, such as delusion, passion, anger, etc. that are important in the Buddhist discourse; # Religious deeds; # Related to temples and shrines; # Buddhist views of Nature; # Natural phenomena alluding to Buddhist themes (e.g. transience of flowers blooming)Ishihara (1980: 20-1). These motifs are not mutually exclusive and are very often combined within a given poem. One of the most famous collections of Japanese tanka of the Kamakura period, the Hyakunin Isshu contains several shakkyōka, for instance Poem 95, by Jien (also anthologized in the Senzai Wakashū: 巻十七, 雑中, No. 1137): In later periods, as tanka was slowly being overshadowed by renga and haiku - the two poetic forms that derived from tanka - such famous poets as \\"the seven worthies of renga\\", (Jp. renga shichiken 連歌七賢) of the Muromachi period,Sōzei 宗砌(?-1455), Shinkei 心敬 (1406-75), Gyōjo 行助 (1405-69), Nōami 能阿弥 (1397-1471), Chiun 智蘊 (d. 1448), Senjun 専順 (1411-76) and Sō'i 宗伊/aka. Sugihara Katamori 杉原賢盛 (1418-85?) are \\"the seven worthies / sages of renga\\" popularized by Sōgi. Ramirez-Christensen (1994: 54-5). Sōgi, and still later, Matsuo Bashō, Kobayashi Issa, among many others, carried on the tradition of Buddhist poetry with their compositions. The nostalgic feeling of the ancient capital, Nara - interspersed with the scent of chrysanthemums (symbol of Japanese monarchy) and the old Buddha statues - captures well the aesthetic ideals of sabi and yūgen in this famous haiku. Although these three lines appear to be a mere utterance of almost prosaic quality, the imagery invoked is far from simplistic. Buddhas, emperors, passage of time, the ethereal beauty of flowers that presents itself obliquely, i.e., appealing to scent rather than sight - all suggest that the poet sought to use language as a medium of condensed imagery to map an immediate experience, whose richness can only be read in the blanks. This world of dew is just a world of dew, and yet... Issa Here the poet uses the image of evanescence of our world, the dewdrop - one of the classical allegories of the Buddhist teaching - to express grief caused by the death of his daughter. In theory, Buddhism teaches its followers to regard all the vicissitudes of life as transitory and ephemeral, akin to magic apparitions without substance or dewdrops soon to evaporate under the sun. Yet, a father's loss of his child is more than reason can counter.Sakaki (1999: 72) ==Buddhist poetry and modernity== As Japan reached the era of industrialized modernity, many of the poets of the Meiji period started to experiment with the European styles of poetic composition. Some poets, notably Miyazawa Kenji—a devout Buddhist who expressed his convictions in his poetry and fiction—often composed poems with Buddhist overtones. His Ame ni mo Makezu (雨ニモマケズ), known to practically every Japanese today,For an alternative translation of this poem, see this site. takes its theme (Chapter 14: Peaceful and Joyous Deeds / Jp. Anrakugyō 安楽行) from the Lotus Sutra 妙法蓮華經, which Kenji revered.An online translation of the Lotus Sutra is available at here . Another Buddhist poem that remains well known today, but for non-religious reasons, is the Iroha poem from the Heian period. Originally written in man'yōgana and attributed to Kūkai, this Buddhist poem contains every kana precisely once, and is learned in Japanese primary schools mainly for this reason. Many old-style Japanese dictionaries adhere to the Iroha order. A modern Indian Sanskrit poet, Vanikavi Dr. Manomohan Acharya, wrote Sri Gautama Buddha Panchakam in simple and lucid Sanskrit through lyrical style.http://www.itimes.com/users/iti499967/blog/_193081 ==Bibliography== *F.

The lighthouse was established in 1907. ==History== The lighthouse tower and surrounding buildings at Isle au Haut Light Station were built in 1907 by the United States Army Corps of Engineers at a site at Robinson Point purchased from Charles E. Robinson. The lighthouse tower was built slightly offshore, standing tall and consisting of a white granite and brick cylindrical upper section on a conical granite block foundation. The keeper's quarters are a two-and-a-half-story frame and stucco Victorian house connected to the tower by a catwalk. A boathouse, oil house, and storage shed were also built at the station. The lighthouse was automated in 1934 and the government sold the property except the tower back to Robinson. The Robinson family used the property as a summer home until they sold it to Jeff and Judi Burke in 1986. The Burkes converted the keeper's quarters into a bed and breakfast called \\"The Keeper's House,\\" which they operated until 2007. Isle au Haut Light was added to the National Register of Historic Places as \\"Isle au Haut Light Station\\" in 1988. The Coast Guard transferred the lighthouse to the Town of Isle au Haut in 1998 under the Maine Lights Program and the tower was completely restored in 1999. The lighthouse remains in service as of 2008. The current optic for the light is a solar- powered lens which flashes red every four seconds with a white sector covering the safe channel. The original fourth order Fresnel lens is at the Maine Lighthouse Museum in Rockland, Maine. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Knox County, Maine ==References== Category:Lighthouses completed in 1907 Category:Lighthouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine Category:Lighthouses in Knox County, Maine Category:Penobscot Bay Category:National Register of Historic Places in Knox County, Maine ","title":"Isle au Haut Light"},{"id":"20337742","text":"Sinocrassula is a genus of succulent, subtropical plants of the family Crassulaceae.

Raj was killed in the shootout with the police after he held a bus with 12 passengers hostage in suburban Kurla. The Mumbai police alleged that he wanted to assassinate the MNS chief, Raj Thackeray. The incident sparked fierce criticism of the police and discussions nationwide, especially from the Bihar politicians. The incident was also seen as a rise of Bihari sub-nationalism to counter the agitation against migrants from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar by MNS. ==Shooting Incident== On 27 October 2008, Rahul Raj, a 25-year-old man from Patna, boarded a double decker city bus route No. 332 plying between Kurla and Andheri at Saki Naka stop around 10 am and went to the upper deck. Rahul, wielding a country made revolver, had taken control of the bus and injured one passenger. He was protesting against the attacks on north Indian candidates appearing for a railway examination recently. He also wanted to talk to the Mumbai Police Commissioner and media. The three key eyewitnesses, including the bus conductor, have told the crime branch that Bhagat, the injured passenger, was injured by Rahul Raj's bullet. Rahul reportedly said that he was not there to harm passengers but instead wanted to 'kill Raj Thackeray'.According to senior inspector, Dadasaheb Godse, Vinoba Bhave station, Kurla, Raj shouted > I want to kill Raj Thackeray. I have nothing against the passengers. Don't > shoot me. However, he allegedly attacked the conductor of the bus and injured a passenger with his revolver. The bus was taken to the nearest police station. According to key eyewitnesses, Rahul fired multiple shots: One outside the bus on seeing the police which lodged in the metal frame of the bus. He also fired a shot at a hostage passenger Bhagat, who had ducked between the seats on firing of the first shot. In a subsequent police shoot out, Mumbai Police shot him dead. A special team of officers entered the bus and went to the upper deck of the bus. Three police officers fired 13 shots, 4 of which hit Rahul Raj, which was confirmed by a four-member panel of forensic experts at J J Hospital carried out a post-mortem on Rahul. Three hit him in the head and one went through his heart. It was alleged that police could have taken him into custody. According to the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials adopted by UN General Assembly resolution 34/169 of 17 December 1979, Article 3 states that, > Law enforcement officials may use force only when strictly necessary and to > the extent required for the performance of their duty. ACP Sadanand Date, officer overseeing the operation (who was later seriously injured and attracted international attention during the November 2008 Mumbai attacks because of his actions resisting terrorists at the Cama and Albless Hospital ), later told reporters that Rahul Raj had fired upon the police & also shot a hostage passenger. Hence the police had to fire in retaliation. ==Reactions and protests== The Deputy Chief Minister R. R. Patil, who also heads the home department of the state, justified the police action against Rahul Raj, saying: \\"I fully justify the police action. If someone is firing at the police, they will not be silent spectators. Police opened fire at Rahul Raj only after he refused to surrender or hand over his revolver to the police. The police had no option but to fire at him\\". The killing of Rahul Raj sparked a row between the politicians of Bihar and Maharashtra with several parties demanding a judicial probe into the incident. The father of Rahul Raj, K.P. Singh, earlier said he would appeal to President of India Pratibha Patil for justice. Unable to meet President Pratibha Patil to seek justice, he planned to file a writ petition in the supreme court and seek justice from National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). Railway Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav, also from the state of Bihar, joined hands with his archrivals Nitish Kumar and Ram Vilas Paswan to condemn the killing of Bihari youth Rahul Raj and demanded action. According to Lalu, the Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had assured him of taking proper action in the matter. Former Delhi Police chief and the current Nagaland Governor Nikhil Kumar (then an MP from Bihar) also heavily criticised the police action. JD(U) MPs from Bihar resigned to protest Rahul Raj's murder. The move came after one of the doctors doing post-mortem claimed that one of the bullets that hit him may have been fired from close range. However, the autopsy report on Rahul Raj revealed that he had been shot from a distance of 4 metres. The Lok Sabha speaker Somnath Chatterjee have accepted the resignation of five Janata Dal (United) MPs' resignation Though the Maharashtra government offered a compensation of Rs 2 lakh to the youth's family, however, the relatives turned down the offer. The MNS general secretary Shirish Parkar accused the ruling Congress and NCP parties trying to appease both Marathis and North Indians and their leaders. Some of the reactions of eminent people on the incident are as follows: Laloo Yadav later tried to encash this incident politically by getting the father of Rahul Raj to campaign for him.http://ibnlive.in.com/news/rahul-rajs-father-is-lalus-new- poster-boy/91363-37.html The Supreme court on 10 November 2008, refused a judicial inquiry in the encounter of Rahul Raj.http://ibnlive.in.com/news/sc- rules-out-judicial-inquiry-in-rahul-raj-case/77830-3.html ==Investigation and Court cases== The investigation into the incident has been handed over to the Mumbai crime branch. Another high level probe has been ordered by the Maharashtra government which is conducted by Maharashtra chief secretary Johny Joseph. When Maharashtra chief secretary Johny Joseph recently visited the hospital to record Manoj Bhagat's statement, the injured man was unable to recall the incident and the sequence of events. Bhagat was shot at by Rahul Raj. A Public Interest Litigation was filed in the apex court to seeks judicial probe into the killings of Rahul Raj.http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20080071445&ch;=11/5/2008%204:17:00%20PM Supreme Court issued a notice to the Maharashtra government asking it to respond to allegations of violence against north Indians by MNS workers. The court, however, turned down the plea for a judicial probe into the controversial encounter death of Rahul Raj.The Supreme Court Judgement Said that the Encounter was justified as Police was not knowing that the Rahul Raj was carrying any other weapon,it also said that police cannot act as spectator when any one is firing on public. ==See also== *2008 attacks on North Indians in Maharashtra *Racism faced by the Bihari community in India ==References and footnotes== Category:People shot dead by law enforcement officers in India Category:History of Mumbai (1947–present) Category:Racism in India Category:Extrajudicial killings Category:Human rights abuses in India Category:2008 in India Category:2000s in Mumbai ","title":"Rahul Raj encounter"},{"id":"20337756","text":"Carlton Trail locomotives in Prince Albert, 2013 The Carlton Trail Railway is a shortline railway with its headquarters in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. It is operated by OmniTRAX, an American transportation company in Denver, Colorado. Carlton Trail has been operating on ex-Canadian National track since Dec 8, 1997; however, after the acquisition of the branch line CTRW also purchased from CN the Birch Hills-Fenton-Prince Albert branch line in 2001. Since the closure of the pulp mill in 2006, Carlton Trail has typically adhered to a schedule of twice weekly rail service, hauling approximately 2000 carloads per year. According to OmniTrax president Darcy Brede, when the mill reopens in 2014, the railway will begin six days a week service, hauling approximately 3000 carloads a year. ==Shortline railways== Over the past several decades many branch lines on the prairies have been discontinued as they have not proved cost effective for the two Federally regulated rail lines, Canadian National Railway & Canadian Pacific Railway. Often these lines carry grain or ship from mills in the north, shortlines help to fill the gap and continue to provide the service of rail. In recent years Saskatchewan has seen a large influx of shortline railways as the two Class 1s find it difficult to draw a profit from remote locations. Many shortline railways cannot afford the maintenance work the lines desperately need and often need financial assistance from the Provincial Government. ==History== The Carlton Trail was originally an overland transportation route connecting Winnipeg and Fort Edmonton during the early 19th century and the latter days of the fur trade in the Northwest Territories. The Carlton Trail cut its way into what is now Saskatchewan southeast of Melville, headed in a northwesterly route towards Batoche; where the trail crossed the South Saskatchewan River and then towards Fort Carlton. The trail continued on past Fort Carlton along the northern banks of the North Saskatchewan River for another 980 km to Fort Pitt and finally terminating at Fort Edmonton. OmniTRAX had decided during the inception of the new shortline, that it should be named after this famous trading route; hence the name of the railway being Carlton Trail Railway. Much of the southern portion of Carlton Trail Railway's Speers Subdivision straddles the proximity of the original Carlton Trail; which would have followed the North Saskatchewan River towards the Battlefords. Carlton Trail Railway had originally taken control of the Warman subdivision and the Speers subdivision. At Warman Carlton Trail transfers onto CN and has limited trackage rights into CN's Saskatoon Chappell Yard. The Speers subdivision extends from the Speers Jct north on both former Canadian National and Canadian Pacific rail line until it reaches Meadow Lake. The Speers subdivisionhttp://www.trainweb.org/oldtimetrains/photos/shortline/CTRW.htm proved problematic due to past neglect, and on October 7, 2008 Carlton Trail gave notice that it was discontinuing rail services to Meadow Lake on April 1, 2009. Carlton Trail continues to own the Meadow Lake Branch, but has made no indication that operations will start up anytime soon. Many rural communities however have taken interest in the line and recent discussions indicate it could be purchased by the local Rural Municipalities, under the name North Central Rail. As of November, 2010 North Central Rail Ltd and OmniTRAX have yet to reach a tentative agreement in the transfer of ownership of the Speers Subdivision. According to Ray Wilfing, chair of NCR Ltd., OmniTRAX has delayed the sale of the line by not responding to North Central's formal offer in August 2009. North Central Rail lodged a negotiating in bad faith complaint with the Highway Traffic Board in December 2009 in order to pressure OmniTRAX to return to the table to discuss the offer. OmniTRAX was given a deadline of February 15, 2010 to come up with a reasonable response to the offer for the rail line. On 15 February, OmniTRAX responded with a counteroffer that was well beyond what North Central Rail could afford. On July 16, 2010 OmniTRAX put the Speers Subdivision up for sale for 11.2 million dollars, a price the Rural Municipality of Meadow Lake along with 17 other municipalities would like a justification for. Updated 2013 Google Street View imagery of the former railway crossing on the Yellowhead Highway at Denholm, Saskatchewan (the southern terminus of the branch and only connection of the branch to the rest of the North American rail network) and various other places along the line shows that the tracks along the length of the line have been torn up and the line abandoned. On January 17, 2001 CTR purchased the line between Prince Albert and Birch Hills (40.87 km), though this line is rarely if ever used as it serves no economical purpose. CTR also briefly controlled the Arborfield branch line when CN placed it up for sale. Due to the long distance between the Aborfield subdivision and head offices in Prince Albert, CTR placed the line up for sale and later sold it to Arborfield Thunder Rail Ltd.. ==Colours and Symbol== Carlton Trail's symbol is the Prairie Lily that grows abundantly in the fields and ditches in and around Prince Albert. The primary colours for the railway are green and yellow, the two primary colours synonymous with Saskatchewan and are present on both the Saskatchewan Provincial flag and the Prince Albert municipal flag. All engines in CTRW livery bear the lily, but are also similar to sister railways of Hudson Bay Railway and the now defunct Okanagan Valley Railway, in that the striping on the engines is the same except for colour. One possible reason for this is the constant exchange of motive power between OmniTRAX rail lines and the cost behind painting each engine a specific livery. Ironically, the only M420 ever painted in CTRW livery suffered a diesel fuel fire when the fuel return line leaked into the engine compartment, even after it was not recommended to be run. The engine was severely damaged outside of North Battleford and was shipped to Prince Albert to be scrapped. Due to the increased cost of painting each new engine, CTRW has now resorted to patching over the reporting mark of the former railway. ==Engines== {  border=\\"1 - ! Unit ! Model ! Built !

Their primary customer in Prince Albert is the Viterra Inland Terminal, in White Star, but also serve Carrier Lumber, transport steel for a local business and serve Belle Pulses within the community of Duck Lake. Agriculture products include wheat, barley, canola, peas, flax and oats. In recent years Carlton Trail has begun to store rolling stock belonging to Class I railways. Much of the rolling stock stored along the shortline are Liquefied Petroleum Gas from the gas fields of Alberta.

Carlton Trail Railway hauling an empty centerbeam car to Carrier Lumber, 2013 ==Post CN Era== Prince Albert's CN rail yard has gone through severe attrition since the 1990s; having lost the scale house, sanding tower, bulk fuel tanks, CN station (now a strip mall) and many other rail related buildings. Since 1991 branchlines in the Prince Albert area began to disappear, including the abandonment of the Canadian Pacific Railway yard. Carlton Trail however began reusing the roundhouse and turntable shortly after purchasing the Canadian National line. The roundhouse provides cover for their equipment and engines (CN would leave their engines outside next to the roundhouse). Carlton Trail continues to repair cars that have been damaged during derailments along their line. In recent years, larger shortline railways have removed oddball motive power, such as ALCO and MLW units from their roster; as such Carlton Trail now strictly operates used EMD units that they have purchased. Currently the only operational engines are three GP10s that run between Saskatoon & Prince Albert. ==See also== *Okanagan Valley Railway *Hudson Bay Railway *Canadian National Railway *Canadian Pacific Railway *OmniTRAX *Thunder Rail Ltd. ==References * Carlton Trail Railway * RAC Members Category:Transport in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan Category:Railway companies established in 1997 Category:Saskatchewan railways Category:OmniTRAX Category:Companies operating former Canadian Northern Railway lines Category:Companies operating former Canadian Pacific Railway lines ","title":"Carlton Trail Railway"},{"id":"20337764","text":"Scene from the smaller Champmol altarpiece; the Execution of John the Baptist The Retable of the Crucifixion; detail of the right side Jacques de Baerze (active before 1384, died after 1399) was a Flemish sculptor in wood, two of whose major carved altarpieces survive in Dijon, now in France, then the capital of the Duchy of Burgundy. De Baerze probably came from Ghent, and lived in Dendermonde (Termonde in French) some thirty kilometres away, which is also not far from Antwerp and Brussels. He was clearly a well-established master before the death in January 1384 of the local ruler, Louis II of Flanders, Duke of Brabant, as two commissions from Louis to produce carved altarpieces are recorded, though the works have not survived. These were for the chapel of the castle of Dendermonde, and the hospice of the Cistercian abbey of Bijloke, then just outside Ghent. These works were noticed by Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, Louis' son-in-law and successor as Count of Flanders. In 1385 Philip had founded a Carthusian monastery, the Charterhouse of Champmol, then just outside Dijon, as the dynastic burial-place of the Burgundian Valois, and was filling it with impressive works of art. In 1390, he commissioned de Baerze to create two similar altarpieces for Champmol: one, now known as the Altar of Saints and Martyrs for the chapter house,Photo and text in french -- Dijon Museum and the larger, now known as the Retable of the Crucifixion, for the main altar of the church.Photo and text in french - Dijon Museum, and more pictures and French text Both are triptychs with hinged wings, carved on the interior, but the exterior panels, showing when the wings were closed, were to be painted by his court artist Melchior Broederlam (another Fleming who also previously worked for Louis) -- a common arrangement for a grand altarpiece. These painted outer panels only survive for the larger of the two retables.Photo juxtaposing the inside and outside The triptychs would normally be shown closed, displaying the paintings, but opened to show the carvings for feast days. The iconography of the two artists' elements was designed to complement each other, with a painted sequence of scenes from the Infancy of Christ and within, carved scenes of the Adoration of the Magi, the Crucifixion in the centre, and the Entombment of Christ, flanked by saints on the inside of the side-panels.Snyder, James; Northern Renaissance Art, pp. 73 and 294, 1985, Harry N. Abrams, Above there is elaborate Gothic tracery with small figures of saints and angels. The whole of both works is either gilded or painted. The Altar of Saints and Martyrs is 159 cm high, and 252 cm wide with the wings open. For the Retable of the Crucifixion the equivalent figures are 167 cm and 252 cm.Dijon Museum links above The retables were transported to Dijon from Dendermonde in August 1391, but were returned to Flanders a year later.Grove, op cit There, the painting and gilding was finished by Broederlam at his studio in Ypres; guild regulations usually mandated that the carving and painting or guilding were performed by members of different guilds. They were returned to Champmol, approved by a committee including Claus Sluter, and installed by the end of 1399, after which de Baerze disappears from documented records. The altarpieces were moved after the French Revolution to the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Dijon, along with the Broederlam panels,Dijon Museum which now, unlike at the time of their creation, receive more attention than the carvings, as they are of great significance in the development of Early Netherlandish painting,Snyder, 71 and 293-4 and painting is generally of greater interest to modern art historians than sculpture. De Baerze's two retables are probably the earliest Netherlandish examples to survive complete, although there were evidently many more such works in existence by this date, and the form probably developed first in the Low Countries. With hardly any works from the period to compare to those in Dijon, it is hard to assess the originality of de Baerze, or his place in the tradition, though he clearly participates in the International Gothic style of the period. Presumably most of his work was for local churches and religious houses. In fact the iconoclasm after the Reformation was so destructive of Netherlandish wood- carved altars that only a few fragments survive there from the following eighty years, while Germany has many examples.Snyder, 293-4 Other smaller carvings attributed to de Baerze survive, including the 28 cm high figure from an altar crucifix which formed part of the Champmol commission, now in the Art Institute of Chicago,Art Institute of Chicago see also for a bibliography on de Baerze. and a St George in the Mimara Museum in Zagreb. == The Retable of the Crucifixion == File:Retable de la crucifixion-volet gauche-Jacques de Baerze-MBA Dijon.jpgThe Retable of the Crucifixion, left side.

She was commissioned in 1957 and remained in service until 1994, after which she was turned into a museum ship in Turku. The vessel was named after the strait of Keihässalmi, which is located in Sipoo. Keihässalmi was the first Finnish minelayer to be constructed after World War II. Keihässalmi was designed according to lessons learned from the Ruotsinsalmi class minelayers, but with increased size and tonnage. It was stronger, more seaworthy and faster than its predecessor. The construction took place from 1956 to 1957 at the Valmet Oy shipyard in Helsinki. The sinking of the minelayer Riilahti in 1943 had left a big gap in Finnish mine warfare capabilities, and a new vessel was needed. It would last until the mid-1950s before this was addressed, due to the harsh after-war conditions and war-payments which included many ships to be constructed at Finnish shipyards. The Keihässalmi was fitted with almost all weapons systems available to the Finnish Navy (except torpedoes), although she primarily was a minelayer and minesweeper. Keihässalmi was launched on 16 March 1957 and the vessel remained the largest vessel of the Finnish Navy until 1962, when the frigate Matti Kurki was purchased. It was also used as a sort of test-bed for multiple systems. At one point a 75 mm gun was fitted to the ship, as the Finnish Navy lacked designated gunships. The ship was also used for training, and was sent out on trips every sailing season. The Keihässalmi was cheap to operate and required a low complement (important as the Finnish Navy had a manpower restriction), but the vessel proved itself over the decades. The ship underwent repairs and refitting from 1975 until 1981, when its seaworthiness was improved by the installment of ballast tanks. The forward mine section was slightly modified to allow the vessel travel in high seas. The weaponry was modernized and the gunlaying was now radar-guided. Keihässalmi was the flagship of the Finnish Navy and she made many visits to other countries in the 1960s. She was the official school ship of the navy from 1975 until 1979, awaiting the replacement for the Matti Kurki. Keihässalmi was retired and turned into a museum ship in 1994. She is currently on display at the Forum Marinum museum in Turku. ==References== *Forum Marinum: Minelayer Keihässalmi *www.mil.fi: Miinalaiva Keihässalmi Category:Valmet Category:Minelayers of the Finnish Navy Category:Ships built in Helsinki Category:1957 ships Category:Museum ships in Finland Category:Tourist attractions in Turku Category:Museum ships in Turku ","title":"Finnish minelayer Keihässalmi"},{"id":"20337836","text":"Roger Ballenger (September 25, 1950 – October 27, 2019) was an American politician.

Known as the \\"Nile of Batangas,\\" the river itself forms the southeastern boundary of Poblacion, Batangas City as it continues to flow southward to Batangas Bay at an approximately point of east of Batangas Port. The river may derive its name from Sterculia foetida, a tree which whose local name is alternately spelled calumpang or kalumpang in Tagalog. == Legends associated with the river == Legend has it that logs, locally known as batang, were floating all over the river. Batang is said to be the root word of Batangan, the former name of the capital city and the province. Another legend states that a statue of the Holy Infant Jesus on board a Spanish ship en route from Manila to Cebu sought shelter on the coast of city after its voyage was interrupted by a bad weather. The crewmen took the Holy Infant to a small church near the river and sang the Te Deum hymn. The storm miraculously stopped and the ship resumed its trip to Cebu. Soon, the statue was reported missing. At the same time, a deaf-mute boy who was playing along the river found the statue atop a floating log. In memory of this, a floral procession and a bangkarera or boat racing are held on the river every 16 January, the Catholic feast day of Batangas City. == Conservation status == The river is now categorized as Class D; this means that its water can only be used for agriculture and manufacturing process after treatment. The factors causing water pollution in the river are direct disposal of household and livestock wastes and untreated sewage.

It marks the divide between the drainage basins of the Rhine River in the east and that of the Rhône (Doubs and Saône) in the west, part of the European Watershed between the North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. ==Geography== Its elevation varies between at its lowest and a little more than . The roughly wide terrain corridor connects the French département of Haut-Rhin, south of the région Alsace and the Territoire de Belfort, north of the région Franche-Comté.The second main road out of Alsace is the Col de Saverne (Saverne Pass), linking the département of Bas-Rhin (Alsace) to the département Moselle, région Lorraine. Alsace is also accessible via the Tunnel Maurice-Lemaire and some other vosgian passes but they are neither allowed to heavy truck traffic (and dangerous goods in the tunnel) nor equipped with railroads. The passage allows warm Mediterranean flows to advect northeastwards into the Upper Rhine Plain and the Middle Rhine Valley. Lines of communication that traverse the Belfort Gap include the French Route nationale 83 and the A36 autoroute, the railway line from Paris to Basel and the planned LGV Rhin-Rhône high-speed railway, as well as the Rhône-Rhine Canal. ==History== Two important routes crossed the area already during the Roman era, which allowed Julius Caesar to quickly move troops which were used to defeat Ariovistus and force his German tribes (primarily Suebi) in the province of Germania Superior to retreat across the Rhine. After the Migration Period and the Decline of the Roman Empire in the 5th century, Germanic Alemanni tribes settled east of the plateau, while the Burgundians established a first kingdom west of it. Both had been incorporated into the Kingdom of Francia by the early 6th century, while the highland remained the linguistic border between Germanic and Romance languages. Upon the division of the Carolingian Empire in the 9th century, the area again marked the border between East Francia, i.e. the German stem duchy of Swabia, in the east and the Kingdom of Arles (Upper Burgundy) in the west. While the Swabian Alsace region was a constituent part of the Holy Roman Empire in 962, the adjacent County of Burgundy in the west was not incorporated until 1033. About 1042 the County of Montbéliard (Mömpelgard) was established on Burgundian territory right at the border with the Alsacien Sundgau region. Montbéliard fell to the Swabian House of Württemberg in 1407, while the Sundgau region around Ferrette (Pfirt) and the French-speaking town of Belfort (Beffert) had been acquired by the Habsburg duke Albert II of Austria by marriage in 1324. The area again marked a borderline, when the Habsburgs had to cede the Sundgau to the Kingdom of France according to the 1648 Peace of Westphalia. Over the following centuries of French–German enmity, the strategically important town of Belfort, situated at the western entrance into the corridor, has played the role of a bolt against invasions over the centuries whether originating from the west or the east and remained a communications center that is impossible to circumvent. After the Franco-Prussian War and the Siege of Belfort, the language border was used in 1871 to determine the new demarcation line between the newly established German Empire and the French Third Republic retaining Belfort. A series of fortifications was set up to ensure defense of the area. The most recent military advance through the Belfort Gap was that of the French I Corps in November 1944.Riviera to the Rhine (U.S. Army in World War II Series), pp. 412-432. Jeffrey J.

Although he arguably gained his greatest influence as the chief editorial writer of The New York Times during the decade of the 1860s, Swinton is best remembered as the namesake of John Swinton's Paper, one of the most prominent American labor newspapers of the 1880s. Swinton would also serve as chief editorialist of the New York Sun during two stints totaling more than a dozen years. ==BiographyEarly years=== John Swinton was born in Saltoun, Scotland, on December 12, 1829.Sender Garlin, Three American Radicals: John Swinton, Charles P. Steinmetz, and William Dean Howells. Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 1991; pg. 4. Swinton's father emigrated to America when John was very young, becoming a pioneer settler in the state of Illinois.\\"John Swinton Dead: The Noted Economist, Writer, and Orator Gone,\\" New York Times, December 16, 1901. He died not long after arriving in America, casting his son John into the job market at a very early age. Swinton became an apprentice to a printer in 1841, when he was just 13 years old.\\"John Swinton,\\" in Gary M. Fink (ed.), Biographical Dictionary of American Labor. Revised Edition. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1984; pp. 539-540. Two years later he moved along, emigrating to Montreal, Lower Canada, where he worked as a journeyman printer. Swinton remained in Canada for the rest of the decade of the 1840s. Swinton returned to the United States to attend Williston Northampton School in Easthampton, Massachusetts. He did not complete his studies there, instead moving to New York City to enroll at New York Medical College, where once again he did not attain a degree. Swinton was politically radicalized by slavery in the United States and the organized campaign for its abolition. In 1856 he moved to Kansas to participate in the Free Soil movement there, taking a position as manager of the Lawrence Republican, an anti-slavery newspaper.Garlin, Three American Radicals, pg. 5. He later moved to the slave state of South Carolina to take a job as a printing compositor at the state printing office. Swinton secretly taught illegal literacy classes for black South Carolinians in this period. ===Journalistic career=== Swinton returned to New York City in 1860, writing an article on medicine for the New York Times which was so well- received that Swinton was offered a post as an editorial writer for the paper. Swinton was no doubt aided in gaining this position by his brother Raymond Swinton, who had joined the Times in 1858 and had himself quickly risen through the managerial ranks. He would remain at the Times for a decade, becoming the chief editorial writer for the paper, including the entire duration of the American Civil War. From 1870 to 1875 Swinton worked as a free lance journalist, writing extensively for Horace Greeley's New York Tribune. Swinton became involved in radical labor politics in the spring of 1874, when he addressed a mass meeting at Tompkins Square in New York City — a gathering which was violently dispersed by the police. Swinton's qualities as an effective orator gained notice, however, and in the fall of 1874 he was persuaded to run for Mayor of New York at the top of the ticket of the fledgling Industrial Political Party. Swinton received few votes and saw his candidacy as largely symbolic. Swinton immersed himself in the New York trade union movement, addressing gatherings of workers and speaking before the New York State Assembly on their behalf. He became active in the affairs of the Cigar Makers' International Union (CMIU) and was instrumental in that union's campaign against the tenement system of cigar production. Following his stint as a freelancer, Swinton took a permanent position as an editorial writer for the New York Sun in 1875.\\"John Swinton,\\" in William D.P. Bliss and Rudolph M. Binder (eds.), The New Encyclopedia of Social Reform. New Edition. New York: Funk and Wagnalls, 1908; pg. 1184. Before he left the Sun in 1883 to launch a newspaper of his own, he delivered at a press dinner the speech he is most famous for today: :\\"There is no such a thing in America as an independent press, unless it is out in country towns. You are all slaves. You know it, and I know it. There is not one of you who dares to express an honest opinion. If you expressed it, you would know beforehand that it would never appear in print. I am paid $150 for keeping honest opinions out of the paper I am connected with. Others of you are paid similar salaries for doing similar things. If I should allow honest opinions to be printed in one issue of my paper, I would be like Othello before twenty-four hours: my occupation would be gone. The man who would be so foolish as to write honest opinions would be out on the street hunting for another job. The business of a New York journalist is to distort the truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to villify, to fawn at the feet of Mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread, or for what is about the same — his salary. You know this, and I know it; and what foolery to be toasting an \\"Independent Press\\"! We are the tools and vassals of rich men behind the scenes. We are jumping-jacks. They pull the string and we dance. Our time, our talents, our lives, our possibilities, are all the property of other men. We are intellectual prostitutes.\\" ===John Swinton's Paper=== The first issue of the eponymous John Swinton's Paper appeared in New York City on October 14, 1883.Frank T. Reuter, \\"John Swinton's Paper,\\" Labor History, vol. 1, no. 3 (Fall 1960), pg. 298. It was a 4-page broadsheet, split into six vertical columns and appearing once a week.Reuter, \\"John Swinton's Paper,\\" pg. 300. The masthead of each issueReuter, \\"John Swinton's Paper,\\" pg. 301, citing John Swinton's Paper, October 14, 1883, et seq. declared Swinton's purposes: > 1\\\\. Boldly upholding the rights of Man in the American Way. > 2\\\\. Battling against the Accumulating Wrongs of Society and Industry. > 3\\\\. Striving for the Organization and Interests of Working men and giving > the news of the Trades and Unions. > 4\\\\.

Warning the American people against the treasonable and crushing > schemes of Millionaires, Monopolists, and Plutocrats ... > 6\\\\. Looking toward better times of fair play and Public Welfare. In this publication Swinton was free to espouse his own radical ideas about the American labor movement and the publication gained a national readership. Chief among Swinton's targets were the so-called \\"Robber Barons\\" of the day, including Jay Gould and William H. Vanderbilt, who were subjected to an unending stream of satirical cartoons, poems, and aggressive editorials.Reuter, \\"John Swinton's Paper,\\" pg. 302. In his pages Swinton opined against the use of exploitative prison labor and contract immigrant labor, casting the perceived menace of Chinese immigration in particularly dark tones. Swinton's agitation against contract convict labor, launched with a series of articles beginning on October 28, 1883, was credited with moving the New York State Assembly to investigate the issue, culminating in a prohibition of the system in the state beginning in 1885.Reuter, \\"John Swinton's Paper,\\" pg. 303. Swinton attempted to have a similar effect upon the system of contract immigrant labor. Under this system, imported workers were brought into the country by employers, often to break strikes, and were provided for at a minimum standard of living for a time, saving their money for families at home. Swinton's use of an undercover investigative reporter to reveal the abusive nature of the system in January 1884 resulted in Congressional action on the matter, ending in passage of watered-down amended legislation in 1885.Reuter, \\"John Swinton's Paper,\\" pp. 303-304. Following passage Swinton continued his crusade against the system, charging the administration of Conservative Democratic President Grover Cleveland with failure to enforce the provisions of the law.Reuter, \\"John Swinton's Paper,\\" pg. 304. Despite gaining a significant and influential readership in the labor movement, John Swinton's Paper was never a self-supporting business venture.Reuter, \\"John Swinton's Paper,\\" pg. 306. Swinton refused to accept financial gifts for the publication, instead relying exclusively upon subscriptions ($1 per year), newsstand sales (3 cents per copy), and paid advertising (25 cents per column inch). As early as December 1884 losses had begun to mount, a process which accelerated in 1887 when the Knights of Labor began a boycott of the publication over Swinton's perceived antagonism and commitment to the network of rival trade unions which later congealed under the auspices of the American Federation of Labor.Reuter, \\"John Swinton's Paper,\\" pp. 305-306. By August 1887 the financial shortfall had become untenable. In his penultimate issue, dated August 7, 1887, Swinton declared that he could no longer subsidize his publication's losses. He wrote: > My means are no longer sufficient to bear any further strain. I have been > wrecked by this paper and the labors associated therewith, in which during > the past four years, I have sunk tens of thousands of dollars — all of it > out of my own pocket.John Swinton's Paper, August 7, 1887, cited in Reuter, > \\"John Swinton's Paper,\\" pg. 307. ===Later life=== Swinton returned to paid journalism working for others, continuing to maintain a high public profile as an orator on the labor question.Reuter, \\"John Swinton's Paper,\\" pg. 307. Swinton ran as the candidate for the Progressive Labor Party in 1887 for the New York State Senate in the state's 7th district. Swinton made a serious effort to win election in this campaign and received a substantial vote, but was ultimately defeated. In 1892 Swinton returned to his former position on the editorial staff of the New York Sun, writing editorials for that publication. He would remain at that position until 1897. ===Death and legacy=== In 1899 Swinton lost his eyesight, but did his best to remain active as a writer despite this handicap. Swinton died in Brooklyn Heights, New York on December 15, 1901, just three days after his 72nd birthday. He was buried at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York, beneath a monument erected by local trade unionists. ==WorksBooks and pamphlets=== * The New Issue: the Chinese American Question.

It is an active little lizard, and if threatened will often play dead to confuse the attacker. ==Description== It is a relatively small, flat bodied skink of a silver-gray coloring. It has a distinct white stripe running along its body from the eye to the base of its tail. It typically grows to a length of around but may grow up to be around in length. Also sometimes called a snake-eyed skink because it lacks eyelids, instead having a translucent layer of scales covering its eyes similar to that of snakes. The skink has around five supraciliary scales, with 22 rows of scales on the midbody and eight plantar scales that are rounded and pale plantar scales. ==Taxonomy== The species was first formally identified by the herpetologist Samuel Garman in 1901 as part of the work Some reptiles and batrachians from Australasia as published in the Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard. The species name is Latin for striped. ==Habitat== The range of the skink is in north eastern Queensland and into Papua New Guinea.

The species Dieffenbachia bowmanii is named after him. ==Career== Bowman was born at Arniston near Edinburgh, where his father worked as a gardener. Bowman started his gardening career working with his father, before working at the gardens at Dalhousie Castle, Archerfield, and Dunmore Park, all in Scotland. He later took up a position as foreman in the gardens of the Royal Horticultural Society at Chiswick, west London. In 1866, he was recruited by James Veitch & Sons of Chelsea, who, in a joint venture with William Wilson Saunders, sent him to Brazil to search for orchids and other plants. He travelled initially to Rio de Janeiro and travelled across the continent to Colombia. Amongst the plants he discovered and sent to his employers were Dieffenbachia bowmanii and Paullinia thalictrifolia, a climbing hothouse plant with fern-like foliage. He also found two orchids, Odontoglossum crispum \\"Alexandrae\\" and Cyanophyllum bowmanii, which was later awarded a first-class certificate by the RHS's Floral Committee. Whilst in Colombia, he also discovered Miltoniopsis vexillaria, but was unable to send a specimen back to England. As well as sending back plants for Veitch, he also obtained material for private collectors in England and for the Royal Horticultural Society. He was preparing to ship a large collection to England from La Paz when he was attacked, losing most of his finds and as a result was instructed by James Veitch, Jr. to remain in Colombia in order to re-trace his steps. Shortly afterwards, he contracted dysentery which led to his death on 25 June 1868. He was buried in the British cemetery at Bogota. ==References== Category:Scottish botanists Category:1838 births Category:1868 deaths Category:People from Midlothian Category:Veitch Nurseries Category:Botanists active in South America Category:Plant collectors ","title":"David Bowman (botanist)"},{"id":"20338064","text":"Hans Heinrich Sievert (1 December 1909 in Grittern near Hückelhoven – 5 April 1963 in Eutin) was a German Olympic decathlete.

It is a contributing property to the Downtown Historic District of Woodland, California. ==History== Designed in 1885 by Thomas J. Welsh, a prominent San Francisco architect, for the amount of $28,000, it was the first opera house to serve the Sacramento Valley. The builder for the community theater was Woodland contractor William Henry Curson. Several years later in July 1892 a fire that started in Dead Cat Alley behind the Opera House destroyed much of what is now the Downtown Woodland Historic District, including the Opera House. There was uncertainty whether the House would be rebuilt when a locally renowned businessman, David N. Hershey, purchased the site. Other local businessmen supported the project in addition to Hershey. The Opera House was rebuilt between 1895 and 1896 by local contractor William H. Winne at the cost of $8,990. Many of the materials from the original building were used including some of the partially standing walls. By 1913 over 300 touring companies had appeared on its stage, and the Woodland Opera House was becoming an entertainment center for the region. Nevertheless, the venue closed in that year, after ticket sales declined and the theater lost a lawsuit by an attendee who had mistaken a loading door for an exit and fell three feet, breaking an arm. ===A new beginning=== The Opera house remained closed and unused for almost sixty years until 1971 when it was purchased by the Yolo County Historical Society, for a sum of $12,000. After many local fund drives, donations, and monies from several different government agencies including the City of Woodland, restoration of the building began. Declared a state historic park in 1976, the building was later deeded to the State of California in 1980. The Opera House reopened in 1989 after a $2,000,000 restoration project. Extensive work was still done over the next nine years. Gary Worth, an architect from Woodland, oversaw the work and Brocchini & Associates of Oakland provided most of the materials for the restoration of the theater including antique wallpaper, lighting, and paint colors. In the restoration the building was made structurally safe and \\"earthquake proofed\\". Central heat and air-conditioning, a sprinkler and alarm system, and handicap access were added. An annex was constructed for storage of mechanical equipment, as well as for administrative office space, a gift counter, the Mid Level Lounge, and a rooftop exterior deck. The interior restoration effort received an Award of Merit from the California Preservation Foundation and a Citation Award from the League of Historic American Theaters. In 1990 with the help of Woodland Rotary Club, the south side grassy \\"Rotary Court\\" was added to the existing outdoor plaza, named Intermission Garden. The Intermission Garden's brick marquee and entrance sign was designed by Brocchini & Associates and was added the same year. ==Architectural design== The present Opera House is a simple, two-story, red brick structure. The structure is approximately 104 feet long by 60 feet wide; and its walls are 20 inches thick. A stage house on top of the north end of the Opera House (destroyed by fire in the 1930s) rose to a height of 60 feet above the street level. The building partially shares a common wall with the building on its western side Its interior is an example of 19th-century American playhouses. The layout of the stage is a typical proscenium arch. It combines the horseshoe balcony with an uninterrupted semi-circular seating arrangement and large orchestra seating area like the common theme in Italian Renaissance- Revival theaters. ==Productions== The Opera House holds mainstage subscriber productions from September to June. The theatre also has a summer youth theatre camp in August of each year and a Young People's Theatre Program that runs throughout the year. Along with many concerts throughout the year. Each production runs from 2 to 5 weekends. The theatre also works with the Yolo County Office of Education to provide very low ticket prices for students for school day performances of plays that are currently running. Some notable performers on the WOH stage in the late 19th and early 20th century include Nance O'Neil, James A. Herne, Harry Davenport, Madame Helena Modjeska, John Philip Sousa and his band, comics Weber and Fields, George M. Cohan's troupe, \\"Gentleman Jim\\" Corbett, John L. Sullivan as well as rising motion picture stars Sydney Greenstreet, Walter Huston and Verna Felton. In addition to play and drama productions, the Opera House is also used for a variety of music performances, comedians, and in rare cases even weddings. ==See also== *Structure of theaters *Play (theater) ==References External links == * * Category:Theatres in California Category:Opera houses in California Category:Buildings and structures in Woodland, California Category:Music venues completed in 1885 Category:Theatres on the National Register of Historic Places in California Category:Historic district contributing properties in California Category:California Historical Landmarks Category:Tourist attractions in Yolo County, California Category:Theatres completed in 1885 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Yolo County, California Category:Individually listed contributing properties to historic districts on the National Register in California Category:Opera houses on the National Register of Historic Places in California ","title":"Woodland Opera House"},{"id":"20338073","text":"The 1969 Ohio State Buckeyes football team represented the Ohio State University in the 1969 Big Ten Conference football season.

The bridge was the final link in the railroad, entering service in February 1923, a year after the rest of the line was finished. The AEC hired the Chicago firm of Ralph Modjeski and Angier to design the bridge, and the American Bridge Company to fabricate and erect it.

This bridge still ranks as the longest span of any kind in Alaska. it was then the third-longest simple truss bridge in North America. President Warren G. Harding, becoming the first president to visit Alaska, traveled to the state to drive the ceremonial last spike at the north end of the bridge on July 15, 1923. It was one of Harding's last public appearances, as he died 18 days later during his ongoing western tour. ==See also== * Juneau–Douglas Bridge, next longest span in Alaska == References  * Construction photos by designer Walter Angier * Recent photos at Bridgehunter.com Category:1923 establishments in Alaska Category:Alaska Railroad Category:Bridges completed in 1923 Category:Bridges in Unorganized Borough, Alaska Category:Buildings and structures in Yukon–Koyukuk Census Area, Alaska Category:Railroad bridges in Alaska Category:Steel bridges in the United States Category:Truss bridges in the United States Category:Pennsylvania truss bridges in the United States ","title":"Mears Memorial Bridge"},{"id":"20338228","text":"Party Hats is a jazz studio album by Will Bernard recorded in 2006 and released in 2007.liner notes Party Hats received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Contemporary Jazz Album of 2007.Press Release grammy.com, December 6, 2007, retrieved November 22, 2008 The album gave Bernard more visibility as a jazz guitarist.Review of Party Hats Dan Oullette, billboard.com, retrieved November 22, 2008 ==Track listing== # \\"Share the Sea\\" - 5:38 # \\"White Elephant Sale\\" - 4:16 # \\"Ripple Sole\\" - 6:37 # \\"Leo's Cat\\" - 6:19 # \\"Party Hats\\" - 5:05 # \\"Afro Sheen\\" - 6:55 # \\"Chin Up\\" - 4:57 # \\"Newbie\\" - 4:16 # \\"Folding Green\\" - 4:57 # \\"Rattle Trap\\" - 4:48 # \\"Penske\\" - 4:42 ==Personnel== *Will Bernard - guitar *Wil Blades - Hammond B3 *Keith McArthur - bass (1,7) *Ryan Newman - bass (2-6, 8-11) *Jan Jackson - drums (1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 11) *Paul Spina - drums (3, 6, 8-10) *Cochemea Gastelum - alto saxophone (1) *Joe Cohen - tenor saxophone (1, 2, 5, 6, 7) *Peter Apfelbaum - tenor saxophone, qarqabas, melodica (3, 6, 7) *Dave Ellis - tenor saxophone (9, 10) *Mike Olmos - trumpet (1, 6, 7) *Adam Theis - trombone (1, 6, 7) *Josh Jones - percussion (1, 4-7) *Michael Bluestein - Hammond B3, electric piano (3, 7) ==References== Category:2007 albums Category:Will Bernard albums ","title":"Party Hats"},{"id":"20338253","text":"KKIA is an FM radio station in Storm Lake, Iowa, operating at 92.9 MHz with a power of 25,000 watts.

Sugihara is a theoretical biologist who has worked across a variety of fields ranging from ecology and landscape ecology, to epidemiology, to genetics, to geoscience and atmospheric science, to quantitative finance and economics. His work involves inductive theoretical approaches to understanding nature from observational data. The general approach is different from most theory and involves minimalist inductive theory – Inductive data-driven explorations of nature using minimal assumptions. The aim is to avoid inevitable assumptions of deductive first- principle models and produce an understanding that passes the validation test of out-of-sample prediction. His initial work on fisheries as complex, chaotic systems led to work on financial networks and prediction of chaotic systems. Other notable research relates some of his early work on topology and assembly in ecological systems to recent work on social systemsSugihara, G., and H. Ye. Cooperative Network Dynamics.

He did something after graduation, but returned to Ann Arbor to take graduate courses in mathematics. In 1978, he matriculated at Princeton University, where he studied mathematical ecology under the supervision of Robert May, earning an M.S. in biology in 1980 and PhD in mathematical biology in 1983. While at Princeton, he was awarded the Ogden Porter Jacobus Prize, Princeton University Graduate School's highest academic honor. Sugihara started his career as Wigner Prize Fellow at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and concurrently associate professor of Mathematics at the University of Tennessee. In 1986, he joined Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO). From 1997–2002, Sugihara took leave from SIO to work in Deutsche Bank on quantitative finance becoming a Managing Director. Sugihara has been a visiting professor at Cornell University, Imperial College London, Kyoto University and the Tokyo Institute of Technology, and was a visiting fellow at Merton College, Oxford University in 2002. He is recipient of several national and international awards, and is currently a member of the National Academy of Sciences Board on Mathematical Sciences and its Applications, a National Research Council advisory board that advises government agencies and guides the nation’s mathematics agenda to better serve national needs. He held the UC San Diego John Dove Isaacs Chair in Natural Philosophy from 1990 to 1995 and has been McQuown Professor of Natural Science at SIO since 2007. He is one of 18 members of the National Academies Board on Mathematical Sciences and their Applications, and was a Managing Director at Deutsche Bank.

An English translation of Wanko to Kurasō was released on November 20, 2008. ==Plot== It is set in Japan, in a world parallel to reality, with the exception being that there exist a variety of pets known as Anthropoid animals. These pets include cats, dogs and birds, though birds never make appearances in the game. They have human form (ears and tails seem to be the only outward changes in appearance,) show some intelligence, and are even allowed to hold special jobs. However, they still retain much of their animal instincts, most notably the urge to mate during the Spring and Fall seasons. The game has two routes, each focusing primarily on one or two characters: The Nadeshiko route, and the Risa route. Both routes, however, included development of other characters. The Nadeshiko route revolves around the owner of a nearby pet-store, Nadeshiko, and her pet anthropoid dog, Kotarou. This route was translated before the Risa route, despite the lower popularity of Nadeshiko, possibly because of the greater amount of ero-scenes in her route. Yuuichi eventually ends up in a relationship with Nadeshiko, but is unable to ultimately commit. The Risa route revolves more primarily around Risa, Mikan and Silvie, showing more character development, most notably with Risa. ==Characters== ;Yuuichi : The protagonist of the story. He appears as friendly and helpful, but detaches himself from others, cynically denying the existence of true love. His cold personality is a result of his upbringing, which took place in a brothel. Over many years, he came to associate love with material gain and sexual gratification, and thus does not hold any stock in it. Yuuichi lives alone in an apartment, attends a nearby college and earns money by teaching a junior cram-school. ;Mikan : An abandoned anthropoid dog. Yuuichi finds her unconscious in the rain one night while walking home, unable to let her just die, he takes her up to his apartment and treats her. Even though he told her she can only stay until the rain ends, she stays in fear and worry. She was the pet dog of a girl called Misa, who recently died. She is initially very shy and detached, due to her being unable to accept the death of her master, and thus Yuuichi assumes that she lacks the proper ability to speak. She is eventually taken in by Yuuichi and, after some time, opens up and proves herself to be exceptionally intelligent. Voiced by Ayaka Kimura ;Risa : The younger sister to the late owner of Mikan. She was meant to take care of Mikan, but Mikan was unwilling to accept this arrangement. Risa eventually begins staying at Yuuichi's house for extended periods of time. She is, despite being a virgin, quite open with Yuuichi about her sexuality. In the Risa-route, she decides to attempt to become Yuuichi's first true love. In the end she married Yuuichi. Voiced by Saya Katsuki ;Nadeshiko : The owner of a local pet store. Despite her incredibly young appearance, she is actually older than Yuuichi, which has confused many people about her, Yuuichi included. Initially helps Yuuichi with Mikan and Silvie, but in the Nadeshiko route, has a relationship with him. The relationship ends neutrally, however, with Nadeshiko and Yuuichi both realising that nothing will ultimately come out of it. Voiced by Haruka Fukai ;Silviana : The pet dog of Risa. Initially the pet of a cruel breeder, she is rescued by Risa and Yuuichi. She is quiet and shy throughout the game, partially due to her relatively low intelligence. She is part of a rare and valuable breed of dog, and thus it was necessary for Yuuichi to spend a lot of money to free her. Voiced by Neko Kurosaki ;Kotarou : The pet dog of Nadeshiko. Despite her average intelligence, she is a highly respected police dog, due to her excellent pedigree resulting in high capabilities. She was extremely violent and aggressive when younger, seriously injuring Nadeshiko. Now that she is more mature, she regrets behaving like she did, and has a very good relationship with Nadeshiko. Voiced by Yu ;Kana : A student in Yuuichi's cram school. Is friendly to Yuuichi, helps him a lot, and often visits for food. She owns Kuu, an exceptionally intelligent anthropoid cat. Voiced by Miru ;Kuu : The pet cat of Kana. Unusual for a cat, she is extremely intelligent. This intelligence results in her having conversations with Yuuichi about the psyche of anthropoid animals, due to her knowledge of them. She helps Yuuichi and Risa free Silvie by discovering that Silvie's previous owner was mistreating her. Voiced bu Yui Moegi ;Seika : One of Kana's classmates who helps Yuuichi out on finding Mikan's owner. She has a crush on Yuuichi since she first met him, and later becomes one of his tutoring students just to spend time with him. She is a self-proclaimed expert on dogs and can be pretty hyper at times. She is the owner of Kaie, her anthropoid dog. Voiced by Kazene ;Kaie : The pet dog of Seika. He is just as intelligent as Kuu, is kind and polite, and behaves to his owner as if he is her butler of sorts, addressing Seika as \\"milady\\". He was away to do advanced studies in the beginning of the game, but later returned. Voiced by Yuu Ayase ==Reception== Wanko to Kurasou is fairly popular amongst the English-speaking community as an eroge visual novel.

It is marked with invasion stripes to help Allied troops clearly identify it as an Allied plane. Aerial reconnaissance is reconnaissance for a military or strategic purpose that is conducted using reconnaissance aircraft. The role of reconnaissance can fulfil a variety of requirements including artillery spotting, the collection of imagery intelligence, and the observation of enemy maneuvers. == History Early developments=== After the French Revolution, the new rulers became interested in using the balloon to observe enemy manoeuvres and appointed scientist Charles Coutelle to conduct studies using the balloon L'Entreprenant, the first military reconnaissance aircraft. The balloon found its first use in the 1794 conflict with Austria, where in the Battle of Fleurus they gathered information. Moreover, the presence of the balloon had a demoralizing effect on the Austrian troops, which improved the likelihood of victory for the French troops. To operate such balloons, a new unit of the French military, the French Aerostatic Corps, was established; this organisation has been recognised as being the world's first air force. Pigeon with German miniature camera, during the First World War. After the invention of photography, primitive aerial photographs were made of the ground from manned and unmanned balloons, starting in the 1860s, and from tethered kites from the 1880s onwards. An example was Arthur Batut's kite-borne camera photographs of Labruguière starting from 1889. In the early 20th century, Julius Neubronner experimented with pigeon photography. These pigeons carried small cameras that incorporated timers. (photographs by Alfred Nobel's rocket and the Bavarian pigeon fleet) Ludwig Rahrmann in 1891 patented a means of attaching a camera to a large calibre artillery projectile or rocket, and this inspired Alfred Maul to develop his Maul Camera Rockets starting in 1903. Alfred Nobel in 1896 had already built the first rocket carrying a camera, which took photographs of the Swedish landscape during its flights. Maul improved his camera rockets and the Austrian Army even tested them in the Turkish-Bulgarian War in 1912 and 1913, but by then and from that time on camera-carrying aircraft were found to be superior. (summary and photo) The first use of airplanes in combat missions was by the Italian Air Force during the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–1912. On 23 October 1911, an Italian pilot, Capt. Carlo Piazza, flew over the Turkish lines in Libya to conduct an aerial reconnaissance mission; Another aviation first occurred on November 1 with the first ever dropping of an aerial bomb, performed by Sottotenente Giulio Gavotti, on Turkish troops from an early model of Etrich Taube aircraft.U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission: Aviation at the Start of the First World War The first reconnaissance flight in Europe took place in Greece, over Thessaly, on 18 October 1912 (5 October by the Julian calendar) over the Ottoman army.Walter J. Boyne (ed.) Air Warfare: an International Encyclopedia: A-L, p. 66 Note: The correct date in the Gregorian calendar is 18 October, not 21 as the source claims. The pilot dropped also some hand-grenades over the Turkish Army barracks, although without success. This was the first day of the Balkan wars, and during the same day a similar mission was flown by German mercenaries in Ottoman service in the Thrace front against the Bulgarians. The Greek and the Ottoman mission flown during the same day are the first military aviation combat missions in a conventional war. A few days later, on 16 October 1912, a Bulgarian Albatros aircraft performed one of Europe's first reconnaissance flight in combat conditions, against the Turkish lines on the Balkan peninsula, during the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913. ===Maturation during the First World War=== B.E.2c reconnaissance aircraft of the RFC with an aerial reconnaissance camera fixed to the side of the fuselage, 1916. The use of aerial photography rapidly matured during the First World War, as aircraft used for reconnaissance purposes were outfitted with cameras to record enemy movements and defences. At the start of the conflict, the usefulness of aerial photography was not fully appreciated, with reconnaissance being accomplished with map sketching from the air. Frederick Charles Victor Laws started experiments in aerial photography in 1912 with No. 1 Squadron RAF using the British dirigible Beta. He discovered that vertical photos taken with 60% overlap could be used to create a stereoscopic effect when viewed in a stereoscope, thus creating a perception of depth that could aid in cartography and in intelligence derived from aerial images. The dirigibles were eventually allocated to the Royal Navy, so Laws formed the first aerial reconnaissance unit of fixed-wing aircraft; this became No. 3 Squadron RAF. Germany was one of the first countries to adopt the use of a camera for aerial reconnaissance, opting for a Görz, in 1913. French Military Aviation began the war with several squadrons of Bleriot observation planes, equipped with cameras for reconnaissance. The French Army developed procedures for getting prints into the hands of field commanders in record time. A German observation plane, the Rumpler Taube. The Royal Flying Corps recon pilots began to use cameras for recording their observations in 1914 and by the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in 1915 the entire system of German trenches was being photographed. The first purpose-built and practical aerial camera was invented by Captain John Moore- Brabazon in 1915 with the help of the Thornton-Pickard company, greatly enhancing the efficiency of aerial photography. The camera was inserted into the floor of the aircraft and could be triggered by the pilot at intervals. Moore-Brabazon also pioneered the incorporation of stereoscopic techniques into aerial photography, allowing the height of objects on the landscape to be discerned by comparing photographs taken at different angles. In 1916, the Austro-Hungarian Empire made vertical camera axis aerial photos above Italy for map-making. By the end of the war, aerial cameras had dramatically increased in size and focal power and were used increasingly frequently as they proved their pivotal military worth; by 1918 both sides were photographing the entire front twice a day and had taken over half a million photos since the beginning of the conflict. In January 1918, General Allenby used five Australian pilots from No. 1 Squadron AFC to photograph a area in Palestine as an aid to correcting and improving maps of the Turkish front. This was a pioneering use of aerial photography as an aid for cartography. Lieutenants Leonard Taplin, Allan Runciman Brown, H. L. Fraser, Edward Patrick Kenny, and L. W. Rogers photographed a block of land stretching from the Turkish front lines deep into their rear areas. Beginning 5 January, they flew with a fighter escort to ward off enemy fighters. Using Royal Aircraft Factory BE.12 and Martinsyde airplanes, they not only overcame enemy air attacks, but also bucked 65 mile-per-hour winds, anti-aircraft fire, and malfunctioning equipment to complete their task circa 19 January 1918. ===Second World War=== High-speed reconnaissance aircraft Sidney Cotton's Lockheed 12A, in which he made a high-speed reconnaissance flight in 1940. During 1928, the Royal Air Force (RAF) developed an electric heating system for the aerial camera; this innovation allowed reconnaissance aircraft to take pictures from very high altitudes without the camera parts freezing. In 1939, Sidney Cotton and Flying Officer Maurice Longbottom of the RAF suggested that airborne reconnaissance may be a task better suited to fast, small aircraft which would use their speed and high service ceiling to avoid detection and interception. Although this may perhaps seem obvious today with modern reconnaissance tasks performed by fast, high flying aircraft, at the time it was radical thinking. PRU Blue Spitfire PR Mk XI (PL965) was a long range, high-altitude reconnaissance variant capable of flying from airfields in England and photographing targets in Berlin. Cotton and Longbottom proposed the use of Spitfires with their armament and radios removed and replaced with extra fuel and cameras. This concept led to the development of the Spitfire PR variants. With their armaments removed, these planes could attain a maximum speed of 396 mph while flying at an altitude of 30,000 feet, and were used for photo- reconnaissance missions. The Spitfire PR was fitted with five cameras, which were heated to ensure good results (while the cockpit was not). In the reconnaissance role, the Spitfire proved to be extremely successful, resulting in numerous Spitfire variants being built specifically for that purpose. These served initially with what later became No. 1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit (PRU). Aerial reconnaissance photographs of Utah Beach prior to the D-Day landings. Other fighters were also adapted for photo-reconnaissance, including the British Mosquito and the American P-38 Lightning and P-51 Mustang. Such aircraft were painted in PRU Blue or Pink camouflage colours to make them difficult to spot in the air, and often were stripped of weapons or had engines modified for better performance at high altitudes (over 40,000 feet). The American F-4, a factory modification of the Lockheed P-38 Lightning, replaced the nose-mounted four machine guns and cannon with four high-quality K-17 cameras. Approximately 120 F-4 and F-4As were hurriedly made available by March 1942, reaching the 8th Photographic Squadron in Australia by April (the first P-38s to see action). The F-4 had an early advantage of long range and high speed combined with ability to fly at high altitude; a potent combination for reconnaissance. In the last half of 1942 Lockheed would produce 96 F-5As, based on the P-38G with all later P-38 photo-reconnaissance variants designated F-5. In its reconnaissance role, the Lightning was so effective that over 1,200 F-4 and F-5 variants were delivered by Lockheed, and it was the United States Army Air Forces's (USAAF) primary photo-reconnaissance type used throughout the war in all combat theatres. The Mustang F-6 arrived later in the conflict and, by spring 1945, became the dominant reconnaissance type flown by the USAAF in the European theatre. American photo-reconnaissance operations in Europe were centred at RAF Mount Farm, with the resulting photographs transferred to Medmenham for interpretation. Approximately 15,000 Fairchild K-20 aerial cameras were manufactured for use in Allied reconnaissance aircraft between 1941 and 1945. The British de Havilland Mosquito excelled in the photo-reconnaissance role; the converted bomber was fitted with three cameras installed in what had been the bomb bay. It had a cruising speed of 255 mph, maximum speed of 362 mph and a maximum altitude of 35,000 feet. The first converted PRU (Photo-Reconnaissance Unit) Mosquito was delivered to RAF Benson in July 1941 by Geoffrey de Havilland himself. The PR Mk XVI and later variants had pressurized cockpits and also pressurized central and inner wing tanks to reduce fuel vaporization at high altitude. The Mosquito was faster than most enemy fighters above 40,000 ft,Bowman 2005, p. 21. and could roam almost anywhere. Colonel Roy M. Stanley II of United States Air Force (USAF) stated of the aircraft: \\"I consider the Mosquito the best photo-reconnaissance aircraft of the war\\".Stanley 2010, p. 35. The United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) designation for the photo-reconnaissance Mosquito was F-8. Apart from (for example) the Mosquito, most World War II bombers were not as fast as fighters, although they were effective for aerial reconnaissance due to their long range, inherent stability in flight and capacity to carry large camera payloads. American bombers with top speeds of less than 300 mph used for reconnaissance include the B-24 Liberator (photo- reconnaissance variant designated F-7), B-25 Mitchell (F-10) and B-17 Flying Fortress (F-9). The revolutionary B-29 Superfortress was the world's largest combat-operational bomber when it appeared in 1944, with a top speed of over 350 mph which at that time was outstanding for such a large and heavy aircraft; the B-29 also had a pressurized cabin for high altitude flight. The photographic reconnaissance version of the B-29 was designated F-13 and carried a camera suite of three K-17B, two K-22 and one K-18 with provisions for others; it also retained the standard B-29 defensive armament of a dozen .50 caliber machine guns. In November 1944 an F-13 conducted the first flight by an Allied aircraft over Tokyo since the Doolittle Raid of April 1942. The Consolidated B-32 Dominator was also used for reconnaissance over Japan in August 1945. The Japanese Army Mitsubishi Ki-46, a twin-engined aircraft designed expressly for the reconnaissance role with defensive armament of 1 light machine gun, entered service in 1941. Codenamed \\"Dinah\\" this aircraft was fast, elusive and proved difficult for Allied fighters to destroy. More than 1,500 Ki-46s were built and its performance was upgraded later in the war with the Ki-46-III variant. Another purpose-designed reconnaissance aircraft for the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service was the carrier-based, single- engine Nakajima C6N Saiun (\\"Iridescent Cloud\\"). Codenamed \\"Myrt\\" by the Allies, the Nakajima C6N first flew in 1943 and was also highly elusive to American aircraft due to its excellent performance and speed of almost 400 mph. As fate would have it on 15 August 1945, a C6N1 was the last aircraft to be shot down in World War II. Japan also developed the high-altitude Tachikawa Ki-74 reconnaissance bomber, which was in a similar class of performance as the Mosquito, but only 16 were built and did not see operational service. The Luftwaffe began deploying jet aircraft in combat in 1944, and the twin-jet Arado Ar 234 Blitz (\\"Lightning\\") reconnaissance bomber was the world's first operational jet-powered bomber. The Ar 234B-1 was equipped with two Rb 50/30 or Rb 75/30 cameras, and its top speed of 460 mph allowed it to outrun the fastest non-jet Allied fighters of the time. The twin piston-engined Junkers Ju 388 high-altitude bomber was an ultimate evolution of the Ju 88 by way of the Ju 188. The photographic reconnaissance Ju 388L variant had a pressurized cockpit from the Ju 388's original multi-role conception as not only a bomber but also a night fighter and bomber destroyer, due to RLM's perceived threat of the U.S.'s high-altitude B-29 (which ended up not being deployed in Europe). Approximately 50 Ju 388Ls were produced under rapidly deteriorating conditions at the end of the war. As with other high performance weapons introduced by Nazi Germany, too many circumstances in the war's logistics had changed by late 1944 for such aircraft to have any impact. The DFS 228 was a rocket-powered high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft under development in the latter part of World War II. It was designed by Felix Kracht at the Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug (German Institute for Sailplane Flight) and in concept is an interesting precursor to the post-war American U-2, being essentially a powered long-wingspan glider intended solely for the high- altitude aerial reconnaissance role. Advanced features of the DFS 228 design included a pressurized escape capsule for the pilot. The aircraft never flew under rocket power with only unpowered glider prototypes flown prior to May 1945. Imagery analysis RAF Medmenham, where aerial reconnaissance intelligence was analysed. The collection and interpretation of aerial reconnaissance intelligence became a considerable enterprise during the war. Beginning in 1941, RAF Medmenham was the main interpretation centre for photographic reconnaissance operations in the European and Mediterranean theatres.Unlocking Buckinghamshire's Past The Central Interpretation Unit (CIU) was later amalgamated with the Bomber Command Damage Assessment Section and the Night Photographic Interpretation Section of No 3 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit, RAF Oakington, in 1942.Allied Central Interpretation Unit (ACIU) During 1942 and 1943, the CIU gradually expanded and was involved in the planning stages of practically every operation of the war, and in every aspect of intelligence. In 1945, daily intake of material averaged 25,000 negatives and 60,000 prints. Thirty-six million prints were made during the war. By VE-day, the print library, which documented and stored worldwide cover, held 5,000,000 prints from which 40,000 reports had been produced. American personnel had for some time formed an increasing part of the CIU and on 1 May 1944 this was finally recognised by changing the title of the unit to the Allied Central Interpretation Unit (ACIU). There were then over 1,700 personnel on the unit's strength. A large number of photographic interpreters were recruited from the Hollywood Film Studios including Xavier Atencio. Two renowned archaeologists also worked there as interpreters: Dorothy Garrod, the first woman to hold an Oxbridge Chair, and Glyn Daniel, who went on to gain popular acclaim as the host of the television game show Animal, Vegetable or Mineral?. Sidney Cotton's aerial photographs were far ahead of their time. Together with other members of his reconnaissance squadron, he pioneered the technique of high-altitude, high-speed photography that was instrumental in revealing the locations of many crucial military and intelligence targets. Cotton also worked on ideas such as a prototype specialist reconnaissance aircraft and further refinements of photographic equipment. At its peak, British reconnaissance flights yielded 50,000 images per day to interpret. Of particular significance in the success of the work of Medmenham was the use of stereoscopic images, using a between plate overlap of exactly 60%. Despite initial scepticism about the possibility of German rocket development, stereoscopic analysis proved its existence and major operations, including the 1943 offensives against the V-2 rocket development plant at Peenemünde, were made possible by work carried out at Medmenham. Later offensives were also made against potential launch sites at Wizernes and 96 other launch sites in northern France. Particularly important sites were measured, from the images, using Swiss stereoautograph machines made by Wild (Heerbrugg) and physical models made to facilitate understanding of what was there or what it was for. It is claimed that Medmanham's greatest operational success was Operation Crossbow which, from 23 December 1943, destroyed the V-1 infrastructure in northern France.\\"Operation Crossbow\\", BBC2, broadcast 15 May 2011 According to R.V. Jones, photographs were used to establish the size and the characteristic launching mechanisms for both the V-1 flying bomb and the V-2 rocket. ===Cold War=== Fifth Air Force photographic analyst elucidates the location of enemy flak batteries to plan attacks against enemy positions during the Korean War Immediately after the Second World War, the long range aerial reconnaissance role was quickly taken up by adapted jet bombers, such as the English Electric Canberra and its American development the Martin B-57, that were capable of flying higher or faster than enemy aircraft or defenses.Polmar 2001, p. 11.\\"FAI Canberra World Records.\\" fai.org. Retrieved 18 October 2009.Lewis 1970, p. 371. Shortly after the Korean War, the United States begun to use RB-47 aircraft; these were at first were converted B-47 bombers, but later purposely built as RB-47 reconnaissance aircraft that had no bombing capability. Large cameras were mounted in the plane's belly and a truncated bomb bay was used for carrying photoflash bombs. Later versions of the RB-47, such as the RB-47H, were extensively modified for signals intelligence (ELINT), with additional equipment operator crew stations in the bomb bay; unarmed weather reconnaissance WB-47s with cameras and meteorological instruments also served the United States Air Force (USAF) during the 1960s.\\"RB-47E USSR Overflights by the 91st SRW.\\" The Cold War Museum.

The onset of the Cold War led to development of several highly specialized and clandestine strategic reconnaissance aircraft, or spy planes, such as the Lockheed U-2 and its successor the SR-71 Blackbird (both from the United States). Flying these aircraft became an exceptionally demanding task, with crews specially selected and trained due to the aircraft's extreme performance characteristics in addition to risk of being captured as spies. The American U-2 shot down in Soviet airspace and capture of its pilot caused political turmoil at the height of the Cold War.Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 170–177. Beginning in the early 1960s, United States aerial and satellite reconnaissance was coordinated by the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO). Risks such as loss or capture of reconnaissance aircraft crewmembers also contributed to U.S. development of the Ryan Model 147 RPV (Remotely Piloted Vehicle) unmanned drone aircraft which were partly funded by the NRO during the 1960s. During the 1960s, the United States Navy opted to convert many of its supersonic carrier-based nuclear bomber, the North American A-5 Vigilante, into the capable RA-5C Vigilante reconnaissance aircraft. Beginning in the early 1980s, the U.S. Navy outfitted and deployed Grumman F-14 Tomcat aircraft in one squadron aboard an aircraft carrier with a system called Tactical Airborne Reconnaissance Pod System (TARPS), which provided naval aerial reconnaissance capability until the Tomcat's retirement in 2006.Donald, David. \\"Northrop Grumman F-14 Tomcat, U.S. Navy today\\". Warplanes of the Fleet. London: AIRtime Publishing Inc, 2004. . ===Post Cold War=== Since the 1980s, there has been an increasing tendency for militaries to rely upon assets other than manned aircraft to perform aerial reconnaissance. Alternative platforms include the use of surveillance satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), such as the armed MQ-9 Reaper. By 2005, such UAVs could reportedly be equipped with compact cameras capable of identifying an object the size of a milk carton from altitudes of 60,000 feet. The U-2 has repeatedly been considered for retirement in favour of drones.Butler, Amy and David A Fulghum. \\"USAF not ready to retire the U-2.\\" . Aviation Week, 26 August 2008.

During the 2010s, American defense conglomerate Lockheed Martin promoted its proposal to develop a hypersonic UAV, which it referred to the SR-72 in allusion to its function as a spiritual successor to the retired SR-71 Blackbird.. The company has also developed several other reconnaissance UAVs, such as the Lockheed Martin RQ-170 Sentinel. ==TechnologiesMiniature UAVs=== Due to the low cost of miniature UAVs, this technology brings aerial reconnaissance into the hands of soldiers on the ground. The soldier on the ground can both control the UAV and see its output, yielding great benefit over a disconnected approach. With small systems being man packable, operators are now able to deploy air assets quickly and directly. The low cost and ease of operation of these miniature UAVs has enabled forces such as the Libyan Rebels to use miniature UAVs.

Developments in miniature electronics have fueled the development of increasingly capable surveillance payloads, allowing miniature UAVs to provide high levels of capability in never before seen packages. ===Reconnaissance pods=== Reconnaissance pods can be carried by fighter-bomber aircraft. Examples include the British Digital Joint Reconnaissance Pod (DJRP); Chinese KZ900; UK RAPTOR; and the US Navy's F-14 Tomcat Tactical Airborne Reconnaissance Pod System (TARPS). Some aircraft made for non-military applications also have reconnaissance pods, i.e. the Qinetiq Mercator. ==See also== * Aerial photography * Imagery intelligence * Surveillance aircraft * Spatial reconnaissance * United States aerial reconnaissance of the Soviet Union * List of United States Air Force reconnaissance aircraft ==ReferencesCitations=Bibliography=== * Bowman, Martin. de Havilland Mosquito (Crowood Aviation series).

In 2001, they played as the opener for Italian band Rhapsody. In January 2001, after the completion of these tours, the band returned to the recording studio. They performed work with narrations and epic stories influenced by the Baroque and Classic romantic style. At the beginning of 2002, two new members came to the band: Gabriel Hidalgo on guitar and Mauricio Nader on bass. With this new formation, the band enhanced its acoustic sound. They released their first album, Dead Kings of the Unholy Valley, in July 2002. In 2003, they began to work on their second album, The Secrets Of An Island. This was a conceptual work about the mythological history of Chiloé Island. The songs on this album used choirs, folk instruments, and was influenced by ethnic Chilean music. Six Magics started then and continued to mix ard rock with a Latin American traditional beat in a style called Folk Metal. Their concerts became larger and more decorated productions and began to attract larger audiences. At one point, singer Sergio Domínguez fell ill and was temporarily replaced by Cristóbal Flores. In 2004, the band flew to Germany, France, and Spain to promote their new albums and tour and is well received. Pianist Sebastián Carrasco left in 2005, and the band decided not to replace him and instead become a quintet. They then prepared a film of their work, entitled Dead Secrets, to be shown at the Theater Province. The DVD was delayed due to technical difficulties and was not resolved until the end of the year, so instead of being shown at the theater was released straight to DVD. In January 2007, Six Magics began work on their third album. The production is directed by the North American David Prater (Dream Theater, FireHouse, Fahrenheit). In May of the 2007, Sergio Domínguez decided to leave the band to spend more time with his family and his upcoming son. On June 26, 2008, they released a single called Behind the Sorrow ahead of their third album, Animal, which was released in August, on September they played with Tarja Turunen. In 2006, they released “Dead Secrets”, their first live DVD containing songs from their two previous albums. After the DVDs release, the decision was made to immediately record a third record with the legendary multi- platinum producer David Prater. His groundbreaking work with Dream Theater on two of their most successful recordings, “Images and Words” and “A Change Of Seasons”, established Prater as perhaps the most sought after producer in all of modern progressive rock. His rich track record also contains an impressive list of best selling mainstream rock artists from the last twenty years (Firehouse, Arcade, Nightranger, Stephen Pearcy, etc.). The álbum was called “Behind the Sorrow” and was released by the Italian label Coroner Records From a creative standpoint, Six Magics has experienced a remarkable growth spurt over the last years beginning with the decision to enlist the services of Prater and continuing with the arrival of Elizabeth Vasquez, the band’s new lead vocalist. The decision to break new ground in a changing musical landscape by bringing her brooding, sultry voice to the foreground of the group’s sound signals a courageous sense of adventure sorely needed in a field dominated by faceless male counterparts. In 2010, to support the new record Behind the Sorrow, Six Magics launched a European tour that kept the musicians on the road for nearly two months. They played in different countries including Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Netherlands and Turkey. In 2011, Six Magics started working on their next studio album. Six Magics also played in Chile at The Metal Fest, the first version of a Chilean festival in which bands like Testament, Blind Guardian, Anthrax, UDO among others were headliners. In July 2012, the new material of the band entitled Falling Angels was released in Europe, Chile, Japan and US. ==MembersCurrent=== * Elizabeth Vásquez (Vocals) * Erick Avila (Guitar) * Pablo Proharam (Guitar) * Pablo Stagnaro (Drums) ===Past=== * Juan Pablo Pizarro (Bass) * Sergio Villarroel (Vocals) * [Sergio Domínguez (Vocals) * Rodolfo Sánchez (Bass) * M.Nader (Bass) * Gabriel Hidalgo (Guitar) * Sebastian Carrasco (Keyboard) ==DiscographyAlbums=== *Trilogía de un guerrero (1996) *Dead Kings Of The Unholy Valley (2001) *The Secrets Of An Island (2003) *Animal (2008) *Behind the Sorrow (2010) *Falling Angels (2012) ===Singles=== *\\"Behind The Sorrow\\" (2008) ===DVD=== *Dead Secret (2006) ==References *Six Magics - Official Site Category:Musical groups established in 1996 Category:Chilean heavy metal musical groups Category:Power metal musical groups ","title":"Six Magics"},{"id":"20338650","text":"Adrián Colunga Pérez (born 17 November 1984) is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a striker and last played for FC Goa in the Indian Super League. He appeared in 152 La Liga matches over seven seasons, scoring a combined 36 goals for Recreativo, Zaragoza, Getafe, Sporting de Gijón and Granada. He added 54 games and 17 goals in Segunda División, and also competed professionally in England, Cyprus and India. ==Club career== Colunga was born in Oviedo, Asturias. After unsuccessfully emerging through Sporting de Gijón's youth system he made his professional debut on loan, in the third division with Marino de Luanco – also in his native region – going on to serve several others in the third and fourth levels while also appearing in the 2004–05 season for Sporting's reserves. In January 2006, Colunga was definitely released by Gijón and, after a spell in the fourth division and another in the third, joined UD Las Palmas of the second tier. He scored 13 league goals (second-best in the squad) in the 2007–08 campaign for a Canary Islands' side that was threatened with relegation until the last month of competition. Colunga was then bought by Recreativo de Huelva in La Liga, in a four-year contract worth €2.7 million. In his debut for the team, on 31 August 2008, he netted the game's only goal in an away win against Andalusia neighbours Real Betis. Alternating between starts and games from the bench during his first year, Colunga entered the club's history when he scored a penalty kick in a 1–4 loss at Deportivo de La Coruña on 21 December, his fourth consecutive game achieving the feat. Spanish football pundit Guillem Balagué compared the player, in his weekly report of first division encounters, to Valencia CF's David Villa; despite a first fruitful year individually, Recre ranked last. On 23 January 2010, after experiencing personal problems in the new season at Recreativo, which included a confrontation with club fans, Colunga was loaned to Real Zaragoza in the top flight, until June. He scored on his debut eight days later, a 3–1 win at CD Tenerife, and finished the campaign as the team's top scorer in only four months of play, with the Aragonese finally escaping relegation. On 5 August 2010, Colunga was sold to Getafe CF as Kepa Blanco moved in the opposite direction. He was loaned to Sporting de Gijón in January 2012, netting three times in 13 starts during his short spell but suffering top flight relegation. On 25 August 2014, Colunga transferred to English club Brighton & Hove Albion for an undisclosed fee, signing a two-year contract. He scored on his debut the following day, contributing to a 4–2 away victory over Swindon Town in the League Cup; he added a further three in the Championship before the close of the year, with strikes against Bournemouth (2–3 away loss), Norwich City (3–3, away) and Fulham (2–0 win, away). Following the appointment of Chris Hughton as new manager, Colunga found first-team opportunities difficult and, in the very last day of the 2015 January transfer window, joined Granada CF on a loan deal lasting until the end of the season, with the option of a permanent transfer in June. However, after featuring rarely, he returned to Brighton and eventually had his contract terminated by mutual consent on 7 October. On 2 September 2017, 32-year-old Colunga switched to the Indian Super League with FC Goa after stints with RCD Mallorca and Cypriot club Anorthosis Famagusta FC. He made his debut on 16 December, scoring in the last minutes of a 5–1 victory against Delhi Dynamos FC. On 25 January 2018, Colunga's contract was terminated by mutual agreement after he refused to play second-fiddle to compatriot Ferran Corominas. Four days later, he announced his retirement. ==Career statisticsClub=== {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Other !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=\\"1\\"Marino (loan) 2002–03 Segunda División B 5000colspan=\\"2\\"—50 - Marino (loan) 2005–06 Segunda División B 14200colspan=\\"2\\"—142 - Pájara Playas (loan) 2006–07 Segunda División B 371000223912 - Las Palmas 2007–08 Segunda División 331330colspan=\\"2\\"—3613 - rowspan=\\"3\\"Recreativo 2008–09 La Liga 33910colspan=\\"2\\"—349 - 2009–10 Segunda División 13210colspan=\\"2\\"—142 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !46!!11!!2!!0!!colspan=\\"2\\"—!!48!!11 - Zaragoza (loan) 2009–10 La Liga 16700colspan=\\"2\\"—167 - rowspan=\\"5\\"Getafe 2010–11 La Liga 2971070377 - 2011–12 La Liga 4020colspan=\\"2\\"—60 - 2012–13 La Liga 22620colspan=\\"2\\"—246 - 2013–14 La Liga 27441colspan=\\"2\\"—315 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !82!!17!!9!!1!!7!!0!!98!!18 - rowspan=\\"1\\"Sporting Gijón (loan) 2011–12 La Liga 17300colspan=\\"2\\"—173 - rowspan=\\"1Brighton & Hove Albion 2014–15 Championship 17341colspan=\\"2\\"—214 - Granada (loan) 2014–15 La Liga 4000colspan=\\"2\\"—40 - rowspan=\\"3\\"Mallorca 2015–16 Segunda División 7200colspan=\\"2\\"—72 - 2016–17 Segunda División 1000colspan=\\"2\\"—10 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !8!!2!!0!!0!!colspan=\\"2\\"—!!8!!2 - Anorthosis 2016–17 Cypriot First Division 18121colspan=\\"2\\"—202 - Goa 2017–18 Indian Super League 21colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—21 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Career total !299!!70!!20!!3!!9!!2!!328!!75 } ==ReferencesCategory:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Oviedo Category:Spanish footballers Category:Asturian footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:La Liga players Category:Segunda División players Category:Segunda División B players Category:Tercera División players Category:Sporting de Gijón B players Category:Marino de Luanco footballers Category:UC Ceares players Category:UD Las Palmas players Category:Recreativo de Huelva players Category:Real Zaragoza players Category:Getafe CF footballers Category:Sporting de Gijón players Category:Granada CF footballers Category:RCD Mallorca players Category:English Football League players Category:Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. players Category:Cypriot First Division players Category:Anorthosis Famagusta FC players Category:Indian Super League players Category:FC Goa players Category:Spanish expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in England Category:Expatriate footballers in Cyprus Category:Expatriate footballers in India Category:Spanish expatriate sportspeople in England Category:Spanish expatriate sportspeople in Cyprus Category:Spanish expatriate sportspeople in India ","title":"Adrián Colunga"},{"id":"20338652","text":"Dancemaker is a 1998 American documentary film directed by Matthew Diamond about the career of choreographer Paul Taylor.

Conley raised $1 million in 1987 to buy the decrepit Phoenix Hotel in San Francisco's Tenderloin neighborhood, where he opened the landmark restaurant Miss Pearl's Jam House with Joey Altman. Conley modeled the name after Esprit, the clothing company then based in San Francisco. Initially targeting traveling rock bands, musicians, and filmmakers, Conley met with travel agents throughout the United States, modeled the hotel's concept after Rolling Stone Magazine, and offered tour managers free massages to induce them to book their bands' stays at the Phoenix. A popular but not financial success, the hotel began to attract nationally known entertainers such as David Bowie, Linda Ronstadt, and Johnny Depp, even though the hotel was essentially a low-budget 1950s era motel. With support from investors, Conley bought a series of moderately sized, often run- down buildings, which he turned at low cost into boutique hotels, in each case creating a different \\"psychographic\\" concept such as new age wellness, men's health, romance novels, New Yorker Magazine, or luxury camping. The Phoenix Hotel during a party in 2006 The company, which had been based in San Francisco, suffered a substantial downturn after 9/11 and the dot com crash, which affected San Francisco more than most other hospitality markets. With 22 capital calls from investors and cuts in executive salaries, the company survived and, rather than closing poorly performing properties or laying off staff, took advantage of lower commercial real estate prices to expand throughout California. The company also began to take over and control its hotel restaurants to reduce risk. the company owns more than 30 hotels, manages 6 others, and operates 18 restaurants, all within California. Among the most famous is the Ventana Inn in Big Sur, California. The Hotel Vitale, on San Francisco's waterfront, is the first hotel the company built, rather than bought from a previous owner. * * The company also expanded into managing hotels and condominium amenities for other owners.

In 2010, a majority stake of Joie de Vivre was purchased by Geolo Capital, the private equity firm founded by Hyatt Hotels heir John Pritzker. A $150 million fund to acquire additional hotels was established as part of the deal, with plans to acquire $300 million to $500 million in hotels over a three-to-five-year period.

During this time he studied theology and graduated with BA degree from Durham University in 1984. ==Ordained ministry== Sinclair was ordained in the Church of England: made a deacon at Petertide 1984 (1 July) and ordained a priest the Petertide following (30 June 1985) – both times by Hugh Montefiore, Bishop of Birmingham, at Birmingham Cathedral. From 1984 to 1988, he served his curacy at Christ Church, Summerfield in the Diocese of Birmingham. He was additionally a part-time chaplain at the Birmingham Children's Hospital.

Greylek is assigned to the Special Victims Unit as a permanent replacement of ADA Casey Novak (Diane Neal), who after the events that occurred in \\"Cold\\", has been censured. In D.C. Greylek is nicknamed \\"The Crusader\\", where she has dealt \\"with the policy making side of sex crimes\\" and moves to Manhattan's SVU \\"to make a difference\\". ==Character within SVU== Introduced in the tenth season premiere episode \\"Trials\\", Greylek maintains an unrelenting reputation unpopular with the detectives; she threatens to charge a defendant with a hate crime for raping two women and has a teenage boy charged with assaulting a police officer so he can be tested for HIV. Further, her hands-on approach in accompanying the detectives is at odds with Detective Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni), who does not believe he is able to do his job with Greylek looking over his shoulder. In the episode \\"Babes\\", Greylek angers a woman believed to be involved with a young girl's suicide, but she was found not guilty. After gloating about her innocence, the woman physically attacks Greylek in the courtroom for correcting her about being \\"innocent\\" and to wash the blood off her hands before holding her daughter's baby. When the officers pull the woman off her, Greylek tells Stabler to charge her with assault. However, Greylek has shown a softer side; warning Stabler to get a good defense attorney for his daughter Kathleen (Allison Siko), in the episode \\"Swing\\". Kathleen, who has bipolar disorder, is charged with breaking & entering in conjunction with theft, and the DA's office will prosecute her. In the episode \\"Smut\\", Greylek successfully prosecutes serial rapist Eric Lutz (Michael Trucco), who claims that his actions were caused by violent pornography; Graylek tracks down Lutz's former fiancée, whom he also raped, and gets her to testify that Lutz does not use pornography and is simply violent by nature. Greylek also seeks justice when a man is brutally beaten outside a strip club, with the man's ex-wife and 13-year-old transgender daughter Hailey (Bridger Zadina) as the prime suspects, in the episode \\"Transitions\\". Before the case gets to trial, detectives Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Stabler discover that it was Haley's guidance counselor who committed the crime. During the trial, Greylek uncovers that the guidance counselor is also a transgender woman and that is why she tried to help Haley. The character is written out in episode \\"Lead\\", during the middle of a trial where pediatrician Gilbert Keppler (Lawrence Arancio) is found guilty of molesting his patients. Greylek is last seen doing a press conference with Captain Don Cragen (Dann Florek), Benson, and Stabler on the steps of the courthouse. When the doctor's attorney hands the SVU squad a lawsuit, Greylek responds, \\"What did you people do?\\". Later in the episode, Benson and Stabler discover the doctor murdered in his home. The detectives hold CSU out of the house until Cragen and Greylek get to the scene in case IAB wants to \\"screw with\\" them again. Sergeant John Munch (Richard Belzer) asks if they are sure Greylek isn't on one of her I need to be at the crime scene' crusades again\\", when Detective Fin Tutuola (Ice-T) realises \\"It's not Greylek\\" and they all see ADA Alexandra Cabot (Stephanie March) walk up to the scene with Cragen. Cabot tells the detectives that the Justice Department called Greylek back to D.C. and that District Attorney Jack McCoy (Sam Waterston) let her leave immediately. ==Development== After the departure of Diane Neal, who portrayed ADA Casey Novak from the fifth to ninth season of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, Michaela McManus was approached to replace her. McManus, who departed One Tree Hill for the role, was cast as a series regular in the capacity of Assistant District Attorney. On the casting, creator and executive producer of SVU Dick Wolf claimed, \\"We look forward to [McManus] working with Neal [Baer], Ted [Kotcheff] and me to create another interesting and memorable character in the Law & Order universe\\". The character was originally to be named \\"Polly Sturges\\", according to McManus. Then-SVU showrunner Neal Baer instead chose to name the character \\"Kim Greylek\\"; \\"Kim\\" after American actress Kim Novak (who also inspired the name of SVU character Casey Novak) and \\"Greylek\\" after Novak's character in the 1955 film 5 Against the House. In the series, Greylek departs to D.C. in the fifteenth episode \\"Lead\\" and is replaced by Cabot (March) in a recurring capacity (while McManus continued to appear in the opening credits for the rest of the season). However, In April 2009, it was confirmed by TV Guide that McManus would not be returning to SVU, with no response from NBC as to why she departed.

Benfica as a forward. ==Club career== Born in Lisbon, Portugal, Semedo started his senior career with local amateurs C.F. Benfica, signing for neighbouring Odivelas F.C. in 2001. After stellar performances with the latter in the third division (18 goals in 29 matches in the 2007–08 season), he attracted attention from Primeira Liga clubs, eventually joining Rio Ave FC. In his first appearance in the competition, on 24 August 2008, he scored in a 1–1 home draw against S.L. Benfica. Semedo moved to Cyprus in January 2009, teaming up with several Portuguese players at APOP Kinyras FC. In May 2010, after two solid seasons – including 22 First Division goals in the 2009–10 campaign, competition best – he stayed in the country, signing with cup holders Apollon Limassol. On 7 September 2013, Semedo joined Albanian Superliga side KF Tirana on a free transfer. He made his debut for the club on 29 September, playing 55 minutes in a 2–0 away defeat to KF Teuta Durrës. He scored his first goal of the season four days later, in a 1–0 victory over KS Kastrioti in which his team returned to winning ways after three consecutive losses; late into the month, in another game that finished with the same scoreline, he netted against KF Bylis Ballsh at Selman Stërmasi Stadium. In December 2013, Semedo made his Albanian Cup debut with Tirana, appearing in a two-legged tie against KF Lushnja and featuring respectively 80 and 44 minutes in an eventual second round exit. He was released in the winter transfer window, scoring twice in 11 competitive appearances. ==International career== Although Portuguese-born, Semedo opted to represent Cape Verde internationally, starting in the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying stage. His debut occurred on 11 October 2008 in that competition, and he scored in a 1–3 loss in Tanzania. Two years later, on 24 May 2010, Semedo won his second and last cap, against his birth country Portugal, coming on as a 25th-minute substitute in a goalless draw in Covilhã. ===International goals=== :Scores and results list Cape Verde's goal tally first. {  - ! # !!

The strategy aimed to enforce Arctic sovereignty with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canadian Coast Guard. CFDS was superseded by the defence policy of the Liberal Government introduced in 2017 entitled, Strong, Secure and Engaged (the SSE). ==Purpose== The purpose of the Canada First Defence Strategy was to give Canada a modern military with clearly defined missions and capabilities. The strategy focused on many key military functions and operations and on improving the equipment and fleets that the Canadian Forces operates. Many of the equipment capability objectives of CFDS were continued under the subsequent SSE. ===Missions=== The Canada First Defence Strategy was focused on six core missions as level of ambition for the Canadian Forces. According to the strategy the forces must be able to support all of the following operations and if necessary, support them all simultaneously. * Conduct daily domestic and continental operations, including in the Arctic and through NORAD. * Support a major international event in Canada, such as the 2010 Winter Olympics. * Respond to a major terrorist attack. * Support civilian authorities during a crisis in Canada such as a natural disaster. * Lead and/or conduct a major international operation for an extended period. * Deploy forces in response to crises elsewhere in the world for shorter periods. ===Personnel=== The Canada First Defence Strategy also sought to increase the number of personnel in the Canadian Forces in order to improve the military's operational effectiveness. In 2008, the Canadian Forces had approximately 65,000 active personnel and 26,000 reserve personnel. However, the CFDS planned to increase personnel levels to 70,000 full-time and 30,000 reserve (mix of full- and part-time) sometime in the next 20 years, with an increase to 67,000 full-time personnel by 2009/2010, 68,000 by 2011/2012 and 69,300 by 2014/2015. The reserves (combined full- and part-time) were to reach 27,000 by 2011/2012 and 28,000 by 2014/2015. Some of this growth was slowed in the aftermath of the end of Canadian involvement in the war in Afghanistan. ==Equipment improvement and replacement== The CFDS provided a plan to invest $15 billion on the improvement and replacement of Canadian Forces' major fleets and equipment, to include: * C-17 Globemaster aircraft -Final delivery in 2015 * C-130J Hercules aircraft -Final delivery in 2013 * Arctic Patrol Ship Project -Contract awarded January 2015 - steel cut starting September 2015 * CH-47F Chinook helicopters -Final delivery 2013 * Trucks * Joint Support Ship Project -Contract to be awarded with construction beginning in 2016; though preliminary work on the lead ship modules actually only commenced in 2018. Another $20 billion was committed for equipment replacement and improvement in the future, to include: * fixed wing search and rescue aircraft - contract awarded in 2016 for 16 C-295 aircraft * destroyers and frigates - construction of the future Canadian Surface Combatant was a core component of CFDS but start dated pushed back; construction of the lead ship is now expected to begin in 2023 following on the Arctic Offshore Patrol Ship program. * maritime patrol aircraft -Upgrades planned on 14 Aurora aircraft to keep them flying until 2030 * 65 new next generation fighter aircraft to replace the CF-18 Hornets as the primary air superiority fighter - initial first delivery originally expected in 2013; delayed thereafter (under SSE contract now not expected until at least 2022 though envisaged numbers increased to 88). * land combat vehicles and systems - Ongoing procurement throughout the timespan of the CFDS ==Funding== The Canada First Defence Strategy was also primarily focused on the funding for the Canadian Forces, and the strategy outlined plans to increase funding for the Canadian Forces from $18 billion in 2007–2008 to over $30 billion in 2027–2028. The overall funding and investments in the forces will amount to $490 billion over the 20-year period of the strategy. This projected spending increase was slowed by the Harper government after the end of the war in Afghanistan. ==See also== *Canadian Forces *Joint Support Ship Project *Arctic Patrol Ship Project *Department of National Defence == References == Category:Canadian Armed Forces ","title":"Canada First Defence Strategy"},{"id":"20338871","text":"Émile Garabiol (1877–1961) was a French engineer. ==Early life== Garabiol was born in the small town of Le Grand Lemps in France.Article from Le Dauphiné Libéré, 1961 and personal archives from the Garabiol family He was one of the first to attend the École Nationale ProfessionnelleCreated by decree July 9, 1881ENP (National Professional School) of Voiron in 1889, a small city 20 miles from Grenoble.

The more popular species from the eastern areas, such as Titanopsis calcarea, fulleri and luederitzii are adapted to summer rainfall, while those from further west, rarer species such as Titanopsis schwantesii and hugo-schlecteri, are adapted to winter rainfall, when they also flower. The plants are calcicole (=they appreciate calcareous soils), but any typical loose succulent soil mix is suitable. Division of larger clumps is possible in some cases, but as most species have tuberous rootstocks and offset slowly, seed production is the most common method of propagation. ==References Category:Aizoaceae Category:Aizoaceae genera ","title":"Titanopsis"},{"id":"20338880","text":"CBS Reports is the umbrella title used for documentaries by CBS News which aired starting in 1959 through the 1990s. The series sometimes aired as a wheel series rotating with 60 Minutes (or other similar CBS News series), as a series of its own, or as specials. The program aired as a constant series from 1959 to 1971. ==Origin== CBS Reports premiered on October 27, 1959.Brooks, Tim & Marsh, Earle. (1979). The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows 1946–Present. Ballantine Books, p. 95. It was intended to be a successor to Edward R. Murrow's influential See It Now, which had ended 15 months prior, and employed several members of the See It Now production staff. For the remainder of 1959 and through 1960, CBS Reports was broadcast on an irregular basis as a series of specials. The network gave CBS Reports a regular primetime slot in January 1961, at 10 p.m. (EST) on Thursdays. That placed it against two \\"tremendously popular\\" established shows, The Untouchables on ABC and Sing Along With Mitch on NBC.Harding, Henry. (1962, April 28-May 4). For The Record. TV Guide, New York State Edition, p. 14-1. Consequently, CBS Reports was pre-empted by a high number of CBS affiliates that aired local programming in its timeslot. When the networks announced their Fall 1962 schedules, Sing Along With Mitch and The Untouchables had been moved from the Thursday 10 p.m. timeslot. However, CBS also decided to move CBS Reports to Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. (EST), explaining that \\"the earlier hour will permit more young people to watch the program.\\" But that move again put the program up against two \\"consistent rating leaders,\\" The Virginian on NBC and Wagon Train on ABC. CBS Reports continued to lead the network's Wednesday primetime line-up until Fall 1965, when the network placed Lost In Space in the 7:30 p.m. Wednesday timeslot and moved CBS Reports to Tuesday at 10 p.m., opposite The Fugitive on ABC and NBC's Tuesday Night at the Movies.Brooks, Tim & Marsh, Earle.

The Council established a United Nations Operation in Somalia I with an immediate deployment of 50 observers in the capital Mogadishu to monitor the ceasefire. The Council went on to establish, in principle, a security force under the direction of the newly created post, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in Somalia, and requested further consultations on the proposed force. It also asked the Secretary-General to facilitate an immediate cessation of hostilities and an observance of a ceasefire throughout the country to promote the process of reconciliation and to provide humanitarian aid. The resolution also welcomed the efforts of the Arab League, Organisation of African Unity and Organisation of the Islamic Conference in Somalia and called for a conference with the aforementioned, the Secretary-General and factions in Somalia. Resolution 751 also established a Committee of the Security Council to oversee a general and complete arms embargo against Somalia, including seeking information from individual states on measures taken by them and making recommendations on improving the effectiveness of the embargo and with states that violate it. It ended by calling for co-operation at all levels to find a peaceful settlement in the country. The embargo has been varied by Security Council resolutions over the years to allow journalists to import flak jackets and helmets for their personal use and for the African Union to establish an armed presence. A Panel of Experts to investigate the lack of success of the arms embargo was set up in 2002. Its report resulted in the establishment of a Monitoring Group. The Monitoring Group report detailed numerous shipments of arms, sometimes with the help of pirates or sourced from government stockpiles in nearby countries. Donor money has been found to have funded the imports. In 2008, the embargo was in relation to nations and the International Maritime Organization providing technical assistance to Somalia upon their request to enhance the capacity to ensure coastal and maritime security, including combating piracy off the Somali coast. ==See also== * History of Somalia * List of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 701 to 800 (1991–1993) * Somali Civil War ==References * *Text of the Resolution at undocs.org 0751 Category:1992 in Somalia Category:United Nations Security Council sanctions regimes 0751 Category:April 1992 events ","title":"United Nations Security Council Resolution 751"},{"id":"20339056","text":"The R-29RMU Sineva (, lit. \\"blueness\\"), code RSM-54, is a Russian liquid- fueled submarine-launched ballistic missile with GRAU index 3M27, designation SS-N-23A Skiff. It can carry four warheads and is designed to be launched from Delta IV class submarines, which are armed with 16 missiles each. As of 2017, there are 96 launchers deployed on the submarines. The first full-range test was reportedly conducted on October 11, 2008; the reported range was 11,547 kilometers (7,174 miles). The R-29RMU entered service in 2007 and is expected to remain in service until at least 2030. Current plans call for the construction of approximately 100 such missiles.Missile balistique Sineva: tir de test réussi, RIAN, 2010-03-04 The Sineva missile has reportedly been modified into R-29RMU2 Layner missile as of 2012. ==Background== At its height in 1984, the Soviet Navy conducted over 100 SSBN patrols. The Russian Navy declined during the 1990s, with no SSBN patrols carried out in 2001–2002. The development of the Sineva is part of a program tasked with \\"preventing the weakening of Russia's nuclear deterrent.\\" The R-29RMU Sineva is seen as a rival to the solid propellant Bulava SLBM. Originally, the Russian Navy was slated to receive the Sineva missile in 2002, but the first test was conducted only in 2004. The missile was eventually commissioned in 2007. The missile was reported to carry new nuclear warheads. ==TestingInitial launch failures=== Failed Sineva test launches took place during the strategic command exercise “Security-2004” (held 10–18 February 2004), which also included the launch of a Molniya communication satellite and an R-36 missile. The launch failures involving nuclear submarines Novomoskovsk and Karelia may have been caused by a military satellite blocking the launch signal; this incident did not lead to any serious consequences for the K-407 Novomoskovsk strategic nuclear submarine. March 1, 2004 saw then Russian president Vladimir Putin instructing the acting defence minister to carry out an investigation in order to determine the reason of the launch failures of the three RSM-54 missiles in mid-February. ===Successful launches=== 17 March 2004 saw Novomoskovsk nuclear submarine of the Russian Northern Fleet perform a successful launch of the RSM-54 Sineva. The missile’s two warheads reportedly hit their targets. President Vladimir Putin and Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov observed a successful test launch of the Sineva missile from the SSBN Yekaterinburg. Further successful launches were conducted by K-84 Yekaterinburg on 8 September 2006. The missile was launched from an ice- covered polar region toward the Chizha test site at the Kanin Peninsula. The three warheads were reported to have successfully reached their targets. Another successful launch was performed on 4 March 2010 from the Barents Sea. This was followed by more launches on 6 August 2010, when a K-114 Tula fired two missiles towards the Kura Test Range. Two more launches were carried out on 20 May 2011 and 27 July 2011, both successful. On 8 May 2014, Sineva has been successfully tested during a large nuclear exercise personally supervised by President Vladimir Putin. On 5 November 2014, Tula submarine hit targets at the Kura Test Range firing from the Barents Sea. The 27th underwater launch occurred on 12 December 2015; the Russian Ministry of Defence shared video on official YouTube site, and major Russian news channels. Another successful launch was conducted on 12 October 2016 and one more on 24 August 2019.https://sputniknews.com/military/201908241076626058-russia-test-launches- submarine-based-ballistic-missiles-bulava-sineva/ ==Operators== ; *Russian Navy ==See also== * R-29 Vysota * R-29RM Shtil * R-29RMU2 Layner * RSM-56 Bulava * Kanyon * UGM-133 Trident II * M45 (missile) * M51 (missile) * JL-1 * JL-2 * K Missile family * Pukkuksong-1 * R-39 Rif * R-39M ==ReferencesExternal sources== *CSIS Missile Threat - SS-N-23 == External links == Category:Submarine-launched ballistic missiles of Russia Category:Makeyev Rocket Design Bureau ","title":"R-29RMU Sineva"},{"id":"20339075","text":" BNS Sahayak (Bengali - \\"helper\\") is a Fleet Replenishment Ship of the Bangladesh Navy, currently assigned to support anti-piracy operations. ==Career== The Sahayak is currently moored at Chittagong, serving with the Commodore Commanding BN Flotilla (COMBAN).

He served an apprenticeship as a printer and took art lessons in the evenings. He won a place at the Royal Academy in 1892 but was unable to take it up due to lack of finances. The first full book he illustrated was Robert Louis Stevenson's A Child's Garden of Verses (1895) which includes over 100 pen and ink drawings. It was extremely popular, going through many reprints, and generated numerous commissions. He illustrated many fairy tales and children's books throughout his career, including Eugene Field's Lullaby Land (1897), W. E. Cule's Child Voices (1899), Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué's Sintram and His Companions (1900), Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1907), Grimm's Fairy Tales (1910), Frances Hodgson Burnett's The Secret Garden (1911), and books written by Walter Copeland Jerrold and himself.

Davis (1999) The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Management and Encyclopedic Dictionaries, The Blackwell Encyclopedic Dictionary of Management Information Systems. p. 173 although initial work on BSP began during the early 1970s. BSP was later sold to organizations.Antonia Albani, Joseph Barjis, Jan L.G. Dietz eds.

BSP was a new approach to IA;John Zachman 1982. \\"Business Systems Planning and Business Information Control Study: A comparisment. In: IBM Systems Journal, vol 21, no 3, 1982. p. 31-53. In this 1982 article John Zachman explains: :Business Systems Planning (BSP) and Business Information Control Study (BICS) are two information system planning study methodologies that specifically employ enterprise analysis techniques in the course of their analyses. Underlying the BSP and BICS analyses are the data management problems that results in systems design approaches that optimize the management of technology at the expense of managing the data. its goals are to: * Understand issues and opportunities with current applications * Develop future technology supporting the enterprise * Provide executives with direction and a decision-making framework for IT expenditures * Provide information systems (IS) with a developmental blueprint The result of a BSP project is a technology roadmap aligning investments and business strategy. BSP comprises 15 steps, which are classified into three sections by function. ==PreparationStudy authorization=== The essential first step in BSP is to obtain authorization for the study from management or an interested department. A number of roles must agree on the purpose and range of the study: * Managing director ** May be a sponsor or team leader ** Verifies and approves study results * Sponsor ** Provides financial support * Team leader ** Chooses team members (four to seven people) ** Coordinates activities ** Documents and implements study (usually longer than eight weeks) ** Presents results to management * Team member ** Usually a department head ** Analyzes and determines organizational information needs ** Recommends future IS content ** Presents results to management * Secretary ** Documents study ** Assists team leader ===Preparation=== The second step is the team leader's study preparation. Its goal is to: * Set timeframe * Obtain documents * Choose managers to interview * Procure meeting and interview space * Inform team members of: ** Organizational functions ** Organizational data-processing level A product of this step is a lead study book with the above information, a study schedule, IT documents and diagrams. ===Beginning=== At the first meeting of the study, the sponsor explains the purpose and expected results of the study; the team leader presents the study plan, and the IT manager describes the current state and the role of IS in the organization. ==Analysis== The analysis is the most important part of BSP. The team searches for an appropriate organizational structure as it defines business strategy, processes and data classesBusiness Systems Planning (IBM Corporation), paper 2. Robinson College of Business, Georgia State University. and analyzes current information support. ===Strategy=== This step define strategic targets and how to achieve them within the organization: * Adaptating to the customer´s desires * Centrally-planned reservations, stock, payments * Improvements in checking in, shipping, presentation, advertising, partner relations and stock management * New customers * Noise reduction * Paperless processes * Product-portfolio expansion * Loss and cost reduction * Simplifying customer order cycle * Transport coordination * Upgrade of production line * Updating information The team works from these strategic targets. Organizational units are departments of the organization. Each department is responsible for a strategic target. ===Processes=== There are about 40-60 business processes in an organization (depending on its size), and it is important to choose the most profitable ones and the department responsible for a particular process. Examples include: * Contact creation * Hangaring * Invoicing * Monitoring * Airplane coordination and service * New- customer registration * Service catalog creation * Reservations * Employee training * Transfers * Car rental ===Data classes=== There are usually about 30–60 data classes, depending on the size of the organization. Future IS will use databases based on these classes. Examples include: * Accommodation * Branches * Corporation * Customer * Employee * Invoice * Load * Airplane * Purchase order * Service catalog * Supplier * Vehicle ===Information support=== The purpose of this step is to check the applications used by an organization, evaluating the importance of each to eliminate redundancy. ===Management discussion=== In the final analytical step the team discusses its results with management to confirm (or refute) assumptions, provide missing information, reveal deficiencies in the organization and establish future priorities. ===Issue results=== All documents created during the analysis are collected, serving as a base for future information architecture. The organization classifies and dissects all identified problems; a list is made of the cause and effect of each problem, which is integrated into the future IS. (marque) ==ConclusionDefining information architecture=== To define an organization's information architecture, it is necessary to connect the information subsystems using matrix processes and data classes to find appropriate subsystems. The organization then reorders processes according to the product (or service) life cycle. ===Establishing IS-development priorities=== A number of criteria (costs and development time, for example) establish the best sequence of system implementation. High-priority subsystems may be analyzed more deeply. This information is given to the sponsor, who determines which information subsystems will be developed. ===Verifying study impact=== An IS planning and management study should be conducted. When the organization has finished its work on processes and data classes, it should explore the functions and goals of the system with a list of requested departmental changes and a cost analysis. ===Proposals=== Final recommendations and plans are made for the organization during this step, which encompasses information architecture, IS management and information- subsystem development and includes costs, profits and future activities. ===Presentation=== This is the agreement of all interested parties (team, management and sponsor) on future actions. ===Final step=== The organization should establish specific responsibilities during the project's implementation. There is usually a controlling commission, ensuring consistency across the IS. BSP, in addition to its value to IS planning, introduced the process view of a firm. The business process reengineering of the 1990s was built on this concept. It also demonstrated the need to separate data from its applications using it, supporting the database approach to software development methodology. ==Criticism== The effectiveness of BSP and other similar planning methodologies has been questioned: * The historical analysis shows that BSP and subsequent enterprise architecture (EA) methodologies are \\"fundamentally flawed\\".\\"Enterprise Architecture Frameworks: The Fad of the Century\\", Svyatoslav Kotusev, British Computer Society (BCS), July 2016Kotusev, Svyatoslav (2018) The Practice of Enterprise Architecture: A Modern Approach to Business and IT Alignment.

The 59th edition of the Gator Bowl, it was played at Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida, on January 1, 2004. The game was the final contest of the 2003 NCAA Division I-A football season for both teams, and ended in a 41-7 victory for Maryland. The Maryland Terrapins (more often, simply 'Terps') earned a bid to the Gator Bowl following a 9-3 record during the 2003 regular season. It was Ralph Friedgen's third season as Maryland head coach and third consecutive bowl game, making him just the second Maryland head coach to do so in his first three seasons—the other being Bobby Ross. At the conclusion of this game, Friedgen also became the first Atlantic Coast Conference coach to ever win at least ten games in his first three seasons. Going into the game, Maryland's 30-win three seasons was the best three-year total in school history. The West Virginia Mountaineers had finished the regular season with a record of 8-4, which already included a defeat at the hands of Maryland. Like Friedgen, it was Rich Rodriguez's third year as head coach of his program. West Virginia entered the game on a seven-game winning streak, as co-champions of the Big East conference. The game took place in front of a crowd of 78,892 fans. The Terps got off to a quick lead, and never relented. Early in the third quarter, Maryland led 31-0 before West Virginia scored its only points. Oddly enough, the game was a bowl rematch of a regular season game which had similarly lop-sided results: Maryland had won that contest too, 34-7. It marked the fourth Terps' win over the Mountaineers in three years, by an average score of 35-13. ==Team selectionMaryland=== The 2003 season was Ralph Friedgen's third as head coach at Maryland. He had already compiled an impressive record in his first two years, elevating Terrapins football back to the national stage for the first time since Bobby Ross left the program in the wake of the Len Bias tragedy. His first year as head coach in 2001, Friedgen had led the Terrapins to a 10-2 record and the BCS Orange Bowl, for the team's first winning season in five years and the first bowl game in eleven years. ===West Virginia=== West Virginia's 2003 season started off badly, with a 1-4 record including losses to Wisconsin, Cincinnati, Maryland, and fellow Big East foe Miami. However, the Mountaineers recovered to win their next seven games and secure a conference co-championship with Miami. With it they also received a bowl bid to travel to Jacksonville to face the Terps in a post- season rematch. ==Game summaryFirst quarter=== The game started with a West Virginia kick off into the Maryland endzone where Steve Suter returned it for 23 yards. Quarterback Scott McBrien led the Terps on a drive with Bruce Perry carrying 22 yards and a pass to Steve Suter for 16 and Jo Jo Walker for 29 yards. The Mountaineers held fast at their own 10-yard line and forced a field goal attempt. Nick Novak made good a 27-yard kick for the first points in the game.Another lopsided win for Maryland, ESPN, 1 January 2004. In the next two series, West Virginia and Maryland exchanged punts. Mountaineer running back Kay-Jay Harris then fumbled the ball which was recovered by Shawne Merriman for the Terps. Maryland suffered two fumbles, by running back Bruce Perry and Scott McBrien, but recovered both. They again tried for a field goal, but Nick Novak missed the 51-yard attempt. West Virginia took over on downs on their 34-yard line and rushed three times for 16 yards before quarterback Rasheed Marshall fumbled and Maryland linebacker Andrew Henley recovered it at midfield. On their next possession, the Terps pushed to the Mountaineer 31-yard line before Scott McBrien completed a pass to Jafar Williams for a 31-yard touchdown. ===Second quarter=== The Terps kicked off to start to 2nd quarter, and with a touchback, West Virginia took over on their 20-yard line. After a three-and-out series, they brought on their special teams unit. Steve Suter received the punt on the Maryland 24 and ran it 76 yards for a touchdown. West Virginia took over and made a first-down, but was forced to punt again. Scott McBrien then led the Terps on an 81-yard drive capped by a 22-yard touchdown pass again to Jafar Williams. The Mountaineers were forced three-and-out and punted once more. Maryland drove down to the West Virginia 18, but a 35-yard field goal attempt by Nick Novak was again missed. Likewise, West Virginia pushed to the Maryland 24, before missing a 41-yard field goal of their own to end the half. ===Third quarter=== After Grant Wiley returned the kick 28 yards for the Mountaineers, they were once again held three-and-out and forced to punt. After driving to mid-field, Scott McBrien launched a 43-yard pass to Steve Suter. Despite good coverage from cornerback Lance Frazier, Suter was able to tip the ball with one hand and catch it in mid-air as he was diving to the ground in a tangle with Frazier. This set up a two-yard rush by McBrien for a touchdown, and Maryland expanded its lead to 31-0. West Virginia received the kick and Adam Jones made a short return for six yards. Rasheed Marshall held onto the ball and rushed for another six yards. Kay-Jay Harris then broke free for a 29-yard run. The Mountaineers picked up another eight yards with a pass to Chris Henry. This set up a 15-yard run up the middle by quarterback Marshall for what would be West Virginia's only points of the game. Maryland responded with another drive, including a 28-yard pass to the right to Josh Allen and a 43-yard pass up the middle to Dan Melendez. After another short run and short pass, Maryland settle for a 24-yard field goal by Novak. ===Fourth quarter=== The teams traded punts, and then the Mountaineers punted once more. A 73-yard drive was then capped with a 14-yard pass to Jo Jo Walker for another touchdown, and the final points of the game. The next Mountaineers' possession was ended with a sack of second-string quarterback Charles Hales and a turnover on downs. Maryland took over on the West Virginia 38, and pushed to the 6-yard line before the game ended on 4th and 1. ==Statistical summary== {  + Statistical ComparisonMaryland Terrapins vs. West Virginia Mountaineers Box Score, January 1 2004, ESPN, 1 January 2004, accessed 22 November 2008. !

Every century has produced heroes who have sacrificed their lives for their country. If they had remained at home to die by the fire, would their names have been inscribed on bamboo and silk to live eternally in Heaven and on the Earth? But as descendants of warrior families, ye are not well- versed in letters; on hearing about these deeds of the past, ye may have some doubts. Let us speak of them no more. I shall tell you instead of several more recent events that have taken place during the years of the Song and Yuan dynasties. Who was Wang Gongjian? And who was his lieutenant Ruan Wen Li? They were the ones who defended the great citadel of Diao Yu against Mongke's immense army; Therefore, the Song people will be eternally grateful to them. Who was Uriyangqatai? And who was his lieutenant Qisusi? They were the ones who drove deep into an unhealthful country in order to put down the Nanchao bandits and they did it within the space of a few weeks; therefore, their names have remained rooted in the minds of the Mongol military chieftains. Ye and I were born in a period of troubles and have grown up at a time when the Motherland is in danger. We have seen the enemy ambassadors haughtily traveling over our roads and wagging their owlish tongues to insult the Court; despicable as dogs and goats, they boldly humiliate our high officials. Supported by Kubilai Khan, they incessantly demand the payment of pearls, silks, gold and silver. Our wealth is limited but their cupidity is infinite. To yield to their exactions would be to feed their insatiable appetites and would set a dangerous precedent for the future. In the face of these dangers to the Motherland, I fail to eat during the day and to sleep at night. Tears roll down my cheeks and my heart bleeds as if it were being cut to shreds. I tremble with anger because I cannot eat our enemy's flesh, lie down in his skin, chew up his liver, and drink his blood. I would gladly surrender my life a thousand times on the field of battle if I could do these things. Ye have served in the army under my orders for a long time. When ye needed clothing, I clothed you; when ye lacked rice, I fed you; when your rank was too low, I promoted you; when your pay was insufficient, I increased it. If ye had to travel by water, I supplied you with vessels; if ye had to travel by land, I supplied you with horses. In time of war, we shared the same dangers; at the banquet table our laughter resounded in unison. Indeed, even Wang Gong Jian and Uriyangqatai did not show more solicitude for their officers than I have displayed for you. And now, ye remain calm when your emperor is humiliated; ye remain indifferent when your country is threatened! Ye, officers, are forced to serve the barbarians and ye feel no shame! Ye hear the music played for their ambassadors and ye do not leap up in anger. No, ye amuse yourselves at the cockfights, in gambling, in the possession of your gardens and rice fields, and in the tranquility of family life. The exploitation of your personal affairs makes ye forget your duties to the State; the distractions of the fields and of the hunt make you neglect military exercises; ye are seduced by liquor and music. If the enemy comes, will your cocks' spurs be able to pierce his armor? Will the ruses ye use in your games of chance be of use in repulsing him? Will the love of your wives and children be of any use in the Army? Your money would neither suffice to buy the enemy's death, your alcohol to besot him, nor your music to deafen him. All of us, ye and I together, would then be taken prisoner. What grief! And not only would I lose my fief, but your property too would fall into enemy hands. It would not be my family alone that would be driven out, but your wives and children would also be reduced to slavery. It would not be only the graves of my ancestors that would be trampled under the invader's heel, but those of your ancestors would also be violated. I would be humiliated in this life and in a hundred others to come, and my name would be ignominiously tarnished. Your family's honor would also be sullied forever with the shame of your defeat. Tell me: Could ye then indulge yourselves in pleasures? I say to you in all frankness: Take care as if ye were piling wood by the fire or about to imbibe a hot liquid. Exercise your soldiers in the skills of archery until they are the equals of Peng Meng and Hou Yi, those famous archers of olden times. Then we will display Kublai's head at the gates of the Imperial Palace and send the Prince of Yunnan to the gallows. After that, not only my fief will be safe forever, but your privileges too will be assured for the future. Not only my family will enjoy the comforts of life, but ye too will be able to spend your old age with your wives and children. Not only the memory of my ancestors will be venerated from generation to generation, but yours too will be worshipped in the spring and autumn of every year. Not only will I have accomplished my aspirations in this life, but your fame too will endure for a hundred centuries to come. Not only will my name be immortalized, but yours too will find a place in our nation's history. At that moment, would ye not be perfectly happy even if ye did not expect to be? I have studied every military treatise in order to write my manual entitled \\"Principles of Military Strategy\\". If ye will make an effort to study it conscientiously, to instruct yourselves in its teachings, and to follow my directions, ye will become my true companions-in-arms. On the other hand, if ye fail to study it and ignore my advice, ye will become my enemies. Why? Because the Mongols are our mortal enemies; we cannot live under the same sky with them. If ye refuse to fight the Mongols in order to wash away the national shame, if ye do not train your soldiers to drive out these barbarians, it would be to surrender to them. If that is what ye want, your names will be dishonored forever. And when the enemy has finally been defeated, how will ye be able to hold your head high between Heaven and Earth? The purpose of this proclamation is to let you know my deepest thoughts. ==External links== *English translation of Proclamation of Officers *Proclamation of Officers on Wikisource Category:Trần dynasty texts Category:13th-century documents ","title":"Hịch tướng sĩ"},{"id":"20339400","text":"Decisiones supremi Senatus Regni Lusitaniae, 1597.

The lighthouse is a tall white brick tower on a granite foundation. The tower was originally lit with a 5th order Fresnel lens. A raised wooden walkway connects the tower to land. In 1895, the original keeper's house was destroyed by lightning. A Colonial Revival style house was built to replace it. An oil house and a bell tower with a bell were added in 1898. The bell was replaced with a fog horn in 1969. The lighthouse was automated in 1980 and the original Fresnel lens was replaced with a modern optic. The original lens is at the Maine Lighthouse Museum in Rockland. In 1986, the St. George Historical Society restored the keeper's house and established the Marshall Point Lighthouse Museum there, presenting the histories of Marshall Point Light and other nearby lighthouses.

The project started under the acronym CENA, meaning \\"National Economical Car\\" (\\"Carro Econômico NAcional\\", in Portuguese), designed to be essentially a small car for urban daily use. It received great attention and good reviews from critics, regarding the mechanic solutions, comfort, drivability and stability.http://www.gurgel800.com.br/publicacoes/quatrorodas/325/ At the September 1987 introduction the car was named the Gurgel 280 but by the time sales started it had finally become the BR-800. The car could only be purchased if the buyer also bought 750 shares in Gurgel, making it considerably more expensive than the much bigger and more capable Chevrolet Chevette, the then cheapest new car available in Brazil. The project was favoured by Brazil's then-president, José Sarney, who ensured large unsecured loans for Gurgel's project and also allowed it to be sold at an especially low sales tax. Nonetheless, only about 4,000 were built in around four years of production. ==Mechanics== The engine, called the Gurgel Enertron, was developed by Gurgel themselves. This is a water-cooled gasoline engine with two opposed piston cylinders. Essentially a halved VW boxer-four engine, it was developed with either 650 cc or 800 cc displacements, generating and respectively. It had a very simple and robust design, eliminating totally the V-belt by using the crankshaft for activating the alternator, and the camshaft for water and oil pump. In a later stage of development, the V-belt was reintroduced for the alternator, so that the battery would be charged even at low engine speeds. The car's ride also came in for heavy complaints, due to the use of Gurgel's own \\"Springshock\\" suspension. This system, made mainly from synthetic materials, was abandoned for a more conventional setup for the succeeding Supermini. Rear view of Gurgel BR-800 SL The body was made using Plasteel, designed for four passengers, and considered by some to have a good level of space for passengers and the driver, despite being less than in length. During development, the little 650 cc engine was set aside, and only a 32 PS version of the 800 cc engine entered production. Nonetheless, the car was considered underpowered, with a top speed of . Power was increased to for the later SL version. The body, in order to save costs, has flat windows. Gurgel BR-800 SL Between 1988 and July 1990, Gurgel BR-800 had the IPI tax reduced to 7%, thus giving a great advantage for Gurgel. In July 1990, the Brazilian president Fernando Collor decided to give a similar tax cut to all cars with engines smaller than one litre, thus equating the price of the BR-800 with those of significantly larger and more usable cars, reducing the BR-800 sales to a trickle. By the end of 1991, the BR-800 received some restyling and other improvements, it was now sold under the name BR-SL. This then received some general improvements and a more thorough restyling, evolving into the Gurgel Supermini. ==References * Automobile Catalog * Gurgel 800 General information and forums about Gurgel cars BR800 Category:1980s cars Category:1990s cars Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles ","title":"Gurgel BR-800"},{"id":"20339489","text":"Boriya is a village development committee in Saptari District in the Sagarmatha Zone of south-eastern Nepal.

There is usually a delivery charge for this service. Online grocery delivery services are available throughout Europe, Asia and North America, mostly in urban centres. The online ordering is done through e-commerce websites or mobile apps. == In-store pickup == In-store order pickup fridges at a Save-On-Foods store in British Columbia, Canada. For brick-and-mortar stores that have online ordering, customers can place orders online and pick up their ready orders in the store on their way home. In-store pickup — sometimes termed \\"click & collect\\" – is typically offered for same- day shopping; it is usually less expensive than delivery, and can be done at a time of the customer's choosing. This option is popular in rural areas. It is also useful for customers living outside of the store's local delivery area. == Local delivery == Most local online grocers have their own drivers. The most common type of personal delivery involves storing grocery inventory in a warehouse to deliver to customers once orders are placed. Another type of personal delivery which is less common is based on just-in-time business in which there is no warehouse or inventory. In this type of delivery, customers place orders for next-day delivery. The online grocer shops for the groceries on the morning of the delivery day. Some grocery fulfilment centres are set up as dark stores. Online-only grocers typically have warehouses or distribution centers nearby, to allow local shipping of refrigerated items. Online grocers with a large regional or national delivery area may ship groceries using courier services. If the order contains cold or frozen items, this involves \\"flash freezing\\" the goods and pack them into special shipping containers. Companies have experimented with automated delivery modes including drone delivery and robots. For instance, in Fall 2016 Washingthon D.C. approved a trial run of rolling delivery drones produced by Starship Technologies. The earthbound robots are similar to wheeled coolers and carry around 40 pounds of groceries . == Platforms == The online grocer technology platform could be developed in-house, or a third party's platform could be re-used and customized to reflect the company brand and provide unique features. In some cases, all management and support tasks are being outsourced to the platform provider. ==Market size and share== In the United States, as of 2017, Amazon.com sold $2 billion worth of groceries online. It had the largest market share, 18%, followed by Walmart.Amazon led the US in online grocery in 2017 It has partnered with Whole Foods Market.Amazon and Whole Foods after a year The value of the US online grocery market has grown from $12 billion in 2016 to $26 billion in 2018 and it has plenty of room to grow, given that the size of the overall grocery market was $632 billion in 2018 according to IBISWorld. Online grocery shopping has grown substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic. ==Impact on the environment== Online grocery stores may allow facilitating local food which may reduce the environmental impact of food transport. Small-scale farmers have been embracing digital technologies as a way to directly sell produce, and community-supported agriculture and direct- sell delivery systems are on the rise during the coronavirus pandemic. Furthermore, weekly grocery deliveries can be a better choice than individual trips to a store. Some online grocery stores have a goal of supporting the production and sale of fresh, organic, locally grown, sustainable foods. ==See also== * List of online grocers * Online food ordering * Grocery store ==References== ","title":"Online grocer"},{"id":"20339657","text":"Gurgel Supermini The Gurgel Supermini was a small car produced in Brazil by Gurgel between 1992 and 1994.

The most powerful version of the car got larger intake valves, increasing the engine power rating by 4 hp - thus offering at 5500 rpm. Its torque was 65 Nm / 48 ft.lb at 2500 rpm. The horizontal windows were also replaced by vertical ones. The Supermini was very lightweight, weighing only 645 kg (1422 lb). Its fuel tank capacity was 10.6 gallons. The Supermini had a top speed of 110 km/h (68 mph). Its longitudinal engine was in the front, despite it being rear-wheel drive. It had a 4 speed manual. Despite its size, the Supermini was a four-seater (With two doors, provided). It came only in a hatchback version. Its peak of production was in its first months of 1992, before the factory went into bankruptcy.

The 2009 season comprised 69 matches played over 17 weeks. The format of the competition was unchanged from last year, starting with a 14-week round robin followed by a three-week finals series. After a very hectic transfer season, teams were confirmed and the competition began. The top four teams from the round-robin stage progressed to the finals stage. The Melbourne Vixens finished the round robin as minor premiers, followed by the Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic, Adelaide Thunderbirds and Southern Steel. The grand final was played on Sunday 26 July at Hisense Arena in Melbourne, contested between the Vixens and Thunderbirds. The Melbourne Vixens emerged as champions for the 2009 season after defeating the Thunderbirds by 54–46. == Format == The format of the 2009 season is identical to that of the 2008 season. During the round-robin stage, played over 14 weeks, each team played every other team once, and played teams from their home country a second time, with one bye somewhere between Rounds 5–9. The top four teams from the round-robin stage progressed to the finals stage, played over three weeks in a Page-McIntyre System. Round 1 matchups in 2008 were identical to the round 14 matchups in 2009. In addition, in trans-Tasman matches the home and away teams are switched around from 2008 to ensure that the teams get to play home and away games over two years: e.g., the Swifts hosted the Magic in round 3 in 2008, but the same game in 2009 will be hosted by the Magic. The 2009 season featured a \\"Rivalry Round\\" in Week 13, in which all matches were contested between teams from Australia and New Zealand. Round 4 matchups in 2008 were identical to the matchups in \\"Rivalry Round\\". The goals scored by each country were accumulated, with Australia winning the inaugural Rivalry Round Trophy. == Transfer Season == See the 2009 Transfer Season The 2008 Off season, saw franchises working hard to sign up the best talent in the ANZ competition, while trying to remain under the Salary Cap. Several teams including the Southern Steel, Waikato/BOP Magic and the Queensland Firebirds looked like teams that improved their rosters the most, joining the NSW Swifts, Adelaide Thunderbirds and the Melbourne Vixens with potential to win the second edition of the competition. The Steel went out to sign all the old guns, picking up its former Southern Sting star duo of former Silver Ferns Adine Wilson and Donna Wilkins, while also inking international defender Sheryl Scanlan. The Waikato/BOP Magic added to its already five current internationals players by putting star backline player Leana de Bruin in the mix also. The Canterbury Tactix signed impressive defender Sonia Mkoloma from the Central Pulse, with the Wellington-based Pulse, just replacing her with another talent, Jamaican goal keeper Althea Byfield. Things were calmer in Australia, the Queensland Firebirds remained strong on paper, resigning 2008 MVP Romelda Aiken, English import Tamsin Greenway and Australian stars Lauren Nourse and Laura Geitz. The West Coast Fever could well of bought the best future talent in the game, signing midcourters Madison Browne and Shae Bolton from the Melbourne Vixens to bolster their midcourt. == Pre-season == Swifts vs Vixens in the 2009 SOPA Cup. The first pre-season tournament was held in Queenstown in New Zealand from 20–22 February at the Queenstown Events Centre. Several ANZ Championship teams participated, including the Steel, Mystics, Swifts and Pulse, and the Australian Institute of Sport also sent a team. The Tactix were scheduled to attend as well, but pulled out due to lack of player availability. The Mystics went through the tournament undefeated, beating defending ANZ Championship winners the Swifts 58–53 on the final day. The official pre-season tournament is the Sydney Olympic Park Netball Cup (SOPA Cup), held in Sydney from 6–8 March. Seven ANZ Championship franchises participated in the tournament, including the Firebirds, Swifts, Vixens, Thunderbirds, Fever, Magic and Steel, along with the Australian Institute of Sport. In a replay of last year's grand final, the Swifts and Magic fought out a close draw. By the end of the tournament, the Swifts emerged as champions, receiving a winner's prize of $10,000. The Waipa Pre-Season Tournament was the third and last in the 2009 pre-season, held from 20–22 March at the Te AwamutuEvents Centre. This tournament featured the Magic, Mystics and Pulse from the ANZ Championship, as well as the New Zealand U21 team. Hosted by the Magic, the home team took out the tournament. ==Fixtures== All listed times are local: New Zealand times are UTC+12; Queensland, New South Wales and Victorian times are UTC+10; South Australian times are UTC+9:30; and Western Australian times are UTC+8.

He transformed the fortunes of the publishing house Cassell & Co, and later became its proprietor. As an author, he published studies of the composers George Frideric Handel, Franz Schubert and (as co-author) Arthur Sullivan. He also edited the million-word journals of Arnold Bennett for publication. ==Life and career== Flower was born at Fontmell Magna, Dorset, England. He was the eldest son of John Walter Flower. \\"Flower, Sir (Walter) Newman\\", Who Was Who, 1920–2007, A & C Black, London; online edn, Oxford University Press, December 2007, accessed 22 Nov 2008 After schooling at the Whitgift School he entered the publishing trade in London at the age of 17.The Times, 13 March 1964, p. 19 ===Publishing=== Flower trained under Lord Northcliffe at the Harmsworth Press, after which he joined Cassell & Co in 1906. Cassell was at that time in the doldrums, but Flower built up a stable of magazine titles that grew to dominate the British magazine market for many years. In 1912 he was given charge of the book publishing branch of the company, where he brought in such authors as Arnold Bennett, G. K. Chesterton and H. G. Wells. In 1926, Cassell's magazines were sold to the Amalgamated Press, and Flower raised enough money to buy the book-publishing branch of the company, becoming proprietor and managing director in 1927. In 1938, shortly after receiving a knighthood for services to literature, he retired, but returned during World War II to look after the literary affairs of the company while his successor, his son Desmond, was on active service. Flower commissioned Winston Churchill's A History of the English-Speaking Peoples, which was eventually completed and published during the 1950s. During the war years, Churchill promised Flower that Cassell would be offered anything he later wrote about the war. The Times described the result, Churchill's The Second World War, as \\"perhaps the greatest coup of twentieth century publishing.\\" ===Writing=== Arthur Flower was also an author. His life of George Frideric Handel was published in 1923 and reissued in a revised edition in 1959. The book was well received, but later writers on Handel have disputed Flower's portrait of Handel as \\"sexless and safe\\".The Times, 12 June 1923, p. 10; and 7 March 1985, p. 9Music & Letters, Vol. 29, No. 2, April 1948, pp. 177-79Thomas, Gary C. \\"'Was George Frideric Handel Gay?': On Closet Questions and Cultural Politics\\" in Brett, Philip, Elizabeth Wood, and Gary C. Thomas. Queering the Pitch: The New Gay and Lesbian Musicology. New York: Routledge, 2006. In 1927, Flower collaborated with Herbert Sullivan in a biography of the latter's uncle, Sir Arthur Sullivan, his Life and Letters. This too was well received at the time but also suffered later from critical disapproval for sanitising its subject by suppressing evidence of Sullivan's gambling and sexual liaisons.Sherr, Richard, Journal of the American Musicological Society, Vol. 38, No. 3, Autumn, 1985, pp. 637-43 In 1928 Flower published a study of Franz Schubert, and in 1945 and 1950 he published two volumes of memoirs. His largest literary project was to prepare the journals of Arnold Bennett for publication – more than a million words in manuscript to be edited. Rupert Hart-Davis later commented on \\"the prudish timidity of their editor, old Newman Flower. According to Hugh Walpole, N. F. was so appalled by much of what he found in the journals that he published only brief extracts, and those the safest.\\"Hart-Davis, Letter of 27 October 1957 ===Personal life=== Flower was twice married, first in 1903 to Evelyne Readwin of Wells, Norfolk, with whom he had one son, and second in 1943 to Bridget Downes of Coore, County Clare, Ireland. He died at his home, Tarrant Keynston House, near Blandford, Dorset, aged 84. ==NotesReferences== *Flower, Newman: Through My Garden Gate, Cassell, London, 1945 *Flower, Newman: Just as it Happened, Cassell, London, 1950 *Hart-Davis, Rupert (ed): The Lyttelton/Hart- Davis Letters Vol 2 John Murray, London, 1979 Category:1879 births Category:1964 deaths Category:British book publishers (people) Category:People associated with Gilbert and Sullivan Category:Knights Bachelor Category:People from Dorset Category:People educated at Whitgift School ","title":"Newman Flower"},{"id":"20339839","text":"FC Nordjylland was the professional team of Danish football club Aalborg Chang from season 2001–02 until its liquidation at the end of season 2003–04.

When opened in 1976, the building surpassed the AMP Building to become the tallest completed building in Perth, a title which it only held until 1977 when St Martins Tower opened. Allendale Square taken from St George's Tce ==Site history and construction== The corner of St Georges Terrace and Sherwood Court where Allendale Square now stands was owned as early as 1829 by the Leake family. Later, it was home to Warwick House, the Bank of New South Wales, the Commercial Travellers Association and the Daily News Chambers. These buildings were demolished in 1974 for construction of Allendale Square. The tower, which was designed by Architects Cameron, Chisholm and Nicol, was built by Multiplex. The building's anodised aluminium cladding was extensively weather tested to ensure it could resist atmospheric corrosion. Although this cladding covers a 70% of the exterior of the building, all cladding units were installed from inside the tower without the use of external scaffolding. The building was officially opened by Premier Sir Charles Court on 3 August 1976. Also attending the opening were descendants of the Leake family which had owned the site from the earliest days of the colony. ==Post-completion== Allendale Square has been used for abseiling for charity down its side.See e.g. The first of these events was held in November 2002, and its success led to it being held annually thereafter, until the change in the building's ownership forced the end of this charitable event. The tower has also been used as a base from which to launch shells in the Lotterywest Skyworks annual fireworks display. The building's prominent tenants include ANZ Bank (which also owns the signage rights over the building), Qantas and Francis Burt Chambers. ===Ownership=== A half share in the building was bought in 1988 by Armstrong Jones Perth Property Fund for $41.63 million. This half share was later purchased for $39.35 million by GEM Commercial Property Trust in 1995, which was acquired by the General Property Trust when it took over GEM in 1996. In mid-2000 General Property Trust put its half-share in the tower up for sale for $44.25 million, but no offers it received came close and it was forced to take the building off the market. Meanwhile, in 1995, the other half share in the tower was acquired from an MLC Life fund by the Australian Prime Property Fund in a package that cost a total of $125 million. Western Australian property mogul Ralph Sarich's investment company Cape Bouvard Investments bought Allendale Square in two steps for $93.03 million between 2001 and 2002. It bought half from the General Property Trust in September 2001 and the other half for $48 million from Australian Prime Property Fund in April 2002. Later, General Electric bought the tower in December 2006 for $154 million from Cape Bouvard. GE put the tower up for sale in 2008, however the tower was taken off the market after none of the offers received met the desired $200 million sale price. The tower was sold for $231m in May 2013 to Mirvac. ===Refurbishments and complex expansion=== The building has been refurbished three times since it opened in 1976. In 1989 the building underwent a minor refurbishment at a cost of $1.5 million. Then, starting in 1999, the building underwent an extensive internal refurbishment which cost $2.5 million. The project involved a refit of the lobby, replacement of lift cars and improvement to core services like lighting. Architect Anna Meszaros from firm Cameron Chisholm and Nicol was responsible for this refurbishment. Most recently, the building was refurbished from 2001 to 2002, which also involved remodelling of the three-storey building adjacent to the tower. This involved an upgrade of some floors, the lobby and the adjoining ANZ Bank branch. The outdoor plaza was also to be revamped for the first time since the building was opened in 1976. The complex was expanded with the completion in early 2006 of the Allendale II building on the site of the former CTA building at the rear of the Allendale Square site. This seven-storey building is connected to Allendale Square and its underground shopping centre, and boosted the total lettable space in the complex to . ==Design== The south-facing windows of the tower The tower is located on a site, above sea level, however the tower itself only occupies 25% of this land area. Designed by architects Cameron, Chisolm and Nicol, the building is rotated 45 degrees relative to St Georges Terrace, in order to secure a plot ratio concession from the Perth City Council. The walls of the tower are stepped in plan, creating V-shaped protrusions along each face. In order to maximise views towards the Swan River whilst reducing heat loads, the building has windows only on the north and south-facing sides of these steps, and the remainder of the tower is clad with aluminium. The of aluminium panels were created from locally mined bauxite, refined at Kwinana by Alco in the largest aluminium task ever undertaken in Australia at that time. On its opening, the building was the largest fully aluminium-clad freestanding tower in Australia, and one of the largest in the world. The 992 windows of the tower are solar-bronze glass, up to thick on upper levels. Ninety percent of the tower's levels had uninterrupted views to the river upon its opening, and all of the office levels are free of internal columns. When it was opened, the tower's lobby had red carpet at the entrance, high ceilings and marble columns. In addition to a lift between the 99-bay basement car park and the lobby, the tower has nine high-speed lifts, divided into two zones. When the tower opened, these lifts were among the most advanced in the world, improving travelling times and halving the plant room space they required. The electronic security devices and air conditioning systems were also advanced. The roof of the building's mechanical penthouse, which is adorned with the ANZ Bank logo, is designed to be able to function as a helipad if necessary. The building has 34 levels, made up of a basement car park, an underground retail arcade, the ground floor lobby, a conference suite, 29 office levels and the plant level at the top. The tower has of lettable space and a \\"spacious\\" lobby. The building has been described as a \\"fine example\\" of high-rise architecture, \\"timeless\\", \\"one of Perth's most prominent office buildings\\", a building of \\"considerable elegance\\" and a good building in its time which still remains relevant. ==Awards== Allendale Square was named as one of the Top 20 Australian 20th century icon buildings by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects. The building has also won several architectural awards, including: * 1977 -- Alcoa of Australia Award for Architecture; * 1978 -- Royal Australian Institute of Architects Design Award; * 1978 -- ACI Energy Conservation Award; and * 1981 -- Royal Australian Institute of Architects (WA Chapter) Bronze Medal. ==References * Official website * Emporis page on the building * Skyscraperpage article about the building * State Library of Western Australia -- photographs of Allendale Square under construction Category:Landmarks in Perth, Western Australia Category:Skyscrapers in Perth, Western Australia Category:Office buildings in Perth, Western Australia Category:St Georges Terrace Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Australia Category:Office buildings completed in 1976 ","title":"Allendale Square"},{"id":"20340056","text":"Shaheen Academy School & College Feni is a secondary school in Feni District, Bangladesh.

Opened in 1975, the tower was known as the AMP Building or AMP Tower after its owner and former flagship tenant, AMP Limited. The building became the tallest completed skyscraper in Perth in 1975, a title which it held only until 1976, when Allendale Square was opened. ==Site history and construction== The old AMP Chambers at the corner of St Georges Terrace and William Street The interior of the old AMP Chambers in 1954 The site at the corner of St Georges Terrace and William Street known as \\"Carr's Corner\\" was purchased by AMP in 1910, and in 1915 the AMP Chambers designed by Oldham and Cox were built on the corner. This six-storey building was clad with sandstone, and the interior was decorated with jarrah. The top of the building featured an iconic bronze statue, which became a landmark atop the chambers. The high statue depicted four figures: a central figure symbolised protection, and it was flanked by a man, woman and child. Weighing around , the sculpture was hollow with a wooden base and was thought to have been made in Europe. When AMP announced plans to demolish the building and erect in its place a modern skyscraper, the National Trust refused to classify the building as in need of protection. The Trust Administrator N.J. Armitage instead applauded the development and the open space that would be created in the forecourt of the new tower. Although the building could not be saved from demolition, the iconic statue atop it was saved by Clive Rutty and purchased by millionaire collector Lew Whiteman, who paid $1000 for it. When the statue was removed from the building on 19 March 1972, a piece of wood was found within it with the names on it of the four men who erected it in October 1914. AMP later asked to buy the statue back from Whiteman, and he told them they did not deserve it. After the death of Whiteman, the statue was bought at auction for A$60,800 by the land developers, Sherwood Overseas, and placed in its current position as a contribution to public art. It now stands in the centre of a lake of Floreat Waters, on the western side of Herdsman Lake. The developers were allowed to build their tower beyond the allowable plot ratio because of planning concessions awarded in return for the provision of public amenities, namely the open space in front of the building and seats provided for the public. A further bonus was given for the linking of the development with the Elders development across St Georges Terrace. Demolition of the old building started in May 1972; construction on the foundations of the office tower then proceeded, and the construction of the tower was completed in 1975. AMP Building taken from St George's Tce The building originally housed an observation deck on the 29th floor, offering sweeping views across the central business district. However, when both its west and east views were blocked by the construction of the BankWest Tower in 1988 and Central Park in 1992, this observation deck was closed. ==Post-completion== When the tower was first built in 1975, an \\"iconic\\" commissioned sculpture by Howard Taylor was installed in its forecourt. The sculpture, entitled \\"The Black Stump\\", was constructed of concrete and mosaic tile and weighed more than . It was relocated to the University of Western Australia in 1990, where it has remained beside the Octagon Theatre ever since. The building was used by AMP as its state headquarters from its opening in 1975 until 2002 when most of its staff moved to West Perth offices. The last AMP staff shifted out of the building in 2003. AMP Building taken from William Street Since 1997, the tower has been used as a launching pad for some shells in the annual Lotterywest Skyworks fireworks display. Owned by AMP companies since 1915, the building was put on the market by owner AMP Asset Management in 2000 and was expected to fetch A$80 million. A Perth-based syndicate headed by Brett Wilkins offered to buy the tower for between $75 and 80 million. However, the property failed to sell, and remained within AMP ownership. In August 2005, the building was sold by AMP Life Statutory Fund No 1 to the AMP-managed Australian Core Property Portfolio for $153.5 million. ===Refurbishments=== The tower seen in the centre of this photo, nestled between 108 St Georges Terrace and Central Park In 1992, the building underwent refurbishment, but this was mostly only minor cosmetic refurbishment. Coinciding with the completion of Central Park, the $15 million project was conducted by Multiplex. The refurbishment involved a facelift for the ground floor lobby, including polished granite flooring, wall panelling and coffered ceilings with concealed lighting, improved revolving doors, new glass and planter boxes. The facelift also saw the repaving of the building's forecourt with cobblestone, new landscaping, further public seating and the integration of the tower's underground car parking with Central Park's. Despite the 1992 refurbishment, by 2000 the building was already widely regarded as in need of an upgrade. In 2003, when the building was \\"almost empty\\", an extensive refurbishment of the building was undertaken, at a cost of A$34 million. The largest office tower refurbishment in Perth's history, work started in April 2003. The refurbishment was mostly an internal one, refreshing office floors and replacing building services such as air conditioning and lifts. The bulk of the facade remained unchanged, aside from a new \\"two-storey high, 15-metre long bronzed-glass canopy\\" at ground level. The glass of the canopy is coated with small white dots which have a shading effect during the day, but uplighting produces a white ceiling effect at night. This canopy was intended to give the tower a more prominent entrance. The refurbishment also involved the installation of new conference facilities. The 2003 refurbishment was designed by architects Cox Howlett & Bailey Woodland, and the refurbishment contract won by Multiplex. The project took until 2005, finishing on-time and on-budget. The refurbishment was a success, with the building going from \\"sparesely occupied\\" at the start of the refurbishment project to \\"practically full\\" in 2006. The refurbishment was also expected to give the tower a \\"4.5 Australian Building Greenhouse Rating\\" due to its new, energy-efficient lifts, air conditioning, window tinting and double glazing. ==Design== The tower seen from the corner of William Street and Hay Street 140 St Georges Terrace features a service core design, with the concrete core containing the lifts and two stairwells. The perimeter of the square cross-section tower features load-bearing columns, allowing the office floors to remain mostly column-free. The building has one service lift and twelve passenger lifts: six for the low- rise portion of the building (floors 1–14) and six for the high-rise (floors 15–28).

The electoral ward was merged with Lyncombe at the boundary changes effected at the elections held on 2 May 2019;Bath and North East Somerset Council District Council Elections the two places have historically been connected (refer to the Lyncombe article). ==History== Widcombe was part of the hundred of Bath Forum. In 1877 Halfpenny Bridge, a pedestrian toll bridge, across the River Avon from Bath Spa railway station to Widcombe collapsed with the loss of about 10 lives amongst a large crowd going to the Bath and West Agricultural show. ==Architecture== Widcombe Parade is a commercial street lined with a mix of Georgian and Victorian buildings located near the Halfpenny Bridge, with buildings dating back as far as 1750. The area has been through many changes over the years, altered to improve traffic movement, removing an entire row of terraced houses at the west end of Widcombe Parade with the development of Rossiter Road as part of the main thoroughfare skirting the city centre of Bath. St. Matthew's Church, built 1846-1847, with one of the tallest spires in Bath, is positioned to be viewed at the east end of Widcombe Parade. Widcombe Manor House is a grade I listed manor house built in 1656. It is located on Church Street adjacent to St Thomas à Beckett Church. Crowe Hall is a Georgian house. It is a Grade II listed building, and the gardens are on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England. It was built around 1780 for Brigadier Crowe. It has had a succession of owners since who each adapted and renovated the building. A serious fire in 1926 destroyed a lot of the fabric of the building and further restoration was required. The house is surrounded by several hectares of sloping gardens, below Prior Park, which are terraced and include a rock garden and grotto. Widcombe Crescent is a terrace of 14 Georgian houses built in 1808 by Thomas Baldwin, and designated a Grade I listed building. ==Canal== Widcombe is where the Kennet and Avon Canal meets the River Avon. Bath Locks are a series of locks, just south of Pulteney Bridge, which climb through Widcombe. Alongside the bottom lock is a side pond and pumping station which pumps water up the locks to replace that used each time the lock is opened. The next stage of Bath Deep Lock is numbered 8/9 as two locks were combined when the canal was restored in May, 1976. A road bridge carrying the A36, constructed while the canal was in a state of disrepair passes over the original site of the lower lock. The new chamber has a depth of 19 ft 5ins, making it Britain's second deepest canal lock. Just above the 'deep lock' is an area of water enabling the lock to refill and above this is Wash House Lock (number 10), and soon after by Abbey View Lock (number 11), a grade II listed building by which there is another pumping station and in quick succession Pulteney Lock (12) and Bath top Lock (13). Above the top lock the canal passes through Sydney Gardens where it passes through two tunnels and under two cast iron footbridges dating from 1800. Cleveland Tunnel is 173 feet long and runs under Cleveland House, the former headquarters of the Kennet and Avon Canal Company. This is now a grade II* listed building. Many of the bridges over the canal are also listed buildings. ==Southcot== Southcot Burial Ground is a small former cemetery, now owned by the Bath Preservation Trust, who manage it for its wildlife and heritage.Bath Preservation Trust Heritage open day at Southcot Burial Ground] ==GeographyReferences== Category:Areas of Bath, Somerset Category:Electoral wards in Bath and North East Somerset ","title":"Widcombe, Bath"},{"id":"20340111","text":"Moody Jones (April 8, 1908 – March 23, 1988) was an American blues guitarist, bass player, and singer who contributed to the development of the postwar Chicago blues sound in the late 1940s. ==Life and career== Jones was born in Earle, Arkansas, on April 8, 1908.Komara 2006, p. 547. Raised in the church, he developed an interest in music at an early age and learned to play the guitar after his brother bought an old broken one for $3. When he was proficient enough, he started playing for country dances. By 1939 he had arrived in Chicago,Rowe 1973, p. 56. where he was one of numerous musicians performing on Maxwell Street and in nonunion venues who played an important role in the development of the postwar Chicago blues sound. He often performed with his first cousin, the singer and guitar player Floyd Jones.Rowe 1973, p. 57. By the late 1940s he was capable of playing any kind of music requested and had learned to play the piano, banjo and bass (including a homemade bass fashioned from a washtub, a broom handle and a clothesline), in addition to the guitar. He was regarded by his contemporaries as the best guitar player on the Chicago scene; the noted slide guitar player Muddy Waters warned Jones not to \\"fool with that slide\\" when he sat in with Waters's band one night.Rowe 1973, p. 75. Jones is most significant and best known for the singles he recorded in 1948 with his cousin Floyd Jones and the harmonica player Snooky Pryor, which were among the first recorded examples of the new style. The track \\"Snooky and Moody's Boogie\\" is said to have been the inspiration for Little Walter's 1952 hit \\"Juke\\". Jones made further recordings for JOB Records in the early 1950s, backing musicians such as Snooky Pryor and Johnny Shines. He sang three numbers on a 1952 session, but these were not released at the time (because, according to Jones, the label's owner, Joe Brown, thought his voice was \\"too rough\\"). One of the songs, \\"Rough Treatment\\", was recorded by the singer and guitarist Little Hudson (Hudson Shower) and released on the same label the following year.Leadbitter, Fancourt and Pelletier 1994, p. 81. After 1953 Jones stopped playing blues and joined a gospel group. By 1955 he had become a pastor of a Sanctified church.Rowe 1973, p. 194.

He attended Nazareth Baptist School, where he and for the first time experienced theatre by participating in school performances. In 1979, he made his directorial debut with the production \\"The King is The King\\" (based on a novel by the late Syrian playwright Saad Alla Wannous). He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from Tel Aviv University in 1982. While at Tel Aviv University, he directed \\"Miss Julie\\" written by August Strindberg and \\"Men in the Sun\\" written by the Palestinian writer, Ghassan Kanafani. \\"Men in the Sun\\" deals with the journey of four Palestinians seeking to travel to Kuwait in a hope of finding a job there during the oil boom. They went through a checkpoint after another, driven by the elusive dream of better future, only to be found dead upon reaching Kuwait. From 1983 until 1987, He worked at the Municipal Cultural Centre in Nazareth. While working at the Cultural Centre, he directed several plays, including, \\"The Dervishes are Looking for the Truth\\" written by the Syrian writer, Mustafa Al Hallaj as well as \\"Ashater Hasan\\" based on the folktale known by the same title. In 1986, he directed \\"A Song of a Deformed Soldier\\" which constituted a turning point in the theatrical production, combining sundry forms of theatrical art such puppets and masks. The play dealt with the compulsory military service amongst the Druze community. In 1987 he directed \\"Birds\\" a play written by Ibrahim Khalaileh which deals with the Palestinian desire to break free from the Israeli occupation. The play was well received in many European countries. In 1989, Awad received \\"Best Theatre Director\\" award as well as \\"Best Theatrical Work\\" award for the play \\"Jaber's Head\\" from Acre Theatre Festival. In 1991 along with his long-time mate, Mohammed Aoudtalla, he established Alsadaka Cultural Centre. In 1992 he directed The Alley in collaboration with Samia Kazmouz Bakri, which deals with the expatriation of Palestinians and the memories of one's home and city; places undergoing demographic changes. In 1993 he directed \\"The Night and The Mountain\\" written by Abed Alghaffar Makawi and produced in the Hebrew language. \\"The Night and The Mountain\\"- a Yemeni legend dealing with the fear caused by occupation- was a production of \\"Hakhan Hayerushalme\\" Theatre in Jerusalem. In 1994, he and his colleague, Eran Bene'el, directed \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" by William Shakespeare, a play that opened Lille Festival in France. It was a collaborative production between Al Kasaba Theatre in Ramallah and Al Khan Theatre in Jerusalem. The play was considered a huge success and received international acclaim. In 1995, \\"The Night and The Mountain\\" was remade, for Alkasaba theatre. From late 1995 and until 1/4/1998 he worked as the manager of Nazareth Contemporary Cultural Centre, a centre that was a product of a self initiative. During that time, the centre hosted numerous art galleries, folklore dance groups, seminars, and movies. In 1998, he directed a play by the name \\"Le Montrer\\" for Almidan Theatre. The play – which is about the humanization and rebellion of an artist's marionettes and their attempt to poison him - was written by Andrée Chedid. Starting from mid-1998 and until late 2002 he worked as the artistic manager of Almidan Theatre. And during that time, numerous productions were made, such as \\"Suhmata\\", \\"Edrab Maftouh\\", \\"Abeir File No.96/63\\", \\"Jazerat Al Ma'az\\", \\"Athkur\\" (a Musical), \\"Bayt Assayida\\", and \\"Zaghroudat Al Ard\\". In 1999 he directed \\"Abeir File No.96/63\\", a play based on the novel \\"The Collector\\" by the British author John Fowles. The play portrays the Israeli- Palestinian conflict; a settler kidnaps a Palestinian artist and holds her in a public bunker, with the claim that he wants to live with her in peace, which is impossible. The play harvested success and recognition due to the boldness in which the play addresses the Israeli occupation of Palestine. The play can be described in terms of production as confluence of cinema and theatre, where a cinematic footage is embedded in a theatrical production. In late 2002 he finished his term as a manager of Almidan Theatre, marking 5 years of success and achievements that catapulted the theatre to prominence and consequentially becoming a leading theatre serving as the national theatre for the Palestinian minority in Israel. In 2003 he directed \\"The Bus\\", a play portraying the post- intifada relations between Palestinians and Israelis and the Israeli perspective towards Palestinians in the light of suicide bombings that emanated at that time. Awad participated it numerous theatrical conferences and festivals in Europe and the Arab world, and was a guest lecturer in some of them, including Berlin Festival, Carthage Festival and Avignon, where he shared his experience and talked about the Palestinian theatre. He served as an artistic consultant in the Israel Film Fund. He served as a member of the artistic committee of Acre (Akko) Theatre Festival for a year. 2004-2007 He was the general manager of Almidan Theatre. At that time, the theatre was going through hardship. Therefore, upon becoming manager, he had to reestablish the theatre's former stature. He increased the number of productions per year, and managed to revive the theatre. During this period, he established the Almidan Theatre Festival. He finished writing his autobiography \\"Law Kont...\\" (If You Were...) which was written by the author and journalist Naji Daher. In 2008 he started to work as the manager of the Cultural Department in Nazareth Municipality. During that time, he established Nazareth International Children's Theatre Festival. He participated in the 24th ACCO, and Theatre in a Multicultural Society Jerusalem Conference, 7–9 January 2008. He's considered a leading theatre director since he had a leading role in shaping the Palestinian theatrical movement in Israel; Awad was the first to bring a cinematic approach to theatre, embedding a cinematic footage in a theatrical production.http://al-masrah.com/portal2/archives/362 Currently, he teaches theatre at the Drama Academy in Ramallah and works as the head of the Cultural Department in Nazareth. ==Work== Stage Productions *The King is The King (1979) *Men In The Sun (1982) *Miss Julia (1982) *The Dervishes are looking for the Truth (1985) *A Song of a Deformed Soldier (1986) *Birds (1987) *Jaber's Head (1989) *The Alley (1992) *The Night and The Mountain (1993) *Romeo And Juliet (1994)http://www.newsweek.com/id/124721 *Le Montrer (1998) *Abeer File No.96/63 (1999) *The Bus (2003) File:Rijal_Fe_Ashams.jpg Men In The Sun, 1982 File:Oghniat_Moshawah_Harb.jpg A Song of a Deformed Soldier, 1986 File:Ra'as_Almamluk_Jaber.jpg Jaber's Head, 1989 File:The_Alley.jpg The Alley, 1992 File:The_Alley_2.jpg The Alley, 1992 File:The_Night_and_The_Mountain_3.jpg The Night and The Mountain (Hebrew), 1993 File:The_Night_and_The_Mountain_4.jpg The Night and The Mountain (Hebrew), 1993 File:The_Night_and_The_Mounatin_5.jpg The Night and The Mountain (Hebrew), 1993 File:Romeo_and_Juliet_11.jpg Romeo and Juliet, 1994 File:Romeo_and_Juliet_1.jpg Romeo and Juliet, 1994 File:The_Night_and_The_Mountain.jpg The Night and The Mountain (Arabic), 1995 File:The_Night_and_The_Mountain_2.jpg The Night and The Mountain (Arabic), 1995 File:Ared_Al_Karakuz.jpg Le Montrer, 1998 File:Ared_Al_Karakuz_2.jpg Le Montrer, 1998 File:The_Bus (2003).jpg The Bus, 2003 File:The_Bus_2.jpg The Bus, 2003 ==Awards== Best Director - Acco Theatre Festival 1989 ==References *\\"Arab-German Literature\\", Iman O.

The principal investigator for ATIC is John Wefel of Louisiana State University. Team and closeup of the instrument ==Results== In November 2008, researchers published in Nature the finding of a surplus of high energy electrons. During a 5-week observatory period in 2000 and 2003, ATIC counted 70 electrons with energies in the range 300–800 GeV; these electrons were in excess of those expected from the galactic background. The source of these electrons is unknown, but it is assumed to be relatively close, no more than about 3000 lightyears away, since high energy electrons rapidly lose energy as they travel through the galactic magnetic field and collide with photons. The electrons could originate from a nearby pulsar or other astrophysical object, but the researchers were not able to identify a fitting object. According to another conjecture, the electrons result from collisions of Dark Matter particles, for example WIMP Kaluza-Klein particles of mass near 620 GeV.Mysterious electrons may be sign of dark matter, New Scientist, 19 November 2008Discovered: Cosmic Rays from a Mysterious, Nearby Object , NASA, 19 November 2008 ==Related data from other experiments== Earlier in the year, the satellite PAMELA had found excess positrons (the antiparticle of the electron) in the cosmic ray signal, also believed to originate from dark matter interactions. ATIC cannot distinguish between electrons and positrons, so it is possible that the two results are compatible. On the other hand, in November 2008 the Milagro experiment reported cosmic ray \\"hotspots\\" in the sky, possibly supporting astrophysical objects as sources of the surplus electrons.Cosmic-ray hot spots puzzle researchers, Nature News, 26 November 2008 In May 2009, observations by the Fermi space telescope were reported which did not support the spike of high-energy electrons seen by ATIC.Dark matter signal recedes into the shadows, New Scientist, 7 May 2009 ==References * ATIC page from the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Louisiana State University *Detailed report on ATIC 1 flight (Antarctica 2000/2001) *Detailed report on ATIC 2 flight (Antarctica 2002/2003) *Detailed report on failed ATIC 3 flight (Antarctica 2005) *Detailed report on ATIC 4 flight (Antarctica 2007/2008) Category:Cosmic-ray experiments Category:Science and technology in Antarctica Category:Balloon- borne experiments Category:Experiments for dark matter search ","title":"Advanced Thin Ionization Calorimeter"},{"id":"20340174","text":"Dighawa was a village development committee in Saptari District in the Sagarmatha Zone of south-eastern Nepal.

Aturia is characterized by a smooth, highly involute, discoidal shell with a complex suture and subdorsal siphuncle. The shell of Aturia is rounded ventrally and flattened laterally; the dorsum is deeply inpressed. The suture, one of the most complex in the Nautiloidea, has a broad flattened ventral saddle, narrow pointed lateral lobes, broad rounded lateral saddles, broad lobes on the dorso-umbilical slopes, and a broad dorsal saddle divided by a deep, narrow median lobe. The siphuncle is moderate in size and located subdorsally in the adapical dorsal flexture of the septum. Based on the feeding and hunting behaviors of living nautiluses, Aturia most likely preyed upon small fish and crustaceans. Comparisons of the nautilid cephalopods Nautilus cookanum (top) and A. alabamensis (bottom), from the Late Eocene Hoko River Formation, Oregon. Aturia is likely derived from species of the genus Aturoidea of the family Hercoglossidae.

Founder of Vincent Motorcycles, his designs influenced the development of motorcycles around the world. ==Early life== Plaque dedicated in 2002 by Thurrock Heritage on the side of High House, Horndon-on-the-Hill, Essex Philip Conrad Vincent was born in Wilbraham Gardens, Fulham on 14 March 1908. His mother, Ada Vincent, travelled back from Argentina to have her children in order to secure British citizenship. The family owned a cattle ranch between Monte Buey and Monte Maize, in the province of Córdoba, Argentina. His education began at St. George's, a British Preparatory School in Quilmes, a suburb of Buenos Aires. He was sent back to England to live with his uncle, John Vincent, who was a veterinary surgeon and lived at High House, Horndon on the Hill, Essex. Philip's education was continued there together with his two sisters, Gwendoline & Marjorie, a cousin and four other local children. He spent a year at Downsend Preparatory School, Leatherhead. He was then accepted at Harrow School where, in the school sanitorium during a three-week period of minor-illness in the company of another patient, an enthusiast, he was introduced to motorcycles. Philip bought his first motorcycle, a secondhand 350cc BSA from Gamages in Holborn at Christmas 1924 which vibrated badly and was replaced by an ABC; he designed his first bike in 1925. He went to Cambridge University in October 1926 to read Mechanical Sciences at Kings College. His father agreed that he could have a break from university to develop his first \\"Vincent Special\\", with a 350 cc MAG engine, in 1927. In 1928 he had registered a patent for his design of cantilever rear suspension and left Cambridge before graduating. The prototype used his own design of diamond-shaped frame constructed from short- tubes having 'lug' ends consistent with technology of the time, combined with his twin-spring, friction-damped cantilever rear suspension. Other main components added were proprietary – Webb front forks, Royal Enfield brakes, Moss gearbox and a McEvoy fuel tank.Motorcycle Sport, July 1979, p. 350 P.C.Vincent - A tribute by R.R.H. (Robert 'Bob' Holliday, ex-editor of Motor Cycling) Accessed and added 23 June 2014 ==Manufacturing== 200px Philip formed his first company with Frank Walker, a family friend. Howard R Davies, founder of the HRD marque and winner of the 1924 Senior Isle of Man TT was in financial difficulties and in 1928 with backing from his family and their cattle ranching business, Philip was able to acquire the trademark, goodwill and remaining HRD spares for £450. The company was promptly named Vincent HRD Co., Ltd., and the logo appeared with The Vincent added in very small letters over the top of the large HRD. Vincent designed a brand new motorcycle with his own spring frame and marketed it as Vincent HRD, with a choice of either JAP or Rudge engines. In 1928, the first Vincent-HRD motorcycle used a JAP single-cylinder engine in a Vincent-designed cantilever frame. The earliest known example is in Canberra, Australia. Some early bikes used Rudge-Python engines. But after a disastrous 1934 Isle of Man TT, with engine problems and all three entries failing to finish, Philip Vincent (with Phil Irving, who had joined the business in 1931) decided to build their own engines. 200pxIn 1935 the first Vincent powered motorcycle, the 499 cc Comet model was launched. It was quickly followed by the 998 cc Series A Rapide in 1936. During the war when motorcycle production ceased with production switched to armaments, Philip Vincent and Phil Irving designed the Series B twin-cylinder engine with integral gearbox which powered the Series B Rapide. Produced from the cessation of hostilities, it was further developed to power the legendary Vincent Black Shadow and Black Lightning models. In 1949 the HRD logo was dropped to prevent confusion with the \\"HD\\" of Harley Davidson in the important American Market. Philip Vincent also experimented with three-wheeled vehicles, amphibious vehicles, and automobiles. In 1932 the first 3-wheeler, \\"The Vincent Bantam\\" appeared, powered by a 293 cc SV JAP or 250 cc Villiers engine. It was a 2.5 cwt delivery van with a car seat and a steering wheel. The Bantam cost £57-10-0 and the windscreen and hood option cost £5-10-0. Production ceased in 1936. ==Writing== During the 1960s Vincent contributed to motorcycling journals, writing technical articles as a freelancer.

The firm's first major infant formula was developed in 1910, and Dextri-Maltose, a carbohydrate-based milk modifier was introduced in 1911, making it the first American product for infants to be approved clinically and recommended by physicians. The creation of Dextri- Maltose was provoked by problems experienced feeding his first son as an infant, which became life-threatening. The firm moved to Evansville, Indiana in 1915, as part of an effort to have easier access to the raw agricultural ingredients that were needed for its products. The relocation required Johnson to build a series of new plants and factories to replace the facilities he had left behind in New Jersey. Johnson retired from the firm and devoted his time to deep-sea fishing and golf. He was an active member of community organizations in Evansville and contributed the money needed to acquire a building used by an organization that fed sick babies, insisting that the donation remained anonymous until his death.

First-class or List A cricket, provincial rugby and international cricket or rugby are considered to be high level for the purposes of this list. To be eligible, players must have appeared for their country's national side in at least one of the sports. The lists below are alphabetical and sorted by the country in which the player spent their international career. Alfred Shaw and Arthur Shrewsbury, who organised the first British Isles rugby tour to Australasia in 1888 were also noted cricketers. While the Wales national rugby union team is a force in international rugby, the Wales national cricket team plays only rarely, and the nation of Wales is usually subsumed under England for cricketing purposes. Both Irish rugby players and cricketers, unlike soccer players, also play as one nation. The two sports have also had a considerable overlap in commentators and journalists, e.g. Robert Hudson, Howard Marshall, Lisa Olson, Denzil Batchelor, Ian Smith, Steve James, Allan Massie Many venues, including St. Helen's Rugby and Cricket Ground, Carisbrook, Eden Park, Raeburn Place, Headingley Stadium, Sydney Cricket Ground, McLean Park, The Oval, Cardiff Arms Park and Limavady Cricket and Rugby Club have been used for both rugby and cricket over the years. Due to the historical relationship between rugby league and rugby union, several of these players have also competed in high level rugby league as well.

In addition to this, although her performance or voice wasn't lacking, it is also claimed that she was running a 104 degree fever. This was Turkey's first entry to the Eurovision contest.

The ship was allegedly heading to Mumbai, India transporting 4,500 tons of chemical of unknown substance. Following a message received from the ship's crew that they were attacked by pirates, Turkish authorities informed British warships patrolling in the region as part of a NATO mission about the incident. NATO forces were asked by the Turkish government to intervene. The Karagöl is the second Turkish-owned vessel hijacked in the area within two weeks after MV Yasa Neslihan, and the second chemical tanker seized within two days, following the Philippines- flagged MV Stolt Strength. Kubilay Marangoz, a lawyer of the ship-owner, said in an interview that \\"Our hands are tied. We have nothing to do at the moment. We are in contact with the pirates. They have demanded ransom. We are negotiating with them.\\" He did not disclose the amount of the ransom demanded. == References == Category:Oil tankers Category:Chemical tankers Category:Maritime incidents in 2008 Category:Ships attacked and captured by pirates Category:Merchant ships of Turkey Category:Ships built in Istanbul Category:Piracy in Somalia Category:2007 ships ","title":"MV Karagöl"},{"id":"20340539","text":"{ class=\\"infobox rugby\\" style=\\"width: 16em; text-align: center;\\" - ! style=\\"font-size: 16px;\\"  Leinster League Division One -  style=\\"font-size: 12px; background: #BFD7FF;\\"  Founded -  style=\\"font-size: 12px;\\"  1994 -  style=\\"font-size: 12px; background: #BFD7FF;\\"  Nation -  style=\\"font- size: 12px;\\"  -  style=\\"font-size: 12px; background: #BFD7FF;\\"  Relegation To -  style=\\"font-size: 12px;\\"  Leinster League Division Two -  style=\\"font-size: 12px; background: #BFD7FF;\\"  Number of Teams -  style=\\"font-size: 12px;\\"  14 -  style=\\"font-size: 12px; background: #BFD7FF;\\"  Current Champions (2007–08) -  style=\\"font-size: 12px;\\"  Cill Dara RFC - } Leinster League Division One, as the name implies, is the first division of the Leinster League and started in the 1994/95 season.

It examines the Misrepresentation Act 1967 and addresses the extent of damages available under s 2(1) for negligent misrepresentation. The court controversially decided that under the Act, the appropriate measure of damages was the same as that for common law fraud, or damages for all losses flowing from a misrepresentation, even if unforeseeable. The reasoning of the decision has been much criticised by academic lawyers such as Treitel and Hooley, R Hooley, 'Damages and the Misrepresentation Act 1967' (1991) 107 LQR 547, : Hooley argues that fraud and negligence are qualitatively different and should be treated differently in order to reflect fraud's greater moral culpability. He says the Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 2(1) establishes only liability in damages but not their quantum, so Royscott was a poor decision. partly for its overly literal interpretation of the statute, and for its dubious finding of fact that a deliberately false document was made negligently, rather than fraudulently. ==Facts== Rogerson acquired on hire purchaseSee: Hire-Purchase Act 1964 a used Honda Prelude from a car dealer, Maidenhead Honda Centre Ltd. The car was priced at £7600, Rogerson paying a £1200 deposit, some 15.8% of the total. The balance came from a finance company, Royscot Trust Ltd. On Rogerson's behalf, the dealer filled in the application forms, falsely misrepresenting that the total cost was £8000 and the deposit was £1600 (20% of the total). Royscot approved the loan; but, had accurate figures been stated, they would have refused finance since its policy was not to lend money if the deposit was less than 20%. Rogerson began paying instalments, but in due course had cashflow difficulties. In August 1987 he dishonestly sold the car, knowing the car was not yet his to sell.He sold the car to a private purchaser for £7,200: the purchaser acquiring good title to the car under the provisions of the Hire Purchase Act 1964. A year later, he informed the finance company of the sale, and stopped paying instalments in September 1988, leaving the balance unpaid. Royscot sued the car dealer in damages, alleging that they had relied upon the dealer's misrepresentation, which induced them into the finance plan. Fraud was not mentioned, but Royscot claimed that had the dealer given the correct figures, they would have refused finance, and that the £3,625·24 loss was the dealer's fault. The dealer countered that the actual cause of Royscot's loss was Rogerson's unlawful sale of the car, since, if he had not sold it, Royscot would be entitled to its repossession. The dealer alleged Rogerson's unlawful sale broke the chain of causation between any misrepresentation and Royscot's loss. ==Judgment== Balcombe LJ and Ralph Gibson LJ held: * That for negligent misrepresentation under s.2(1), the correct measure of damages was tortious and the same as that for the tort of deceit. * The car dealer was liable for all the consequences of his misrepresentation, and therefore had to pay the losses incurred by Royscot Trust Ltd. * Rogerson's wrongful sale of the car was foreseeable and not a break in the chain of causation. The following passage of Balcombe LJ's judgment is key: B ==Case summary== The case caused some alarm among academic and practising lawyers. Given the relative lack of blameworthiness of a non- fraudulent defendant (who is at worst merely careless, and at best has an honest belief on reasonable grounds) for many years lawyers presumed that for non-fraudulent misrepresentation damages would be on a contract/negligence basis requiring reasonable foreseeability of loss. Royscot Trust Ltd v Rogerson changed all that. The court gave a literal interpretation of s.2 (which, to paraphrase, provides that where a person has been misled by an innocent misrepresentation then, if the misrepresentor would be liable to damages had the representation been made fraudulently, that person \\"shall be so liable\\"). The phrase \\"shall be so liable\\" was read literally to mean \\"as liable as for fraudulent misrepresentation\\". So, under the Misrepresentation Act 1967, damages for innocent misrepresentation are calculated as if the defendant had been fraudulent, despite the absence of deceit. Although this was almost certainly not the intention of Parliament, no changes to the law have been made to address this discrepancy. This is known as the fiction of fraud and also extends to tortious liability. Tortious liability can have a wider scope than usual contractual liability, as it allows the claimant to claim for loss even if it is not reasonably foreseeable, which is not possible with a claim for breach of contract due to the decision in Hadley v Baxendale. Inclusion of the representation into the contract as a term will leave the remedy for breach in damages as a common law right. The difference is that damages for misrepresentation usually reflect the claimant's reliance interest, whereas damages for breach of contract protect the claimant's expectation interest, although the rules on mitigation will apply in the latter case. In certain cases though, the courts have awarded damages for loss of profit, basing it on loss of opportunity.See East v Maurer [1991] 2 All ER 733. (S.2 does not specify how \\"damages in lieu\\" should be determined, and interpretation of this point is up to the courts). It is also unclear why the dealer's misrepresentation should have been considered \\"non-fraudulent\\" when it seems plain that the dealer deliberately misled the finance company. Arguably, this case should have been considered \\"fraudulent\\" as it complied with the 3-part guidelines of Derry v Peek. Since no reference was made to Derry v Peek, this case is open to challenge as per incuriam. ==See also== *Doyle v Olby (Ironmongers) Ltd [1969] 2 QB 158 ==Notes== Category:English contract case law Category:English misrepresentation case law Category:Court of Appeal (England and Wales) cases Category:1991 in case law Category:1991 in British law ","title":"Royscot Trust Ltd v Rogerson"},{"id":"20340663","text":"John Hardin Oldham (born November 6, 1932) is a former Major League Baseball player.

Despite not appearing in a single minor league game in 1956 (due to an injury), the Redlegs called Oldham up in September. On September 2, 1956, he entered the game against the Chicago Cubs in the third inning at Crosley Field in Cincinnati as a pinch runner for Ted Kluszewski, who himself had pinch-hit for third baseman Alex Grammas. The next batter popped out and Oldham was replaced on defense by Rocky Bridges.Box score for Oldham's MLB appearance Although he pitched for three more seasons in the minors, his MLB career was over. Oldham batted right and threw left- handed, which was itself unusual: as of 2015, only 553 players in MLB history (about 3% of all players) hit right and threw left, with Hall of Famer Rickey Henderson probably the best known. ==Coaching== From 1985–97, Oldham coached the Broncos of Santa Clara University, leading them to four NCAA appearances and three West Coast Conference championships.

It was five times as bright as a full moon. Over 400 people reported seeing it. There are several videos of the meteoroid on YouTube. The object split into multiple pieces before widespread impact. The meteoroid entered the atmosphere at approximately 14 kilometres per second and is estimated to have been about the size of a desk and have had a mass of approximately 10 tonnes. The village of Marsden, Saskatchewan became a hub of activity for meteorite hunters, being just south of the estimated 20 square kilometre debris field. Locals dubbed the object the \\"Marsden Meteor\\"; many of the residents reported seeing, hearing and even smelling the burning fragments as they fell. The meteor was also referred to as the \\"Buzzard Coulee fireball\\", named after the area where searchers found the first fragments. Buzzard Coulee is located approximately from the Battle River valley. The first pieces of the rock were found by Ellen Milley, a University of Calgary Master's student on November 27, 2008. Milley was a part of a team working with Dr. Alan Hildebrand, University of Calgary professor and Canadian Research Chair in Planetary Science in the ice of a fish pond about south east of Lloydminster, Saskatchewan, near the hamlet of Lone Rock. Lone Rock, Battle River, Marsden and other names were possible candidates for the meteorite name, but the University of Calgary researchers followed the local residents' lead in officially calling the fall Buzzard Coulee, after the oldest-named geographic feature in the fall area. Ten pieces were initially found; the largest fragment weighed and smallest was . In total, more than one thousand meteorite fragments have been collected from the 10-tonne fireball, among them are two fragments. This event has set a new Canadian record for the most number of pieces recovered from a single meteorite fall. Robert A. Haag, a famous American meteorite hunter, offered $10,000 to anyone who gave him the first one-kilogram chunk of the meteorite. \\"We can see on the videos that there were three big pieces that continue here. And those aren't found yet,\\" said Alan Hildebrand on May 4, 2009. The meteorite hunters have, however, broken a world's record for collecting over 1,000 fragments, the most ever collected from a single meteor fall.

According to the 2011 Nepal census, the population of Manraja was 4,447, which consisted of 902 households. The village development committee was included in Bodebarsain municipality (Bodebarsain Nagar Palika in Nepali) in 2017. == Religious places  Shree Raja Ji Than Temple === thumb The Shree Raja Ji Than Temple is in the Bodebarsain Municipality of Manraja. The temple was built from ancient stones that were carefully hand-carved with different symbols typical of the Mithila region. The temple contains rectangular stones on either side that are approximately high and wide, which are carved with a variety of symbols. Near the roots of trees, there are many fragments of black stones carved with different symbols. According to locals, the statue is known by the name of Shree Raja Ji Baba of Shree Lakshmi Narayan. The statues of the temple are fragmented. Some theorize that the statues may have been damaged during the spread of Islam into Southeast Asia. According to a survey conducted by the government of Nepal, the temple is situated on the remains of an older temple as evidenced by some older rectangular hand-carved stones found within the temple. A tamarind (imli) tree lives within the temple. The temple is surrounded by various temples dedicated to the God Hanuman, Lord Shiva, and the Goddesses Saraswati and Durga. Every year at Baishakhi, a puja (prayer service) is performed, and a festival in the Raja Ji Than area celebrates the new year. Festivals are held on auspicious days such as Ekadashi, Shivaratri, Chaturdashi, and Rama Navami. In times of misfortune, people go to the temple to practice bhajan, puja, aarti, yagya, hawan, and other ceremonies. Some people also visit the temple regularly to pray for their wishes to be fulfilled by their god. Sacrificial offerings are often placed within the temple. These include animals (pigeons, goats, etc.), as well as offerings of kheer, laddu, peda, paan, and supari. It is a common tradition for people who suffer from ailments, particularly skin diseases, to present four pairs of brinjal (eggplant) as an offering for a cure. The local people of the Bodebarsain region worship at the Raja Ji Than Temple and consider it sacred. ==Politics== In Phase 3 of the 2017 Nepalese local elections, the Federal Socialist Forum Nepal achieved victories in both the mayoral and deputy mayoral posts in the Bodebarsain municipality of the Saptari district.

He was the eldest in the family and had two brothers and two sisters. He attended Upper Sheringham School, King Edward VI Middle School, Norwich (merged with the Presbyterian School to become the City of Norwich School) and Downing College, Cambridge. He gained first in Part 1 of the Natural Science Tripos in 1905 and in Part 2 of the Historical Tripos in 1906. ==Career== He became a schoolteacher and later an educational administrator. He became an education officer for London County Council. He was a tutor at Bede College, Durham then Assistant Master at St. Andrews College, Toronto and Tewfikieh School, Cairo. He became a lecturer at Khedivial Training College, Egypt. From 1914-9 he served in the Royal West Kent Regiment in Gallipoli, becoming a Captain then a Major. He was injured at Ypres. After the war he was Assistant Master at Eton College. He became a District Inspector for the Board of Education from 1919–27, then Chief Inspector of Technical Schools and Colleges in 1932. He was a Senior Chief Inspector from 1933–40, then Education Officer to the LCC from 1940-51. This was during The Blitz. Labour had controlled London County Council since 1934. ===Comprehensive schools=== From 1925-6 he visited America specifically the states of New York and Ohio, and was impressed by the democratic nature of the high schools in terms of social diversity, although overall academic performance of such schools was less well-researched; it was of secondary interest. He noted that the system did not account for the different needs of the school population, but he nonetheless liked the general nature of the schools. The Labour Party had been a champion of grammar schools in the 1940s, but by the 1950s had begun to look at Graham Savage's ideas instead which had been implemented partly in London. In 1947 he introduced the London School Plan of comprehensive schools, wholly driven by the wishes of the incumbent Labour council. Although largely responsible for their first introduction, he had some misgivings about the comprehensive system; he hoped these could be alleviated, specifically that although at the same school, pupils would study different courses in keeping with their abilities. In this his ideas were more for bi-lateral schools than comprehensives. He explicitly did not want all pupils of differing abilities studying the same courses. To achieve this, schools would have to be very large - up to 400 in each year. In many comprehensive schools this is simply not possible. He was knighted in 1947. He thought highly of direct grant grammar schools, saying in 1965 that they were the scaffolding on which a good state system of secondary education is slowly being built. Most of London's fifty five state grammar schools would stay until the 1970s. He retired in 1951. ===Outcome of his work=== In later life, despite his satisfaction with lending British national pedagogy a more democratic character, he thought that the educational standards of comprehensive schools might have declined more than the marginal amount he had predicted in 1928.Peter Hitchens August 2002 ==Personal life== He married May Thwaites, from Southchurch in Essex, in 1911 in Rochford. They had two sons and a daughter. ==See also== * Debates on the grammar school * Tripartite System * Anthony Crosland * Social mobility ==References== Category:1886 births Category:1981 deaths Category:Alumni of Downing College, Cambridge Category:Comprehensive education Category:English educational theorists Category:Schoolteachers from Norfolk Category:Local government officers in England Category:People educated at Norwich School Category:People from Erpingham ","title":"Graham Savage"},{"id":"20341000","text":"Pinault's law is a Proto-Indo-European (PIE) phonological rule named after the French Indo-Europeanist Georges-Jean Pinault who discovered it.

As a consequence, voting was not held in his constituency, as well as two other constituencies, at the time of the July-August 2012 parliamentary election. On 17 August 2012, the parliamentary terms of Ngolo and the other two deputies were extended by the Constitutional Court until such time as voting could be held.

Under Ngolo's leadership, the PCT won a parliamentary majority in the 2012 election, the first time it had done so since the introduction of multiparty politics. Speaking to Jeune Afrique after the election, he argued that the state of the party had improved greatly in the preceding year. Prior to his election as Secretary-General, the party was suffering from \\"lethargy\\", according to Ngolo: \\"the party did not work, the rules were not observed\\". He also dismissed allegations of fraud from the opposition and said that the PCT was committed to \\"democratic pluralism\\". Reflecting on the events of the early 1990s, he credited the PCT and Denis Sassou Nguesso with the transition to multiparty politics and democratic elections, emphasizing that Sassou Nguesso had stepped down after his 1992 electoral defeat and did not try to \\"cling to power\\".

It was founded by the government of Moscow and by the commercial house Mosexpo. It began broadcasting on March 1, 1995 on the UHF band. It was only broadcast in the territory of Moscow and the Moscow Region. ==History== Initially, much of the material broadcast were TV shops, musical or entertainment programs, soap operas, videoclips and concerts. The station was broadcast in Moscow on Channel 5 and blocked the reception of Petersburg Channel 5 in the Moscow area. The time of broadcasting was initially from 00:30 to 12:30 daily. From April 1, 1998, a number of programs appeared with a parallel BIZ-TV logo, previously broadcasting at 2x2, and in the summer of the same year, the air consisted almost entirely of those programs that then became an integral part of the MTV Russia TV channel in its first three - four years of broadcasting. Since September 26, 1998, the broadcasting of Teleexpo's own programs was discontinued, according to the license of TeleExpo with the channel logo in the lower right corner, broadcast on TV channel MTV Russia in the morning and night. The broadcasting of this channel ceased in October 2001 for commercial and political reasons. Channel 33 UHC and Channel 5 broadcast Euronews from October 2001 to September 2017, and then for political reasons was removed, too. ==Programs== Originally, it focused on music and entertainment. In the first year of broadcasting, it broadcast the programs Alive and A-Erotic, and soon added more television series, predominantly those produced in Mexico. In May 1996 the channel began to show art films and television concerts. At the same time, TeleExpo began to be listed in all television guides. By 1998 it increasingly began to focus on music, and by that summer was broadcasting musical programming almost exclusively. On September 26, 1998, Teleexpo began to transmit MTV Russia in the morning and at night.

Olivella biplicata (Sowerby, 1825) . accessed 22 November 2008. ==Life habits== Three specimen of Olivella biplicata. These snails are carnivorous or omnivorous sand-burrowers. ==Shell description== This shell of this species is quite solid, and large for an Olivella, with adult shells ranging from 20 mm to 27 mm in length, about one inch. The shell is smooth, shiny, and is an elongated oval in shape. The shell is often some shade of greyish purple, but it can also be whitish, tan, or dark brown. On the darker color forms there is often some rich yellow above the suture on the spire. At the anterior end of the long narrow aperture there is a siphonal notch, from which the siphon of the living animal protrudes.

It is being studied as a possible treatment for several types of cancer, particularly cancer that is at an advanced stage or has not responded to chemotherapy. Vatalanib is orally active, that is, it is effective when taken by mouth. Vatalanib is being developed by Bayer Schering and Novartis. It inhibits all known VEGF receptors, as well as platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta and c-kit, but is most selective for VEGFR-2. ==Development== Vatalanib was discovered through high-throughput screening. Retrieved on October 29, 2008. It has been extensively investigated in Phase I, II and III clinical trials. Two large, randomized controlled Phase III trials have studied the effect of adding vatalanib to the FOLFOX chemotherapy regimen in people with metastatic colorectal cancer: CONFIRM-1, whose participants had not yet received any treatment for their cancer; and CONFIRM-2, in which participants had received first-line treatment with irinotecan and fluoropyrimidines. Vatalanib produced no significant improvement in overall survival (the primary endpoint of the studies), although it did significantly increase progression-free survival in CONFIRM-2. Both trials found that progression-free survival was improved in people with high levels of lactate dehydrogenase, an enzyme used as a marker of tissue breakdown; the reasons for and implications of this difference are still unclear. ==Adverse effects== The adverse effects of vatalanib appear similar to those of other VEGF inhibitors. In the CONFIRM trials, the most common side effects were high blood pressure, gastrointestinal upset (diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting), fatigue, and dizziness. ==Notable Users== Patrick Swayze, a popular actor in the 1980's who starred in such films as Dirty Dancing and Road House was given this drug when he was diagnosed with Stage IV Pancreatic Cancer in 2008. Doctors hoped the drug would cut off blood supply to the tumor http://www.webmd.com/cancer/pancreatic- cancer/news/20090915/patrick-swayze-dies-of-pancreatic-cancer. Despite this, Swayze died on September 14th, 2009, 20 months after being diagnosed. ==References * Ongoing and completed clinical trials of vatalanib at ClinicalTrials.gov (U.S. National Institutes of Health) Category:Angiogenesis inhibitors Category:Tyrosine kinase inhibitors Category:Experimental cancer drugs ","title":"Vatalanib"},{"id":"20341315","text":"Croatia has had two adaptations of the singing competition Pop Idol under two different titles and on two different networks: * Hrvatski Idol, which was aired from 2004–2005 on Nova TV * Hrvatska traži zvijezdu, which premiered February 22, 2009 on RTL Croatia Category:Television series by Fremantle (company) ","title":"Idol (Croatian TV series)"},{"id":"20341327","text":"For the reservoirs near Stalybridge, in Tameside, Greater Manchester, see Higher Swineshaw Reservoir and Lower Swineshaw Reservoir Swineshaw Reservoir is a reservoir near Glossop, north Derbyshire.

Hurst Reservoir was on the Hurst Brook and Mossy Lea Reservoir was to take water from the Shelf Brook. Only the Hurst reservoir was constructed before the money ran out. Mossy Lea Reservoir was constructed privately by the Duke of Norfolk. Swineshaw, on Swineshaw Clough, was adopted in 1864 by the Glossop Water Company to provide drinking water for Glossop. It was taken over in 1929 by the Glossop Corporation Waterworks. This became part of the Manchester Corporation Waterworks in 1959.

Common names include Lemon Ball cactus, Golden Ball cactus and Yellow Tower cactus. Botanist Karl Moritz Schumann named it after Wilhelm Lenninghaus (1845-1918),Note: His name was Lenninghaus, but the species is leninghausii without the double \\"n\\". a native of North Rhine-Westphalia who, in the 1880s, left his hometown of Ennepetal and emigrated to Porto Alegre, Brazil, where he became Guillermo Lenninghaus, and collected cacti for the German grower Haage. P. leninghausii is native to the Rio Grande do Sul province in the south of Brazil. In those regions, winter nights are cold, with a light freeze. These cacti survive in these conditions because they are quite dry at that time. P. leninghausii shows cactus species nomadism; it was successively included in genus Pilocereus K. Schumann 1895, Malacocarpus (K.Schumann) Britton & Rose 1922, Notocactus (K.Schumann) A.Berger 1929, Eriocactus (K.Schumann) Backeberg 1942, and finally ended up in Parodia (K. Schumann) F.H.Brandt 1982. ==Description== The species have many thin golden spines. The young plants are globular, then columnar up to 1m tall, 12 cm diameter and about 30 ribs. Old plants cluster from the base. Flowers are yellow, 5 cm diameter, at the top of the plants, but only if adult (at least 20 cm tall) Sometimes, they present monstruous forms. There is a cultivar albispina with white spines. ==Cultivation== As most of the cactus, they need well drained soil, sunny exposure, regularly watering in summer and not at all in winter.

The contest was held at BC Place stadium in Vancouver, British Columbia. The Stampeders won the contest 20–16 to claim their seventh Grey Cup championship in franchise history and first since 2008. Calgary quarterback Bo Levi Mitchell was named the Grey Cup Most Valuable Player, while Hamilton's Andy Fantuz received the Dick Suderman Trophy as most outstanding Canadian. ==Host city== In 2008, the CFL awarded an expansion team to Ottawa and named the city host of the 2014 Grey Cup, conditional on the franchise being ready to play by 2010. Lawsuits and construction delays during the renovation of Frank Clair Stadium pushed the start date for the city's expansion team, the Ottawa RedBlacks, to 2014. As a consequence, the CFL sought a new venue for the contest. The CFL moved the game to BC Place Stadium in Vancouver, British Columbia, which had most recently hosted the 99th Grey Cup in 2011. (Ottawa would eventually be awarded the 105th Grey Cup.) ==Path to the Grey CupCalgary Stampeders=== The Calgary Stampeders finished the regular season with the top record in the CFL at 15–3. Their 15 wins also tied the franchise record. They advanced directly to the West Division final where they hosted the Edmonton Eskimos. Led by running back Jon Cornish, the Stampeders eliminated the Eskimos with a 43–18 victory. Cornish was named the Most Outstanding Canadian for 2014 after leading the CFL in rushing with 1,082 yards despite missing nine games due to injuries. He was one of two award winners for the Stampeders as centre Brett Jones was named Most Outstanding Offensive Lineman. The team was led by 24-year-old quarterback Bo Levi Mitchell, who stood 15–2 in his career as a starter and who won his first playoff game in the victory over Edmonton. ===Hamilton Tiger-Cats=== The Hamilton Tiger-Cats finished atop the East Division with a 9–9 record. They hosted the Montreal Alouettes, who also ended the regular season at 9–9, in the East Final. The contest was the first playoff game at Tim Hortons Field, which opened mid-season and where Hamilton won all six home games played there. Hamilton advanced to their second consecutive Grey Cup final with a 40–24 victory that featured two punt returns for touchdowns by Brandon Banks. Hamilton's offence was led by quarterback Zach Collaros, who played his first season as a CFL starter in 2014 after serving as the back-up to Ricky Ray with the Toronto Argonauts for two seasons. ===Head to head=== The Stampeders entered the game as 8-point favourites to win the title as the dominant story line entering the game centred around whether Hamilton could complete an upset of Calgary. The Stampeders won both regular-season games, 10–7 at Calgary in week four and 30–20 at Hamilton in week eight. Both teams were without key players during those games as both Jon Cornish and Zach Collaros were unavailable for both contests. The Grey Cup game pitted the best rushing offence in the CFL – Calgary averaged 143.4 yards per game rushing – against a Hamilton team that allowed the fewest rushing yards, 73.4 per game. The 2014 Grey Cup represented the third time the Stampeders and Tiger-Cats had met in the championship. Hamilton won the 87th Grey Cup in 1999 by a 32–21 score, which avenged a Calgary 26–24 victory at 1998's 86th Grey Cup. Hamilton made its second consecutive appearance in the title game; they lost the 101st Grey Cup to the Saskatchewan Roughriders. Calgary's most recent appearance came in 2012 when they lost the 100th Grey Cup to the Toronto Argonauts. ==Game summary== The Hamilton Tiger-Cats face the Calgary Stampeders in the 102nd Grey Cup. The Hamilton Tiger-Cats were unable to get their offence working early in the game as they ended the first quarter with −12 yards rushing and only +4 net yards. Calgary had 120 net yards, 117 passing, but began the second quarter with only a 7–0 lead following a one-yard touchdown rush by Drew Tate at the 9:48 mark. Tate scored a second touchdown 48 seconds into the second quarter and Calgary added a field goal to extend their lead to 17–0. The Stampeders maintained the score when Demonte Bolden blocked Hamilton's attempted field goal with six minutes remaining in the half, however the Tiger-Cats scored their first points of the game three minutes later when quarterback Zach Collaros connected with Brandon Banks on a 45-yard pass play; Calgary led 17–7 at the half. Stampeders quarterback Bo Levi Mitchell completed ten consecutive passes midway through the game, tying him for the third longest streak in Grey Cup history, but the Stampeders could add only a field goal in the third quarter to take a 20–7 lead. Hamilton scored a field goal early in the fourth quarter to cut the deficit to ten points, then regained possession after Delvin Breaux intercepted Mitchell for the only turnover of the game. Collaros moved the Tiger-Cats offence to within three yards of the goal line, but Hamilton was forced to settle for a field goal. The Tiger-Cats against marched the ball into Calgary territory but were again prevented from scoring a touchdown after Corey Mace sacked Collaros on second down. Hamilton scored a third consecutive field goal to cut the lead to 20–16 with 2:05 remaining in the contest. Calgary was forced to punt with less than a minute to play. Brandon Banks received the punt and ran the ball 90 yards for an apparent touchdown to give Hamilton a lead; however, the play was called back when Taylor Reed was penalized for an illegal block. Instead, Hamilton's offence began at their defensive 12-yard line. The Tiger-Cats subsequently ran out of time as Collaros' attempted pass on the final play of the game fell incomplete. The 20–16 victory represented the franchise's seventh Grey Cup championship and first since 2008. Bo Levi Mitchell was named the Grey Cup Most Valuable Player after completing 25 of 34 passes for 334 yards. Hamilton's Andy Fantuz received the Dick Suderman Trophy as the Most Outstanding Canadian. He received six passes for 81 yards. ==Scoring summary== ;First Quarter :CGY – TD Tate 1 yd rush (5:12) 7–0 CGY ;Second Quarter :CGY – TD Tate 1 yd rush (14:26) 14–0 CGY :CGY – FG Paredes 11 yd (2:17) 17–0 CGY :HAM – TD Banks 45 yd receiving (1:21) 17–7 CGY ;Third Quarter :CGY – FG Paredes 20 yd (4:20) 20–7 CGY ;Fourth Quarter :HAM – FG Medlock 25 (11:55) 20–10 CGY :HAM – FG Medlock 12 (5:35) 20–13 CGY :HAM – FG Medlock 37 (2:05) 20–16 CGY ==Entertainment== Alternative rock band Imagine Dragons headlined the contest's half time show. It was the third time an American band has been brought in to perform, a decision that some Canadians have criticized due to a preference for using the stage to promote local talent. Canadian artist Dallas Smith performed during the pre-game festivities and Nikki Yanofsky (accompanied by 102 members of the Coastal Sound Music Academy) sang O Canada. In Vancouver, organizers opted to host events and festivities in a single location around the city's convention centre in a bid to create a \\"small-town feel\\" and try to \\"overcome the big-small divide that is apparent between CFL cities\\". ==Attendance== The 2014 Grey Cup game was not a sellout, with 1,423 tickets remaining unsold. Vancouver having hosted the event just three years prior was cited as the main cause for the slump, while the mediocre performance by home side BC Lions provided few opportunities to drum up interest over the course of the season. ==References== Category:Grey Cup Category:Grey Cups hosted in Vancouver Category:Hamilton Tiger-Cats Category:Calgary Stampeders Grey Cup Category:2010s in Vancouver Grey Cup Grey Cup Grey Cup Grey Cup ","title":"102nd Grey Cup"},{"id":"20341405","text":"Fyodor Grigoryevich Chernozubov (14 September 1863 – 14 November 1919; sometimes seen as Theodore G.

It was written by members of the Association of Teachers of Mathematics and found its way into school computers, predominantly in the UK. The game is controlled by a contemporaneous two-word input system in the form of \\" \\", e.g. \\"get book\\", and includes several mathematical and logical puzzles. The target audience for L is mid-late primary (elementary) school children, and the puzzles are based on this level of critical thinking. ==Introduction text== It is a very hot day. You are sitting on the grass outside a crumbling palace. Your sister is reading a book called \\"Fractions and the Four Rules - 5000 Carefully Graded Problems\\". You are bored and the heat is making you feel a little sleepy. Suddenly you see an old man dressed as an abbot. He glances at you nervously and disappears through a small door in the side of the palace. ==Memorable characters/puzzles== The recommended usage of L was for a class of students (or smaller groups) to attempt solving the various puzzles in the game in short pieces over the course of a semester, year or similarly protracted time and is hence somewhat difficult to remember. Drogo Robot Guard - These appear somewhat randomly at different times during the game and attempt to capture the player. It is possible to evade capture (a small puzzle in itself), and avoid being taken to the attic. Runia - It is possible to solve the game by completing most of the puzzles, but a full solution includes rescuing Runia, a princess who is imprisoned within the game. Three Blind Mice - One of the puzzles is a musical puzzle, where you have to play the correct tune on a piano in order to obtain a special item. ==References *L - a walkthrough *L - video playthrough *L at the Classic Adventures Solution Archive *L at the Interactive Fiction Database Category:Mathematical education video games Category:Children's educational video games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom ","title":"L – A Mathemagical Adventure"},{"id":"20341554","text":"Dalbergia cearensis, radial and cross section Dalbergia cearensis, with common names Brazilian kingwood, kingwood, tulipwood, and violetwood, is a small tree endemic to Brazil.

Steinar Nilsen took over as head coach after the six-year tenure of Mons Ivar Mjelde. The club didn't see the big signings or sales in the January transferwindow. Local-lad Erlend Hanstveit left the club after 10 years, while thought-to-be star striker Njogu Demba-Nyrén was sold only one year after signing with the club following a season where his performance was below expectations. The season started horrific for the \\"pride of Bergen\\". In the first premiership match of the season, Brann lost 1-3 against newly promoted Sandefjord, followed by two ties, a loss and another tie. Brann didn't win a game until the sixth round where they beat Bodø/Glimt 2-0 away. The club's form improved as the season went by, but they were never a serious contender to the league title. After being knocked out in the Quarterfinals of the Norwegian Football Cup by Odd Grenland), the season seemed to end up as a total disappointment for the fans. One of the few highlights of the season was the performances of Erik Huseklepp who had his definite breakthrough as a player. In his first season as a striker, Huseklepp scored 15 goals in the league, only two goals shy of the top scorer Rade Prica. The technical striker had previously played as a right winger, scoring 4 goals in 4 seasons for Brann. He also became a regular in the national team squad, scoring his first goal for Norway in the World Cup qualifier against Scotland on August 2, 2009. Before the last games of season, Brann found themselves in a situation where they had a legitimate chance to snatch the bronze medals, but in the end they had to settle for a fifth place, which didn't qualify for a spot in the Europa League. ==Information== Manager: Steinar Nilsen League: Norwegian Premier League Shirt supplier: Kappa Shirt sponsor: Sparebanken Vest Average league attendance: 15,932 (4th best in club history at the time) League result : 5th Norwegian Cup: Quarterfinals (1-5 against Odd Grenland) Top goal scorer: Erik Huseklepp (15 in league, 0 in cup, 15 in total) Player of the year: - ==Team kit== The team kits for the 2009 season were produced by Kappa and the main shirt sponsor was Sparebanken Vest.

Nicolai Misje did not get his contract renewed, while Michael Thwaite was sold to the newly started Australian club Gold Coast United . *January 10: Erlend Hanstveit chose to not take Brann up on their last contract offer. He reasoned his decision with his wish to play abroad. The wingback had played for the club since 1998. *January 26: Njogu Demba- Nyrén returned to Denmark after signing a 3.5 year contract with OB. In addition to a money fee worth between NOK 6 and 7 million, Brann also got the Danish striker David Nielsen. *February 26: Brann signed the young striker Cato Hansen from Bryne FK. *February 27: Rodolph Austins transfer to Brann was made permanent. The Jamaican midfielder signed a four-year deal with Brann. *March 11: Yaw Amankwah was loaned out to Alta IF. *March 12: Kristian Flittie Onstad was brought to Brann on a loan deal from Esbjerg fB. *March 16: Brann opened their Premiership-season with a poor performance against the newly promoted Sandefjord Fotball. Brann lost 1-3 in Sandefjord in a match that featured the official debuts of Bjørnar Holmvik, Cato Hansen, David Nielsen and Kristian Flittie Onstad. *March 22: Brann took their first point of the season after playing 1-1 against the reigning champions Stabæk Fotball. The match was characterized by terrible playing conditions, as the new gras at Brann Stadion hadn't had time to grow properly into the soil. *April 27: Brann took their first three-pointer of the season after a 2-0 win against Bodø/Glimt away in the sixth round of the 2009 Norwegian Premier League. David Nielsen scored both of Brann's goals, his first in the red jersey. *May 13: Brann advanced to the second round of the Norwegian Cup after a 6-0 win over IL Høyang. *May 24: Brann advanced to the third round of the Norwegian Cup after a 2-0 win over Lyngbø SK. *June 17: Brann advanced to the fourth round of the Norwegian Cup after a 4-2 win over Nest-Sotra. *July 9: Brann advanced to the quarterfinals of the Norwegian Cup after a 1-0 win over FC Lyn Oslo. *August 5: Brann signed the Uruguayan striker Diego Guastavino from FC Lyn Oslo. *August 7: Cato Hansen was loaned out to fellow Bergen-based club Løv- Ham for the remainder of the season. *August 8: Brann was knocked-out of the Norwegian Cup after a 5-1 loss against Odd Grenland in the quarterfinals. The match at Skagerak Arena was not without controversy. After 29 minutes, Håkon Opdal and Hassan El Fakiri got injured in a duel after a cornerkick. Opdal injured his knee, but was able to continue, while El Fakiri had to leave the pitch temporary to treat a cut in the head. Three minutes later, Opdal got an easy pass that he intended to play up the pitch. Just when he was about to kick the ball, Opdal's knee gave up on him, causing him to fall to the ground and losing control over the ball. Odd-striker Péter Kovács took advantage of the situation and put the ball in the net with ease. His actions was seen as an act of unsportsmanship and a breach of Fair Play by the Brann-players. Brann also had Eirik Bakke sent off, while Ólafur Örn Bjarnason missed a penalty kick. *August 12: Bjørn Dahl signed a contract with Hønefoss BK on a free transfer. *August 26: Ármann Björnsson signed with League One-club Hartlepool United on a free transfer. *September 1: Azar Karadas signed with Turkish-club Kasımpaşa S.K.. The deal was worth around NOK 2.000.000. *Oktober 19: On a press conference on Brann Stadion, Brann's director of football Bjørn Dahl announced a NOK 20m deficit, due to lack of revenue as a direct consequence of the credit crunch. *November 1: Brann finished their season with a 1-1 draw at home against league champions Rosenborg BK. *November 21: Johan Thorbjørnsen signed for Løv-Ham. ==StatisticsAppearances and goals=== The table shows matches and goals in the Norwegian Premier League and Norwegian Cup, and was last updated after the game against Rosenborg BK on November 1, 2009 } ===Top scorers=== Includes all competitive matches.

They were renowned for their unpredictable on-stage antics and the offensive lyrical content of their songs. While the band has had at least 10 members, outrageous frontman Rohan \\"Marxi\\" Marx has been the one constant. Mobile Stud Unit were originators of self-described 'pus-rock' - a sound heavily influenced by early New Zealand punk bands such as those that featured on the AK79 compilation of late seventies Auckland punk bands, mixed with outwardly offensive \\"fart jokey\\" lyrics. Song titles include \\"Stroke Victim\\", \\"Grut Sniffer\\" and \\"Wheel of Clitoris\\". ==The early years== The Mobile Stud Unit was formed, by chance, when they entered a busking competition in 1993. The winners of the competition would go on to open for renowned New Zealand band The Mutton Birds. Winning band the Romantic Andes were unable to perform the support gig, so it went to second-place-getters Mobile Stud Unit. This posed a problem for MSU - having only one song, they were then required to write enough material to last a whole set. According to folklore the band nearly jeopardised their first official gig when they decided to get drunk and start tackling Mutton Birds frontman Don McGlashan. ==\\"Stu's Pie Cart\\"== \\"Stu's Pie Cart\\", off MSU's 1997 CD Blood Spew is a lament on the closing of Stu's Rivercity Diner, a popular pie cart in Hamilton East's Grey Street. The song was featured on Radio New Zealand National's Sounds Historical programme and mentioned in the 2008 book The Great New Zealand Pie Cart. ==10th anniversary== MSU held their 10th anniversary in 2004 (11 years after they were formed). The line-up for the night included current and previous members who performed all MSU songs in chronological order to a full house at Diggers Bar, Hamilton. Hamilton ska band Bwa Da Riddum reunited to play support for MSU. ==15th anniversary and break-up== MSU celebrated their 15th anniversary by calling it quits. The band played their final gig at Altitude Bar, Hamilton. Support was provided by Th' Shrugs and TV's Wayne Anderson. MSU played two sets of their greatest hits. The most recent line-up was joined by former members Jocko, Jamie Stone, Dave O'Shea, Deano Ballswinger and SS Stormtrooper. The band also released their final album, Road Kill, a best-of compilation. While MSU have broken up before, Marxi stated on the band's Facebook page that this time the band has broken up for good. ==2018 reunion== Despite Marxi’s statement that the 15th anniversary was the end for MSU, the band reformed to support The Hard-Ons (with 5 Girls and the Illicit Wah-Wahz) at the Yot Club in Raglan on 19 May 2018. Joining Marxi in the line-up was Sven Tainui, Leroy Brown and an unidentified drummer. SS Stormtrooper appeared as a guest vocalist on Gunna Bash. Two new songs were included in the set; Weather Bomb and Dog. ==Soundtracks== The track \\"Gunna Bash\\" from their 2002 album Flaps is also featured on the soundtrack of the feature film The Locals and can be heard in the car chase scene. ==Discography== MSU have released four albums. Most notably, their 2002 album Flaps was engineered by The Datsuns's guitarist Christian Livingstone. ===Albums=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" - ! Year ! Title !

The Search and Rescue Force was established in 1986 from the helicopter elements of the RAF Marine Branch which was disbanded that year. The Force supported search and rescue over the United Kingdom until 4 October 2015 when the role was handed over to civilian contractor Bristow Helicopters. On 18 February 2016, the force's disbandment was officially marked with a parade in front of The Duke of Cambridge, who was a former SAR pilot, and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, his wife. and ==History== Whaleback high speed air-sea rescue launch HSL 164 off Ceylon in 1943 In 1918 the RAF was established through the merging of the aviation arms of the Royal Navy, the Royal Navy Air Service (RNAS), and that of the Army, the Royal Flying Corps. Together with its aircraft, vessels acquired to support RAF seaplane operations were also transferred to the new service, becoming the Marine Craft Section (MCS), Post-war the MCS became a force of 150 vessels which in addition to supporting the operation of seaplanes were equipped for rescue operations, with a launch being at the ready whenever an aircraft was flying over water. However, the training and seamanship of the crews, especially with regards to navigation, meant that the MCS at this time was only suitable for inshore rescue operations. As the vessels it had inherited from the Navy began wear out the RAF began to have built for it launches capable of higher speeds and in light of the larger crews of some aircraft, greater capacity. This would in the late 1930s lead to the acquiring of High Speed Launches (HSL) for rescue operations. However, during the Second World War the MCS found itself ill-prepared for war. During the Battle of Britain even with the help of civilian vessels and the Royal Navy, aircrew who baled out or ditched in the North Sea and English Channel had only a 20 percent chance of being returned to their squadrons, with over 200 pilots and aircrew being lost to the sea during the battle. In light of this, in 1941, an emergency meeting was convened by Air Marshal Sir Arthur Bomber Harris. The Royal Navy offered to take over in its entirety the at sea rescue role, the RAF declined and subsequently created the Directorate of Air Sea Rescue on 6 February 1941, which adopted the motto \\"The sea shall not have them\\". Operationally it was to become known as Air Sea Rescue Services (ASRS), which later became the RAF Search and Rescue Force. The headquarters of the ASRS was co-located with that of Coastal Command with which it was to operate closely. Together with creation of specialist Air Sea Rescue Units (ASRU), ASRS worked to improve the survival of aircrews through the development and issue of better individual survival equipment, including one man inflatable dinghies for fighter pilots copied from the Germans; the training of aircrew in ditching drills to maximise their chances of surviving to be retrieved; the development and fielding of air droppable survival equipment; and coordination between the different services, branches and units towards the goal of locating and recovering of downed airmen. Rescue & Target Towing Launch (RTTL) 2757, built in 1957, in the Grounds of the Royal Air Force Museum London, Hendon. The air- sea rescue squadrons of the ASRS flew a variety of aircraft, usually hand me downs rejected or withdrawn from front line service by the RAF's other branches or as in the case of the Walrus begged from the Navy. They used Supermarine Spitfires and Boulton Paul Defiants to patrol for downed aircrew and Avro Ansons to drop supplies and dinghies. Supermarine Walrus and Supermarine Sea Otter amphibious craft were used to pick up aircrew from the water. Larger aircraft were used to drop airborne lifeboats. Although the Walrus and Sea Otters could pick up survivors close to shore and in coastal waters further out to sea it was still not possible for aircraft to routinely pick up survivors, the large flying boats that could do so, such as the Consolidated Catalinas and Short Sunderlands of Coastal Command, had many other jobs to do and were not always available. The role of aircraft in the ASRS therefore, was to locate downed airmen and to keep them alive, by dropping them survival equipment and stores, until an ASRS launch, or one from the Royal Navy's Naval Sea Rescue Services, arrived to pick them up. Generally MCS craft had responsibility for the Channel and North Sea, and Navy ones for the Western Approaches. By the end of the Second World War, more than 8,000 aircrew and 5,000 civilians had been rescued. At the end of the Second World War the MCS had some 300 HSLs and over a thousand other vessels, the largest fleet of such rescue craft in the world. This fleet and the RAF sailors that crewed it would contract as the RAF did, however it continued be found everywhere that the RAF flew over water. ===Introduction of helicopters=== In the mid 1950s, helicopters began to replace fixed–wing aircraft and supplement the marine craft in the search and rescue role, their ability to hover giving them an ability to recover survivors that fixed wing aircraft did not have. It was not until the 1960s, with the introduction of the Westland Whirlwind, the Westland Wessex and later the Westland Sea King, that it was possible to replace marine craft in all sea and weather conditions. Helicopters have the advantage of speed, which means that the same coverage as marine craft can be provided with far fewer bases and much reduced personnel numbers. However, even into the 1970s helicopters had not completely replaced RAF marine craft, however by this time the MCS craft were becoming increasingly elderly and service in the MCS increasingly unattractive. In 1986 the Marine Branch was disbanded, the last of the RAF's vessels were retired. Henceforth the RAF's rescue operations would be entirely helicopter based, Air Sea Rescue Services would be renamed the Search and Rescue Force. ==Role== A SAR Force winchman practising drills. The SARF's primary roles were military search and rescue, and the provision of rescue for civilian aircraft in distress under the 1948 Chicago Convention. The latter was a delegated responsibility to the UK MoD from the Department of Transport, who had primary responsibility for general search and rescue of any type throughout the UK Search and Rescue Region (UK SRR). The military role involved the rescuing of aircrew who have ejected or parachuted from, or crash-landed their aircraft. This role raises the wartime combat effectiveness of the RAF (and RN) by enabling downed aircrew to be returned to front-line flying duties as soon as possible. Although established with a primary role of military search and rescue, most of SARF's operational missions were spent in its secondary role, conducting civil search and rescue. This entails the rescue of civilians from the sea, on mountains, from flooded regions or other locations on land. The aeronautical search and rescue roles were complemented by the related Royal Air Force Mountain Rescue Service whose trained mountaineers also conduct search and rescue in hilly terrain. SARF helicopters and RAF mountaineers often work together on mountain rescue incidents. The military and civil roles were shared with the Sea King helicopters of the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm, while the civil search and rescue role was also shared with the helicopters of HM Coastguard. ==OrganizationNo. 22 Squadron RAF=== February 1955 - June 1955 - HQ at RAF Thorney Island * Bristol Sycamore HC.12 June 1955 - June 1956 - HQ at RAF Thorney Island * Westland Whirlwind HAR.2 {  - !

In addition to the Force HQ proper, the HQ building housed the HQs of the RAFs two operational SAR squadrons in the UK (22 and 202), as well as the RAF Sea King Simulator. SAR Force HQ controlled the SAR Force's three helicopter squadrons and one independent flight. These were: * No. 22 Squadron equipped with the Sea King HAR.3/HAR.3A. * No. 202 Squadron equipped with the Sea King HAR.3. * No. 84 Squadron based at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus and equipped with the Griffin HAR.2. * No. 1564 Flight based at RAF Mount Pleasant in the Falkland Islands and equipped with the Sea King HAR.3. SARF's Operational Conversion Unit was No. 203 Squadron also based at RAF Valley and equipped with the Sea King HAR.3. ==Coordination== In the UK, maritime search and rescue is coordinated by HM Coastguard, while land-based operations are usually coordinated by the local Police force. From 1941 until the end of 1997 there were two Aeronautical Rescue Coordination Centres (ARCC) – at Plymouth and at Edinburgh. These two were combined in 1997 at RAF Kinloss in the north of Scotland. All requests for assistance from the emergency services throughout the United Kingdom (Police, Fire, Ambulance and Coastguard) were handled at this single ARCC until March 2016 when responsibility for the service was transferred to civilian personnel of Her Majesty's Coastguard. ==Disbandment== In 2006, the government announced controversial plans to effectively privatise provision of search and rescue helicopters in order to replace the ageing Sea Kings, although they have suggested that crews may, at least partially, still be made up of military personnel. In February 2010, Soteria SAR was announced as the preferred bidder for the UK SAR programme. On 8 February 2011, days before the contract was due to be signed, the UK Government halted the process after Soteria admitted that it had unauthorised access to commercially sensitive information regarding the programme. While this contract is being renegotiated, a \\"Gap\\" contract was tendered for the existing Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) bases and in February 2012 it was announced that Bristow Helicopters would take over the running of Stornoway and Sumburgh using Sikorsky S-92s and that Portland and Lee on Solent would be retained by CHC Helicopter using AgustaWestland AW139s. In March 2013 the Department for Transport announced that it had signed a contract with Bristow Helicopters Ltd to provide search and rescue helicopter services in the UK with operations commencing progressively from 2015. The new service was fully operational across the United Kingdom by May 2019 and will use AgustaWestland AW189 and Sikorsky S-92 based at ten locations around the UK. ==See also== * History of Royal Navy Helicopter Search and Rescue * Rescue ==ReferencesCitations=Bibliography=== * * ==External links== * * Category:Military units and formations of the Royal Air Force Category:Rescue aviation units and formations Category:Emergency services in the United Kingdom Category:Sea rescue in the United Kingdom Category:1941 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Military units and formations established in 1941 ","title":"RAF Search and Rescue Force"},{"id":"20341651","text":"Soo Wincci () is a singer, recording artist, actress, composer, celebrity chef, host, model, beauty queen, PhD holder and entrepreneur from Malaysia.

It is accredited by the Commission for University Education in Kenya. ==Location== The main campus of the university is located along Bogani East Road, in the neighborhood called Langata, a southwestern neighborhood, within the city of Nairobi, the capital of Kenya and the largest city in that country. The geographical coordinates of the university campus are: 1°21'04.0\\"S, 36°45'28.0\\"E (Latitude:-1.351111; Longitude:36.757778). ==History== Catholic University of East Africa founded on 3 September 1984, as a graduate school of theology, under the name the Catholic Higher Institute of Eastern Africa (CHIEA). The institute was founded by the regional ecclesiastical authority known as Association of Member Episcopal Conferences of Eastern Africa (AMECEA). The member countries of AMECEA are: Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. On 18 August 1985, the institution was formally opened by Pope John Paul II. In 1986, the Graduate School of Theology started negotiations with the Commission for Higher Education in Kenya to establish the Catholic University of Eastern Africa (CUEA). In 1989, the institute obtained the \\"Letter of Interim Authority\\" as the first step towards its establishment as a private university. After three years of intensive negotiations between the Authority of the Graduate School of Theology (CHIEA) and the Commission for Higher Education, the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences was established. The climax of the negotiations was a granting of the Civil Charter to CHIEA on 3 November 1992. This marked the birth of the university as a private institution. The institute rebranded as the Catholic University of Eastern Africa, in 1992. In 2002, the Faculties of Science and Commerce were established. Then in 2003, the Center for Social Justice & Ethics was established. The Faculty of Law was established in 2004, and the School of Continuing Professional Development in 2009. In 2009, satellite campuses were established in Eldoret and Kisumu. In April 2013, the university opened a new campus in the I&M; Tower, along Kenyatta Avenue, in Nairobi's central business district. The campus can accommodate up to 500 students. ==Controversies== In 2018, CUEA encountered financial difficulties that stemmed from poor management and a loss of KSh400 million (US$4 million) to former university officials, according to CUEA's former vice chancellor, Professor Justus Mbae. Investigations by the Daily Nation revealed that CUEA's vice chancellor preceding Prof. Mbae, one Dr. Pius Rutechura, together with CUEA's deputy vice-chancellor in charge of finance and the chief financial officer were facing audit questions over the loss. This theft resulted in CUEA not meeting its salary obligations in the ensuing years, particularly to part-time lecturers who make up the bulk of its teaching staff. Salary arrears led to thousands of exam booklets being withheld by instructors and created a practice of missing marks being manipulated by the school's administrators. These woes even imperilled CUEA's 35th graduation ceremony, according to local media reports. CUEA never recovered from the KSh400 million \\"loss to university officials\\", and it was forced to close its Nairobi city and Kisumu campuses, in January 2018. The university has also been trying to liquidate land it owns in Karen, in a bid to raise funds. The Commission for University Education (CUE) threatened CUEA in January 2018 with closure if the university did not improve its financial standing within one year. The problems at the university continued when the Kenya Private Universities Workers Union announced a strike in January 2019 over inconsistencies and delay in salary payments and a reduction of the Provident Fund from 17 per cent to 6 per cent. ==Recent events== On 1 October 2018, Reverend Professor Stephen Mbugua assumed office as CUEA's new vice chancellor. On the same day, the Right Reverend Charles Kasonde, Bishop of Solwezi, Zambia was elected as the new chairman of AMECEA, taking over from the outgoing chairman Cardinal Berhaneyesus Demerew Souraphiel of Addis Ababa, Etiopia. Reverend Kasonde is the new chancellor of CUEA. ==Faculties of the university== As of May 2020, the university maintains the following faculties: * Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences # * Faculty of Commerce * Faculty of Education * Faculty of Science * Faculty of Law * Faculty of Theology ==Constituent colleges== * Marist International University College * Tangaza University College * Hekima University College * Regina Pacis University College * Uzima University College ==Affiliated colleges== * Don Bosco College: Moshi, Tanzania * Christ the King Major Seminary * The Spiritan Seminary * AMECEA Pastoral Institute * Chemichemi ya Uzima Center ==Associate institution== * Ukweli Video Production ==Notable alumni== Notable alumni include: * Stella Kilonzo, executive director of the Capital Markets Authority of Kenya; July 2008 – June 2012. *Eve D'Souza, media personality *George Khaniri, senator, Vihiga County *Vanessa Mdee, singer ==See also== * Education in Kenya * List of universities in Kenya ==References * Website of Catholic University of Eastern Africa Category:Catholic universities and colleges in Africa Category:Private universities and colleges in Kenya Category:Educational institutions established in 1984 Category:1984 establishments in Kenya ","title":"Catholic University of Eastern Africa"},{"id":"20341798","text":"Princess Elizabeth of Poland () (1326–1361) was the eldest child of Casimir III of Poland and his first wife, Aldona of Lithuania. == Marriage == Elizabeth was originally betrothed to her future brother-law, Louis VI the Roman. She was eventually passed over for her younger sister, Cunigunde. An agreement, directed primarily against the Teutonic Order, was reached on 24 February 1343 in Poznań between Elizabeth's father and Bogislaw V, Duke of Pomerania. As a result, Elizabeth married Bogislaw on 28 February 1343. She received a dowry from her father of 20 000 kop (cents in Prague) and mainly lived in Castle of Darlowo during her marriage. The couple had children: *Elizabeth of Pomerania (1347 – 15 April 1393), wife of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor. *Casimir IV of Pomerania (c. 1351 – 2 January 1377). Her daughter Elizabeth was married in 1363 to the Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV. The marriage took place during the Congress of Kraków; the most celebrated feast commemorating the event took place at the house of Mikołaj Wierzynek (młodszy). Elizabeth of Poland, however, never saw her daughter married off. She had died in 1361, at a monastery of the Order of Saint Augustine in Świątkach, and was buried there. Her son, Casimir (Kaźko) was groomed to become Casimir the Great's successor as King of Poland but was sidelined by Louis I of Hungary, and instead succeeded Bogislaw in 1364 as duke of Pomerania. ==AncestorsReferencesSources== * * Category:1326 births Category:1361 deaths Category:Piast dynasty Category:House of Griffins Category:Polish princesses Category:Pomeranian nobility Category:14th-century Polish people Category:14th-century Polish women ","title":"Elizabeth of Poland, Duchess of Pomerania"},{"id":"20341802","text":"Bryan Rosenfeld (born 19 September 1965) is a Canadian retired professional soccer player and former Head Coach of the Canadian U-17 Women national soccer team.Rosenfeld named Canada's U-17 coach ==Career== Rosenfeld played club football for Hamilton Steelers, and Toronto Blizzard.

Diamphidia in the Chrysomelidae family, the same family as the Colorado potato beetle. The larvae and pupae of Diamphidia produce a toxin used by Bushmen as an arrow poison. The Finnish explorer Hendrik Jacob Wikar, who travelled in Southern Africa in 1773-1779, described the larvae as \\"poisonous worms\\". Hans Schinz was the first scientist to document the process by which the Bushmen extract and use the poison. The adults and larvae of Diamphidia nigroornata feed on Commiphora angolensis (Engler), whereas Diamphidia vittatipennis eat African myrrh. ==Life cycle== Diamphidia nigroornata Adult females of Diamphidia femoralis Gerstaecker and Diamphidia nigroornata (Stål) lay their eggs on the stems of Commiphora species and coat the eggs with their faeces which hardens into a protective covering. As the larval instars develop, the pellets of their own faeces remain attached to their backs and posteriors.Chaboo CS, Grobbelaar E, Larsen A, Fecal Ecology in Leaf Beetles: Novel Records in the African Arrow-Poison Beetles, Diamphidia Gerstaecker and Polyclada Chevrolat (Chrysomelidae: Galerucinae) (2007) The Coleopterists Bulletin: Vol. 61, No. 2 pp. 297–309 The final instar sheds this faecal coat when entering the soil to pupate. The same behaviour is found in Blepharida, a Flea Beetle and Polyclada, the African Leaf Beetle. The Diamphidia larvae burrow down for a depth of up to 1 metre in the sand under the food plant, where they may lie dormant for several years before going through a very rapid pupal phase. ==Toxin== Diamphotoxin, the toxic compound in Diamphidia, is highly labile, and has a low molecular weight. It is bound to a protein that protects it from deactivation. It causes an increased permeability of cell membranes, which, while not affecting normal ionic flow between cells, allows easy access to all small ions, thereby fatally disrupting normal cellular ionic levels.TF Jacobsen, O Sand, T Bjøro, HE Karlsen, JG Iversen, Effect of Diamphidia toxin, a Bushman arrow poison, on ionic permeability in nucleated cells, Toxicon (1990) 28: 435-44 Although it has no neurotoxic effect, it produces a lethal haemolytic effect, and may reduce haemoglobin levels by as much as 75%, leading to haemoglobinuria.CY Kao, MJ Salwen, SL Hu, HM Pitter, JM Woollard, Diamphidia toxin, the bushmen's arrow poison: possible mechanism of prey-killing, Toxicon (1989) 27: 1351-66; accessed on ionchannels.org website Diamphotoxin is only toxic to mammals when injected into the bloodstream, not when ingested, making it unclear how it protects the larvae. It has been hypothesized that the toxin may be harmful on ingestion for non-mammal species. ==Parasite host== Diamphidia is parasitised by a carabid Lebistina beetle, the larva of which attaches itself to a mature Diamphidia larva, clinging to it until the Diamphidia has formed its cocoon, enclosing both host and parasite, and then feeding on its host's soft tissue. The Lebistina larvae are more toxic than their hosts and are preferred by San hunters for arrow poison.How San hunters use beetles to poison their arrows, Biodiversity Explorer website == Gallery == Image:Diamphidia fg01.jpgDiamphidia nigroornata larva Image:Diamphidia fg02.jpgDiamphidia nigroornata cocoon == References  External links == * Harvard Entomology Database * Biodiversity Explorer * African Ethnobotany Category:Alticini Category:Chrysomelidae genera Category:Poisonous animals ","title":"Diamphidia"},{"id":"20341828","text":"The London, Brighton and South Coast Railway E6 Class was a class of 0-6-2T side tank steam locomotive designed by Robert Billinton. They were introduced in 1904 and were a development of the E5 class with smaller driving wheels intended for heavy short and medium-distance freight trains. ==History== The E3 class radial tanks were useful on all but the heaviest freight trains in congested the London area, which required rapid acceleration from signals in order to avoid holding up other traffic. Robert Billinton therefore produced a version of his successful E5 passenger tank class with smaller driving wheels for this purpose. Twelve locomotives were built by Brighton Works between December 1904 and December 1905. The last two locomotives were originally intended to be built as 0-8-0s for heavy shunting purposes but Billinton died in November 1904 before any were built and the order was subsequently changed by his successor D. E. Marsh. The E6s were successful goods locomotives, but in 1911 two examples were rebuilt with the larger C3 class boiler and a C2X class smokebox and were re-classified E6X. These two locomotives proved to be very powerful, but used significantly more fuel and no more examples were rebuilt. All of the class survived the transfer to Southern Railway ownership in 1923, and British Railways ownership in 1948. Withdrawal commenced in September 1957 and was completed by December 1962.

At its height there were 91 blast furnaces within a 10 mile radius of the area. By the late 1970s, there was only one left on Teesside. Opened in 1979 and located near the mouth of the River Tees, the Redcar blast furnace was the second largest in Europe. The majority of the steelworks, including the Redcar blast furnace, Redcar and South Bank coke ovens and the BOS plant at Lackenby closed in 2015. The Teesside Beam Mill and some support services still operate at the Lackenby part of the site. ==History== ;1875 Steel production on Teesside begins when Bolckow, Vaughan & Co Ltd, formerly Bolckow, Vaughan, opens the Cleveland Steelworks in Middlesbrough. Using the Bessemer process, the works have three blast furnaces. ;1876 Albert John Dorman enters into a partnership with Albert de Lande Long taking over the West Marsh Ironworks in Middlesbrough. Dorman Long is founded. ;1879 Bolckow, Vaughan & Co Ltd. acquire the Southbank Steelworks. The firm is also persuaded by Sidney Gilchrist Thomas to adopt the process which he and his cousin Percy Gilchrist developed. This allows the use of local ironstone which had a high phosphorus content. Bolckow, Vaughan & Co Ltd were already well established producers of Iron owning many Ironworks and furnaces and were seen as the driving force behind the rapid expansion of Middlesbrough or \\"Ironopolis\\" and Great Britain's leading producer of pig iron. ;1889 Dorman Long is registered enabling it to take over the business from the firm of the same name. The firm has acquired the Brittania works in Middlesbrough. ;1899 Dorman Long builds a new steel works at the Clarence works in a joint venture with Bell Brothers. ;1900 Bolckow, Vaughan & Co Ltd acquire the Clay Lane works and shift production from Iron to steel, owning 21 of the 91 blast furnaces in the Cleveland area and become the largest producers of Steel in Great Britain and possibly the world. ;1902 The first integrated steelworks is built at Cargo Fleet by Dorman Long who also acquire the other half of Bell brothers. ;1905 Bolckow, Vaughan & Co Ltd produce 820,000 tons of pig iron which is equivalent to 8.5% of the entire country's total output. ;1914 Dorman Long now has a workforce of around 20,000 and is one of the dominant producers of steel in Britain and in Europe. ;1917 Dorman Long builds a brand new blast furnace at Redcar with a cost of £5.4 million. Some of the steel produced here, along with steel from the Brittania and Cargo Fleet steelworks, is used to build structures including the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Tyne Bridge and the Auckland Harbour Bridge. ;1918 Dorman Long opens the new Cleveland works. ;1922 Dorman Long wins the contract to build the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The majority of the steel used in its construction is produced by Dorman long's Bridge and Constructional Works division in Middlesbrough. ;1923 Bolckow, Vaughan & Co Ltd acquire Redpath, Brown & Co, manufacturers of structural steel. ;1924 Dorman Long wins the contract to build the Tyne Bridge in Newcastle. ;1929 Bolckow, Vaughan & Co Ltd. are effectively bankrupt and is forced into a takeover by Dorman Long who by this point is also struggling financially. ;1946 The Lackenby development is built by Dorman Long between the Redcar and Cleveland Works. ;1967 Dorman Long is absorbed into the newly created nationalised company, British Steel Corporation. ;1979 Brand new state-of-the- art blast furnace opens at the former Redcar site using the open hearth process. It is the second largest of its kind in Europe and Teesside's sole remaining blast furnace. ;1988 British Steel is privatised to form British Steel plc. ;1999 British Steel plc merged with Netherlands-based steel maker Koninklijke Hoogovens to form Corus Group. Corus utilised the site for basic oxygen steelmaking, using iron produced at the company's Redcar blast furnace. ;2003 Corus announce that the production at Teesside Cast Products (TCP) as a surplus to its needs. ;2007 Corus is bought by Tata Steel. ;2009 Corus announced partial mothballing of the Teesside blast furnace. Approx. 1,700 jobs eliminated. To help the workers, a Corus Response Group was formed which developed a comprehensive package of support. This plan was in place over the past 10 months of announcement and included employment experts on site from January 2010. Support was put in place to help affected workers with individual sessions to update CVs, highlight job opportunities and look at retraining options. The response group was also supposed to work with the Teesside Cast Products function to offer similar support. === SSI: 2012–2015 === On 24 February 2011, the steelworks was purchased by Thai-based Sahaviriya Steel Industries (SSI) at $469 million. The acquisition was expected to create more than 800 jobs on top of the existing workforce of 700 and the plant was officially reopened 15 April 2012. 18 September 2015, production paused due to the decline in steel prices. 28 September 2015, plant \\"mothballed\\" again amid poor steel trading conditions across the world and a drop in steel prices. 2 October, SSI UK enter into liquidation. 12 October 2015 the receiver announced there was no realistic prospect of finding a buyer. The coke ovens are scheduled for extinguishing. ===British Steel: 2016–2019=== The remainder of the site still operational (Teesside Beam Mill and ancillary support services at Lackenby and the deep-water bulk handling terminal), was sold by Tata Steel to investment firm Greybull Capital on 1 June 2016. As part of the deal, the historic British Steel name was resurrected. The new company includes the UK sites of Skinningrove and Scunthorpe as well as the Hayange rail plant in northern France. ===Insolvency of British Steel 2019–Present=== In 2019 British Steel collapsed in May 2019 and was taken over by the UK Insolvency Service, and was later purchased in March 2020 by Jingye Group, who agreed to save the remaining jobs by modernising the steelworks. == Environmental aspects == The closure of the steelworks, coupled with the running down of many coal-fired power stations and a UK Government carbon-tax, led to a 6% reduction in carbon emissions from the United Kingdom in 2016. ==Transport== The site is situated alongside the A66 and A1085 dual carriageways. Main access is via the Lackenby and Redcar entrances, situated on the A1085. The site is adjacent to Teesport that was used for iron ore, coal, and other raw material imports, and steel exports. The site was served by the Redcar British Steel railway station, which opened on 19 June 1978. Northern discontinued service to the station in December 2019, prior to this the station (owned by Network Rail), was surrounded by private land, which prevented any public access to or from the station. == References  Category:Tata Steel Europe Category:Buildings and structures in Redcar and Cleveland Category:Buildings and structures in North Yorkshire Category:Ironworks and steelworks in England Category:Redcar ","title":"Teesside Steelworks"},{"id":"20341886","text":"Computer-aided lean management, in business management, is a methodology of developing and using software-controlled, lean systems integration. Its goal is to drive innovation towards cost and cycle-time savings. It attempts to create an efficient use of capital and resources through the development and use of one integrated system model to run a business's planning, engineering, design, maintenance, and operations. ==Overview== Computer-Aided Lean Management (CALM) is a management philosophy that uses computational software to reduce risk and inefficiencies. CALM acts on uncertainties and business inefficiencies to increase profitability through the use of computational decision-making tools that enable opportunities for additional value creation. It is based on the application of software to enable continuous improvement through an Integrated System Model (ISM) of the business’s physical assets, business processes, and machine learning. This unique integration of software applications using lean principles was developed in the aerospace industry and has migrated to the energy industry. The creation of an integrated system model removes the barriers posed by the silos or stovepipes inherent in the departmentalization of most companies. Integration enables lean uses of information for the creation of actionable knowledge. CALM strives to create such a lean management approach to running the company through the rigors of software enforcement. From this software enforcement comes clear policy and procedures that are adhered to, activity-based costing, measurement of effectiveness, and the capability of using advanced algorithms for dramatic improvements in optimization of resources. CALM creates business capabilities through software to enable technology application, streamlining of processes, and a lean organizational structure. The methodology is based on a commonsense approach for running a business, by measuring of actions taken and using those measurements to design improved processes in order to drive out inefficiencies. ==History== CALM was inspired by lean processes and techniques that were already dominant management technologies with a wide diversity of applications and successes. Motorola and General Electric (GE) had been known for the concepts of Six Sigma; Boeing had been managing mass (using modular and flexible assembly options), and Toyota put it all together into a truly lean business through its Toyota Production System. Boeing in turn took the Toyota model and added computer-aided enforcement of lean methodologies throughout the manufacturing process. One of the major sources for CALM's outgrowth was integrated definition (IDEF) modeling in aerospace manufacturing that was pioneered by the U.S. Air Force in the 1970s. IDEF is a methodology designed to model the end-to-end decisions, actions, and activities of an organization or system so that costs, performance, and cycle times can be optimized. IDEF methods have been adapted for wider use in automotive, aerospace, pharmaceuticals, and even software development industries. IDEF methods serve as a starting point to understand lean management through semantic data modeling. The IDEF process begins by mapping the as-is functions of an enterprise, creating a graphical model, or road map, that shows what controls each important function, who performs it, what resources are required for carrying it out, what it produces, how much it costs, and what relationships it has to other functions of the organization. IDEF simulations of the to-be enterprise have been found to be efficient at streamlining and modernizing both companies and governmental agencies. Perhaps the best- developed evolution of the IDEF model beyond Toyota was at Boeing. Their project life-cycle process has grown into a rigorous software system that links people, tasks, tools, materials, and the environmental impact of any newly planned project, before any building is allowed to begin. Routinely, more than half of the time for any given project is spent building the precedence diagrams, or three-dimensional process maps, integrating with outside suppliers, and designing the implementation plan-all on the computer. Once real activity is initiated, an action tracker is used to monitor inputs and outputs versus the schedule and delivery metrics in real time throughout the organization. When the execution of a new airplane design begins, it is so well organized that it consistently cuts both costs and build time in half for each successive generation of airframe. And, of course, it is paperless. Boeing created a complex lean management process called 'define and control airplane configuration/manufacturing resource management' (DCAC/MRM). The process was built with the help of the operations research and computer sciences departments of the University of Pittsburgh. The manufacture of the Boeing 777 was ultimately a success, and it became the precursor to succeeding generations of CALM at Boeing. Boeing is four generations beyond that airplane now, and they have succeeded in cutting the time and cost for each new generation of airplane. Boeing’s successes in conversion from inefficient silos of manufacturing to a lean and efficient operation have become legendary. The methodology of CALM has recently been applied to field orientated infrastructure based businesses with highly interdependent systems, such as electric utilities where a smart grid concept is being researched and developed. The management of infrastructure-based industries like oil, gas, electricity, water, transportation, and renewables requires massive investments in interdependent, physical infrastructure, as well as simultaneous attention to disparate market forces. In infrastructure businesses that manage field assets, uncertainty is the prime impediment to profitability, rather than the maintenance of efficient supply chains or the management of factory assembly lines. These businesses are dominated by risk from uncertainties such as weather, market variations, transportation disruptions, government actions, logistic difficulties, geology, and asset reliability. CALM has been applied to deal with these types of infrastructure based challenges. ==References== *Anderson, Boulanger, Johnson, Kressner (2008), Computer-Aided Lean Management for the Energy Industry, *Anderson, R.

She is the leader of the Reason Party and has a seat in the Victorian Legislative Council, representing the Northern Metropolitan Region. Patten established the Australian Sex Party in 2009 to focus on personal freedoms after deep frustration with stagnation on censorship, freedom, marriage equality and drug law reform. On 22 August 2017, it was announced that the Australian Sex Party would be changing its name to the Reason Party. Before entering politics, Patten was the CEO of Australia's national adult industry association, Eros Association. She championed sexual rights and health movements for more than 20 years, particularly on HIV/AIDS, after initially starting out as a small businesses owner with her own fashion label. ==Early life and career== Patten was born in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, the daughter of Colin Richard Lloyd \\"Rick\\" Patten, an Australian naval officer, and his wife Anne, a Scottish-born public servant who worked for a government-owned telecommunications company. Rick and Anne Patten had met in Scotland, where the former had been posted, and after her birth Patten spent parts of her childhood in the United Kingdom and the United States, in concert with her father's postings. Patten has two younger sisters. Patten received her primary education overseas. She excelled in sport and took particular interest in swimming. Upon returning to Australia with her family in 1978, Patten attended Hawker College in Canberra where she studied Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Industrial Arts, Technical Drawing, Landscape Design and Environmental Studies. She went on to study Landscape Architecture and Industrial Design at the University of Canberra. She later graduated with qualifications in fashion design and started her own fashion label, Body Politics. The first boutique was opened in Yarralumla in the late 1980s, where she sold her own fashion creations as well as the designs of colleagues in Sydney. During the early 1990s recession in Australia, interest in Patten's expensive collection was received largely from workers in the sex industry. ==Business career, 1988–2014Body Politics=== Patten started her career with her company Body Politics. With her large clientele of sex workers, Patten became interested in sex workers' rights, eventually joining Workers In Sex Employment (WISE), a lobbying group, to inform at-risk members of the population about the emerging threat of HIV/AIDS. Patten was employed as an outreach speaker, and would once a week visit brothels to teach the women about safe sex. From 1990 to 1992, Patten was a sex worker herself. Her initial encounter began at Tiffany's Palace in Canberra, where she had intercourse with a client when another worker was unavailable. Patten eventually lost interest in her work, which had also interfered with her social and professional life. After working as a female escort in Cairns, Queensland, Patten quit sex work in 1992 and continued in sex education. ===Eros Association=== In 1992, Patten and her partner, Robbie Swan, established the Eros Association, a peak body for the adult industry.Mark Dapin, \\"Now that Sex Party MP Fiona Patten has your attention ...\\", The Age, 13 February 2016. Retrieved 12 February 2017. The company extended its interests into publications, public relations, business, and political advocacy. Eros was heavily involved in the editing and publication of a political humour and satire magazine entitled Matilda, an adult magazine entitled Ecstacy, and launched their own \\"sex and politics\\" themed magazine Eros. The Eros Association was instrumental in support for the Brindabella Wilderness Project, an initiative to preserve wildlife in the Brindabella Valley and Mountains. In 2001, the company established the first National Museum of Erotica, dedicated to the history of erotica and the preservation of erotic art, literature, film and photography. The museum was unveiled by Chief Minister Kate Carnell. While the physical presence of the Museum was closed in 2002, the collection remained preserved and continued to grow, with over 400 individual pieces cataloged by 2005, and instead maintained a virtual presence on the internet. Patten scaled down her interests in the company in 2000 to pursue other interests in advocacy. She returned in 2006, and left again in 2014 when she was elected to the Victorian Parliament. ===National Museum of Erotica=== The National Museum of Erotica was opened in Canberra in 2001, dedicated to the history of erotica and the preservation of erotic art, literature, film and photography. The museum was unveiled by Chief Minister Kate Carnell, and was the first establishment of its kind in Australia. The National Museum of Erotica collected works from the likes of Brett Whiteley, Charles Blackman, Salvatore Zofrea, Lesbia Thorpe, Richard Larter, Mario Azzopardi, and more historically Mihály Zichy. Patten expressed that the collection and archiving of erotic, pornographic and sexual art and artefacts is fundamentally different from the collection of non sexual material because the former was perceived as a rapidly diminishing resource in the world. The museum housed erotic artistic works, including paintings, pictures, pin-up, illustrated books, comic strips and films, from the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, Hungary, Russia and Australia. The museum also displayed a collection of sex toys, including dildos, vibrators and other mechanical devices dating back to the late 1800s. The Museum was closed in 2002, but the collection remained preserved and continued to grow, with over 400 individual pieces cataloged by 2005. The Museum now maintains an internet archive. ==Political career, 1992–present== Patten first sought election in the 1992 ACT general election. Patten contested the second election for representation in the multi-member single constituency Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly on a ticket called the Hare-Clark Independent Group, in association with the larger group of independent politicians who entered an alliance with the Liberal and Residents Rally government. Patten ran alongside the sitting member Craig Duby, however both Duby and Patten were unsuccessful in being elected. ===Australian Sex Party (2009–2017)=== Patten in 2009 In 2009, Patten founded the Australian Sex Party, which began by focusing on law reform for the sex industry, but soon \\"broadened [its] platform to include supporting voluntary euthanasia, same-sex marriage, decriminalising cannabis for personal use, greater transparency in government through freedom of information laws, and increasing people’s right to privacy.\\" Patten contested the seat of Higgins in Victoria at the 2009 by-election. She received over 3 percent of the vote, placing her 4th out of 10 candidates. Her campaign was based on opposing Greens Victoria candidate Clive Hamilton's proposal for an ISP-level Internet filter which would block access to websites containing RC- rated content—that is, legal material which is banned from sale, trade or public exhibition due to its extreme nature. Patten publicly criticized the proposal. She appeared in the Four Corners episode \\"Access Denied\\" arguing that it would include blocking access to adult films such as Pirates—refused classification because of a technicality—that do not depict sexual violence, are extremely popular overseas and are available for download on dozens of websites. The party contested all states and territories, except for Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory, in the Senate and six of 150 House of Representatives seats at the 2010 federal election. The party won 2.04 percent of the national Senate vote, over 250,000 first preferences.First Preferences for the Senate – 2010 federal election: AEC After the major parties and the Greens, the Sex Party during the vote count were \\"neck and neck\\" with the Family First Party for the fourth place in the national Senate vote.Australian Sex Party does well: AustralianNews.net 24 August 2010 The party \\"outpolled several more prominent minor parties and came within about 10,000 votes of Family First for the Senate in Victoria\\".

Patten contested the 2012 Melbourne state by-election, coming third out of 16 candidates, receiving 6.6 percent of the vote, in the absence of a Liberal Party candidate. She says the party preferenced Labor ahead of the Greens due to the \\"anti-sex feminist movement\\" within the Greens,The Melbourne byelection special: 3AW 19 July 2012 but that future preferences may change again.Official by-election outcome still days away: Yahoo News 23 July 2012 Patten was again a Sex Party candidate for a senate seat in Victoria at the 2013 federal election. Patten successfully contested the Northern Metropolitan Region in the Victorian Legislative Council during the 2014 Victorian state election becoming the first candidate for the Australian Sex Party to be elected to parliament. During her time as a Victorian MP, Patten has been credited for playing pivotal roles in achieving social reforms in Victoria, with examples including the passage of Victoria's assisted dying legislation, the trial of a medically supervised drug injecting room in Richmond, relaxing laws for ride-share companies such as Uber and establishing buffer zones for abortion clinics to keep protesters away from patients and staff. ===Reason Party (2017–present)=== Fiona Patten in 2019 On 22 August 2017, there were reports that the Australian Sex Party would be changing its name and becoming the Reason Party. This was later confirmed, and the Reason Party registered for federal elections in Australia in May 2018, and was confirmed as \\"Reason Australia\\" on 30 August 2018. ==Personal life== Patten's book, Sex, Drugs and the Electoral Roll was published in 2018. It took her two years to write. ==Bibliography== *Sex, Drugs and the Electoral Roll: My unlikely journey from sex worker to Member of Parliament (Crows Nest: Allen & Unwin, , published in 2018) == Activism == Patten was awarded the 2020 Australian Humanist of the Year for her achievements in leading debate and securing legislation on many issues of concern to humanists, particularly end of life, abortion safety, sexual health and drugs of addiction. ==References * Fiona Patten MLC - Homepage * Reason Party official party website * Reason Party - Victoria secondary official party website with more focus on Victoria * Sex Party vs Family First debate: Sunrise 2 August 2010 * * Fiona Patten on Twitter * Parliamentary voting record of Fiona Patten at Victorian Parliament Tracker Category:1964 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century Australian politicians Category:21st-century Australian women writers Category:Australian Sex Party politicians Category:Australian businesspeople Category:Drug policy reform activists Category:Members of the Victorian Legislative Council Category:People from Canberra Category:Reason Party (Australia) politicians Category:Sex worker activists in Australia Category:University of Canberra alumni Category:Women members of the Victorian Legislative Council ","title":"Fiona Patten"},{"id":"20341964","text":"The torch passing by Memorial University of Newfoundland in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador on November 13th, 2009. The flame is passed in Moncton, New Brunswick on November 23, 2009. A closeup of the 2010 Olympic Torch. Photo of one of the miniature displays used to show the flame during the community celebrations. The 2010 Winter Olympics Torch Relay was a 106-day run, from October 30, 2009 until February 12, 2010, prior to the 2010 Winter Olympics. Plans for the relay were originally announced November 21, 2008 by the Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games (VANOC). Communities were initially informed in June 2008, but the locations were not announced for \\"security reasons\\". Exact routes were later announced several weeks before the start of the torch relay. The torches used in the Olympic relay were designed by Leo Obstbaum (1969–2009), the late director of design for the 2010 Winter Games. There were an estimated 12,000 torchbearers, including notable Canadian celebrities such as Shania Twain, Simon Whitfield, Silken Lauman, Alexandre Despatie and Catriona Le May Doan and past and present NHL hockey stars including Sidney Crosby, Wayne Gretzky, and the captains of the Vancouver Canucks teams that went to the Stanley Cup Finals, Trevor Linden () and Stan Smyl (). In fact, many television personalities were selected as torchbearers for the relay, mainly from CTV's parent company, CTVglobemedia. Matt Lauer and American actor, bodybuilder, and former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger were also torch bearers. On 22 October 2009 the Olympic Torch was lit during a ceremony held at the Ancient Olympia in Greece. Actress Maria Nafpliotou played the role of the High Priestess and ignited the flame using a parabolic mirror and the sun's ray. The first torch was carried by Olympic skier Vassilis Dimitriadis. Kept under close secrecy, the final Olympic Torchbearer turned out to be not one, but five final torchbearers. Rick Hansen brought it into BC Place Stadium, in turn lighting Catriona Le May Doan's torch, who lit Steve Nash's torch, and the flame continued to Nancy Greene and Wayne Gretzky. Three of the four torchbearers lit the indoor Olympic Cauldron; Le May Doan remained with her torch due to a malfunction causing only three of the four arms to be raised. Gretzky exited BC Place, with his torch still lit, and caught a ride on the back of a VANOC vehicle, to Coal Harbour, where he lit the outdoor Cauldron. This makes Gretzky the first person to light two official cauldrons in the same Olympics. At the start of the closing ceremony, Le May Doan re-lit the indoor Cauldron after clown and mime Yves Dagenais \\"fixed\\" and \\"raised\\" the arm that malfunctioned in the opening ceremony. ==Relay elementsTorch=== The torches used for 2010 relay and the lighting ceremonies were made by designers at Bombardier Inc.'s Aerospace division. ===Route=== # Before October 30: Olympia, Greece # October 30: Victoria, British Columbia loop # October 31: Victoria to Nanaimo # November 1: Nanaimo to Tofino # November 2: Tofino to Courtenay to Campbell River # November 3: Campbell River to Whitehorse, Yukon # November 4: Whitehorse to Inuvik, Northwest Territories # November 5: Inuvik to Yellowknife, briefly entering Nunavut # November 6: Yellowknife to Cold Lake, Alberta # November 7: Cold Lake to Churchill, Manitoba, going through Saskatchewan # November 8: Churchill to Alert, Nunavut # November 9: Alert to Iqaluit # November 10: Iqaluit to Gaspé, Quebec # November 11: Sept-Îles to Labrador City, Newfoundland and Labrador to Happy Valley-Goose Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador # November 12: Happy Valley-Goose Bay to St. John's # November 13: St. John's loop # November 14: St. John's to Grand Falls-Windsor # November 15: Grand Falls-Windsor to Channel-Port aux Basques # November 16: Channel-Port aux Basques to Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia # November 17: Port Hawkesbury to Truro # November 18: Truro to Halifax, Nova Scotia # November 19: Halifax loop # November 20: Halifax to Lunenburg # November 21: Lunenburg to Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island # November 22: Charlottetown to Summerside # November 23: Summerside to Moncton, New Brunswick # November 24: Moncton to Saint John # November 25: Saint John to Fredericton # November 26: Not travelling, staying in Fredericton. # November 27: Fredericton to Bathurst # November 28: Bathurst to Edmundston # November 29: Edmundston to Rimouski, Quebec # November 30: Rimouski to Baie- Comeau, Quebec # December 1: Baie-Comeau to Saguenay(Alma) # December 2: Saguenay to Quebec City # December 3: Quebec City to Lévis # December 4: Lévis to Saint-Georges # December 5: Saint-Georges to Sherbrooke # December 6: Sherbrooke to Trois-Rivières # December 7: Trois-Rivières to Longueuil # December 8: Longueuil to Beaconsfield # December 8: Beaconsfield to Kahnawake # December 9: Kahnawake to Mont-Tremblant # December 10: Mont-Tremblant to Montreal # December 11: Montreal to Gatineau # December 12: Gatineau to Ottawa, Ontario # December 13: Ottawa loop # December 14: Ottawa to Kingston # December 15: Kingston to Peterborough # December 16: Peterborough to Oshawa # December 17: Oshawa to Toronto # December 18: Toronto to Brampton # December 19: Brampton to Hamilton # December 20: Hamilton to Niagara Falls # December 21: Niagara Falls to Brantford # December 22: Brantford to Chatham # December 23: Chatham to Windsor # December 24: Windsor to London # December 25: Not travelling, staying in London. # December 26: Not travelling, staying in London. # December 27: London to Kitchener # December 28: Kitchener to Owen Sound # December 29: Owen Sound to Barrie # December 30: Barrie to North Bay # December 31: North Bay to Val-d'Or, Quebec # January 1, 2010: Val-d'Or to Timmins, Ontario # January 2: Timmins to Sault Ste.

The episode was written by Matt Selman, and directed by Mark Kirkland. ==Plot== Edna Krabappel's positive attitude is crushed when she sees her students distracted from class by their cell phones, so she takes the devices away and puts them in the drawer with the biology frogs. This angers Bart and the other children, and Edna fails to stimulate their learning via other methods. The kids decide that Edna needs to \\"chill out\\" once in a while, and Bart understands that Homer is goofy and easy-going once he has had a few beers, so the students decide to spike Edna's coffee with liquor they steal from their parents. The next day, once she has consumed a mug of heavily-spiked coffee, with sly encouragement from the kids, Edna becomes very intoxicated. She sings a loud, off-key, incoherent version of \\"This Old Man\\" with her students, and ends up hitting on Dewey Largo and disrupting an assembly bidding farewell to foreign exchange students. Principal Seymour Skinner is forced to fire her, although reluctantly, even giving her his hankey when she starts crying. Skinner replaces her with a hip recent graduate of Tufts University named Zachary Vaughn. The students are immediately impressed with Zack, as he returns their cell phones and instructs them to use their electronic devices for classwork; his first assignment to them is “Twenty minutes of Twittering”. Bart raves to his mother about how much fun it is to have Zack as a teacher, but Marge worries about Edna's well-being, and Lisa doubts Zack's ability to teach. Bart goes to visit Edna and is stricken with guilt when he sees her moping in front of the television. Bart and Milhouse meet at a bookstore (where Moe is revealed to be a fan of Doris Kearns Goodwin) and decide to get Edna rehired. They buy a self-help book entitled \\"The Answer\\" (a spoof of \\"The Secret\\"), which professes to have all the answers to help someone achieve their dreams. Edna is initially skeptical, but reveals her dream is to open a muffin shop. Using the book, she successfully opens a muffin shop which attracts several Springfielders including Ned Flanders. However, when Bart inadvertently confesses that he had the idea to spike her coffee with alcohol and therefore is responsible for getting her fired, Edna is furious and tells him that her real dream was to be a teacher, and is now facing heavy debt as well as competition from other newly-opened muffin stores. Destroying the self-help book, Edna declares that Bart is the only kid she has ever met who is \\"bad on the inside\\". Bart, deeply troubled by Edna's statement, sneaks into the school late at night to spike Zack's \\"Blue Bronco\\" energy drink and get Edna's old job back, but cannot go through with it and instead decides to tell Skinner the truth and face punishment. Skinner is pleased that Bart was honest and agrees to punish him for it, but tells him he cannot just rehire Edna when Zack is doing a good job in her place. Their conversation is suddenly disrupted by a belligerently drunk Zack — who ironically secretly mixes vodka in his own drink and mocks the schoolchildren, telling them they have no future because their education will not help them achieve real things in life. Groundskeeper Willie drags Zack away with the remark \\"It's always the good ones that go crazy the fastest\\", and Edna is reinstated. Bart hopes that there will be no hard feelings between Edna and himself. She responds by making every student in the class eat a stale muffin, as part of her \\"muffin-based revenge\\", and smiles as she stares out the window to the historical figures from \\"The Answer\\", who nod in approval, indicating that she has fully accepted the teachings of the self-help book after all. They disappear in a flash of smoke as the end credits style of text mimics that of The Secret. ==Production== The episode was written by Matt Selman, and directed by Mark Kirkland, marking the pair's writing and directorial debuts for the season. TV.com Retrieved 2010-06-24 On Twitter, Selman said that the episode title was widely and wrongly assumed to be a simple play on words where the \\"Z\\" referred to Bart's new teacher being named Zachary; in fact, the title was devised during an early script where Zach's meltdown started with him giving all of the students \\"Z's\\" for their grades because he was staggeringly drunk, and even after it was decided to present Zach's meltdown differently everyone liked the title and kept it anyway. ==Cultural references== The episode name is a reference to the name of the Season 2 episode \\"Bart Gets an \\"F\\"\\", which was also referenced in the same season episode \\"Bart's Dog Gets an \\"F\\", and the Season 10 episode \\"Lisa Gets an \\"A\\"\\".

After the Thirty Years' War, the province consisted of Farther Pomerania. Subsequently, the Lauenburg and Bütow Land, Draheim, and Swedish Pomerania south of the Peene river were joined into the province. The province was succeeded by the Province of Pomerania set up in 1815. The name Pomerania comes from Slavic po more, which means \\"Land at the Sea\\".Der Name Pommern (po more) ist slawischer Herkunft und bedeutet so viel wie „Land am Meer“. () == Farther Pomerania == Farther Pomerania was made a province of Prussia (Brandenburg-Prussia) after the Peace of Westphalia ended the Thirty Years' War in 1648. During the war, the noble House of Pomerania (Griffins), ruling Pomerania since the 1120s as Dukes of Pomerania, became extinct in the male line with the death of Bogislaw XIV in 1637. Throughout the existence of the Griffin duchy, Brandenburg claimed overlordship and was asserted of Pomerania inheritance in numerous treaties. Yet, Sweden had been one of the most important players in the war and as such, she was awarded some of her territorial gains in Pomerania (Swedish Pomerania), after the war by the Peace of Westphalia, thwarting Brandenburg-Prussia's ambitions for inheritance of the whole former Duchy of Pomerania. == Gain of Lauenburg and Bütow Land and Draheim == Brandenburg-Prussia (1618–1680) with Farther Pomerania (Hinterpommern, light green), Draheim (yellow), Lauenburg-Bütow (yellow) and the strip along the Oder (yellow). Year of incorporation indicated. During the Second Northern War (1654–1660), Brandenburg-Prussia and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth concluded the Treaty of Wehlau on 19 September 1657, and the subsequent Treaty of Bromberg. The Commonwealth therein gave Brandeburg- Prussia the Lauenburg and Bütow Land as a fief, and also pawned Draheim to Brandenburg.Buchholz, 1999, p. 318. The Peace of Oliva on 3 May 1660, confirmed Brandenburg's rights in the Lauenburg and Bütow Land as well as in Draheim. == Gain of lower Oder's right bank == Swedish Pomerania was occupied by Denmark and Brandenburg in the Brandenburg-Swedish theater of the Scanian War from 1675–1679, whereby Denmark claimed Rügen and Brandenburg the rest of Pomerania. Sweden reestablished control after the Peace of Saint-Germain-en- Laye on 28 June 1679.Buchholz, 1999, pp. 318–319. This tempted Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, to utter \\"Exoriare aliquis nostris ex ossibus ultor! [Let someone arise from my bones as an avenger]\\".Büchmann, Geflügelte Worte. The strip of land on the east side of the Oder, except for Gollnow and Altdamm, was given to Brandenburg. Gollnow and Altdamm were held by Brandenburg as a pawn in exchange for reparations, until these were paid in 1693. == Gain of southern Swedish Pomerania == Great Northern War in Pomerania. Swedish Pomerania in brown, Brandenburg-Prussian Pomerania in blue, Siege of Stralsund (1711–1715) and gains of 1720 indicated. During the Great Northern War, Stettin was sieged by Russian and Saxon forces led by prince Menschikov, and surrendered on 29 September. According to the Treaty of Schwedt on 6 October, Menschikov was paid his war costs by Prussia, and Stettin was occupied by Holstein and Brandenburg troops.Buchholz, 1999, pp. 341–343. On 12 June 1714, king Friedrich Wilhelm I of Brandenburg-Prussia concluded a treaty with the Russian Empire confirming her gains in Swedish Ingermanland, Karelia and Estonia, and in turn received Russian confirmation of his gains in southern Swedish Pomerania. On 22 November 1714, King Charles XII of Sweden returned from Turkey to lead the Swedish defense in Pomerania in person. In turn, Holstein's forces in Stettin were arrested as a Swedish ally by Prussia. In February 1715, Charles seized Wolgast in an advance to reestablish Swedish control in Western Pomerania. On 1 May 1715, Prussia officially declared war on Sweden. In the same month, Hanover and Denmark joined the Russian-Prussian treaty of 1714. The allied forces subsequently occupied all of Pomerania except for Stralsund. In the Battle of Stralsund Charles XII of Sweden led the defense until 22 December 1715, when he evacuated to Lund. In the Treaty of Stockholm, concluded on 21 January 1720, Prussia was allowed to retain its conquest, including Stettin. By this, Sweden ceded the parts east of the Oder River that had been won in 1648 as well as Western Pomerania south of the Peene river (Old Western Pomerania or Altvorpommern) and the islands of Wollin and Usedom to Brandenburg-Prussia in turn for a 2 million Taler payment. The capital was then moved to Stettin. == Seven Years' War == Siege of Kolberg (1761) After the Battle of Zorndorf in 1759 (Seven Years' War), Russian troops made their way into Pomerania and laid a siege on Kolberg. When Kolberg withstood, the Russian troops ravaged Farther Pomerania. Sweden and Russia invaded Brandenburgian Pomerania throughout the years 1760 and 1761. Kolberg was again made a target, withstood a second siege, but not the third one in 1761. In the winter of the same year, the Russian troops made Farther Pomerania their winter refuge. In 1762, Prussia made peace with Sweden and Russia.Buchholz, 1999, pp. 352–354. Brandenburgian Pomerania was left ravaged and the civilian death toll amounted to 72,000.Buchholz, 1999, p. 356. == Administration == The Swedish forces left Kolberg and were replaced by Brandenburgian troops on 6 June 1653. Three days later, the prince elector called the nobility to assemble at a Landtag in Stargard, that constituted on 19 July 1654, to decide on the further administrative system of the province.Buchholz, 1999, pp. 310–311. === Regimentsverfassung (\\"regime constitution\\") of 1654 === The Landtag decrees along with a constitution (\\"Regimentsverfassung\\") were issued on 11 July 1654.Buchholz, 1999, p. 312. Kolberg was made the new capital. Troops were to be permanently garrisoned in the town, this was to be paid for by the province. The province was to be governed by a \\"Regierung\\" (government, led by a president and a chancellor, four other members, general administration, in charge of the police, border patrol, enforcement of ducal rights), a \\"Kammer\\" (chamber, also \\"Amtskammer\\"), a \\"Rentei\\", for administration of the domains), a \\"Hofgericht\\" (court) and a \\"Konsistorium\\" (ecclesiastical administration). The first president was Ewald von Kleist. Because the president was also occupied with diplomatic missions and representation of the province in Berlin, the chancellor was instead supervising the province's administration.Buchholz, 1999, pp. 310ff. The province was divided into seven knightly districts, also the territories of eight local noble houses (Flemming, Borcke, Wedel, Dewitz, Osten-Blücher, Manteuffel and Glasenapp, so- called \\"schloßgesessene Familien\\", i.e. palace-owning families), and the County of Naugard. Furthermore, there were the ducal domains (\\"Amt\\") Kolbatz, Friedrichswalde, Marienfließ, Treptow, Stolp and Rügenwalde, and the towns of Pyritz, Stargard, Treptow an der Rega, Greifenberg, Belgard, Neustettin, Schlawe, Stolp, Rügenwalde, Kolberg and Köslin. The secularized territory of the Kammin diocese (\\"Stift Cammin\\") had a separate status. The population was represented in the \\"Landständische Vertretung\\" by 25 \\"Landrat\\" officials. The knightly districts assigned nine, the noble families six, the towns five and Stift Cammin also five. The prince-elector had to approve the assignments. === Military administration === Brandenburg-Prussia set up a combined military institution, the war commissionary for her Pomeranian province and Neumark. It was led by Wedego von Bonin as the kriegskommissar. Initially only active during wartime, it became a permanent institution in 1660. The Kriegskommissariat was subject only to the prince-elector (later king) and not to the provincial government. It was represented in the urban communities by \\"Steuerkommissar\\" and in the rural districts by \\"Kriegskommissar\\" (later \\"Kreisdirektor\\") officials. These commissioners collected contributions (war tax) and supervised garrison. Tus, the Kriegskommisariat became a central institution in the province's financial and economical administration.Buchholz, 1999, pp. 320ff. === Administrative reform of 1714 === In 1714, the former position of \\"Landrat\\" was abolished, and replaced with that of \\"Prussian Landrat\\". The office was assigned to the former Kreisdirektor. Already before the reform, the positions of Kreisdirektor (initially Kriegskommissar) and Landrat of a district had often been held by the same man. === Administrative reform of 1722 === Based on an order of Prussian king Frederick William I, Amtskammer and Kriegskommissariat were fused into the \\"Kriegs- und Domänenkammer\\" (war and domain chamber), in 1722. This new chamber moved from Stargard, which had been capital since 1668, to Stettin, which had been acquired by Prussia and merged into the Pomeranian province in 1720. The chamber was responsible for all administrative fields of the province except for justice (that was within the responsibility of the government and the court) and ecclesial administration (handled by the Konsistorium). A second chamber (though under superiority of the Stettin chamber) was set up in 1764 in Köslin for the eastern districts. === Administrative and military reform of 1733 === On 15 September 1733, Prussian king Frederick William I ordered another administrative reform. The most important change was the application of the \\"Kantonsreglement\\" order. This order split the province into small military districts (\\"Kanton\\") based on the civilian ones. All peasants of a canton were enrolled by the Prussian army, and assigned to the Prussian infantry units Infanterieregiment 7, 8, 17, 22 or 30, or the cavalry units Dragonerregiment 1, 2 or 5. The enrollment did not depend on actual warfare, but was permanent. Also, the rural nobility was enlisted into the army as potential officers. Those chosen (by the king himself) for a military career were trained in Berlin, and received not only military, but a broad education. Duchy of Hither and Farther Pomerania around the year of 1794. == Rebuilding and Inner Colonisation of Prussian Pomerania == After the great losses of the previous wars, Prussia began rebuilding and resettling her war-torn province in 1718. Programs were devised for financial aid to rebuild houses, e.g. people were paid 23% of a house's cost if they built it with fire-proof material, and vacant residential areas were granted rent free to those willing to erect buildings. There were also cases where those building a house were granted free citizenship, were exonerated from garrison duties, or were given the necessary timber for free. Also, public buildings were renewed or built new by the Prussian administration.Buchholz, 1999, p. 347. Swamps in the Randowbruch and Uckermark regions were drained and settled with colonists from the Low Countries from 1718. In 1734 part of this region became therefore known as \\"Royal Holland\\". Dutch colonists were also settled in other parts of Pomerania. Also, Protestants from the otherwise Catholic Salzburg region arrived Prussia via the Pomeranian ports. While most went on to settle in other parts of Prussia, some settled in Pomerania. To improve access to the port of Stettin, the Swine river was deepened and Swinemünde was founded on the river's mouth in 1748. A similar project in Stolp failed due to financial shortfalls.Buchholz, 1999, pp. 350–351. Throughout the 1750s, the vast Oderbruch swamps were drained to provide farmland. King Frederick the Great appointed Franz Balthasar von Brenckenhoff to rebuild the war-torn Prussian portion of Pomerania. Even before the Seven Years' War, the Inner Colonisation of Farther Pomerania had been begun by prince Moritz of Anhalt-Dessau. Brenckenhoff, after providing some humanitarian aid in 1763 (especially horses and wheat from the military and money for seed and life stock), introduced programs for financial aid, tax reduction, and low-rate credits and thus managed to have most of the farms that had been destroyed rebuild in 1764.Buchholz, 1999, p. 354. In the years following, new farmland was made available by clearance of woodlands and draining of swamps (e.g. Thurbruch, Plönebruch, Schmolsiner Bruch) and lakes (e.g. Madüsee, Neustettiner See) as well as levee construction at some rivers (e.g. Ihna, Łeba). To compensate for the wartime population losses, new colonists were attracted. In the 1740s, colonists were invited from the Palatinate, Württemberg, Mecklenburg and Bohemia. Most came from the Palatinate, while the Bohemians soon returned to their homeland as a result of housing shortages. In 1750, recruitment of settlers started in Danzig, Elbing, Warsaw, Augsburg, Frankfurt am Main, Nuremberg, Hamburg and Brussels. Protestant craftsmen from Roman Catholic Poland settled in the towns. The colonists were freed of certain taxes and services such as military service. Between 1740 and 1784, 26,000 colonists arrived in Prussian Pomerania, and 159 new villages were founded. Most colonists originated in the Palatinate, Mecklenburg and Poland.Buchholz, 1999, pp. 351, 358. In 1786, the population of Prussian Pomerania (Farther Pomerania and Western Pomerania south of the Peene river) reached 438,700.Buchholz, 1999, p. 332. == Napoleonic Wars == After Prussia lost the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt in late 1806, French troops marched north into the Pomeranian province. Fortified Stettin surrendered without battle, and the province became occupied by the French forces. Only fortified Kolberg resisted, and the French laid siege in March 1807. Ferdinand von Schill was among the defendants. The siege was not successful and was lifted only when Prussia surrendered to Napoleon Bonaparte in the Peace of Tilsit on 2 July.Buchholz, 1999, p. 360. The terms of surrender included high war contributions (25,000,000 Taler from the Province of Pomerania alone). The agreed on withdrawal of the French troops was delayed repeatedly. In November 1808, the French troops left the province except for Stettin, which forced the provincial government to move to Stargard in 1809. The Kriegs- und Domänenkammer was renamed Royal-Prussian government (\\"Königlich Preußische Regierung\\"), while the former government (\\"Regierung\\") was renamed Supreme State Court (\\"Oberlandesgericht\\").Buchholz, 1999, pp. 363–364. The reforms of vom Stein (1807) and Karl August von Hardenberg (1811) abolished serfdom. In 1812, French troops invaded Swedish Pomerania, and also occupied Prussian Pomerania again. The Prussian troops took quarter in Kolberg. After Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg, who commanded a Prussian corps with a significant Pomeranian share, had left the coalition with France in the Convention of Tauroggen of 30 December 1812, the Prussian military called the Pomeranians to arms in February 1813. Also in February, Russian troops reached Farther Pomerania. In March, all French forces left Pomerania, except for Stettin, which was held by the French until 5 December 1813. After the war, Prussia after diplomatic efforts of Hardenberg in the Congress of Vienna gained Swedish Pomerania by paying 2,6 million Taler to Denmark and granting her the Duchy of Lauenburg, and paying an additional 3,5 million Taler to Sweden on 7 June 1815. On 23 October, Swedish Pomerania was merged into the Prussian province, both now constituting the Province of Pomerania. == References  Notes = Bibliography === * Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, .

Deroche is adjacent to the eastern end of Nicomen Island, from which it is separated by the Nicomen Slough (NB a different location 3 km away was known as Deroche Landing). The community is at the foot of Nicomen Mountain and is immediately across the river from Chilliwack Mountain. The population of Deroche is definitely more than the estimated 148 people indicated here up until now (Friday September 6, 2019) and more than likely is closer to 1000. ==Name origin== The original name of Deroche was Derocier, but the local CPR station was given the current name to honour Joseph Deroche, who settled there in the early 1880s and had moved to BC from Quebec, Canada in 1860 during the gold rush. Deroche died on March 19, 1922, age 99, and some of his descendants still live in the area. ==Services== In addition to a store and garage and other small commercial enterprises, Deroche has an elementary school which is part of British Columbia School District No. 75 (Mission). The Deroche water system service area was established in 1992 by the Dewdney-Alouette Regional District, and later became a Fraser Valley Regional District service area after reorganization of regional district boundaries. The water system serves the community of Deroche, which is in Electoral Area G of the regional district. The system was originally operated as a private water system under a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity, and was taken over by DARD in 1993. At that time, Deroche Creek was used as the source, but several debris flow incidents within the watershed severely affected the creek, causing interruptions of supply as well as several water quality challenges for the system. As a result, in 1999-2000 several upgrades to the system were carried out. The system was changed over to a groundwater well source, dramatically improving water quality and supply reliability. ==See also== *Dewdney, British Columbia *Lake Errock *Chehalis, British Columbia *Mission, British Columbia ==References== * ==Further reading== *\\"Deroche Community\\", heritageplaces.com website (Mission Museum & Community Archives) *\\"Butter-Inman Farm\\", heritageplaces.com website (Mission Museum & Community Archives) Category:Populated places on the Fraser River Category:Populated places in the Fraser Valley Regional District Category:Unincorporated settlements in British Columbia Category:Designated places in British Columbia Category:1860s establishments in British Columbia ","title":"Deroche"},{"id":"20342235","text":"Martha Elizabeth “Marelize” Robberts (born 1986) is a Namibian model and beauty pageant contestant who won the title of Miss Namibia 2008 and represented Namibia in Miss World 2008 in South Africa. ==External links== * Marelize Robberts biography and photos Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:Namibian female models Category:Miss World 2008 delegates Category:People from Windhoek Category:White Namibian people Category:Namibian beauty pageant winners ","title":"Marelize Robberts"},{"id":"20342258","text":"==National teamFriendly Matches=== * Qatar vs. Iraq not considered as a FIFA International match since Iraq made 13 Substitutions. ===Four Nations Tournament=== Four nations tournament, hosted in the UAE.

He was a two time First Team All American at Penn State and played over ten seasons in the American Soccer League. Packer grew up in Newtown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania. He attended the George School where he played soccer, basketball and baseball. In 1952, the Penn State University soccer coach, Bill Jeffrey, recruited Packer. He entered Penn State on a full athletic scholarship, playing both baseball, as a center fielder and shortstop, as well as center forward on the soccer team. At the time, collegiate rules prohibited freshmen from playing intercollegiate sports. Consequently, he played on the varsity soccer team from 1953 to 1955. His junior season, he dropped baseball and concentrated on soccer for his last two seasons at Penn State. In 1954, Penn State won the national college championship and shared the 1955 title with Brockport University. Packer was named to the 1954 and 1955 first team All American team.1954 All Americans1955 All AmericansLeader of the pack Despite playing only three seasons and twenty- four games, he scored 53 goals, a school record which stood until broken by Stuart Reid in 1995. In December 1955, he joined the Uhrik Truckers of the American Soccer League. By that time, he had been selected for the U.S. Olympic Soccer team as it prepared for the 1956 Summer Olympics. In order to maintain his amateur, he played without pay with Truckers. The Truckers won the 1955-1956 ASL championship with Packer coming off the bench and scoring two goals in the title game. Packer graduated from Penn State in 1956 with a bachelor's degree in hotel administration. That summer, he went to the Summer Olympics, but did not play in the team's only game, a 9-1 loss to Yugoslavia. The Year in American Soccer – 1956 During his college years, he had attended ROTC and after graduation, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Air Force. Packer separated from the Air Force in 1959. He rejoined Uhrik and would play with the team until at least 1968. He also worked in the travel industry. He has also run soccer camps for over thirty years.Ex-Olympian still carries a torch for soccer ==See also== *List of Pennsylvania State University Olympians ==References *An unlikely Olympian Category:Living people Category:American soccer coaches Category:American soccer players Category:Olympic soccer players of the United States Category:Footballers at the 1956 Summer Olympics Category:Penn State Nittany Lions men's soccer players Category:American Soccer League (1933–1983) players Category:Uhrik Truckers players Category:United States Air Force officers Category:Soccer players from Pennsylvania Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Association football forwards ","title":"Dick Packer"},{"id":"20342298","text":"Julius Ailio (19 July 1872 – 4 March 1933) was a Finnish archaeologist and a Social Democratic politician.

The programme was produced by 12 Yard, and hosted by Chris Tarrant and Millie Clode. The format was originally devised by Paul Brassey and Daniel Moody in 2006, and developed by Jim Cannon, Andy Culpin, Samuel Pollard and David Young. A total of eight episodes were produced but only seven of these were broadcast, due to poor viewing figures. Subsequently, the programme was axed by ITV on 12 June 2009. The game-show later survived as a board game manufactured by Drumond Park. ==Format== Twenty stylised \\"cash machines\\" stand on the stage, each with a screen displaying a different colour. Each machine is loaded with a different cash amount ranging from £1,000 to £20,000 in increments of £1,000; the amounts are kept secret from everyone. At the beginning of the game, the contestant selects one of three \\"cash cards\\", each of which has been credited with a value of £50,000 or higher in multiples of £1,000. The contestant runs the selected card through a reader to reveal its value, which becomes their target for the game. On each turn, the contestant selects a machine and the host starts it. The screen displays a starting value of zero and begins to count up slowly in £1,000 steps. As long as the machine has not exceeded its limit, the contestant may shut it off any time by calling \\"Stop!\\", at which point the displayed amount is added to their total. However, if the machine reaches its limit and continues to run without being stopped, it shuts itself off and the contestant banks no money for that turn. After the contestant stops a machine, the amount it contains is revealed by allowing it to keep running until shutoff occurs. The contestant may select up to 10 machines, and must bank enough money to reach the target in order to win that total. Failure to do so forfeits all the money. In addition, if it becomes mathematically impossible to reach the target with the remaining machines, the game ends immediately and the contestant leaves with nothing. Co-host Millie Clode provided contestants with a statistical rundown between the machines being played – informing them of their running total, how much money they still needed to take, how many machines they could still select and how much money they needed to take, on average, from each of these remaining machines to reach their target. Each episode of the show featured two games. ==Series== The series was filmed at The London Studios, with the first episode airing at 6:35 PM on Saturday, 21 February 2009. The second, third (postponed on Saturday, 7 March) and fourth episodes were broadcast at the slightly later time of 6:45 PM. The fifth episode aired on Saturday, 28 March at 8:20 PM. The sixth episode aired on Saturday, 4 April at 7:55 PM. The seventh episode aired on Saturday, 11 April at 9:15 PM. The eighth and final episode that was scheduled to air on 18 April was rescheduled for 29 December, but again was not shown. ==ReceptionRatings=== Episode viewing figures from BARB: {  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !Show !Date !Audience (millions) !Viewing share (%) - 1 21 February 2009 3.99 18 - 2 28 February 2009 4.43 20 - 3 14 March 2009 4.24 20 - 4 21 March 2009 4.23 20 - 5 28 March 2009 2.71 12.3 - 6 4 April 2009 2.50 12.1 - 7 11 April 2009 2.86 12.5 } Prior to the show going on air, former ITV controller of Entertainment Duncan Gray, writing in The Independent, suggested that ITV executives were hoping for an audience of around 5 million viewers. ===Critical reaction=== The programme received a largely negative response from critics. The Times said that it was \\"tedious\\", while The News of the World branded it \\"exactly the kind of cynical crowd-pleasing guff we’ve come to despise ITV for\\". One of the few positive reviews came from Charlie Brooker, writing in The Guardian, who called the show \\"so compelling, tense and yet ultimately random, it's likely to be a huge worldwide hit.\\". In his review of 2009, Brooker described this as the \\"most off-the-mark prediction\\" of the year. Readers of ukgameshows.com named it the worst new game show of 2009 in their \\"Hall of shame\\" poll. == International versions== The TV format was sold in Italy with the title Il colore dei soldi aired on Italia 1, hosted by Enrico Papi in September 2009. ==References * Category:2000s British game shows Category:2009 British television series debuts Category:2009 British television series endings Category:British game shows Category:ITV game shows Category:Television series by ITV Studios ","title":"The Colour of Money (game show)"},{"id":"20342366","text":"Juhani Arajärvi Juhani Arajärvi (July 25, 1867, Urjala – November 13, 1941) was a Finnish politician.

The lake, while entirely within Canada, is located just north of the border between British Columbia and the state of Washington and is both fed and drained by the Chilliwack River, which has its source in the North Cascades of Washington state and Canada, which surround the lake on all sides. == Parks and recreation == Chilliwack Lake in the winter (2009) Chilliwack Lake Provincial Park is located on the lake's shores on the Canadian end of the lake. At the south end of the lake, there is a large beach, often a partying location, where the at-this-point-slough-like Chilliwack River enters the far end of the lake. There is also a trail that leads into an old growth forest along the river above the lake. It starts near the lake's far end. If you head off trail and ford the river, you can find the difficult trail to Hanging Lake. === Boating === Chilliwack Lake can be ideal for canoeing, kayaking, and small motorized boats. It is important to understand local conditions prior to departure as strong afternoon winds can strand unsuspecting people on the east end of this alpine lake. Also note that dangerous currents exist on the south-west corner of the lake where the water flows into the Chilliwack River. There is a boat launch that is suitable for boats under 20 feet in length at the west end of the lake. Water levels fluctuate throughout the year and the boat launch can become unusable due to either high water completely submerging it, or low water exposing jagged rocks - use at your own risk. ==Climate== Chilliwack Lake has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate type Cfb). == Road closures == The road on the east side of the lake leading to its far end has been closed off to all but regular vehicles. ATVs and dirtbikes are not permitted on the road beyond the south boundary of Chilliwack Lake Provincial Park. In addition to that, the road has been decommissioned and gated at the bridge over Depot Creek due to vandalism at the far end of the lake. ==References== Category:Lakes of the Lower Mainland Category:Canadian Cascades Category:North Cascades of Washington (state) Category:Lakes of Whatcom County, Washington Category:Lakes of Washington (state) ","title":"Chilliwack Lake"},{"id":"20342395","text":"Harold Foster Hallet (1886 - 1966), - British philosopher, was born in 1886.

He is the author of numerous books and articles on philosophy. Most noteworthy is his seminal work in the philosophy of Baruch Spinoza. His \\"Spinoza The Elements of His Philosophy\\" stands as the most comprehensive and erudite analysis of Spinoza's system in the entire extant. The book employs an extremely sophisticated philosophical language, much which appears to be usages uniquely employed to capture in intricate detail all of the interrelationships or 'potency in act' among Substance, Attribute and the Modalities. This detail allows Hallett to display the complete unity and self-evident truth value in the \\"Ethics\\" and related Spinoza writings. Spinoza's tersely stated propositions, corollaries, demonstrations, definitions and scholia, along with the dearth of illustrations or examples have left many of those lacking in imaginative or expansionary thinking to surmise and explicate much useless commentary. Professor Hallett sets this sorry situation to rights. His work is written for trained students of philosophy, but the intelligent and capable non- philosopher can glean new learnings through diligent study and deep reflection on elegance of Hallett's wisdom and tutelage.

The company was later a subsidiary of Waste Management, Inc., active from 1970-1984. ==HistoryEarly years=== SCA was unique in that it was not originally supposed to be a waste hauler. SCA was incorporated by Berton Steir as a diversified conglomerate, providing building maintenance, vending, food, travel, and waste disposal service. SCA's first acquisition was of seven vending companies, a building maintenance company, and a single waste hauler. By the time its stock was placed on the NYSE, it had decided to focus on waste disposal instead. Similar to many of the other firms around this time, it would purchase companies with its stock. In the early 1970s, SCA absorbed 87 independent contractors. As part of the deals, SCA would keep the current management in control. The Harvard-educated Steir naïvely acquired New Jersey trash companies, with disguised ownership, which subsequently caused SCA problems. Berton Steir left the company in 1976. ===Mafia and Criminal Connections Emerge=== SCA was the first major trash hauler to enter New Jersey, which proved to be highly unstable for the company. To combat this, Tom Viola and his firm were enlisted to soften up the market. Viola also brought his criminal connections with him, but despite this, he was made SCA's vice president. Another waste hauler, based out of Utica, New York, was owned by the infamous Anthony Bentro, known for his connections to Anthony Provenzano, a mobster linked with plots to murder Fidel Castro, John F. Kennedy and Jimmy Hoffa. Months after Hoffa's assassination, prominent members of SCA's New York team were indicted for planning a $300,000 kickback to mobsters and Teamsters. ===Continued Expansion=== SCA had grown to become the third largest waste hauler amidst all this internal turmoil. Its territory stretched from Boston, Massachusetts, all the way to California. By 1976, the company's sales were $660,000,000, including all of its subsidiaries. SCA's fleet of garbage trucks had swelled to 1,800 in 90 cities. It had 39 landfills, 100 municipal contracts, 110,000 commercial accounts and 100,000 dumpsters. SCA's data center in Somerville, MA provided information technology (\\"IT\\") services to its haulers, many of which had no IT capability prior to acquisition by SCA in the 1980s. ===Hazardous Waste Activities=== SCA had begun to diversify into the world of hazardous wastes. It owned sites in five states. One of these dumps in Niagara Falls, New York, near the infamous Love Canal site, became a local terror. Lagoons of industrial waste would emerge during rainstorms, and highway officials reported of numerous explosions and fires. A 1976 incident was described as sending flames and exploding drums 80 feet in the air. Continued public protest made SCA prefer incineration of toxic wastes to landfill burial. These efforts appeared to pay off when President Carter banned hazardous waste burial, but the Reagan administration quickly reversed these policies. ===The Fall Of SCA=== The company's criminal connections would become known after the murder of several independent contractors who had challenged SCA in New Jersey. Immediately afterwards, the towns reverted to SCA's services. In response to these accusations, SCA tried to dispose of all of its New Jersey operations, but couldn't find a buyer. Due to the numerous troubles that Tom Viola had gotten the company into, he resigned in 1981. Viola was replaced by a far more reputable business leader, Henry Russell. In one of the strangest alliances in the company's history, SCA joined the Environmental Defense Fund to reinstate the ban of hazardous waste dumping. But these moves just forestalled SCA's inevitable demise. ===BFI Vs. Waste Management=== Houston based Browning-Ferris Industries attempted to swallow the company whole in 1982. Many inside the company questioned if this would work. SCA had rejected an offer by Waste Management in 1977, and this was no different. What would have amounted to an $210 million deal, was rejected by the company. Canadian waste hauler Laidlaw was going to purchase SCA, but the various scandals and criminal connections that the company had deterred the company from pursuing mergers. Through a subsidiary, 60 percent of SCA was purchased by Waste Management, Inc. ==Sources== *\\"Giants Of Garbage\\" By Harold Crooks, 1988. *https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/23/business/sca-services-inc-reports- earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html *https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/23/business/sca-studying-merger- proposals.html Category:Corporate scandals Category:Waste management companies of the United States Category:Companies based in Boston Category:American companies established in 1970 Category:Waste companies established in 1970 Category:Companies disestablished in 1984 Category:Defunct companies based in Massachusetts Category:1970 establishments in Massachusetts Category:1984 disestablishments in Massachusetts ","title":"Service Corporation of America"},{"id":"20342397","text":"Arthur Brofeldt (January 27, 1868 in Taipalsaari – August 27, 1928) was a Finnish politician.

The season officially began on June 1 and ended on November 30, dates which conventionally limit the period of each year when tropical cyclones tend to form in the Atlantic. The first named storm, Tropical Storm Alberto, formed on June 30. The last storm of the season, Hurricane Gordon, dissipated on November 21. This timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, as well as dissipation during the season. The timeline also includes information which was not operationally released, such as post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center. This season produced seven named storms; three attained hurricane status, though none became a major hurricane, a storm that ranks as a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Tropical Storm Alberto produced significant rainfall and flooding in the Southeastern United States, damaging or destroying over 18,000 homes, and inflicting $750 million (1994 USD) in damages. In August, Tropical Storm Beryl produced heavy rainfall in areas of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina, with moderate to heavy rainfall throughout several other states. Beryl caused numerous injuries, many of which occurred from a tornado associated with the tropical storm. Tropical Storm Debby killed nine people throughout its path in September. Hurricane Gordon in November caused damages from Costa Rica to North Carolina in its six landfalls; extreme flooding and mudslides from the storm caused about 1,122 fatalities in Haiti. ==Timeline of events== ImageSize = width:800 height:200 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/06/1994 till:01/12/1994 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/06/1994 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Depression_=_<39_mph_(0–62_km/h) id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39–73_mph_(63–117 km/h) id:C1 value:rgb(1,1,0.80) legend:Category_1_=_74–95_mph_(118–153_km/h) id:C2 value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46) legend:Category_2_=_96–110_mph_(154–177_km/h) id:C3 value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Category_3_=_111–130_mph_(178–209-km/h) id:C4 value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13) legend:Category_4_=_131–155_mph_(210–249_km/h) id:C5 value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Category_5_=_>=156_mph_(>=250_km/h) Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:30/06/1994 till:07/07/1994 color:TS text:\\"Alberto\\" from:20/07/1994 till:21/07/1994 color:TD text:\\"Two\\" from:14/08/1994 till:19/08/1994 color:TS text:\\"Beryl\\" from:16/08/1994 till:23/08/1994 color:C1 text:\\"Chris\\" barset:break from:29/08/1994 till:31/08/1994 color:TD text:\\"Five\\" from:09/09/1994 till:11/09/1994 color:TS text:\\"Debby\\" from:21/09/1994 till:26/09/1994 color:TS text:\\"Ernesto\\" from:24/09/1994 till:26/09/1994 color:TD text:\\"Eight\\" barset:break from:27/09/1994 till:29/09/1994 color:TD text:\\"Nine\\" from:29/09/1994 till:30/09/1994 color:TD text:\\"Ten\\" from:02/11/1994 till:08/11/1994 color:C2 text:\\"Florence\\" from:08/11/1994 till:21/11/1994 color:C1 text:\\"Gordon\\" bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/06/1994 till:01/07/1994 text:June from:01/07/1994 till:01/08/1994 text:July from:01/08/1994 till:01/09/1994 text:August from:01/09/1994 till:01/10/1994 text:September from:01/10/1994 till:01/11/1994 text:October from:01/11/1994 till:01/12/1994 text:November TextData = pos:(570,30) text:\\"(From the\\" pos:(617,30) text:\\"Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale)\\" ===June=== Radar image of Tropical Storm Alberto near landfall ;June 1 :*The Atlantic hurricane season officially begins. ;June 30 :*2 a.m. EDT (0600 UTC) – Tropical Depression One forms 45 miles (75 km)The figures for maximum sustained winds and position estimates are rounded to the nearest 5 units (knots, miles, or kilometers), following the convention used in the National Hurricane Center's operational products for each storm.

Ammunition: 6 kg metal ball. The Year XI system (French:\\"Système An XI\\", after of the 11th year of the French Republic, i.e. 1803) was a French artillery system developed during the rule of Napoleon. The Year XI system was original in that it brought various improvements to the highly successful Gribeauval system, on which many successes of the Napoleonic Wars relied. It especially consisted in streamlining the existing Gribeauval designs.The Roots of Artillery Doctrine: Napoleonic Artillery tactics reconsidered by B McConachy - 2001 The main proponent of the new system was General Marmont.Chartrand (1) pp.23-34 It was superseded by the Valée system. ==Definition== In light of the French Revolutionary Wars it appeared especially that the Gribeauval 4-pdr was too light, and that the 8-pdr was too heavy for medium field artillery.Dawson et al (2007) p 70 These two guns had not appeared adequate against enemy 6-pdr guns.Napoleon's Guns, 1792-1815 - René Chartrand p.21 In order to define the new improved system, Napoleon formed a committee of Artillery on 29 December 1801, presided by general Augustin Gabriel d'Aboville, First Inspector of Artillery. The committee accomplished its research from 11 January 1802 to 21 July 1802.Dawson et al (2007) p 70 Napoleon himself participated in the proceedings: The committee gave its results on 2 May 1803.Dawson et al (2007) p 74 Mortar of 324 mm. Strasbourg, 1811. One of the main findings of the committee was as follows: * To recommend the introduction of a 6-pdr and the suppression of the 4-pdr and the 8-pdr. * The field artillery would thus be composed of a 12-pdr cannon, a 6-pdr cannon and a 24-pdr (5.72-inch) howitzer * The mountain artillery would have the short 3-pdr cannon, short 6-pdr cannon and 24-pdr howitzer. * Siege artillery was also modified, with the introduction of new Long 24-pdr and Short 24-pdr, * Garrison artillery was also modified, with the introduction of new Long 24-pdr, Long 12-pdr and Long 6-pdr cannons * New Mortars as well as 324mm, 216mm and 152mm mortars, and 405mm perriers.Dawson et al (2007) p 74, 173 and 177-179 ==Obsolescence== Canon obusier de 11 pouces (11-inch gun- howitzer), système An XI, bronze founded in 1810 at Douai.

Many of its members later became key figures of the Tongmenghui. ==Background== In 1903, Russian Empire made seven requests to the Qing Dynasty in an attempt to invade and occupy Northeast China. This action shook Japan. The Asahi Shimbun first published this news, and the Chinese students studying in Japan held a student conference at the Kinkikwan () in Tokyo. In early June, Huang Xing returned to China from Japan as an \\"athlete\\" of the Army and National Education Association () and planned new actions in Hunan and Hubei. On November 4, 1903, in the name of celebrating his 30th birthday, Huang Xing invited Liu Kuiyi (), Song Jiaoren, Zhang Shizhao and others to hold a secret meeting at the home of Peng Yuanxun (), Baojia Bureau Lane, West District of Changsha, and decided to organize an anti-Qing revolutionary group to name \\"Huaxinghui\\", and called it \\"Huaxing Company\\" () to the outside. The group's members amounted to hundreds of people, mostly intellectuals. Its purpose was to \\"expel the Tatar barbarians and revive Zhonghua\\" (); its strategy was to launch a war in Hunan, and the provinces respond to \\"go straight to Youyan\\" (). ==History== The China Revival Society was dominated by students from Hunan who had returned from Japan. Nevertheless, from the very beginning it had strong ties with secret societies, especially with the Ko Lao Hui whose organizational structure the Huaxinghui paralleled, particularly in the field of the military chain of command. This connects to the primary goal of the Huaxinghui: to \\"kick out the Tartars\\" through assassinations of important Manchu officials. After two failed plots, in November 1904 and early 1905, Huang Xing fled to Japan. There he met Sun Yat-sen in the summer of 1905 for the first time in Tokyo, in order to discuss the possibility of the merger of Sun's Xingzhonghui and the Huaxinghui. A compromise was reached, and Huang decided to support Sun fully. At this point the Huaxinghui had ceased to exist. On 20 August 1905, Sun Yat- sen was elected Tsung-li (premier) of the new party named Tongmenghui.

He was the second son of Madalyn Murray O'Hair, an activist who founded American Atheists in 1963 and served as its first president. He was the half-brother of William J. Murray. ==Career and activism== From 1986 until his death in 1995, Murray held the de jure office of President of American Atheists. It was a title without power, however, as his mother retained authoritative control behind-the-scenes. ==Personal life and death== Jon Garth Murray, called \\"Garth\\", was born in Baltimore, Maryland in 1954, the son of Madalyn Murray O'Hair and Michael Fiorillo, her boyfriend at the time. It is likely that Garth never met his father. In 1960 his mother filed a lawsuit against the Baltimore public school system, naming his older half-brother William J. Murray as plaintiff. Consolidated with another case, it reached the United States Supreme Court on appeal, which ruled that mandatory public Bible readings in public schools was unconstitutional. That year his mother founded American Atheists and served for decades as the first president. Murray also worked for the organization as an adult. He is thought to have had only one, short-lived relationship with a woman. He was a tall, heavyset man and had a speech impairment. He was living with his mother Madalyn in 1995, together with his niece Robin Murray O'Hair in Austin, Texas. (His mother had adopted her granddaughter Robin, making her Garth's adopted sister). In 1995, Murray, his mother, and his niece Robin were all kidnapped and killed in San Antonio by David Roland Waters, a former employee of American Atheists. Waters committed these crimes in association with two other men. ==Remembrance== In 2012, a memorial brick for Murray, his mother Madalyn Murray O'Hair, and his niece Robin was placed at Lou Neff Point in Zilker Park in Austin, Texas. ==References== * Category:1954 births Category:1995 deaths Category:American atheism activists Category:American murder victims Category:People from Austin, Texas Category:People murdered in Texas Category:Kidnapped American people Category:20th-century atheists ","title":"Jon Garth Murray"},{"id":"20342537","text":"Erik Berg (October 6, 1876 – January 1, 1945) was a Finnish politician.

He was born in the village of Nan'an, Fujian, China, in 1867. He came to Penang at the age of 17 in the 1880s virtually penniless, and found work as a barber. He rose to become the richest men in Penang. Over a course of thirty years, he built an empire with real banking, real estate and commodities trading activities. He founded the Ban Hin Lee Bank in 1918 and many other companies. Yeap Chor Ee remained the only individual who single-handedly funded the establishment of a bank in that era. He also became one of the State's leading philanthropists. Yeap died in 1952 at the age of 85. By then, he was known as \\"The Grand Old Man of Penang\\", praised for his \\"old-world courtesy, humility, generosity and integrity\\". ==Family== He had a wife in China, who remained in his ancestral home. He also married a local girl, Lee Cheng Kin, by whom he had two sons, Datuk Yeap Hock Hoe and Yeap Hock Hin. They lived in a mansion called ‘Homestead’ at No 54 Northam Road which was their family house. In 1942, his son Yeap Hock Hoe married Julie Phang who gave birth to a daughter, Angela Yeap (Yeap Poh Suat). During the Japanese Occupation Datuk Yeap remarried to someone called Hooi Kum Chee, then still in her teens, who lived in Homestead. Although there is no evidence of Kum Chee's marriage, Yeap Chor Ee recognised her as Datuk Yeap's wife. She gave birth to three daughters and one son. During his marriage to Kum Chee and sometime in 1943, Datuk Yeap met Yam Kim Lian at the Wembley Arcade where he frequented regularly. Eventually, she became his secondary wife in 1944 and bore him two daughters and four sons. Kim Lian and her children lived at Selamat Lane whilst Datuk Yeap and Kum Chee continued to live with his parents in Homestead. Kum Chee died in 1948 after an operation. She was still in her early twenties, leaving behind four young children, the eldest of whom was five years old and the youngest barely two years. Datuk Yeap was deeply grieved by her death. Some three years later, on 22 December 1951 Datuk Yeap married Kum Chee's younger sister Hooi Sooi Wan, then 20 years old. The marriage was conducted in Homestead according to Chinese rites and custom in the presence of Yeap Chor Ee and Lee Cheng Kin and others. In 1957 Datuk Yeap married another wife, Gan Chiew Heang, who gave birth to three daughters. : A Full List of Datuk Yeap Hock Hoe's wives: : * Ida Oei (Daughter of Chinese Indonesian Businessman, Oei Tiong Ham married in 1933), who divorced shortly after the birth of a son, Francis Yeap. * Julie Phang (m. 1942), who later left Homestead and remarried. * Hooi Kum Chee (m. ~ 1943), who died in 1948, after an operation; * Yam Kim Lian (m. 1944), who lived at Selamat Lane with her children; * Hooi Sooi Wan (m. 1951); who is Hooi Kum Chee's younger sister; * Gan Chiew Heang (m. 1957). ==Family museum== A private family gallery/museum in Penang has been opened - House of Yeap Chor Ee. The museum, traditionally known as the Kau Kheng Choo (Nine Houses), was originally the home of Yeap Chor Ee before Homestead.

He was a member of the Senate of Finland and Minister–Secretary of State for Finland. ==Biography== His family was originally from Braunschweig in Germany, where his grandfather stepped into service for Russia. Through his wife the grandfather became a landowner in Finland in 1784. His sons Johan, Alexander and Karl were entered into the House of Nobility in 1836. Johan and Karl became soldiers and Alexander, the only one with a university education, farmed land. Marrying Maria Charlotta Amalia von Wilde, he had six children of whom Woldemar was the second youngest. The oldest of the sons, Alexander Gustaf, inherited the Sippola mansion. Like two of his older brothers, Woldemar went to Hamina Cadet School. Over the years he progressed through the ranks first in the Finnish military and then the Imperial Russian Army, becoming a colonel in 1869. In 1871, he married noblewoman Nina Svjatopolsk-Mirsk. He served as an officer in the Imperial Russian Army for 20 years, but returned to Finland in 1882 when he was appointed the governor of the Vyborg province. In 1885 he was promoted chief of then Ministry of the Interior, also becoming a member of the Senate of Finland, where he often had heated debates with Leo Mechelin. He became Minister–Secretary of State for Finland in 1891, serving until 1898. He faced numerous difficult conflicts and uproar regarding what were seen as reductions of Finnish autonomy in the 1890s, such as the 1890 by tsar Alexander III and many others such as regarding criminal law and the entire state system of the Grand Duchy of Finland. He played a large part in negotiations concerning Finland with tsars Alexander III and Nicholas II. He resigned for health reasons on 11 June 1898. He died aged 62 in Rome, Italy. All five of his children died without leaving children of their own, which meant that the family of von Daehn was registered as ended in the Finnish House of Nobility in 1971 when the youngest son died. ==GalleryReferences== Category:1838 births Category:1900 deaths Category:People from Kouvola Category:People from Viipuri Province (Grand Duchy of Finland) Category:Finnish people of German descent Category:Finnish nobility Category:Finnish politicians Category:Finnish senators ","title":"Woldemar von Daehn"},{"id":"20342683","text":"J.

In this microcommunity of bacteria, rotifers, protozoa, and midges, W. smithii is the top-level predator; its presence determines the bacterial species diversity within the pitcher. It is not in any way a pest mosquito, neither biting nor approaching humans or livestock, although there are some populations in the southern US, such as that in the Apalachicola National Forest, that have been observed to take blood meals after laying an initial egg batch.W.E. Bradshaw, Blood-feeding and Capacity for Increase in the Pitcher-plant Mosquito, Wyeomyia smithiiD. Allen, Carbon dioxide sensitivity in two disjunct populations of the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii. 2015. Georgia Southern University, University Honors Program Theses. 126. https://digitalcommons.georgiasouthern.edu/honors-theses/126. In fact, it is the only known mosquito to have both obligatory biting and non-biting populations in the same species. ==Life CycleDescription of the life cycle=== The life cycle of Wyeomyia smithii begins in either late spring or early fall when the adult female lays her eggs in the phytolema of a purple pitcher plant. The eggs then gestate in the pitcher plant anywhere from 1–8 days before they hatch as larvae. The larvae remain in the phytolema feeding on bacteria, micro-animals, and decaying insects. The mosquito larvae will live in the pitcher plant until it goes through its fifth instar about 20 to 22 days after hatching. They then emerge as adult mosquitoes ready to mate. Wyeomyia smithii females will produce a clutch of fertilized eggs generally within two days of sexual maturity. Some populations in the southern United States have also been known to drink blood after producing their first clutch to help produce a second clutch; there are no reports of northern populations displaying this behavior, however. ==Photoperiodism== Wyeomyia smithii is a model organism for the study of photoperiodism, the biotic process of controlling seasonal life history events by measuring day length as a reliable predictor of the seasons. W. smithii enters a state of developmental arrest, larval diapause, that is initiated and maintained by short day lengths and averted or terminated by long day lengths. There is speculation that hypothetical global warming and the shortening of winters, W. smithii has been observed to now require shorter days before going dormant, this led to the theory that this is an example of microevolutionary selection; mosquitoes that waited longer to go dormant and which had a greater fitness have been favored. Photoperiodism in Wyeomyia smithii is believed in nature to examine the startling finding that proposed, but not proven, recent climate change can force genetic change in plants and animals. Wyeomyia smithii lives through the winter as diapausing larvae in the leaves of the pitcher plant. The pitcher- plant mosquito enters a hibernal diapause as larvae. Which means, short days initiate and maintain diapause, and long days promote continuous development in diapausing larvae. The day length promotes 50% development and 50% diapause (the critical photoperiod) as the same for the initiation and termination of not developing in unchilled larvae. For the initiation of not developing, insects pass through a “sensitive period” during which day length is interpreted as long or short, which results in a diapause/no-diapause response. Wyeomyia smithii is photoperiodic while in diapause. The sensitive period is indefinitely long, and the effect of manipulating different light. Dark cycles can be assessed over weeks or months, instead of a few days. Wyeomyia smithii oviposits into and completes their entire preadult development only within the water-filled leaves of the carnivorous pitcher plant Sarracenia purpurea. Throughout this range, W. smithii occupies a uniform microhabitat whose community composition remains highly consistent. The photoperiodic response has been exposed to various seasonal changes, both in situ and during postglacial dispersal. ==Co-evolution of mosquito and plantPlant adaptations=== The purple pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea), which houses W. smithii, is known to be the most habitable pitcher plant for many different inquilines. At least 165 various species of insects, protozoa, algae, and other organisms can live within the purple pitcher plant. The plant has adapted to have fluid with a higher pH than other, more acidic, carnivorous pitcher plants. There is little fluid secreted by this plant in comparison to the rainwater it collects in its pitcher, which dilutes the solution and creates a more habitable environment for outside organisms. The plant's adaptation allowing it to host diverse life is an advantage to the mosquito because its larvae prey upon those organisms. The mosquitos also prey on the food that the pitcher plant catches, giving them a steady food source. ===Mosquito Evolution/Adaptations=== The pitcher plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii, has been featured in scientific studies because of its co-evolution with the purple pitcher plant. The relationship between the two species highlights a genetic response to climate change, which details how a population can evolve at a quicker pace in order to make accommodations due to the changes in climate. The water-filled pitcher plant proved to be a suitable home for the mosquito in its habitat range. It is because both species can endure a temperate climate. This idea makes the pitcher plant the next option for this mosquito species to stay in its current domain. The relationship is beneficial for both species and allows them to continue to evolve together. The purple pitcher plant uses the mosquito for nutrients once the mosquitoes die off. And, these mosquitoes are no different than any other subspecies, in terms of attraction, they are drawn to water. The pitcher plant is filled with water and this is a type of environment that is used as a location for female mosquitoes to lay their eggs.

Books include over 140 story books, activity books, picture books and annuals.Felicity Wishes books The popularity of the books led to the launch of a Felicity Wishes magazine and hundreds of other products.Felicity Wishes products at Amazon The series is about a fairy called Felicity Wishes and her friends Holly, Polly and Daisy and later on winnie. Felicity lives in a fictional town called Little Blossoming. Little Blossoming, Bloomfield is in Fairy World. Fairy World is much the same as the human world with several key exceptions: there is no age, birth or death (fairies live forever), no men, no meat-eating, no money, no evil and no crime. Most of the books are set pre- graduation where Felicity goes to the School of Nine Wishes to learn and she eats cake and drinks tea with her friends at Sparkles Cafe. She has also travelled all over Fairy World. In these books Felicity Wishes and her friends both have a single pair of wings, because they still go to school; fairies who have graduated get double wings. Felicity has a constant companion, a little blue bird called Bertie Dishes, the only male character in the whole book series. ==Characters== *Felicity is the main character of the books. She is a fairy who befriends many people wherever she goes. She is blonde and her favourite colour is pink. She always wears a lot of pink and her signature is her pink and white stripy tights. In Spooky Sleepover, the 13th book, it is seen that Felicity lacks the ability to cook and can get very clumsy. Felicity wants to be a Friendship Fairy when she graduates. *Holly is one of Felicity's friends. She loves fashion and hairstyles and, lacking a natural talent, has to learn many things. In Party Pickle, the 10th book, it is revealed that Holly's favourite colour is red. Her hair is long, straight and chestnut brown. Holly wants to be a Christmas Fairy when she is older. Holly is quite dramatic and can sometimes be a bit of a show-off. Also she loves to eat cakes with her friends! *Polly is Felicity's friend. She is very intelligent and is good at almost something, but she is never self-satisfied. Polly is the smartest of Felicity's friends; she pays more attention to teachers and gets all of her work answers correct. Polly loves teeth, so she wants to be a Tooth Fairy when she is older. Polly is very modest, helpful and kind and has frizzy hair. *Daisy is another one of Felicity's friends. Daisy has a floral interest, and does not like going out on sunny days much because she wants to water her flowers. Daisy loves garden centres so she can see flowers. Daisy daydreams quite a lot, even at school. In one of the magazines, it said that Daisy's favourite colour is green. When Daisy graduates with double wings, she would like to be a Blossom Fairy. Daisy is helpful and kind and seems to be quite shy. *Winnie was released in 2008. She wants to become an Adventure Fairy. Winnie is multiracial, and is very adventurous, brave and curious about the world. She has been all over the Fairy World. ==The magazine== The first issue of the magazine was released in 2007; it was the first of 56 issues, released fortnightly.Partwork launch: Felicity Wishes In each magazine Felicity considered a different career: in the first issue, that of a cake- maker. An exclusive Felicity doll with wool hair was included with the first issue and costumes for the doll were given in other issues. Issue 2 had a satin pink bag with the Felicity Wishes logo and the third issue had a box for storing magazines or books. Subsequent editions featured careers that included: 'Journalist', 'Flight Attendant', 'Architect', 'Doctor', 'Decorator', 'Inventor' and 'Chef' ==Foreign editions== Felicity Wishes has been translated into over 22 different languages including Portuguese and published by Dinalivro, a Portuguese Publishing House. In Portugal, Felicity has been named «Fada Carolina» («Fada» meaning «fairy» in Portuguese). Little Blossoming became «Cidade das Flores» and the school is called «Escola dos Nove Desejos». More than 20 titles are available in Portugal, most of them reaching their 2nd and 3rd editions. Some of Felicity's 22 foreign names are: Rose Felicity (French), Valeria Varita (Spanish), Dolca Picarol (Catalan), A fada Carolina (Portuguese), Isa Belletje (Dutch), Sofie Fehar (Danish), Felicity Bell (Italian), Tunderi Lonka (Hungarian) and Felicity Wunschfee (German). == Feminist critiques == In 2007, writing in the UK newspaper The Independent, Katy Guest raised concerns about the message conveyed to young girls by the line of products associated with the Felicity character: :A current advert for a new magazine from the fairy princess Felicity Wishes encourages little girls to dream about their future lives. \\"Every issue I try out a new job, from cake-maker to nurse, to popstar!\\" Felicity squeals. \\"Part 1 comes with a cute Felicity Wishes doll and with every issue there's a sparkly new outfit to dress her in!\\" Felicity does not come with an astronaut's costume or a train driver's hat, and seems to want little girls to grow up to be homemakers and pop tarts and use too many exclamation marks. : The blog The Alpha Parent iterated similar concerns in a 2012 post analyzing the magazine's series of \\"dream jobs\\": \\"The magazine is an example of how girls are socialised to be *prepared* to accept their place in the sexual division of labour. That is, to aspire to jobs which are less skilled, lower paid, and often part time.\\" Emma Thomson helped admonish the misrepresentation this feature expressed by posting a response that drew attention to the article's many omissions: those Felicity Wishes magazines that featured skilled, higher paid and full-time employment. ==References * Felicity Wishes Official Website. * Video: Emma Thomson talks about Felicity Wishes Category:Series of children's books Category:British children's books Category:Novels about fairies and sprites ","title":"Felicity Wishes"},{"id":"20342972","text":"Albert Freeman Africanus King (18 January 1841 – 13 December 1914) an English- born American physician who witnessed the assassination of Abraham Lincoln on 14 April 1865. He was a bystander physician who was pressed into service during the assassination. He was one of a few physicians who served in both the Confederate States Army and the United States Army during the American Civil War. In addition, King was one of the earliest to suggest the connection between mosquitos and malaria. ==Early life== On January 18, 1841, King was born in Ambrosden, a village near Bicester in the Cherwell District of north- eastern Oxfordshire in England. He was the youngest of three children of Edward King and Louisa Freeman. His sister was Stella Louisa Elizabeth King (born 1838) and brother was Claudius Edward Richard King (born 1839). His father was a doctor interested in the colonization of Africa. He was named Africanus \\"because of his father's admiration\\" for that continent.Kunhardt. Twenty Days, p. 45 He attended Maley's School and the Bicester Diocesan School. His family left Liverpool on 26 August 1854 to emigrate to the United States. They arrived in Jersey City, New Jersey, on 7 September 1854 (but some records indicate 1851) and first settled in Alexandria, Virginia. In 1855, they moved to Bushy Bridges, Prince William County. ==Education and early career== King earned his (MD) degree from National Medical College of Columbian University (now George Washington University Medical School) in 1861 at age twenty. In November he became an Acting Assistant Surgeon to Major J. W. L. Daniel of 15th AL Infantry, Confederate States Army, and the University of Pennsylvania. In 1864 he was appointed Acting Assistant Surgeon in the U.S. Army, and worked at the Lincoln Hospital, Washington, D.C. In 1865, he became lecturer on toxicology at the National Medical College of Columbian University, and also obtained his second MD degree from University of Pennsylvania. ===Lincoln assassination=== During the American Civil War, King was in Washington, DC. On 14 April 1865 he was in the audience at Ford's Theatre when President Abraham Lincoln was shot by John Wilkes Booth. He helped carry the dying President to a house across the street. Some suggest King was the first physician to reach Lincoln but the accounts of the other physicians present, Dr. Charles Augustus Leale and Dr. Charles Sabin Taft, suggest that King was second or third. ==Later life== In 1871 King became a professor of obstetrics both at University of Vermont College of Medicine and Providence Hospital in Washington, D.C. and at the University of Vermont.McCullough. The Path Between the Seas. Pg. 143 From 1879 to 1894 he was Dean of National Medical College, Medical Department, at National Medical College of Columbian University. ===Mosquito-malaria theory=== In 1882, King proposed a method to eradicate malaria from Washington, DC. His method was to encircle the city with a wire screen as high as the Washington Monument. Many people took this as a jest, partly because the link between malaria and mosquitoes had, at that time, been hypothesized by only a few physicians. It was not until 1898 that Ronald Ross proved mosquitoes were a vector for malaria (he won the Nobel Prize for the discovery just four years later).McCullough. The Path Between the Seas. Pp. 409-410, 422 However impractical, King was on the right track for malaria control, well in advance of the rest of the medical profession. ==Honours== King was elected President of Medical Society of Washington, D.C. in 1883, and again in 1903. In 1883 University of Vermont awarded him honorary master's degree. From 1885 to 1887 he was President of Washington Obstetrical and Gynecological Society. He received LLD degree from University of Vermont in 1894. He was Fellow of British Gynecological Society, American Gynecological Society, and American Association for the Advancement of Science. He was Consulting Physician at Children's Hospital in Washington, D.C.. He was elected member of Washington Academy of Sciences, and Associate Member of the Victoria Institute, or Philosophical Society of Great Britain. ==Personal life and death== King married Ellen Amory Dexter of Boston on 17 October 1894. Together they had two daughters, Louisa Freeman and Sarah Vincent. His wife died in 1935. King died in Washington, D.C. due to senile debility, and is interred at Rock Creek Cemetery. ==See also== * Abraham Lincoln assassination * Anderson Ruffin Abbott * Joseph K. Barnes * Charles H.

He wrote under the pseudonym Arvi Jännes. His best known poems are \\"Herää Suomi”, ”Karjala” and ”Väinölän lapset”. He was a member of the Senate of Finland from 1901–1905. ==Background== He was born in Impilahti, Finland. His parents were Carl Johan Garbriel Genetz and Laura Charlotta Ferrin. His brother was the Finnish composer Emil Genetz (1852-1930). Genetz was married in 1877 with Julia Eva Maria Arppe (1851-1931). He and his wife had six children: sons Juho, Arvi, Niilo and Paavo, and daughters Laura and Helvi. Poet and author Saima Harmaja (1913–1937) was his granddaughter. Arwi Jännes, portrait by Eva Ingman (1903) ==Career== Genetz graduated from the gymnasium in 1866, graduated from the Imperial Alexander University (now University of Helsinki) as a candidate doctor in 1871 and received his doctorate in 1877. He initially worked as a Finnish and Swedish teacher at the Lyceum in Hämeenlinna, and then serves as a lecturer at the University of Helsinki in the School of Finnish language and literature, in 1877. Genetz served under Professor August Ahlqvist (1826–1889) and was elected to the chair held by Professor Ahlqvist after the death of the Finnish language and literature professor in 1891. Genetz rival for this position was his colleague Eemil Nestor Setälä (1864–1935). A year later that the position was split in two—Finnish language and literature, and separately Finno-Ugric language research studies. The latter was the specialty of Genetz, and Setälä became the professor of Finnish language and literature. Genetz worked as a professor until 1901. He died during 1915 in Helsinki. Genetz has been considered a pioneer of modern morphology, as he described the Sami morphological variations in a modern way, using principles later employed in generative linguistics to understand both the deep and surface structure of the language, separating the description of the models. In historical linguistics, he was the first one who realized that the Sami exchanged a large number of loans words with the Baltic Finnish languages. In order to investigate Finno languages, Genetz made several expeditions to the White Sea region of Karelia the Kola Peninsula and Siberia. Arvid Genetz worked with native speakers to translate the Gospel of Matthew into Karelian Sámi. In 1897 the British and Foreign Bible Society published his Gospel in 1897. Chapters 1-22 were in Kildin Sámi language and chapters 23-28 were in Akkala Sámi language. ==Poetry== * Muistoja ja toiveita ystäville jouluksi (Weilin & Göös 1889) * Muutamia Arvi Jänneksen runoja (Kansanvalistus-seura 1892) * Toukokuun-lauluja (KS 1897) ==References* Arvid Genetz at 375 Humanists. 22.6.2015.

However, the White Star Line decreed that only 20 lifeboats would be carried, which could accommodate about 38% of those on board when the ship was filled to capacity. At the time, the Board of Trade's regulations stated that British vessels over 10,000 tons (Titanic was just over 46,000) must carry 16 lifeboats with a capacity of , plus enough capacity in rafts and floats for 75% (or 50% in case of a vessel with watertight bulkheads) of that in the lifeboats. Therefore, the White Star Line actually provided more lifeboat accommodation than was legally required.Butler, p. 38 The regulations made no extra provision for larger ships because they had not been changed since 1894, when the largest passenger ship under consideration was only 13,000 tons, and because of the expected difficulty in getting away more than 16 boats in any emergency. On the night of the sinking, Titanic lifeboat complement was made up of three types of boats. The most numerous were the 14 standard wooden lifeboats, each long by wide, with a capacity of 65 persons each. Forward of them, one on each side of the ship, two smaller emergency boats, long, had a capacity of 40 persons each. Four Engelhardt collapsible lifeboats measuring long by wide had a capacity of 47 persons each; they had canvas sides, and could be stowed almost flat, taking up a comparatively small amount of deck space. Two were stowed port and starboard on the roof of the officers' quarters, at the foot of the first funnel, while the other two were stowed port and starboard alongside the emergency lifeboat cutters. After the Titanic disaster, recommendations were made by both the British and American Boards of Inquiry stating, in part, that ships would carry enough lifeboats for those aboard, mandated lifeboat drills would be implemented, lifeboat inspections would be conducted, etc. Many of these recommendations were incorporated into the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea passed in 1914. ==24-hour radio watch and distress rockets== Following the inquiries, United States government passed the Radio Act of 1912. This Act, along with the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, stated that radio communications on passenger ships would be operated 24 hours along with a secondary power supply so as not to miss distress calls. Also, the Radio Act of 1912 required ships to maintain contact with vessels in their vicinity as well as coastal onshore radio stations. In addition, it was agreed in the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea that the firing of red rockets from a ship must be interpreted as a sign of the need for help. This decision was based on the fact that the rockets launched from the Titanic prior to sinking were interpreted with ambiguity by the freighter SS Californian. Officers on the deck of the Californian had seen rockets fired from an unknown liner yet surmised that they could possibly be \\"company\\" or identification signals, used to signal to other ships. At the time of the sinking, aside from distress situations, it was commonplace for ships without wireless radio to use a combination of rockets and Roman candles to identify themselves to other liners. Once the Radio Act of 1912 was passed it was agreed that rockets at sea would be interpreted as distress signals only, thus removing any possible misinterpretation from other ships. == International Ice Patrol == After the Titanic disaster, the U.S. Navy assigned the Scout Cruisers Chester and USS Birmingham (CL-2) to patrol the Grand Banks for the remainder of 1912. In 1913, the United States Navy could not spare ships for this purpose, so the Revenue Cutter Service (forerunner of the United States Coast Guard) assumed responsibility, assigning the Cutters Seneca and Miami to conduct the patrol. The Titanic disaster led to the convening of the first International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) in London, on 12 November 1913. On 30 January 1914, a treaty was signed by the conference that resulted in the formation and international funding of the International Ice Patrol, an agency of the United States Coast Guard that to the present day monitors and reports on the location of North Atlantic Ocean icebergs that could pose a threat to transatlantic sea traffic. In the mid-20th century, ice patrol aircraft became the primary ice reconnaissance method with surface patrols phased out except during unusually heavy ice years or extended periods of reduced visibility. Use of the oceanographic vessel continued until 1982, when the Coast Guard's sole remaining oceanographic ship, USCGC Evergreen, was converted to a medium endurance cutter. The aircraft has distinct advantages for ice reconnaissance, providing much greater coverage in a shorter period of time. == Ship design changes == Following the Titanic disaster, ships were refitted for increased safety. For example, the double bottoms of many existing ships, including the RMS Olympic, were extended up the sides of their hulls, their waterlines, to give them double hulls. Another refit that many ships underwent were changes to the height of the bulkheads. The bulkheads on Titanic extended 10 feet (3 m) above the water line. After the Titanic sank, the bulkheads on other ships were extended higher to make the compartments fully watertight. ==References== Category:RMS Titanic Category:Maritime safety ","title":"Changes in safety practices after the sinking of the Titanic"},{"id":"20343108","text":"Franco Tomás Quiroga (born 23 November 1986 in Cutral Có, Neuquén) is an Argentine football midfielder who plays for Nueva Chicago. ==Career== Quiroga started his playing career in 2005 with Club Atlético Temperley in the regionalised third division of Argentine football.

The building, along with the Redpath Library Building currently houses the Humanities and Social Sciences Library, the largest branch of the McGill University Library. ==History== Dilcoosha, 1913 The McLennan Library Building stands on the site of Jesse Joseph's former mansion, Dilcoosha. Joseph, a prominent Montreal businessman, philanthropist and member of the city's Jewish community, died in 1904. Once a Canadian Officers' Training Corps headquarters during World War I and after the home of the McCord Museum, the mansion was demolished in 1955.Jewish Encyclopedia The current seven-storey reinforced concrete structure was built between 1967 and 1969 and designed by the firm Dobush, Stewart and Bourke, who also designed McGill's Stewart Biological Sciences and Ernest Rutherford Physics Buildings, and worked on design for the city's Cadillac Metro station. The exterior consist of identical precast concrete panels that are attached to a reinforced concrete frame. It is attached to the more modern Redpath library extension by a bridge walkway. The main entrance to McLennan library is now at the south end of the concrete terraced due to the Redpath library entrance being closed after the terrace renovations ended in January 2014, due to a lack of funding by McGill's administration. All traffic between floors is controlled by the central stairwell and elevator core. The sixth floor houses the McGill University Archives and the fourth floor is dedicated to McGill Rare Books and Special Collections. The library building was named in honour of Isabella McLennan, who had made a large donation to McGill in order to purchase books. == Food Services == A Loaf of Bread from Première Moisson. Première Moisson, a chain of artisanal bakeries located in Quebec, Canada, was located in the basement of McLennan Library until the end of the 2018/19 school year. For the 2019/20 school year, Bento Sushi moved in, offering poke bowls and sushi, while the cafe that operated alongside Premiere Moisson continues to offer coffee, baked goods, and other snacks and packaged meals similar to those offered in the McGill dining halls. == Rare Book Collection == This 20-seat work space is located inside the Rare Book Collection. The Rare Book Collection is located on the fourth floor of Mclennan Library. McGill began collecting rare materials since the 1850s, now constituting rich and highly diverse research collections. These collections are used to aid teaching, learning and research for McGill students and the general public from all fields of study. The books held in the collection cover disciplines of Canadian literature, history of ideas, arts and architecture, history, and travel. Critical scientific holdings can be found in both the general and special collections. The Rare Book Collections of the Blackader-Lauterman, the Blacker-Wood, Islamic Studies and Macdonald Campus libraries are housed with the general rare book collection. Collection development is focused on all aspects of Canadiana including literature, history, maps, travel and popular culture; on philosophy and in particular David Hume and the late 17th and 18th centuries; on English and French literature of the 18th c. with an emphasis on the circle of Fanny Burney; and on book history including printing history, type specimen books and significant examples of printing. Some general rules of the room include: Each item may be put on hold to make the item readily accessible throughout one's research period but is never allowed to leave the premise, the use of acid-free paper strips to mark the pages is required to not make marks, the use of personal camera use is allowed only upon permission, and all visitors must register annually to agree to all the rules and regulations of the room. == Wellness-Focused Spaces == McLennan Tranquility-Zone The Arts Undergraduate Improvement Fund supported the creation of the McLennan Library's new relaxing work space. The new space is located on the 6th floor of the McLennan Library building and was designed with the user preferences in mind. The tranquility zone is aimed to foster a conductive learning yet relaxing environment. The space was designed to differ from other conventional study spaces throughout the library; it encompasses reclining lounge chairs, square side tables, and multiple exercise balls to create a calm environment. The centre of the tranquility zone showcases a Zen Garden which contains stress relieving activities for students to engage with in between periods of work. The work space, like all most spaces in the McLennan building, is a quiet zone to ensure productive and no disruptive environment. Spin Bike Garden The Spin Bike Garden (SBG) is a project with aim of bringing mental health and wellbeing to McGill. The project has equipped the McLennan Library / Redpath Library 1st floor (group study area) with two silent spin bikes surrounded by plants and meditative art. The Spin Bike Garden provides a space for students to engage in mental and physical breaks while studying; this is proven to help reduce overall stress while boosting energy levels and mental wellness. The spin Garden is a space for everybody, no biking experience is required. ==See also== *McGill University Archives ==References *McGill Humanities and Social Sciences Library Web site Category:McGill University buildings Category:Libraries in Montreal Category:Brutalist architecture in Canada Category:Library buildings completed in 1969 Category:Academic libraries in Canada Category:University and college buildings completed in 1969 ","title":"McLennan Library Building"},{"id":"20343161","text":"Valde Hirvikanta Valde Hirvikanta (originally von Hellens) (March 17, 1863 in Turku - October 2, 1911 in Turku) was a conservative Finnish politician of the Finnish Party.

The Chinese character \\"Yick\\" was created by Wong's parents and therefore not all computers can type in or display this character. Dame Rosanna Wong Yick-ming (, born 15 August 1952) also known by her married name, Rosanna Tam Wong Yick- ming, in her former marriage from 1979 lasting until 1992, and primarily known as Dr Rosanna Wong in public occasions after 1997, is a Hong Kong social work administrator and politician who has served as the Executive Director of the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups since 1980. Before the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong, she was appointed as unofficial member of the Legislative Council from 1985 to 1991 and of the Executive Council from 1988 to 1991. She briefly retired from politics in 1991 but was successful to return as unofficial Executive Councillor for a second time in 1992, and was also appointed chairperson of the Hong Kong Housing Authority in the following year. Wong was trusted by the last British colonial Governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten (later Lord), who chose her to replace Baroness Dunn as the Convenor of the Executive Council (equivalent to the Senior Unofficial Member of the Executive Council) in 1995, thus rising as an influential figure in the final years of the colonial government. In 1997, she was made Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire and became the second Chinese woman, after Baroness Dunn, to be made a Dame in history. After the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong in 1997, Wong was one of the two colonial unofficial members who remained in the new Executive Council under the Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Nevertheless, when the Housing Authority Short- piling Scandal broke out in 1999, Wong, as the chairperson of the Housing Authority, was heavily blamed by the general public of not taking any responsibility. Under public pressure, she subsequently decided to resign from the Housing Authority four days before the Legislative Council passing the motion of no confidence on her and the Director of Housing, Tony Miller in June 2000. However, her resignation did not prevent her and some other government officials from receiving censure in the short-piling scandal investigation report released by the Legislative Council later in January 2003. Following the scandal, Wong ceased to be an unofficial member of the Executive Council in 2002 but was appointed chairperson of the Education Commission from 2001 to 2007. Since 2003, she has also been a Hong Kong member of the CPPCC National Committee of the People's Republic of China. Besides, Wong plays a role in the business sector in Hong Kong. She has been a non- executive director of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation since 1996 and has also been an independent non-executive director of Sir Ka-shing Li's Cheung Kong Holdings since 2001. ==BiographyEarly years=== Wong was born on 15 August 1952 in Hong Kong to a family descended from Anxi County of Fujian Province in China. Her father Wong Chun Chung was an overseas Chinese from Singapore. Her mother Poon Chor Ying had been a journalist in Vietnam and in Hong Kong was a teacher at St. Stephen's Girls' College. Both had graduated from mainland China universities and were considered well-educated. Wong is the fourth child in the family. She has three elder sisters and two younger sister and brother. She spent her early years with her family in Shatin and later moved to Kowloon. After entering secondary school, Wong's family resided on Lyttelton Road in Mid-levels on Hong Kong Island.何良懋. 《香港的童年》. 香港：新雅文化事業有限公司. 1997.Edited by Kevin Sinclair, Who's who in Hong Kong, Hong Kong: Who's Who in Hong Kong Ltd.: Asianet Information Services Ltd., 1988. Wong entered St. Stephen's Girls' Primary School in 1962 and followed her sisters to enter St. Stephen's Girls' College, where their mother taught, in 1965. Wong had some classes with her mother, who also taught Regina Ip and Rita Fan, later Secretary for Security of the Hong Kong government and the President of the Legislative Council respectively. Wong once recalled that her mother's knowledge and attitude to life had deeply inspired her thinking that since secondary three, she had become a volunteer and once joined a gospel rehabilitation group for drug addicts to pay visit to the Kowloon Walled City.〈范太當年被禁參加運動會〉. 《蘋果日報》A06. 19 March 2002. In 1972, Wong graduated from the school and was soon successfully enrolled at the University of Hong Kong studying social work. At first, she was not given a room in any of the residential colleges because she lived too near to the campus. Only when she became a social secretary of St John's College Students' Association in year three of study, she had the chance to move into St John's College. In the university, Wong was something of a student activist and in 1973 joined a university visit the mainland China. All these experiences influenced her deeply and she decided to commit herself to the field of social work upon graduation. ===Social work career=== The headquarters of the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups in Pak Fuk Road, North Point. Wong received her degree of social work from the University of Hong Kong in 1975 and was immediately employed by the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups as a social worker. She was sent to Kowloon West at first and became a supervisor responsible for affairs of teenagers and counselling services in districts including Yau Ma Tei, Sham Shui Po and Tsuen Wan. Wong later received HSBC scholarship from 1974 to 1975, Rotary Foundation Educational Award from 1977 to 1978 and PEO International Peace Scholarship from 1978 to 1979. These scholarships allowed her to further study in the University of Toronto in Canada from 1977 to 1979. After obtaining a master's degree of social work from Toronto, Wong returned to the Federation of Youth Group and was immediately promoted as Executive Secretary (Operations). Later in 1980, she was further promoted as general secretary (later renamed Executive Director) at the age of 28 and thus becoming the leader of the Federation. In this capacity, she has successfully expanded the Federation to be a major teenage service organisation in Hong Kong with a total number of 800 employees. Apart from the Federation, Wong had also involved deeply in a large number of social organisations including a number of local Christian churches. Since 1981, she had also been appointed as a member of the Executive Committee of the Hong Kong Council of Social Service and stepped down in 2005 after more than twenty years of service. From 1984 to 1988, she was appointed to the Subventions and Lotteries Fund Advisory Committee as a member by the government as well. In 1982, she was awarded Commonwealth Scholarship, studying social policy and planning in the London School of Economics of the United Kingdom, and obtained her master degree in science in 1983. Two years later she received a diploma of executive management in a course organised jointly by the Chinese University of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Council of Social Service. In the same year, she was awarded Hong Kong's Ten Outstanding Young Persons' Award.《香港特區名人錄》. 香港：星島日報出版社. 2004. ===Legislative and Executive Councillor=== Wong's brilliance as a social administrator was soon noticed by Governor Sir Edward Youde. In 1985, Sir Edward intended to reform the Legislative Council through appointing professionals from different career sectors to the Council. Under the recommendation of Legislative Councillor, Hui Yin Fat, Wong was appointed as unofficial member of the Legislative Council at a relatively young age of 33 and thus entering politics. Other unofficial legislators newly appointed in that year included barrister-at-law Maria Tam, physician Dr Henrietta Ip Man-Hing and so on.〈火鳳凰. 王䓪鳴〉. 《壹週刊》時事短打. 3 May 2001. Since joining the Legislative Council, she had hold a large number of public duties which included court member of the University of Hong Kong, Technical College (later Polytechnic University), Baptist College (later Baptist University) and City Polytechnic (later City University), member of the Hong Kong committee for UNICEF, vice-patron of Mother's Choice, member of the government's Standing Committee on Young Offenders and so on. Besides, from 1987 to 1988 she was appointed honorary advisor to the Social Welfare Department, member of government's Law Reform Commission and Broadcasting Authority from 1987 to 1990, appointed chairwoman of the Social Welfare Advisory Committee from 1988 to 1991 and appointed the first chairwoman of the government's newly created Commission on Youth from 1990 to 1991.Executive Councillors, Hong Kong Government Website, 1998.岑維休主編. 《香港年鑑》. 香港：華僑日報. 1990. Wong's work in the Legislative Council was deeply impressed by then Senior Unofficial Member of the Legislative Council Lydia Dunn (later Dame and Baroness) that under her promotion, she was further appointed as unofficial member of the government decision-making body, the Executive Council by Governor Sir David Wilson (later Lord) in 1988. On 16 January 1989 Wong was made an unofficial Justice of the Peace〈太平紳士〉. 《Civil And Miscellaneous Lists》. 2008-11-16-造訪。 and later on the Queen's Birthday in 1990 she was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for her contribution to the general public.London Gazette: no. 52173, page 17, 15 June 1990. However, in 1991 Wong suddenly retired from the two Councils and resigned all her public posts. She chose to further her study with her husband Dr Alfred Tam Yat-chung in the United States, trying to save their marriage from divorce. Yet their attempt was fail and they divorced eventually in 1992.〈刀槍不入. 王䓪鳴〉. 《壹週刊》時事. 4 October 2001. Although the divorce was a terrible blow to her, she was able to continue her study while took care of her two children alone. Finally in 1993, she obtained her master's degree of arts from the University of California, Davis. A year before graduation, she was also awarded the prize of Global Leader of Tomorrow. ===Returning to politics=== In 1991, the Legislative Council introduced direct election for the first time in the history of Hong Kong and the election resulted in the landslide victory of the many new-born local pro-democratic political parties. To balance the power in the Council, to show friendliness to the mainland Chinese regime and to ensure that sovereignty of Hong Kong can be transferred smoothly and peacefully in 1997, many appointed or indirectly elected legislators, such as Allen Lee, Selina Chow and Rita Fan came together and formed a more conservative political group, the Co-operative Resources Centre (later renamed Liberal Party) with the support of then Governor Sir David Wilson immediately after the election. Nevertheless, Sir David was soon forced to retire in 1992 and the British policy towards China changed fundamentally. Sir David's successor, Chris Patten no longer continued his policy of gradual reform but endorsed democratic reform in full-swing. Patten believed the Co- operative Resources Centre would become a hindrance to his reform and therefore he refused to support the Centre as Sir David had done. Furthermore, he immediately reshuffled the pro-Sir David's Executive Council after becoming governor. Except the Senior Member Baroness Dunn, all other members served in Sir David's Executive Council were replaced. Under this background of wind of change, Wong was appointed back to the Executive Council as unofficial member by Patten in 1992, a year before graduating from the University of California. After returning to Hong Kong politics, she was deeply trusted by the Governor. In 1993, she was appointed chairperson of the Hong Kong Housing Authority, overseeing the policy on the construction of public housing estates. In the same year, she was also appointed chairwoman of the Independent Police Complaints Council. In 1994, she became a member of the Court of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire.London Gazette: no. 53696, page 16, 10 June 1994. On the contrary, Baroness Dunn, the Senior Member of the Executive Council, was distanced by Governor Patten because she once supported the founding of the Co-operative Resources Centre, and thus her importance in the government faded gradually. Eventually in 1995, Dunn retired from the Council and chose to migrate to England. Wong then was selected to replace Dunn as the last Convenor (equivalent to the post of the Senior Unofficial Member) of the colonial Executive Council by Governor Patten. As the Convenor of the Executive Council, Wong became an influential figure in the final years of the colonial government. Apart from being appointed non-executive director of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in November 1996, she was chosen as the chairwoman of the ICAC Complaints Committee in the transitional period between 1997 and 1998.NICK TABAKOFF, \\"HSBC TOPS UP NAMES ON BOARD\\", South China Morning Post, 27 November 1996. In the 1997 New Year Honours, she caught up the last chance before the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong that she was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire and therefore became a Dame.London Gazette: no. 54625, page 24, 30 December 1996. Wong was the second Hong Kong woman, after Baroness Dunn, to be made a substantive Dame in history, and was the last person to receive a damehood in the colonial Hong Kong. She received the damehood from Governor Chris Patten in the Government House on 19 April 1997.〈彭定康愛將回歸前封爵〉. 《太陽報》A01. 6 May 2001. In the same year, Wong also received her doctorate of sociology from the University of California, Davis. She personally chose to call herself Dr. Rosanna Wong rather than Dame Rosanna Wong after 1997 in public occasions.〈王䓪鳴博士〉. 《香港教育學院第十屆畢業典禮》. 19 November 2004. Since Wong had close and intimate ties with the colonial government, there had been rumours before the transfer of sovereignty that she would not be allowed to serve in the new Hong Kong Special Administrative Region's Executive Council, or even the Housing Authority. Yet, the fact was that Wong once served in the colonial Executive Council with the future Chief Executive, Tung Chee Hwa and Tung was impressed by her low-pitched image. Finally in 1997, although Tung chose veteran politician Sir Sze Yuen Chung as Convenor, Wong, along with Raymond Ch'ien Kuo Fung, was invited to stay as unofficial member in the new Executive Council. Wong continued to remain as chairperson of the Housing Authority as well. In the early years of the Special Administrative Region, Wong was again appointed to different public posts. She has been appointed president of the Hong Kong Schools Music and Speech Association since 1997, appointed president of the English Speaking Union, Hong Kong from 1999 and has become a director of the board of the Dragon Foundation and the chairperson of the World Vision Hong Kong (香港宣明會) since 2000. ===Short-piling scandal=== Under the \\"85,000 Housing Policy\\" suggested by Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa, the Housing Authority was demanded to build large-scale public housing estates and Home Ownership Scheme estates all over Hong Kong by the government in the early years after the transfer of sovereignty. At one time the Authority was even asked to build not less than 85,000 flats a year, so that more people could enjoy public housing. Nevertheless, because of lacking of efficient monitoring and poor planning, the policy soon became a leak for jerry-building, and a series of short-piling scandals were exposed.〈立會短樁報告. 暗批「八萬五」肇禍〉. 《香港經濟日報》A22. 21 January 2003. One of the \\"short-piling blocks\\" in Tin Shui Wai. In September 1999, some blocks in Tin Chung Court, a Home Ownership Scheme estate built by the Housing Authority in Tin Shui Wai, were discovered with serious and unusual settlement. Later in January 2000, a Home Ownership Scheme construction site in Yuen Chau Kok, Sha Tin was reported to have the same problem found in Tin Chung Court, and it became known that the pilings of these affected blocks were much shorter than required. The short-piling scandals were followed by a series of discoveries of jerry-building. In March and May of the same year, constructions in the shopping centre of Shek Yam Estate and in the site of Phase 3 of Tung Chung Area 30 were reported extensive non-compliance respectively. The general public was deeply shocked by the series of scandals and the Independent Commission Against Corruption soon carried out investigations into the housing scandals.〈公屋短樁醜聞經過〉. 《大公報》A07. 23 January 2003. Facing the housing scandals, as the chairperson of the Housing Authority, Wong vowed to grasp the opportunity to reform the bureaucratic and corrupted Housing Department. However, she quickly became the target to be blamed by the public opinions. Many civil groups representing residents of the public housing estates reproached Wong for being incompetent to supervise the housing constructions and they demanded her and the Director of Housing, Tony Miller to step down. In June 2000, Secretary for Housing, Dominic S. W. Wong appointed Director of Intellectual Property, Stephen R. Selby as the chairman of the Investigation Panel on Staff Discipline in the Yuen Chau Kok and Tin Chung Court Incidents to see if anyone was derelict in the whole scandal. Apart from the pressure from the government, Democratic Party's legislator Fred Li moved a motion of no confidence on both Rosanna Wong and Tony Miller in the Legislative Council on 9 June. Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa later paid a special visit to the Legislative Council on 23 June and addressed to the Council Meeting. He hoped the legislators to vote against the motion of no confidence, claiming that if \\"both of them leave one after another, an administrative and legal vacuum would be created at the top level of the Government\\".OFFICIAL RECORD OF PROCEEDINGS, Legislative Council of Hong Kong, 23 June 2000. She declared her resignation from the Housing Authority on 24 June 2000, and became the first government official to hold accountability and resign from the government of the Special Administrative Region before the introduction of Principal Officials Accountability System. Four days later, the Legislative Council passed the motion of no confidence on her and Miller with a significant majority, however, Miller had never resigned. The post of chairperson of the Housing Authority was later filled by Dr Cheng Hon-kwan on 1 October.〈房委會歡迎新任主席〉. 《新聞公報》. 香港特別行政區政府新聞處. 29 September 2000. The scandal did not rest with the resignation of Wong. In February 2001, the Legislative Council set up a Select committee to enquire into the whole matter in-depth. On 8 May 2001, Wong was summoned to give evidences in front of the committee. In the enquiry, she admitted the risk of jerry-building had been underestimated. Yet, she claimed that the concept of \\"85,000 Housing Policy\\" which had already existed during the governorship of Chris Patten and the Housing Authority was merely ordered to carry out the long-term housing policy which was planned by the government, not the Authority. Besides, she provided a number of letters to Governor Patten written by her between 1994 and 1996 to the enquiry. One of them, dated December 1996, stated that the Housing Authority could build only 82,000 flats a year and could not fulfill the government's intention to build 106,000 flats.〈王䓪鳴：不知「八萬五」怎訂出. 承認低估地盤監督風險〉. 《蘋果日報》A16. 9 May 2001.〈王䓪鳴認低估. 監管工程難度. 建屋高峰準備足夠否. 也值得商榷〉. 《香港經濟日報》A28. 9 May 2001. However, when Secretary for Housing, Dominic Wong gave evidences to the enquiry on 12 May, he rebutted what Wong had said. Dominic Wong explained that since 1988, it had been the Housing Authority who decided the target number of public housing flats to be built annually. The government itself had not been involved and therefore, figures forecasting the number of new public housing flats in each year's colonial Policy Address had been provided by the Housing Authority instead. He further explained that the government had only started to make their own forecast since 1997, so it was not the case suggested by Rosanna Wong that the Housing Authority had to fulfill the target number of public housing flats demanded by the government.〈黃星華反駁王䓪鳴. 指建屋量由房委會制訂〉. 《新報》A03. 13 May 2001. After two years of investigation, the Legislative Council's Select Committee released its report on the short-piling scandal in January 2003. Rosanna Wong, Dominic Wong and Tony Miller received differing degrees of censure in the report. However, the report did not recommend any punishment as it was up to the government to make the decision of whether to impose any punishment or not.〈立會公屋短樁調查報告完成. 王䓪鳴苗學禮黃星華遭譴責〉. 《蘋果日報》A08. 21 January 2003. ===After-Housing Authority=== After resigning from the Housing Authority, Wong started to fade out from Hong Kong politics and retired from the Executive Council in 2002. Besides, she succeeded Antony Leung as Chairperson of the Education Commission from 2001 to 2007. In January 2001, Wong was employed as a non-executive director to the Cheung Kong Holdings by Li Ka-shingand her employment aroused public concern. Some public opinions feared she had only stepped down from the Housing Authority for only seven months and it was inappropriate for her to be employed to a real property corporation. A few legislators also worried that Wong would no longer represent the interest of social workers by having a closer relationship with the business sector. Yet, she responded that she would only received 5,000 HKD annually as director's emoluments from the directorship and she promised to bring the voice of the social work sector into the corporation.〈王䓪鳴任長實非執行董事. 議員憂行會權力轉移工商界〉. 《星島日報》A09. 26 January 2001. Since 2003, Wong has been appointed as a Hong Kong member of the CPPCC National Committee of the People's Republic of China. There was little controversy within the pro-Beijing camp of Hong Kong over the appointment since it was the first time for Wong to be admitted to a mainland Chinese official organisation. Some criticised she had had pro- British background while some said she had a close friendship with former Chief Secretary, Anson Chan. Yet, all these criticism died out soon.〈行會前成員獲委政協. 王䓪鳴入選惹左派爭議〉. 《蘋果日報》A04. 22 January 2003. ==Personal life== Wong married Dr. Alfred Tam Yat-chung , a paediatrician, on 15 September 1979. They had two children, Joyce (born 1981) and Jonathan (born 1985). In 1991, the couple went to study in the United States, during a difficult time in their marriage. They were divorced in 1992, after Alfred began another relationship.

He played his county cricket for Middlesex, Worcestershire and Glamorgan, and also appeared for Combined Services. He was capped by Glamorgan in 1956. ==Life and careerMiddlesex=== Devereux was educated at Torquay Boys' Grammar School. He made his first-class debut at the age of 17, appearing for Middlesex against Cambridge University at Fenner's in May 1949, though he neither batted nor bowled. The following month, he played against Oxford University at The University Parks, scoring 32 and 11. These proved to be his only appearances for Middlesex, and in 1950 and 1951 he played occasionally for Combined Services and Worcestershire, on one occasion in June 1951 turning out for the former against the latter. Playing for Combined Services against Glamorgan in late May 1951 he hit his maiden first-class half-century in scoring a first- innings 52. ===Worcestershire=== From 1952 onwards Devereux played County Championship cricket for Worcestershire, and the 1953 season saw him send down over 4,000 deliveries, by far the most he bowled in any one season, and take 55 first-class wickets. This was the only time he topped 50, albeit at an average of over 40 and without his ever claiming more than three dismissals in a single innings. 1953 was also a productive summer with the bat for Devereux: he finished it with 732 runs at a little under 21, including four half- centuries. The highest of these, 81 not out against Warwickshire at the beginning of July, remained his highest score for Worcestershire. ===Glamorgan=== He played only the first half of the 1955 season, and in 1956 joined Glamorgan, being awarded his cap in his first year. Although he only took 22 wickets in total, those included the two best innings returns of his career. The first and better of the two came against Yorkshire at Middlesbrough in late July, when he took 6/29 in 17.2 first-innings overs. Less than a fortnight later, he claimed 5/11 in 11.3 overs, working in tandem with Don Shepherd (5/25 in 18 overs) as Gloucestershire, who had been 61/0, lost all ten wickets for 20 runs. That summer Devereux also made 93 against Northamptonshire. He had made 833 first-class runs in 1956, but he surpassed that in 1957 when he managed 1,039, the only occasion on which he reached a thousand. At the end of May he made what was to remain his only first-class century (although by the end of his career he had reached 50 on no fewer than 23 other occasions), making 108* against Lancashire. He also hit four more half-centuries during the 1957 season. Although Devereux's position seemed strong, he was never again to enjoy such a successful season. He did manage just over 700 runs in 1958, but then his form began to desert him, and while he kept his first-team spot until the middle of 1959, by the end of that summer he was struggling for his place. He played some minor cricket in Argentina in 1959–60, but when the English summer came around again Devereux found himself out of favour with his county. He played only five first-class matches in 1960, and after the game against Gloucestershire in early July he was out of the first team for good. He was released by Glamorgan, only discovering his fate when he saw it printed in the local newspaper. Devereux was a fine player of table tennis, and played for England in 1949. After his cricket career he ran the Central Hotel in Aberystwyth from 1965 until 1995. ==ReferencesCategory:1931 births Category:2016 deaths Category:English cricketers Category:Glamorgan cricketers Category:Middlesex cricketers Category:Worcestershire cricketers Category:Combined Services cricketers ","title":"Louis Devereux"},{"id":"20343335","text":"Abdul Wahid Mohamed al Nur (also Abdel Wahid el-Nur or Abdulwahid Mohammed Nour; , ʿAbd al-Wāḥid Muḥammad Nūr; born in 1968) is the leader of the rebel Sudan Liberation Movement (al Nur) faction.BBC Staff (24 February 2009) \\"Who are Sudan's Darfur rebels?\\" BBC News Born in Zalingei, West Darfur, he was educated at the University of Khartoum, where he graduated in 1995 with a law degree before working as a lawyer.Sudan rebel leader on limelight while President in panic, Sudan Tribune, 18 July 2008 In June 1992, al Nur and others at the University of Khartoum created the Sudan Liberation Movement. ==Notes *Abdel Wahid Al-Nur, \\"Why We Won't Talk to Sudan's Islamo-Fascists\\", The Wall Street Journal, June 18, 2008 *\\"SLM statement on the secular state\\", by al Nur * Video: Al Nur Supports Relations with Israel: \\"An Israeli Embassy in Khartoum Will Serve the Interests of the Sudanese People\\".

Rev. Theodore DuBose Bratton, eventual bishop of Mississippi (1903), assisted his students with the creation. The purpose was to \\"foster the highest ideals of Christian womanhood\\" (Saint Mary's Archives). The first initiation was held in 1901. Two other Greek lettered literary societies were also founded on campus in 1900: Epsilon Alpha Pi, and Sigma Lambda. == Going National == In 1904, AKP was incorporated as a national sorority. Soon, other chapters were chartered. Beta chapter was chartered at Virginia Female Institute (Stuart Hall) in Staunton, Virginia. The next eight years were the \\"heyday\\" of the sorority. Chapters were chartered at schools in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Washington DC, and Pennsylvania. The Alpha chapter disbanded in 1911, when rector Dr. George W. Lay abolished all sororities at Saint Mary's. The Beta chapter existed for only five years, 1904- 1909. ==Moderate Success== Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities (1912) categorized AKP with other \\"women's general fraternities\\", such as Alpha Chi Omega and Alpha Omicron Pi. Seven active chapters are listed, with total active sisters at 304. Three conventions took place previous to this entry. The 1915 publication of Baird's categorized the sorority in the \\"second division\\" of women's fraternities. This meant that Baird did not see AKP to be of the same status as Alpha Chi Omega and Alpha Omicron Pi. AKP now had five active chapters and five inactives, with a total membership of 377. Two chapters reaffiliated with Delta Delta Delta (Baird's 1915, p. 464). ==Demise== Somewhere between 1914 and 1916, Alpha Kappa Psi became a Junior College Sorority, granting releases to chapters at Four Year Colleges that desired including Wesleyan Female College, Florida State College for Women, and Stetson University. In 1920, the sorority was recategorized as one of the \\"Miscellaneous Fraternities\\" in Baird's Manual. Four active chapters were listed: *Fairmont Seminary (Monteagle, Tennessee)Later a college according to Baird's 20th ed, this Fairmont Seminary should not be confused with another dormant institution of the same name in Washington DC. *Carnegie Institute of Technology *Gunston Hall (Washington, DC) *Synodical College (Fulton, MO) The sorority had an approximate total of 487 members (Baird's 1920, p. 675) Although the date of national dissolution is unknown, Alpha Kappa Psi probably declined sometime after 1920.

Davies's College was originally set up to prepare students for entrance to Oxford and Cambridge, the Armed Services and the Civil Service. A second branch of Davies's College was founded in Hove in 1959. Davies's Tutorial College in Hove as it was then called was based in premises at 44 Cromwell Road in Hove. The college was a tutorial college providing A-levels and A-Level re-sits mainly for British students. In 1980 Mr Robin Bellerby became principal of Davies College in Hove and the college expanded to occupy neighbouring premises on Cromwell Road. At this time the college expanded its recruitment overseas and the college made links with the Jordanian government, leading to over 30 students from Jordan coming each year to study A Levels on government scholarships. Other students at the college came from Malaysia and Hong Kong. Later the college was renamed Bellerbys College after the principal became the new owner. In 1991 the college was bought by a group of British businessmen who invested money in recruitment overseas and developed the foundation programme, a one-year bridging course enabling international students to enter UK universities at first-year undergraduate level. The original Davies's College in London, which was located at 25 Old Gloucester Street, Queen Square, Bloomsbury, London, continued to operate independently of the college in Brighton until its closure in 1998. ===Ownership=== In 1994 the business together with the Embassy schools became British Study Group, later Study Group International, later to become owned by the Daily Mail GroupDaily Mail Group Press release Preliminary unaudited consolidated results from Thursday 10 December 1998; mentions Study Group becoming a subsidiary. before being sold on to the Australian Champ group. ===Growth=== In 1996 Bellerbys opened a campus in the north of Cambridge and the following year took over a school in Wadhurst, East Sussex, expanding to cater to growing demand for British education overseas. Then in 1998 a London centre opened on the campus of the Roehampton Institute, University of Surrey (later Roehampton University). The college was based in Downshire House, a grade II Listed building in Roehampton, for four years until moving to custom-built premises in Greenwich which it today shares with Study Group sister company Embassy CES. Bellerbys Cambridge added its Queens Campus in 1999 and an Oxford campus opened on Broad Street in 2002. ===Rape=== In January 2011, an 18-year-old Malaysian Bellerbys student was gang raped at the school's Bounty House halls of residence following a disco at its nearby Greenwich campus. The four perpetrators, three of whom were the sons of Russian oligarchs, were all fellow students at the college; they were sentenced to a total of thirty-five years in prison. ==Ofsted boarding inspectionsBrighton=== An Ofsted inspection on 1 June 2009 resulted in a report which found “the organisation is inadequate” and “the overall quality rating is inadequate”; this was as a result of \\"inadequate provision\\" in the key areas of \\"helping children to be healthy\\" and \\"protecting children from harm or neglect and helping them stay safe\\". Ofsted's latest inspection, conducted in March 2013, found the boarding provision to be ‘good’. An Ofsted inspection on 22 March 2013 resulted in a report which found that the school met the national minimum standards for boarding schools ===Cambridge=== In the latest Ofsted Welfare report November 2014 stated “The school now meets all the national minimum standards for boarding schools.” This represented an improvement over the previous Ofsted report in May 2014 in which the school was criticised for inconsistency in the application of recruitment practices; not fully implementing healthcare policies; a lack of communal space and lacking in both number and training of residential staff. Ofsted's boarding report, published in June 2014 following an inspection the previous month at Bellerbys' Cambridge site, concluded that: “The school does not meet the national minimum standards for boarding”. The inspectors found that overall effectiveness was “inadequate” including in the areas of \\"quality of boarding provision and care\\", \\"boarders’ safety\\", and \\"leadership and management of boarding\\", writing: > “Since the last inspection, the leadership and management of the college has > failed to monitor the safety and welfare of students. The staffing > arrangements for boarders lack pastoral care; residential staff are lacking > in number and training in welfare matters”. However, they also noted that “The recent change in leadership is driving forward improvements and learning from inspection of fellow colleges. There is a commitment to build on strengths and tackle areas of weakness to improve the boarding experience for students”. A follow-up re-inspection in November 2014, found that: > “The school has made good progress and now meets all the national minimum > standards for boarding schools”. ===London=== Ofsted latest welfare inspection of Bounty House in May 2014 concluded: “The school now meets all the national minimum standards for boarding schools.” The report concluded: “Boarding staff have received training that promotes consistency of good safeguarding practice and enables them to support individual boarders effectively. All boarding staff have had training in child protection, first aid, self-harm and eating disorders, crisis management and drugs awareness. Their individual practice has been reviewed through an annual appraisal system and also, through frequent one to one supervision meetings. The college has created and recruited to a new post of a residential supervisor manager. This ensures that extra resources are available for the management, supervision and support of boarding staff. The boarding team has also been strengthened by the creation and appointment to an additional post for a permanent boarding staff member who works only at weekends. This means that the college relies less on agency staff and ensures more consistency and continuity for boarders.” The May 2014 report concluded: > \\"Boarding staff are very positive about the changes that have taken place. > They receive clear direction and guidance from the leaders and managers > whose expertise and motivation they trust. Boarding staff report that the > new leaders have brought a student-centred culture to the college. The > welfare of each individual student is paramount for everybody at the > college.\\" Following the death of a boarder at Bellerbys’ Bounty House residential facility in London in January 2014, Ofsted carried out an emergency inspection at the request of the Department for Education (DfE). The inspectors’ report, published in March 2014, concluded that with one exception “all other national minimum standards looked at were not met”. Failings identified in the emergency inspection report included: > “The arrangements for child protection are ineffective [...] the risk > assessment process is not robust [...] boarding staff are not appropriately > supervised and managed [and] they are not appropriately trained [and that] > the arrangements for recording and monitoring of required boarding records > are poor […] For example, the incident log is not appropriately maintained; > it does not include a record of the two recent serious incidents”. Ofsted re-inspected Bounty House in May 2014; the subsequent progress monitoring inspection boarding report found that: “The school has made good progress and now meets all the national minimum standards for boarding schools”. ===Oxford=== In November 2014 the Ofsted Welfare Inspection concluded the school meets the national minimum standards for boarding schools. The report highlighted the commitment of staff to improving safeguarding arrangements following a report in March 2014 that found boarding provision to be inadequate. Ofsted inspected Bellerbys College, Oxford in March 2014 and found its boarding provision to be inadequate, concluding that \\"The school does not meet the national minimum standards for boarding\\". A progress monitoring inspection boarding report published in December 2014, following a re-inspection the previous month, found that “senior leaders have shown commitment to improve the safeguarding arrangements. The college has made good progress in implementing its action plan to ensure that all the national minimum standards are now met”. The Oxford college closed in 2017, with students and staff moving to other Bellerbys colleges. ==Marketing claims== In 2004, Bellerbys Colleges told undercover reporters from the Sunday Times that it could guarantee good university places to students completing its courses. In March 2015, Private Eye reported that marketing in Singapore was still claiming “successful completion of Bellerbys Foundation program guarantees you a place at one of our 50 partner universities”. When Private Eye contacted Durham University, first on the list of Bellerbys' supposed UK partners, the university said it has never offered any such guarantee adding: “We have previously been in touch with Bellerbys to clarify this fact and to provide guidelines for using our name and logo in their marketing materials. We were not consulted on the Singapore website, which is misleading. We have contacted Bellerbys to ask for the wording … to be changed immediately”. ==Accreditation== Bellerbys College is accredited by the British Accreditation Council (BAC) for Independent Further and Higher Education and is on the UK Register of Independent Schools. In 2006 the college in Cambridge won 5 Good Schools Guide Awards for A Level results and in the last two years the colleges have won a further 12 awards in 2008 and 2009 combined. ==References * Bellerbys College official site Category:Independent co-educational schools in London Category:Independent schools in the Royal Borough of Greenwich Category:Sixth form colleges in Cambridgeshire Category:Sixth form colleges in Oxfordshire Category:Sixth form colleges in East Sussex Category:Sixth form colleges in London ","title":"Bellerbys College"},{"id":"20343401","text":"Barton Power Station was a coal-fired power station on the Bridgewater Canal in Trafford Park, near Eccles, Lancashire, England. ==History== The construction of the station began in 1920 and operation began in 1923. The station's original equipment consisted of three Metropolitan-Vickers 27.5 MW turbo-alternators, nine Babcock & Wilcox chain-grate stoked boilers, Mather & Platt auxiliary equipment and British Thomson-Houston switchgear. The station supplied electricity to an area of 3,100 square kilometers and was one of the most advanced power stations of the time. Coal was delivered to the station in barges, using the Bridgewater Canal. Steam condensing and cooling was by water abstracted from the canal. The station was extended twice with Metropolitan- Vickers supplying a 40 MW generating set in 1928, followed by an additional 50 MW set in 1938.GEGB Annual report and accounts, various yearsElectricity Commission, Generation of Electricity in Great Britain year ended 31st December 1946.

In that year the station sent out 72.149 GWh, the load factor was 11.9 percent and the thermal efficiency was 17.86 per cent. The station was closed on 18 March 1974 with a reduced generating capacity of 69 MW. At the time the station was co-firing oil. The station was then demolished in 1978 and 1979. The first chimney was demolished in June 1979.

The Martyrology of Tallaght is in prose and contains two sections for each day of the year, one general and one for Irish saints. It also has a prologue and an epilogue.Welch, Robert, & Bruce Stewart, The Oxford Companion to Irish Literature (Oxford University Press, 1996, ), p. 359 at google.co.uk ==Prologue and Irish paganism== The prologue contains a famous verse on the declining pagan faith in Ireland: > Senchatraig na ngente/iman roerud rudad/itfossa can adrad/amail Lathrach > Lugdach. Ind locáin rogabtha/dessib ocus trírib/it rúama co ndálib/co > cétaib, co mílib. which reads in translation as > The old cities of the pagans to which length of occupation has refused are > deserts without worship like Lugaid's House-site. The little monastic sites > that were settled by twos and threes are Romes with multitudes, with > thousands. ==Title and authorship== The earliest mention of the Martyrology of Tallaght by that name is in the 12th-century Martyrology of Gorman (Félire Uí Gormáin), written between 1166 and 1174 by Mael Muire Ua Gormáin, abbot of Knock, County Louth. Ua Gormáin attributes the Martyrology of Tallaght to Mael Ruain and says that Óengus based his work on it: \\"...because it was thus in the Martyrology of Tallaght of Mael Ruain, out of which he [Óengus] composed his félire\\".Follett, Westley, Céli Dé in Ireland: Monastic Writing and Identity in the Early Middle Ages (London: Boydell Press, 2006, ) pp 129-130 at books.google.co.ukStokes, W. (ed.) Felire Hui Gormain: The Martyrology of Gorman (London: 1895) available at archive.org The 17th-century scholar Michael O'Clery made a copy of the Martyrology of Tallaght, and headed it \\"Here begins the Martyrology of Oengus mac Oibleainviz., Óengus the Culdee. and Mael Ruain\\", but he did not give a source for this statement. The Franciscan John Colgan, another 17th-century scholar, pointed out that Óengus and Maelruain could not have completed the Martyrology of Tallaght as it stands, as several entries are from periods after the death of both, but he also formed the opinion that the later entries had been made at Tallaght, where Óengus and Maelruain worked together, so justifying Ua Gormáin's use of the name Martyrology of Tallaght. Based on oral traditions and on older texts, the work may have been first completed in 790.Martyrology of Tallaght at catholiconline.com However, Pádraig Ó Riain of University College, Cork, a leading authority, has argued that the Martyrology of Tallaght and the Martyrology of Oengus date from about 830. Ó Riain has shown that the general sections of the Martyrology of Tallaght are based on a Northumbrian copy of the Martyrologium Hieronymianum.Primary Sources for the Study of Liturgy, Hagiography and Other Aspects of Medieval Studies at ucc.ieÓ Riain, Pádraig, Feastdays of the Saints: A History of Irish Martyrologies, Subsidia Hagiographica 86 (Brussels: Société des Bollandistes, 2006, ) ==Manuscripts== The earliest surviving manuscript of the work is in a fragment of Áed Ua Crimthainn's 12th-century Book of Leinster.Best, Richard Irvine & Lawlor, Hugh Jackson (eds.) The martyrology of Tallaght (Henry Bradshaw Society 68, 1931) This consists of ten folios which had been separated from the main volume of the Book of Leinster by 1583. These came into the possession of Michael O'Clery in 1627 and were deposited at the Franciscan friary of Donegal. In 1631, the Martyrology of Tallaght folios were sent to St Anthony's at Louvain, where John Colgan added some marginalia. In the late 18th century they passed on to St Isidore's College, Rome, and in 1872 were returned from there to Ireland, to be kept first in the Franciscan convent at Merchant's Quay, Dublin, later at Dun Mhuire, Killiney. In 2000, the manuscript came into the possession of University College, Dublin, where it is known as MS Franciscan A3.Ms A3 at www.ucd.ie This 12th-century manuscript is now lacking the text for some one hundred and fifty days of the calendar, but what is missing is supplied by Michael O'Clery's 17th century transcript.

Its range of distribution includes Nunavut, Ontario, Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Nova Scotia in Canada. In the United States it is found in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, West Virginia, Maryland, Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina, and South Carolina. It is also found in Greenland. Within Nova Scotia this plant is found in Inverness County and along the south shore in only a few areas.Roland, A. E., Zinck, M., Owen, E., & Nova Scotia Museum. (1998). Roland's flora of Nova Scotia (3rd ed.). Halifax, N.S.: Nimbus Pub. & Nova Scotia Museum. The plant has a peak flowering time of two weeks in the middle of July, although it does flower anywhere between June to August. In this period pollen grains are transported from flower to flower by insects. The most effective insect to transport pollen grains is the bumblebee Bombus terricola. This is due to tiny hairs on the bee that collect pollen, and the bee's habit of crawling all over the flower in low temperatures when it is too cold to fly. Greenland stitchwort is found in areas of high elevation where bedrock is exposed. The plant grows on rocky ledges and in fine gravel on slopes. The soil in this area has a pH of 3.1 to 4, and is low in nitrogen and phosphorus, but high in organic matter content. This region is very cloudy, has frequent fog and considerable precipitation. One study area on Mount Washington recorded an annual precipitation average at 1837.5 millimeters, an average wind speed of 50 km/h, and a mean annual temperature of -3.0 °C. Minuartia groenlandica was studied for use on roof tops for insulation and urban greenery but was unable to tolerate drought for long enough to be used successfully.Wolf, D., & Lundholm, J. T.

The following year the club returned to Preferente. ==Season to season== { valign=\\"top\\" width=0% {  - f0f6fa;\\" !Season !Tier !Division !Place !Copa del Rey - CECE1B;\\"1951–77 CECE1B;\\"— CECE1B;\\"Regional CECE1B;\\"— !efefef;\\" - 99A61C;\\"1977/78 99A61C;\\"8 99A61C;\\" 99A61C;\\"— !efefef;\\" - 99A61C;\\"1978/79 99A61C;\\"8 99A61C;\\" 99A61C;\\"— !efefef;\\" - 99A61C;\\"1979/80 99A61C;\\"8 99A61C;\\" 99A61C;\\"— !efefef;\\" - 99A61C;\\"1980/81 99A61C;\\"8 99A61C;\\" 99A61C;\\"11th !efefef;\\" - 99A61C;\\"1981/82 99A61C;\\"8 99A61C;\\" 99A61C;\\"1st !efefef;\\" - 77DD77;\\"1982/83 77DD77;\\"7 77DD77;\\" 77DD77;\\"4th !efefef;\\" - 25A8F9;\\"1983/84 25A8F9;\\"6 25A8F9;\\" 25A8F9;\\"10th !efefef;\\" - 25A8F9;\\"1984/85 25A8F9;\\"6 25A8F9;\\" 25A8F9;\\"13th !efefef;\\" - 25A8F9;\\"1985/86 25A8F9;\\"6 25A8F9;\\" 25A8F9;\\"3rd !efefef;\\" - CECE1B;\\"1986/87 CECE1B;\\"5 CECE1B;\\" CECE1B;\\"15th !efefef;\\" - CECE1B;\\"1987/88 CECE1B;\\"5 CECE1B;\\" CECE1B;\\"4th !efefef;\\" - CECE1B;\\"1988/89 CECE1B;\\"5 CECE1B;\\" CECE1B;\\"8th !efefef;\\" - CECE1B;\\"1989/90 CECE1B;\\"5 CECE1B;\\" CECE1B;\\"15th !efefef;\\" - 25A8F9;\\"1990/91 25A8F9;\\"6 25A8F9;\\" 25A8F9;\\"1st !efefef;\\" - 25A8F9;\\"1991/92 25A8F9;\\"6 25A8F9;\\" 25A8F9;\\"8th !efefef;\\" - CECE1B;\\"1992/93 CECE1B;\\"5 CECE1B;\\" CECE1B;\\"12th !efefef;\\" - CECE1B;\\"1993/94 CECE1B;\\"5 CECE1B;\\" CECE1B;\\"15th !efefef;\\" - 25A8F9;\\"1994/95 25A8F9;\\"6 25A8F9;\\" 25A8F9;\\"12th !efefef;\\" - 25A8F9;\\"1995/96 25A8F9;\\"6 25A8F9;\\" 25A8F9;\\"4th !efefef;\\" } valign=\\"top\\" width=0% {  - f0f6fa;\\" !Season !Tier !Division !Place !Copa del Rey - 25A8F9;\\"1996/97 25A8F9;\\"6 25A8F9;\\" 25A8F9;\\"5th !efefef;\\" - 25A8F9;\\"1997/98 25A8F9;\\"6 25A8F9;\\" 25A8F9;\\"8th !efefef;\\" - 25A8F9;\\"1998/99 25A8F9;\\"6 25A8F9;\\" 25A8F9;\\"3rd !efefef;\\" - 25A8F9;\\"1999/00 25A8F9;\\"6 25A8F9;\\" 25A8F9;\\"5th !efefef;\\" - 25A8F9;\\"2000/01 25A8F9;\\"6 25A8F9;\\" 25A8F9;\\"12th !efefef;\\" - 25A8F9;\\"2001/02 25A8F9;\\"6 25A8F9;\\" 25A8F9;\\"9th !efefef;\\" - 25A8F9;\\"2002/03 25A8F9;\\"6 25A8F9;\\" 25A8F9;\\"4th !efefef;\\" - 25A8F9;\\"2003/04 25A8F9;\\"6 25A8F9;\\" 25A8F9;\\"7th !efefef;\\" - 25A8F9;\\"2004/05 25A8F9;\\"6 25A8F9;\\" 25A8F9;\\"6th !efefef;\\" - 25A8F9;\\"2005/06 25A8F9;\\"6 25A8F9;\\" 25A8F9;\\"1st !efefef;\\" - CECE1B;\\"2006/07 CECE1B;\\"5 CECE1B;\\" CECE1B;\\"2nd !efefef;\\" - FF7F00;\\"2007/08 FF7F00;\\"4 FF7F00;\\"3ª FF7F00;\\"18th !efefef;\\" - CECE1B;\\"2008/09 CECE1B;\\"5 CECE1B;\\" CECE1B;\\"18th !efefef;\\" - 25A8F9;\\"2009/10 25A8F9;\\"6 25A8F9;\\" 25A8F9;\\"17th !efefef;\\" - 77DD77;\\"2010/11 77DD77;\\"7 77DD77;\\" 77DD77;\\"11th !efefef;\\" - 77DD77;\\"2011/12 77DD77;\\"7 77DD77;\\" 77DD77;\\"3rd !efefef;\\" - 25A8F9;\\"2012/13 25A8F9;\\"6 25A8F9;\\" 25A8F9;\\"9th !efefef;\\" - 25A8F9;\\"2013/14 25A8F9;\\"6 25A8F9;\\" 25A8F9;\\"14th !efefef;\\" - 77DD77;\\"2014/15 77DD77;\\"7 77DD77;\\" 77DD77;\\"6th !efefef;\\" - 77DD77;\\"2015/16 77DD77;\\"7 77DD77;\\" 77DD77;\\"4th !efefef;\\" } } { valign=\\"top\\" width=0% {  - f0f6fa;\\" !Season !Tier !Division !Place !Copa del Rey - 77DD77;\\"2016/17 77DD77;\\"7 77DD77;\\" 77DD77;\\"3rd !efefef;\\" - 77DD77;\\"2017/18 77DD77;\\"7 77DD77;\\" 77DD77;\\"1st !efefef;\\" - 25A8F9;\\"2018/19 25A8F9;\\"6 25A8F9;\\" 25A8F9;\\" !efefef;\\" } } \\\\---- *1 season in Tercera División ==Uniform == *Home Kit: Blue shirt, blue shorts and blue socks. *Away Kit: Red shirt, white trousers and red socks. == Stadium == CD Humanes plays its home matches in the town's municipal stadium, Emilio Zazo, with capacity for 2,000 spectators and artificial turf. ==External links== *ffmadrid.es profile *futmadrid.com profile Category:Football clubs in the Community of Madrid Category:Divisiones Regionales de Fútbol clubs Category:Association football clubs established in 1951 Category:1951 establishments in Spain ","title":"CD Humanes"},{"id":"20343687","text":"Joe Tyler - (Joseph Tyler) born 1 April 1982 in Halifax, West Yorkshire is a Freestyle skier.

On March 19, 1993, Associate Justice Byron White announced his retirement (and assumption of senior status), effective at the end of the Supreme Court's 1992–1993 term.Linda Greenhouse, Byron R. White, Longtime Justice And a Football Legend, Dies at 84, The New York Times (April 16, 2002). President Clinton announced Ruth Bader Ginsburg as White's replacement on June 15, 1993, and she was confirmed by the United States Senate on August 3, 1993. On April 6, 1994, Associate Justice Harry Blackmun announced his retirement (and assumption of senior status), which ultimately took effect August 3, 1994. President Clinton announced Stephen Breyer as Blackmun's replacement on May 13, 1994, with the United States Senate confirming Breyer on July 29, 1994. ==Overview== Throughout much of the history of the United States, the Supreme Court of the United States was considered the least powerful branch of the government, and nominations to that body, although important, were not the source of great political controversy as they are today. Furthermore, Clinton's Supreme Court nominations were the first by a Democratic president since President Lyndon Johnson's controversial and failed nomination of Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice of the United States in 1968. ==Politics== When asked about the kind of justices he would appoint to the Supreme Court, President Bill Clinton insisted that he had no litmus test for his justice, but at the same time, that he only wanted justices who would be pro-choice when it came to abortion. \\"I will appoint judges to the Supreme Court who believe in the constitutional right to privacy, including the right to choose\\", Clinton said in an interview on April 5, 1992.Thomas L. Friedman, THE SUPREME COURT; Clinton Expected to Pick Moderate for High Court, The New York Times (March 20, 1993). In an interview on June 18, 1992, Clinton said, \\"I don't believe in the litmus test for Supreme Court judges, but I do think that the Court has been so politicized by the recent appointments under the last two presidents that we ought to appoint someone who can provide some balance; someone who everybody will say, 'There is someone who can be a great judge and someone who believes in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights and protecting the rights of ordinary citizens to be let alone from undue intrusion by their government.'\\" In addition, Clinton said he felt it was unhealthy that the court was dominated by former judges, most of whom, he felt, lacked adequate real-world experience. Clinton also made clear he was interested in shifting the dynamics of the court. \\"Look, the court is totally fragmented and it's dominated by Republican appointees\\", he said. \\"It's not enough for someone to vote the right way. We've got to get someone who will move people, who will persuade the others to join them. It's what Warren did. I want someone like that.\\" ==Ruth Bader Ginsburg nomination== Ginsburg accepting her nomination from Bill Clinton After Byron White announced his retirement on March 19, 1993, Clinton began a weeks-long journey through consideration of an unusually large number of candidates. The name that came up that interested Clinton the most was that of New York Governor Mario Cuomo. Clinton offered White's seat first to Cuomo, who initially had told confidants that he was willing to take the seat, but then changed his mind and faxed Clinton a letter telling him that his duty to residents of his state was more important than his desire to serve on the court. Liberal lawyers wanted Harvard Law professor and constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe, but Clinton and his aides next considered several candidates as \\"outside-the-box\\" choices. Clinton played with the idea of nominating a brilliant political philosopher instead of a practicing attorney. Professors Stephen L. Carter of Yale and Michael Sandel of Harvard would have fit the bill, but Clinton then hit upon what he considered to be a \\"sexy\\" idea: the nomination of his wife, Hillary Clinton. However, there was a huge problem associated with such a selection. George Stephanopoulos, a Clinton aide at the time, has written that the idea was dropped because the president's \\"choice had to be ratified by the Senate, where Republicans hadn't forgotten the rejection of Robert Bork, and Democrats were reeling from their recent encounters with Zoe Baird, Kimba Wood, and Lani Guinier. Sexy was good, but safe was better. We simply couldn't afford another failed nomination.\\" Stephanopoulos quotes Clinton himself saying, \\"We don't need another gang- that-couldn't-shoot-straight story.\\"Byron York, Advice and Consent? How Clinton Chose Ginsburg , The National Review (July 5, 2005) Clinton then turned to other politicians—first, U.S. Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, who declined on the spot, desiring to stay in the Senate and help to pass Clinton's legislation. After Mitchell, Clinton approached his Secretary of Education, Richard Riley, a former Governor of South Carolina who also said no. \\"I was a mediocre country lawyer\\", Riley told Clinton. \\"This isn't my thing.\\" Clinton next considered his Secretary of the Interior, Bruce Babbitt, a former Arizona Governor. Clinton prepared to nominate Babbitt when two problems surfaced—a false published report about gambling debts in Las Vegas and opposition to Babbitt's nomination voiced by Senator Orrin Hatch, who was the ranking Republican on the United States Senate Judiciary Committee. Hatch had told Clinton that Babbitt's strong pro-environmental views had enraged a group of Republican senators in the western United States who might take revenge either on Babbitt's nomination or on the candidate Clinton nominated to replace him in the Department of the Interior. Clinton chose not to proceed with Babbitt's nomination.Richard L. Berke, 2 Republicans Oppose Naming Babbitt to Court, The New York Times (June 9, 1993). Clinton then turned to existing judges. He considered Eighth Circuit judge Richard S. Arnold, who was not a close friend of Clinton's but who was from Clinton's home state of Arkansas. The President very much wanted to nominate Arnold but feared the nomination might be viewed as cronyism. He then weighed Sixth Circuit judge Gilbert S. Merritt, who was a family friend of Vice President Al Gore. However, a problem surfaced relating to Merritt's tenure as a U.S. attorney in the 1960s, and Clinton decided not to proceed with him. Clinton then asked his staff about Janie Shores, who had been the first woman to serve on the Alabama Supreme Court but who was not well known in Washington, D.C. legal circles. In addition, Shores' constitutional views were completely unknown to Clinton or anyone else on his team. \\"You are not nominating Janie Shores to the Supreme Court\\", White House counsel Bernard W. Nussbaum told Clinton. \\"No one knows who she is. This is insane.\\" The next name Clinton considered was that of First Circuit judge Stephen Breyer. Clinton's staff had liked Breyer, but given an injury that he had sustained just a few days earlier, Breyer was in a significant amount of pain. During his interview with Clinton, Breyer was short of breath and in pain. Clinton ultimately decided that Breyer seemed \\"heartless.\\" \\"I don't see enough humanity\\", Clinton told his staff. \\"I want a judge with soul.\\" Clinton then considered a list of \\"firsts\\" for diversity purposes: David Tatel, a Washington lawyer who had served in the Carter Administration who would be the first blind justice; José A. Cabranes, a district court judge who would be the first Hispanic justice, and D.C. Circuit judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who, Stephanopoulos writes, \\"would be the first Jewish justice since Abe Fortas, and the first woman to be appointed by a Democrat. More important, she was a pioneer in the legal fight for women's rights—a female Thurgood Marshall.\\" In addition, Ginsburg was noted as moderate-to-conservative on criminal matters and had a different rationale for supporting Roe v. Wade than most liberals: she considered laws banning abortion a form of sex discrimination rather than a violation of privacy. Hatch told Clinton that he would support Ginsburg as well. At that point, however, Cuomo's oldest son who served as an official in the Clinton Administration, Andrew Cuomo, contacted Clinton's staff to inquire if the President had made a final decision yet. Mario Cuomo, his son said, believed that Clinton was about to name Breyer to the court and as a result thought that Clinton would not name two white males in a row. As such, the governor believed that his own chances were now or never. Clinton still was interested in nominating Cuomo, telling his staff that the governor \\"will sing the song of America. It'll be like watching Pavarotti at Christmas time.\\" Clinton then interviewed Ginsburg, and then took a phone call from Cuomo, who backed out of consideration for a second time. The next day, on June 15, 1993, Clinton announced that he had chosen Ginsburg. The Senate confirmed Ginsburg in a 96–3 vote on August 3, 1993.U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes – Nomination of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, senate.gov. Senators Jesse Helms (R-NC), Don Nickles (R-OK) and Bob Smith (R-NH) voted against the nomination. Donald Riegle (D-MI) did not vote. ==Stephen Breyer nomination== After Harry Blackmun announced his retirement on April 6, 1994, Clinton again asked Mitchell, who had announced that he would not stand for reelection in November 1994, to be his nominee. Mitchell told Clinton that he did not want to be a Supreme Court Justice. Clinton also asked Babbitt, who asked not to be considered. At that point, Clinton again considered Arnold, who had been recommended by over 100 federal judges in a joint letter written after Blackmun had retired. Clinton's willingness to proceed with Arnold, however, was complicated by the fact that Arnold had been diagnosed with low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 1976 and who since had suffered from tumors that had spread to other parts of his body. Although Arnold was functioning normally, his doctor told the President that Arnold had cancer all through his body and that there was no way he could say that Arnold's disease \\"would not interfere\\" with Supreme Court duties. Finally, Clinton announced on May 13, 1994 that he would nominate Breyer to the Supreme Court. The Senate confirmed Breyer in an 87 to 9 vote on July 29, 1994.U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes – Nomination of Stephen Breyer, senate.gov. Senators Conrad Burns (R-MT), Dan Coats (R-IN), Paul Coverdell (R-GA), Jesse Helms (R-NC), Trent Lott (R-MS), Richard Lugar (R-IN), Frank Murkowski (R-AK), Don Nickles (R-OK), and Bob Smith (R-NH) voted against the nomination.

He also served as a Union Army general during the American Civil War, and was seriously wounded several times in the conflict. ==Early life and career== Campbell was born on August 10th,1823 in St. Thomas Township, Franklin County, Pennsylvania, and he studied at Marshall College (known now as Franklin & Marshall College) located in Lancaster. In 1846 Campbell served in the U.S. Army during the Mexican–American War, assigned as a second lieutenant in the 8th U.S. Infantry. On February 11, 1847, Campbell was promoted to first lieutenant, and on April 9 he joined the 11th U.S. Infantry.Eicher, p. 160. In August 1847 he was promoted to the rank of captain in the 11th U.S. Infantry, and was honorably discharged on August 14, 1848. In 1852 Campbell was elected to the lower house of the Pennsylvania General Assembly.Warner, p. 65. ==Civil War service== At the beginning of the American Civil War in 1861, Campbell chose to follow his home state and the Union cause. He volunteered for service in the state forces on May 29, and was assigned as a captain of Battery A in the Pennsylvania Light Artillery.Warner, pp. 65-6. On August 5 Campbell was promoted to lieutenant colonel in the Pennsylvania Artillery, and to colonel on September 13. On December 20 Campbell participated in the Battle of Dranesville in Fairfax County, Virginia, and he resigned from the state forces on February 1, 1862.Warner, p. 66. Battle of Seven Pines Joining the Union Army in 1862, Campbell was appointed to command the 57th Pennsylvania Infantry as its colonel. He led the 57th Infantry, part of Brig. Gen. Philip Kearny's division, in the Peninsula Campaign of 1862, fighting at the Battle of Seven Pines on May 31. In the battle Campbell's horse was shot from under him, and he was severely wounded three times. Campbell was hit in the right arm, pelvis, and left leg, and was captured by Confederate soldiers. Despite these injuries Campbell managed to escape later that day. With his right arm still in a sling, Campbell led the 57th during the Fredericksburg Campaign in the winter of 1862. At the Battle of Fredericksburg on December 13, he was again seriously wounded, hit in his abdomen and the same right arm. The wound in his belly went through his liver, and Campbell was considered beyond hope and left for dead. He had been appointed a brigadier general in the Union Army on November 29, 1862, but it was never confirmed and this appointment would expire on March 4, 1863.Eicher, p. 160; Warner, p. 66. \\"He had been appointed brigadier general from November 29, 1862, and when the appointment expired by statute on March 4, 1863, he was reappointed to rank from March 13.\\" Partially recovered, Campbell was promoted to brigadier general on March 13, 1863, and given command of the Union District of Wisconsin in the Department of the Northwest on November 7, 1864. He led this district until the end of the war, and was mustered out of the volunteer service on January 15, 1866. ==Postbellum== After the American Civil War, Campbell relocated to the Dakota Territory. He worked as an Inspector of Indian agencies, then a Stage Line operator, and a hotel operator. In 1870 Campbell established a stagecoach stop along the Firesteel Trail, which included his residence, an inn, a general store, and a large horse barn. It grew into the town of Scotland, and he became active in Democratic politics, serving as mayor of the town he helped found.Jones, p. 252 Campbell died in Scotland, SD at the age of 71, six days after being injured when he fell from the steps of his hotel on April 9, 1895. He was buried in Yankton City Cemetery, located in Yankton, South Dakota.Warner, p. 66; Eicher p. 160. ==See also== *List of American Civil War generals (Union) ==NotesReferences== * * * Category:1823 births Category:1895 deaths Category:Franklin & Marshall College alumni Category:People of Pennsylvania in the American Civil War Category:Union Army generals Category:People from Scotland, South Dakota ","title":"Charles Thomas Campbell"},{"id":"20343826","text":"is a Japanese DJ, record producer, songwriter, composer and arranger.

He was the leading American two-year-old of 2004, a year in which he was undefeated. His subsequent career was restricted by injuries. ==Background== Foaled in Maryland, Declan's Moon was from the second crop of stallion Malibu Moon, whose second crop of foals also included eventual Gr.I winner Malibu Mint. His dam, Vee Vee Star, was graded stakes placed during her career, finishing second in the 1999 Black-Eyed Susan Stakes. A \\"tall, rangy\\" gelding, Declan's Moon was bred by Brice Ridgely who named him after his grandson. Jay Em Ess Stable purchased Declan's Moon for $125,000 at the 2003 Fasig-Tipton Midlantic September yearling sale. Declan's Moon was conditioned for racing by Ron Ellis. ==Racing career== Declan's Moon won his debut as a two-year-old on July 31, 2004, at California's Del Mar Racetrack. He followed this with wins in the Grade II Del Mar Futurity and the Grade III Hollywood Prevue Stakes. The colt ended the season with a win in the Grade I Hollywood Futurity. His undefeated season resulted in Declan's Moon being voted the Eclipse Award as the American Champion Two-Year-Old of 2004. Declan's Moon began his three-year-old season with a win in the March 5, 2005, Santa Catalina Stakes and was the early favorite for the Kentucky Derby until a knee injury sidelined him for several months. Back in training in the fall, Declan's Moon sustained a fracture at the top of his cannon bone that kept him out of racing until July 2006, when he returned to finish a solid second in a non-stakes event at Hollywood Park Racetrack. However, the colt was beaten again in his ensuing four starts, finishing last in three of them. He did not win another race until July 2007, when he captured a six-furlong minor event at Hollywood Park. This was his last win, and he was retired with a record of one win in his final thirteen starts. ==Retirement== Declan's Moon was retired to Merryland Farm in Bel Air, Maryland. In late 2012, Declan's Moon was one of four retired Thoroughbred race horses to be selected for the Retired Racehorse Training Project's \\"100 Day Challenge\\" designed to demonstrate the versatility of Thoroughbreds by introducing them to new equestrian disciplines, including dressage, eventing, equitation, show jumping, and foxhunting. At the end of the challenge, in March 2013, Declan's Moon, the 2004 Eclipse Award-winning, undefeated two year old by Malibu Moon, was voted in a landslide the horse best suited for dressage. He represented Country Life Farm and is owned by Samantha Siegel of Jay Em Ess Racing. \\"Declan's Moon's incredible movement shatters the myth that the racing industry no longer produces horses suited for sport at the top levels,\\" said RRTP founder and president Steuart Pittman. \\"He was not only the fastest horse of his crop, but is also exactly what sport horse breeders are trying to produce for the show ring.\\" ==References== Category:2002 racehorse births Category:Thoroughbred family 2-i Category:Racehorses bred in Maryland Category:Racehorses trained in the United States Category:Eclipse Award winners ","title":"Declan's Moon"},{"id":"20343981","text":"Rudolf Kippenhahn (born 24 May 1926, in Pernink, Czechoslovakia) is a German astrophysicist and science author. ==Biography== Rudolf Kippenhahn originally studied mathematics and physics at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg before changing to Astronomy.

It occurs when a government or central bank buys or sells foreign currency in exchange for its own domestic currency, generally with the intention of influencing the exchange rate and trade policy. Policymakers may intervene in foreign exchange markets in order to advance a variety of economic objectives: controlling inflation, maintaining competitiveness, or maintaining financial stability. The precise objectives are likely to depend on the stage of a country's development, the degree of financial market development and international integration, and the country's overall vulnerability to shocks, among other factors.Joseph E. Gagnon, “Policy Brief 12-19”, Peterson Institute for International Economic, 2012. The most complete type of currency intervention is the imposition of a fixed exchange rate with respect to some other currency or to a weighted average of some other currencies. ==Purposes== There are many reasons a country's monetary and/or fiscal authority may want to intervene in the foreign exchange market. Central banks generally agree that the primary objective of foreign exchange market intervention is to manage the volatility and/or influence the level of the exchange rate. Governments prefer to stabilize the exchange rate because excessive short-term volatility erodes market confidence and affects both the financial market and the real goods market. When there is inordinate instability, exchange rate uncertainty generates extra costs and reduces profits for firms. As a result, investors are unwilling to make investment in foreign financial assets. Firms are reluctant to engage in international trade. Moreover, the exchange rate fluctuation would spill over into the other financial markets. If the exchange rate volatility increases the risk of holding domestic assets, then prices of these assets would also become more volatile. The increased volatility of financial markets would threaten the stability of the financial system and make monetary policy goals more difficult to attain. Therefore, authorities conduct currency intervention. In addition, when economic conditions change or when the market misinterprets economic signals, authorities use foreign exchange intervention to correct exchange rates, in order to avoid overshooting of either direction. Anna Schwartz contended that the central bank can cause the sudden collapse of speculative excess, and that it can limit growth by constricting the money supply. Today, forex market intervention is largely used by the central banks of developing countries, and less so by developed countries. There are a few reasons most developed countries no longer actively intervene: * Research and experience suggest that the instrument is only effective (at least beyond the very short term) if seen as foreshadowing interest rate or other policy adjustments. Without a durable and independent impact on the nominal exchange rate, intervention is seen as having no lasting power to influence the real exchange rate and thus competitive conditions for the tradable sector. *Large- scale intervention can undermine the stance of monetary policy. Developing countries, on the other hand, do sometimes intervene, presumably because they believe the instrument to be an effective tool in the circumstances and for the situations they face. Objectives include: to control inflation, to achieve external balance or enhance competitiveness to boost growth, or to prevent currency crises, such as large depreciation/appreciation swings.Bank for International Settlements, BIS Paper No. 24, Foreign exchange market intervention in emerging markets: motives, techniques and implications, (2005). In a Bank for International Settlements (BIS) paper published in 2015, the authors describe the common reasons central banks intervene. Based on a BIS survey, in foreign exchange markets \\"emerging market central banks\\" use the strategy of \\"leaning against the wind\\" \\"to limit exchange rate volatility and smooth the trend path of the exchange rate\\". In their 2005 meeting on foreign exchange market intervention, central bank governors had noted that, \\"Many central banks would argue that their main aim is to limit exchange rate volatility rather than to meet a specific target for the level of the exchange rate\\". Other reasons cited (that do not target the exchange rate) were to \\"slow the rate of change of the exchange rate\\", \\"dampen exchange rate volatility\\", \\"supply liquidity to the forex market\\", or \\"influence the level of foreign reserves\\". ==Historical context== In the Cold War-era United States, under the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates, intervention was used to help maintain the exchange rate within prescribed margins and was considered to be essential to a central bank's toolkit. The dissolution of the Bretton Woods system between 1968 and 1973 was largely due to President Richard Nixon's “temporary” suspension of the dollar's convertibility to gold in 1971, after the dollar struggled throughout the late 1960s in light of large increases in the price of gold. An attempt to revive the fixed exchange rates failed, and by March 1973 the major currencies began to float against each other. Since the end of the traditional Bretton Woods system, IMF members have been free to choose any form of exchange arrangement they wish (except pegging their currency to gold), such as: allowing the currency to float freely, pegging it to another currency or a basket of currencies, adopting the currency of another country, participating in a currency bloc, or forming part of a monetary union. The end of the traditional Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s led to widespread but not universal currency management.Lucio Sarno and Mark P. Taylor, “Official Intervention in the Foreign Exchange Market: Is It Effective and, If So, How Does It Work?,” Journal of Economic Literature 39.3 (2001): 839-68. From 2008 through 2013, central banks in emerging market economies (EMEs) had to \\"re-examine their foreign exchange market intervention strategies\\" because of \\"huge swings in capital flows to and from EMEs. ===Direct intervention=== Direct currency intervention is generally defined as foreign exchange transactions that are conducted by the monetary authority and aimed at influencing the exchange rate. Depending on whether it changes the monetary base or not, currency intervention can be distinguished between non-sterilized intervention and sterilized intervention, respectively. *;Sterilized intervention ::Sterilized intervention is a policy that attempts to influence the exchange rate without changing the monetary base. The procedure is a combination of two transactions. First, the central bank conducts a non-sterilized intervention by buying (selling) foreign currency bonds using domestic currency that it issues. Then the central bank “sterilizes” the effects on the monetary base by selling (buying) a corresponding quantity of domestic-currency-denominated bonds to soak up the initial increase (decrease) of the domestic currency. The net effect of the two operations is the same as a swap of domestic-currency bonds for foreign- currency bonds with no change in the money supply. With sterilization, any purchase of foreign exchange is accompanied by an equal-valued sale of domestic bonds. ::For example, desiring to decrease the exchange rate, expressed as the price of domestic currency, without changing the monetary base, the monetary authority purchases foreign-currency bonds, the same action as in the last section. After this action, in order to keep the monetary base unchanged, the monetary authority conducts a new transaction, selling an equal amount of domestic-currency bonds, so that the total money supply is back to the original level. *;Non-sterilized intervention ::Non-sterilized intervention is a policy that alters the monetary base. Specifically, authorities affect the exchange rate through purchasing or selling foreign money or bonds with domestic currency. ::For example, aiming at decreasing the exchange rate/price of the domestic currency, authorities could purchase foreign currency bonds. During this transaction, extra supply of domestic currency will drag down domestic currency price, and extra demand of foreign currency will push up foreign currency price. As a result, the exchange rate drops. ===Indirect intervention=== Indirect currency intervention is a policy that influences the exchange rate indirectly. Some examples are capital controls (taxes or restrictions on international transactions in assets), and exchange controls (the restriction of trade in currencies). Those policies may lead to inefficiencies or reduce market confidence, or in the case of exchange controls may lead to the creation of a black market, but can be used as an emergency damage control. ==Effectiveness== Imports and exports from Argentina 1992 to 2004 ===Non-sterilization intervention=== In general, there is a consensus in the profession that non-sterilized intervention is effective. Similarly to the monetary policy, nonsterilized intervention influences the exchange rate by inducing changes in the stock of the monetary base, which, in turn, induces changes in broader monetary aggregates, interest rates, market expectations and ultimately the exchange rate. As we have shown in the previous example, the purchase of foreign-currency bonds leads to the increase of home-currency money supply and thus a decrease of the exchange rate. ===Sterilization intervention=== On the other hand, the effectiveness of sterilized intervention is more controversial and ambiguous. By definition, the sterilized intervention has little or no effect on domestic interest rates, since the level of the money supply has remained constant. However, according to some literature, sterilized intervention can influence the exchange rate through two channels: the portfolio balance channel and the expectations or signaling channel. ;The portfolio balance channel :In the portfolio balance approach, domestic and foreign bonds are not perfect substitutes. Agents balance their portfolios among domestic money and bonds, and foreign currency and bonds. Whenever aggregate economic conditions change, agents adjust their portfolios to a new equilibrium, based on a variety of considerations, i.e., wealth, tastes, expectation, etc.. Thus, these actions to balance portfolios will influence exchange rates. ;The expectations or signaling channel :Even if domestic and foreign assets are perfectly substitutable with each other, sterilized intervention is still effective. According to the signaling channel theory, agents may view exchange rate intervention as a signal about the future stance of policy. Then the change of expectation will affect the current level of the exchange rate. ==Modern examples== According to the Peterson Institute, there are four groups that stand out as frequent currency manipulators: longstanding advanced and developed economies, such as Japan and Switzerland, newly industrialized economies such as Singapore, developing Asian economies such as China, and oil exporters, such as Russia.Joseph E. Gagnon, \\"Policy Brief: Combating Widespread Currency Manipulation\\", Peterson Institute for International Economics, (2012). China's currency intervention and foreign exchange holdings are unprecedented. It is common for countries to manage their exchange rate via central bank to make their exports cheap. That method is being used extensively by the emerging markets of Southeast Asia, in particular. The American dollar is generally the primary target for these currency managers. The dollar is the global trading system's premier reserve currency, meaning dollars are freely traded and confidently accepted by international investors.Jared Bernstein, “How to Stop Currency Manipulation”, The New York Times, 2015 System Open Market Account is a monetary tool of the Federal Reserve system that may intervene to counter disorderly market conditions. In 2014, a number of large investment banks, including UBS, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, HSBC and the Royal Bank of Scotland were fined for currency manipulations. ===Swiss franc=== As the financial crisis of 2007–08 hit Switzerland, the Swiss franc appreciated \\"owing to a flight to safety and to the repayment of Swiss franc liabilities funding carry trades in high yielding currencies.\\" On March 12, 2009, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) announced that it intended to buy foreign exchange to prevent the Swiss franc from further appreciation. Affected by the SNB purchase of euros and US dollars, the Swiss franc weakened from 1.48 against the euro to 1.52 in a single day. At the end of 2009, the currency risk seemed to be solved; the SNB changed its attitude to preventing substantial appreciation. Unfortunately, the Swiss franc began to appreciate again. Thus, the SNB stepped in one more time and intervened at a rate of more than CHF 30 billion per month. By the end of June 17, 2010, when the SNB announced the end of its intervention, it had purchased an equivalent of $179 billion of Euros and U.S. dollars, amounting to 33% of Swiss GDP. Furthermore, in September 2011, the SNB influenced the foreign exchange market again, and set a minimum exchange rate target of SFr 1.2 to the Euro. On January 15, 2015, the SNB suddenly announced that it would no longer hold the Swiss Franc at the fixed exchange rate with the euro it had set in 2011. The franc soared in response; the euro fell roughly 40 percent in value in relation to the franc, falling as low as 0.85 francs (from the original 1.2 francs). As investors flocked to the franc during the financial crisis, they dramatically pushed up its value. An expensive franc may have large adverse effects on the Swiss economy; the Swiss economy is heavily reliant on selling things abroad. Exports of goods and services are worth over 70% of Swiss GDP. To maintain price stability and lower the franc's value, the SNB created new francs and used them to buy euros. Increasing the supply of francs relative to euros on foreign-exchange markets caused the franc's value to fall (ensuring the euro was worth 1.2 francs). This policy resulted in the SNB amassing roughly $480 billion-worth of foreign currency, a sum equal to about 70% of Swiss GDP. The Economist asserts that the SNB dropped the cap for the following reasons: first, rising criticisms among Swiss citizens regarding the large build-up of foreign reserves. Fears of runaway inflation underlie these criticisms, despite inflation of the franc being too low, according to the SNB. Second, in response to the European Central Bank's decision to initiate a quantitative easing program to combat euro deflation. The consequent devaluation of the euro would require the SNB to further devalue the franc had they decided to maintain the fixed exchange rate. Third, due to recent euro depreciation in 2014, the franc lost roughly 12% of its value against the USD and 10% against the rupee (exported goods and services to the U.S. and India account for roughly 20% Swiss exports). Following the SNB's announcement, the Swiss stock market sharply declined; due to a stronger franc, Swiss companies would have had a more difficult time selling goods and services to neighboring European citizens. In June 2016, when the results of the Brexit referendum were announced, the SNB gave a rare confirmation that it had increased foreign currency purchases again, as evidenced by a rise of commercial deposits to the national bank. Negative interest rates coupled with targeted foreign currency purchases have helped to limit the strength of the Swiss Franc in a time when the demand for safe haven currencies is increasing. Such interventions assure the price competitiveness of Swiss products in the European Union and global markets.\\"Swiss National Bank ramps up currency intervention after Brexit\\" . Reuters. July 4, 2016. ===Japanese yen=== From 1989 to 2003, Japan was suffering from a long deflationary period. After experiencing economic boom, the Japanese economy slowly declined in the early 1990s and entered a deflationary spiral in 1998. Within this period, Japanese output was stagnating; the deflation (negative inflation rate) was continuing, and the unemployment rate was increasing. Simultaneously, confidence in the financial sector waned, and several banks failed. During the period, the Bank of Japan, having become legally independent in March 1998, aimed at stimulating the economy by ending deflation and stabilizing the financial system.Takatoshi Ito, \\"Japanese Monetary Policy: 1998-2005 and Beyond,\\" Bank of International Settlements, p.105-107. The \\"availability and effectiveness of traditional policy instruments was severely constrained as the policy interest rate was already virtually at zero, and the nominal interest rate could not become negative (the zero bound problem).\\"Takatoshi,p.105. In response of deflationary pressures, the Bank of Japan, in coordination with the Ministry of Finance, launched a reserve targeting program. The BOJ increased the commercial bank current account balance to ¥35 trillion. Subsequently, the MoF used those funds to purchase $320 billion in U.S. treasury bonds and agency debt.Richard Duncan, The Dollar Crisis: Causes, Consequences, Cures, (2011). By 2014, critics of Japanese currency intervention asserted that the central bank of Japan was artificially and intentionally devaluing the yen. Some state that the 2014 US-Japan trade deficit — $261.7 billion — was increased unemployment in the United States. Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo has urged Asian countries to work together to defend themselves against the side-effects of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's reflation campaign. Some have (who?) stated this campaign is in response to Japan's stagnant economy and potential deflationary spiral. In 2013, Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso stated Japan planned to use its foreign exchange reserves to buy bonds issued by the European Stability Mechanism and euro-area sovereigns, in order to weaken the yen. The U.S. criticized Japan for undertaking unilateral sales of the yen in 2011, after Group of Seven economies jointly intervened to weaken the currency in the aftermath of the record earthquake and tsunami that year. By 2013, Japan held $1.27 trillion in foreign reserves according to finance ministry data.Mayumi Otsuma, “Japan to Buy European Debt with Currency Reserves to Weaken Yen”, Bloomberg News, 2013: par. 1-8. ===Chinese yuan=== Currency intervention has led to the devaluing of the Yuan, 1989 to 2008 In the 1990s and 2000s, there was a marked increase in American imports of Chinese goods. China's central bank allegedly devalued yuan by buying large amounts of US dollars with yuan, thus increasing the supply of the yuan in the foreign exchange market, while increasing the demand for US dollars, thus increasing the price of USD. According to an article published in KurzyCZ by Vladimir Urbanek, by December 2012, China's foreign exchange reserve held roughly $3.3 trillion, making it the highest foreign exchange reserve in the world. Roughly 60% of this reserve was composed of US government bonds and debentures. There has been much disagreement on how the United States should respond to Chinese devaluation of the yuan. This is partly due to disagreement over the actual effects of the undervalued yuan on capital markets, trade deficits, and the US domestic economy. Paul Krugman argued in 2010, that China intentionally devalued its currency to boost its exports to the United States and as a result, widening its trade deficit with the US. Krugman suggested at that time, that the United States should impose tariffs on Chinese goods. Krugman stated: Greg Mankiw, on the other hand, asserted in 2010 the U.S. protectionism via tariffs will hurt the U.S. economy far more than Chinese devaluation. Similarly, others have stated that the undervalued yuan has actually hurt China more in the long run insofar that the undervalued yuan does not subsidize the Chinese exporter, but subsidizes the American importer. Thus, importers within China have been substantially hurt due to the Chinese government's intention to continue to grow exports.Jonathan M. Finegold Catalan, \\"A Closer Look at China's Currency Manipulation\\", Ludwig von Mises Institute, (2010). The view that China manipulates its currency for its own benefit in trade has been criticized by Cato Institute trade policy studies fellow Daniel Pearson, National Taxpayers Union Policy and Government Affairs Manager Clark Packard, entrepreneur and Forbes contributor Louis Woodhill, Henry Kaufman Professor of Financial Institutions at Columbia University Charles W.

Forsyth, United Courier Services, and China Learning Curve. ===Russian ruble=== On November 10, 2014, the Central Bank of Russia decided to fully float the ruble in response to its biggest weekly drop in 11 years (roughly 6 percent drop in value against USD). In doing so, the central bank abolished the dual-currency trading band within which the ruble had previously traded. The central bank also ended regular interventions that had previously limited sudden movements in the currency's value. Earlier steps to raise interest rates by 150 basis points to 9.5 percent failed to stop the ruble's decline. The central bank sharply adjusted its macroeconomic forecasts. It stated that Russia's foreign exchange reserves, then the fourth largest in the world at roughly $480 billion, were expected to decrease to $422 billion by the end of 2014, $415 billion in 2015, and under $400 billion in 2016, in an effort to prop up the ruble. On December 11, the Russian central bank raised the key rate by 100 basis points, from 9.5 percent to 10.5 percent. Declining oil prices and economic sanctions imposed by the West in response to the Russian annexation of Crimea led to worsening Russian recession. On December 15, 2014, the ruble dropped as much as 19 percent, the worst single-day drop for the ruble in 16 years. The Russian central bank response was twofold: first, continue using Russia's large foreign currency reserve to buy rubles on the forex market in order to maintain its value through artificial demand on a larger scale. The same week of the December 15 drop, the Russian central bank sold an additional $700 million in foreign currency reserves, in addition to the nearly $30 billion spent over previous months to stave off decline. Russia's reserves then sat at $420 billion, down from $510 billion in January 2014. Second, increase interest rates dramatically. The central bank increased the key interest rate 650 basis points from 10.5 percent to 17 percent, the world's largest increase since 1998, when Russian rates soared past 100 percent and the government defaulted on its debt. The central bank hoped the higher rates would provide incentives to the forex market to maintain rubles. From February 12 to 19, 2015, the Russian central bank spent an additional $6.4 billion in reserves. Russian foreign reserves at this point stood at $368.3 billion, greatly below the central bank's initial forecast for 2015. Since the collapse in global oil prices in June 2014, Russian reserves have fallen by over $100 billion.http://www.businessinsider.com/russian-currency- reserves-are-running-out-2015-2 As oil prices began to stabilize in February–March 2015, the ruble likewise stabilized. The Russian central bank has decreased the key rate from its high of 17 percent to its current 15 percent as of February 2015. Russian foreign reserves currently sit at $360 billion. In March and April 2015, with the stabilization of oil prices, the ruble has made a surge, which Russian authorities have deemed a \\"miracle\\". Over three months, the ruble gained 20 percent against the US dollar, and 35 percent against the euro. The ruble was the best performing currency of 2015 in the forex market. Despite being far from its pre-recession levels (in January 2014, US$1 equaled roughly 33 Russian rubles), it is currently trading at roughly 52 rubles to US$1 (an increase in value from 80 rubles to US$1 in December 2014). Current Russian foreign reserves sit at $360 billion. In response to the ruble's surge, the Russian central bank lowered its key interest rate further to 14 percent in March 2015. The ruble's recent gains have been largely accredited to oil price stabilization and the calming of conflict in Ukraine. ==See also== * Exchange Equalisation Account in the United Kingdom * Exchange Stabilization Fund in the United States * Open market operation * Quantitative easing ==References== Category:Currency ","title":"Currency intervention"},{"id":"20344130","text":"Flavius Paulus (floruit 496) was a politician of the Eastern Roman Empire. == Family == Paulus was the brother of Anastasius I.

Voltages and depictions of electrical lines are typical for Germany and other European systems. An electrical grid, electric grid or power grid, is an interconnected network for delivering electricity from producers to consumers. It consists of:Kaplan, S. M. (2009). Smart Grid. Electrical Power Transmission: Background and Policy Issues. The Capital.Net, Government Series. Pp. 1-42. * generating stations that produce electric power * electrical substations for stepping electrical voltage up for transmission, or down for distribution * high voltage transmission lines that carry power from distant sources to demand-centers * distribution lines that connect individual customers Electrical grids vary in size from covering a single building through national grids (which cover whole countries) to transnational grids (which can cross continents). Power stations connected to grids are often located near energy resources such as a source of fuel or to take advantage of renewable energy resources, and away from heavily-populated areas. A bulk-power transmission network is therefore used to move the power long distances, sometimes across international boundaries, until it reaches its wholesale customer (usually the organisation that owns the local electric power distribution network). The electric power is therefore stepped up to a high voltage for the electric power transmission system. On arrival at a substation, the power will be stepped down from a transmission level voltage to a distribution-level voltage. As it exits the substation, it enters the distribution wiring. Finally, upon arrival at the service location, the power is stepped down again from the distribution voltage to the required service voltage(s). Although electrical grids are widespread, 1.4 billion people worldwide were not connected to an electricity grid. Electrical grids can be prone to malicious intrusion or attack; thus, there is a need for electric grid security. Also as electric grids modernize and introduce computers, cyber threats also start to become a security risk. Particular concerns relate to the more complex computer systems needed to manage grids. ==History== Early electric energy was produced near the device or service requiring that energy. In the 1880s, electricity competed with steam, hydraulics, and especially coal gas. Coal gas was first produced on customer's premises but later evolved into gasification plants that enjoyed economies of scale. In the industrialized world, cities had networks of piped gas, used for lighting. But gas lamps produced poor light, wasted heat, made rooms hot and smoky, and gave off hydrogen and carbon monoxide. They also posed a fire hazard. In the 1880s electric lighting soon became advantageous compared to gas lighting. Electric utility companies established central stations to take advantage of economies of scale and moved to centralized power generation, distribution, and system management.Borberly, A. and Kreider, J. F. (2001). Distributed Generation: The Power Paradigm for the New Millennium. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL. 400 pgs. After the war of the currents was settled in favor of AC power, with long distance power transmission it became possible to interconnect stations to balance load and improve load factors. In the United Kingdom, Charles Merz, of the Merz & McLellan consulting partnership, built the Neptune Bank Power Station near Newcastle upon Tyne in 1901, and by 1912 had developed into the largest integrated power system in Europe. Merz was appointed head of a Parliamentary Committee and his findings led to the Williamson Report of 1918, which in turn created the Electricity Supply Bill of 1919. The bill was the first step towards an integrated electricity system. The Electricity (Supply) Act of 1926 led to the setting up of the National Grid. The Central Electricity Board standardized the nation's electricity supply and established the first synchronized AC grid, running at 132 kilovolts and 50 Hertz. This started operating as a national system, the National Grid, in 1938. In the United States in the 1920s, utilities formed joint-operations to share peak load coverage and backup power. In 1934, with the passage of the Public Utility Holding Company Act (USA), electric utilities were recognized as public goods of importance and were given outlined restrictions and regulatory oversight of their operations. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 required transmission line owners to allow electric generation companies open access to their networkMazer, A. (2007). Electric Power Planning for Regulated and Deregulated Markets. John, Wiley, and Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ. 313pgs. and led to a restructuring of how the electric industry operated in an effort to create competition in power generation. No longer were electric utilities built as vertical monopolies, where generation, transmission and distribution were handled by a single company. Now, the three stages could be split among various companies, in an effort to provide fair accessibility to high voltage transmission. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 allowed incentives and loan guarantees for alternative energy production and advance innovative technologies that avoided greenhouse emissions. In France, electrification began in the 1900s, with 700 communes in 1919, and 36,528 in 1938. At the same time, the nearby networks began to interconnect: Paris in 1907 at 12 kV, the Pyrénées in 1923 at 150 kV, and finally almost all of the country interconnected in 1938 at 220 kV. By 1946, the grid is the world's most dense. That year that state nationalised the industry, by uniting the private companies as Électricité de France. The frequency was standardised at 50 Hz, and the 225 kV network replaces 110 and 120. From 1956, service voltage is standardised at 220 / 380 V, replacing the previous 127/220 V. During the 1970s, the 400 kV network, the new European standard, was implemented. In China, electrification began in the 1950s. In August 1961, the electrification of the Baoji-Fengzhou section of the Baocheng Railway was completed and delivered for operation, becoming China's first electrified railway. From 1958 to 1998, China's electrified railway reached 10,000 kilometers. As of the end of 2017, this number has reached 87,000 kilometers. In the current railway electrification system of China, State Grid Corporation of China is an important power supplier. In 2019, it completed the power supply project of China's important electrified railways in its operating areas, such as Jingtong Railway, Haoji Railway, Zhengzhou–Wanzhou high-speed railway, et cetera, providing power supply guarantee for 110 traction stations, and its cumulative power line construction length reached 6,586 kilometers. ==FeaturesGeneration=== Turbo generator Diagram of an electric power system, generation system in red Electricity generation is the process of generating electric power from sources of primary energy. For utilities in the electric power industry, it is the stage prior to its delivery (transmission, distribution, etc.) to end users or its storage (using, for example, the pumped-storage method). Electricity is not freely available in nature, so it must be \\"produced\\" (that is, transforming other forms of energy to electricity). Production is carried out in power stations (also called \\"power plants\\"). Electricity is most often generated at a power plant by electromechanical generators, primarily driven by heat engines fueled by combustion or nuclear fission but also by other means such as the kinetic energy of flowing water and wind. Other energy sources include solar photovoltaics and geothermal power. ===Transmission=== 500 kV Three-phase electric power Transmission Lines at Grand Coulee Dam; four circuits are shown; two additional circuits are obscured by trees on the right; the entire 7079 MW generation capacity of the dam is accommodated by these six circuits. Electric power transmission is the bulk movement of electrical energy from a generating site, such as a power plant, to an electrical substation. The interconnected lines which facilitate this movement are known as a transmission network. This is distinct from the local wiring between high- voltage substations and customers, which is typically referred to as electric power distribution. The combined transmission and distribution network is part of electricity delivery, known as the \\"power grid\\" in North America, or just \\"the grid\\". In the United Kingdom, India, Tanzania, Myanmar, Malaysia and New Zealand, the network is known as the National Grid. Efficient transmission involves reducing the currents by stepping up the voltage prior to transmission, and stepping it down at a substation at the far end. For AC power transmission the stepping up and down is done using transformers. A wide area synchronous grid, also known as an \\"interconnection\\" in North America, directly connects many generators delivering AC power with the same relative frequency to many consumers. For example, there are four major interconnections in North America (the Western Interconnection, the Eastern Interconnection, the Quebec Interconnection and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid). In Europe one large grid connects most of continental Europe. Historically, transmission and distribution lines were owned by the same company, but starting in the 1990s, many countries have liberalized the regulation of the electricity market in ways that have led to the separation of the electricity transmission business from the distribution business. ===Substations=== thumbupright=1.5Elements of a substation A: Primary power lines' side B: Secondary power lines' side 1\\\\.

This is showing three of the five 220 kV/66 kV transformers, as well as high-voltage transformer fire barriers, each with a capacity of 150 MVA. This substation is constructed using steel lattice structures to support strain bus wires and apparatus. A 115 kV to 41.6/12.47 kV 5 MVA 60 Hz substation with circuit switcher, regulators, reclosers and control building at Warren, Minnesota. This substation shows elements of low-profile construction; apparatus is mounted on individual columns. A substation is a part of an electrical generation, transmission, and distribution system. Substations transform voltage from high to low, or the reverse, or perform any of several other important functions. Between the generating station and consumer, electric power may flow through several substations at different voltage levels. A substation may include transformers to change voltage levels between high transmission voltages and lower distribution voltages, or at the interconnection of two different transmission voltages. Substations may be owned and operated by an electrical utility, or may be owned by a large industrial or commercial customer. Generally substations are unattended, relying on SCADA for remote supervision and control. The word substation comes from the days before the distribution system became a grid. As central generation stations became larger, smaller generating plants were converted to distribution stations, receiving their energy supply from a larger plant instead of using their own generators. The first substations were connected to only one power station, where the generators were housed, and were subsidiaries of that power station. 220 kV/110 kV/20 kV station in Germany ===Voltage === Grids are designed to supply electricity to their customers at largely constant voltages. This has to be achieved with varying demand, variable reactive loads, and even nonlinear loads, with electricity provided by generators and distribution and transmission equipment that are not perfectly reliable. Often grids use tap changers on transformers near to the consumers to adjust the voltage and keep it within specification. ===Topologies=== Transmission networks are complex with redundant pathways. For example, see the map of the United States' (right) high-voltage transmission network. Network diagram of a high voltage transmission system, showing the interconnection between the different voltage levels. This diagram depicts the electrical structure of the network, rather than its physical geography. The structure, or \\"topology\\" of a grid can vary depending on the constraints of budget, requirements for system reliability, and the load and generation characteristics. The physical layout is often forced by what land is available and its geology. Distribution networks are divided into two types, radial or network. The simplest topology for a distribution or transmission grid is a radial structure. This is a tree shape where power from a large supply radiates out into progressively lower voltage lines until the destination homes and businesses are reached. However, single failures can take out entire branches of the tree. Most transmission grids offer the reliability that more complex mesh networks provide. The expense of mesh topologies restrict their application to transmission and medium voltage distribution grids. Redundancy allows line failures to occur and power is simply rerouted while workmen repair the damaged and deactivated line. Other topologies used are looped systems found in Europe and tied ring networks. In cities and towns of North America, the grid tends to follow the classic radially fed design. A substation receives its power from the transmission network, the power is stepped down with a transformer and sent to a bus from which feeders fan out in all directions across the countryside. These feeders carry three-phase power, and tend to follow the major streets near the substation. As the distance from the substation grows, the fanout continues as smaller laterals spread out to cover areas missed by the feeders. This tree- like structure grows outward from the substation, but for reliability reasons, usually contains at least one unused backup connection to a nearby substation. This connection can be enabled in case of an emergency, so that a portion of a substation's service territory can be alternatively fed by another substation. ===Synchronous grid=== A synchronous grid or an \\"interconnection\\" is a group of distribution areas all operating with three phase alternating current (AC) frequencies synchronized (so that peaks occur at virtually the same time). This allows transmission of AC power throughout the area, connecting a large number of electricity generators and consumers and potentially enabling more efficient electricity markets and redundant generation. A large failure in one part of the grid—unless quickly compensated for—can cause current to re-route itself to flow from the remaining generators to consumers over transmission lines of insufficient capacity, causing further failures. One downside to a widely connected grid is thus the possibility of cascading failure and widespread power outage. A central authority is usually designated to facilitate communication and develop protocols to maintain a stable grid. For example, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation gained binding powers in the United States in 2006, and has advisory powers in the applicable parts of Canada and Mexico. The U.S. government has also designated National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors, where it believes transmission bottlenecks have developed. Some areas, for example rural communities in Alaska, do not operate on a large grid, relying instead on local diesel generators.Energy profile of Alaska, United States , Editor: Cutler J. Cleveland, Last Updated: July 30, 2008 - Encyclopedia of Earth ===Frequency=== In a synchronous grid all the generators must run at the same frequency, and must stay very nearly in phase with each other and the grid. For rotating generators, a local governor regulates the driving torque, maintaining constant speed as loading changes. Droop speed control ensures that multiple parallel generators share load changes in proportion to their rating. Generation and consumption must be balanced across the entire grid, because energy is consumed as it is produced. Energy is stored in the immediate short term by the rotational kinetic energy of the generators. Small deviations from the nominal system frequency are very important in regulating individual generators and assessing the equilibrium of the grid as a whole. When the grid is heavily loaded, the frequency slows, and governors adjust their generators so that more power is output (droop speed control). When the grid is lightly loaded the grid frequency runs above the nominal frequency, and this is taken as an indication by Automatic Generation Control systems across the network that generators should reduce their output. In addition, there's often central control, which can change the parameters of the AGC systems over timescales of a minute or longer to further adjust the regional network flows and the operating frequency of the grid. For timekeeping purposes, the nominal frequency will be allowed to vary in the short term, but are adjusted to prevent line-operated clocks from gaining or losing significant time over the course of a whole 24 hour period. An entire synchronous grid runs at the same frequency, neighbouring grids would not be synchronised even if they run at the same nominal frequency. High-voltage direct current lines or variable- frequency transformers can be used to connect two alternating current interconnection networks which are not synchronized with each other. This provides the benefit of interconnection without the need to synchronize an even wider area. For example, compare the wide area synchronous grid map of Europe with the map of HVDC lines. ===Interconnectors=== Electric utilities between regions are many times interconnected for improved economy and reliability. Electrical interconnectors allow for economies of scale, allowing energy to be purchased from large, efficient sources. Utilities can draw power from generator reserves from a different region to ensure continuing, reliable power and diversify their loads. Interconnection also allows regions to have access to cheap bulk energy by receiving power from different sources. For example, one region may be producing cheap hydro power during high water seasons, but in low water seasons, another area may be producing cheaper power through wind, allowing both regions to access cheaper energy sources from one another during different times of the year. Neighboring utilities also help others to maintain the overall system frequency and also help manage tie transfers between utility regions.. (2001). Glover J. D., Sarma M. S., Overbye T. J. (2010) Power System and Analysis 5th Edition. Cengage Learning. Pg 10. Electricity Interconnection Level (EIL) of a grid is the ratio of the total interconnector power to the grid divided by the installed production capacity of the grid. Within the EU, it has set a target of national grids reaching 10% by 2020, and 15% by 2030. ===Storage=== Simplified electrical grid with energy storage. Simplified grid energy flow with and without idealized energy storage for the course of one day. Grid energy storage (also called large-scale energy storage) is a collection of methods used to store electrical energy on a large scale within an electrical power grid. Electrical energy is stored during times when production (especially from intermittent power plants such as renewable electricity sources such as wind power, tidal power, solar power) exceeds consumption, and returned to the grid when production falls below consumption. , the largest form of grid energy storage is dammed hydroelectricity, with both conventional hydroelectric generation as well as pumped storage hydroelectricity. Developments in battery storage have enabled commercially viable projects to store energy during peak production and release during peak demand. Two alternatives to grid storage are the use of peaking power plants to fill in supply gaps and demand response to shift load to other times. ===Demand=== The demand, or load on an electrical grid is the total electrical power being removed by the users of the grid. The graph of the demand over time is called the demand curve. Baseload is the minimum load on the grid over any given period, peak demand is the maximum load. Historically, baseload was commonly met by equipment that was relatively cheap to run, that ran continuously for weeks or months at a time, but globally this is becoming less common. The extra peak demand requirements are sometimes produced by expensive peaking plants that are generators optimised to come on- line quickly but these too are becoming less common. ===Production=== The sum of the power outputs of generators on the grid is the production of the grid, typically measured in gigawatts (GW). The total energy produced is the integral of the power outputs, which is measured in gigawatt hours (GWh). ===Transmission losses=== It might be expected that demand and production might be equal, however, in practice power is lost in transmission lines and transformers in the transmission grid, so the demand plus the losses is equal to the production. Where power is being exported or imported to neighbouring grids that power is often considered as a demand or production respectively. ===Capacity and firm capacity=== The sum of the maximum power outputs (nameplate capacity) of the generators attached to an electrical grid might be considered to be the capacity of the grid. However, in practice, they are never run flat out simultaneously. Typically, some generators are kept running at lower output powers (spinning reserve) to deal with failures as well as variation in demand. In addition generators can be off-line for maintenance or other reasons, such as availability of energy inputs (fuel, water, wind, sun etc.) or pollution constraints. Firm capacity is the maximum power output on a grid that is immediately available over a given time period, and is a far more useful figure. ===Grid code=== Grid-connected equipment's behaviors are governed by a grid code which is a specification generally provided by the network operator. This ensures the grid stability and in particular specifies the correct behavior in off-nominal scenarios. ==FailureBrownout=== A brownout near Tokyo Tower in Tokyo, Japan A brownout is an intentional or unintentional drop in voltage in an electrical power supply system. Intentional brownouts are used for load reduction in an emergency.Steven Warren Blume Electric power system basics: for the nonelectrical professional. John Wiley & Sons, 2007 p. 199 The reduction lasts for minutes or hours, as opposed to short-term voltage sag (or dip). The term brownout comes from the dimming experienced by incandescent lighting when the voltage sags. A voltage reduction may be an effect of disruption of an electrical grid, or may occasionally be imposed in an effort to reduce load and prevent a power outage, known as a blackout.Alan Wyatt, Electric Power Challenges and Choices, The Book Press Limited, Toronto, 1986 page 63 ===Blackout=== A power outage (also called a power cut, a power out, a power blackout, power failure or a blackout) is a loss of the electric power to a particular area. Power failures can be caused by faults at power stations, damage to electric transmission lines, substations or other parts of the distribution system, a short circuit, cascading failure, fuse or circuit breaker operation, and human error. Power failures are particularly critical at sites where the environment and public safety are at risk. Institutions such as hospitals, sewage treatment plants, mines, shelters and the like will usually have backup power sources such as standby generators, which will automatically start up when electrical power is lost. Other critical systems, such as telecommunication, are also required to have emergency power. The battery room of a telephone exchange usually has arrays of lead–acid batteries for backup and also a socket for connecting a generator during extended periods of outage. ===Load shedding=== Electrical generation and transmission systems may not always meet peak demand requirements— the greatest amount of electricity required by all utility customers within a given region. In these situations, overall demand must be lowered, either by turning off service to some devices or cutting back the supply voltage (brownouts), in order to prevent uncontrolled service disruptions such as power outages (widespread blackouts) or equipment damage. Utilities may impose load shedding on service areas via targeted blackouts, rolling blackouts or by agreements with specific high-use industrial consumers to turn off equipment at times of system-wide peak demand. ===Black start=== Toronto during the Northeast blackout of 2003, which required black-starting of generating stations. A black start is the process of restoring an electric power station or a part of an electric grid to operation without relying on the external electric power transmission network to recover from a total or partial shutdown.Knight, U.G. Power Systems in Emergencies - From Contingency Planning to Crisis Management John Wiley & Sons 2001 section 7.5 The 'Black Start' Situation Normally, the electric power used within the plant is provided from the station's own generators. If all of the plant's main generators are shut down, station service power is provided by drawing power from the grid through the plant's transmission line. However, during a wide- area outage, off-site power from the grid is not available. In the absence of grid power, a so-called black start needs to be performed to bootstrap the power grid into operation. To provide a black start, some power stations have small diesel generators, normally called the black start diesel generator (BSDG), which can be used to start larger generators (of several megawatts capacity), which in turn can be used to start the main power station generators. Generating plants using steam turbines require station service power of up to 10% of their capacity for boiler feedwater pumps, boiler forced-draft combustion air blowers, and for fuel preparation. It is uneconomical to provide such a large standby capacity at each station, so black-start power must be provided over designated tie lines from another station. Often hydroelectric power plants are designated as the black-start sources to restore network interconnections. A hydroelectric station needs very little initial power to start (just enough to open the intake gates and provide excitation current to the generator field coils), and can put a large block of power on line very quickly to allow start-up of fossil-fuel or nuclear stations. Certain types of combustion turbine can be configured for black start, providing another option in places without suitable hydroelectric plants.Philip P. Walsh, Paul Fletcher Gas turbine performance, John Wiley and Sons, 2004 , page 486 In 2017 a utility in Southern California has successfully demonstrated the use of a battery energy storage system to provide a black start, firing up a combined cycle gas turbine from an idle state. ==SizeWide area synchronous grid=== A wide area synchronous grid (also called an \\"interconnection\\" in North America) is an electrical grid at a regional scale or greater that operates at a synchronized frequency and is electrically tied together during normal system conditions. These are also known as synchronous zones, the largest of which is the synchronous grid of Continental Europe (ENTSO-E) with 667 gigawatts (GW) of generation, and the widest region served being that of the IPS/UPS system serving countries of the former Soviet Union. Synchronous grids with ample capacity facilitate electricity market trading across wide areas. In the ENTSO-E in 2008, over 350,000 megawatt hours were sold per day on the European Energy Exchange (EEX). Each of the interconnects in North America are run at a nominal 60 Hz, while those of Europe run at 50 Hz. Neighbouring interconnections with the same frequency and standards can be synchronized and directly connected to form a larger interconnection, or they may share power without synchronization via high-voltage direct current power transmission lines (DC ties), or with variable-frequency transformers (VFTs), which permit a controlled flow of energy while also functionally isolating the independent AC frequencies of each side. The benefits of synchronous zones include pooling of generation, resulting in lower generation costs; pooling of load, resulting in significant equalizing effects; common provisioning of reserves, resulting in cheaper primary and secondary reserve power costs; opening of the market, resulting in possibility of long term contracts and short term power exchanges; and mutual assistance in the event of disturbances. (See \\"Operation of Power Systems\\" link for title page and table of contents.) One disadvantage of a wide-area synchronous grid is that problems in one part can have repercussions across the whole grid. For example, in 2018 Kosovo used more power than it generated due to a row with Serbia, leading to the phase across the whole synchronous grid of Continental Europe lagging behind what it should have been. The frequency dropped to 49.996 Hz. This caused certain kinds of clocks to become six minutes slow. ===Microgrid=== A microgrid is a localized group of electricity sources and loads that normally operates connected to and synchronous with the traditional wide area synchronous grid (macrogrid), but can also disconnect to \\"island mode\\" – and function autonomously as physical and/or economic conditions dictate. In this way, a microgrid can effectively integrate various sources of distributed generation, especially renewable energy sources, and can supply emergency power, changing between island and connected modes. Control and protection are challenges to microgrids.\\"A Survey of Techniques for Designing and Managing Microgrids\\", IEEE PES GM 2015 ===Super grid=== One conceptual plan of a super grid linking renewable sources across North Africa, the Middle East and Europe. (DESERTEC) A super grid or supergrid is a wide-area transmission network that is intended to make possible the trade of high volumes of electricity across great distances. It is sometimes also referred to as a mega grid. Super grids can support a global energy transition by smoothing local fluctuations of wind energy and solar energy. In this context they are considered as a key technology to mitigate global warming. Super grids typically use High-voltage direct current (HVDC) to transmit electricity long distances. The latest generation of HVDC power lines can transmit energy with losses of only 1.6% per 1000 km. ==TrendsIncreasing electrification=== The number of people with access to grid electricity is growing. About 840 million people (mostly in Africa) had no access to grid electricity in 2017, down from 1.2 billion in 2010.Closing Sub- Saharan Africa’s Electricity Access Gap: Why Cities Must Be Part of the Solution ===Demand response=== Demand response is a grid management technique where retail or wholesale customers are requested or incentivised either electronically or manually to reduce their load. Currently, transmission grid operators use demand response to request load reduction from major energy users such as industrial plants. Technologies such as smart metering can encourage customers to use power when electricity is plentiful by allowing for variable pricing. ===Aging infrastructure=== Despite the novel institutional arrangements and network designs of the electrical grid, its power delivery infrastructures suffer aging across the developed world. Contributing factors to the current state of the electric grid and its consequences include: * Aging equipment – older equipment has higher failure rates, leading to customer interruption rates affecting the economy and society; also, older assets and facilities lead to higher inspection maintenance costs and further repair and restoration costs. * Obsolete system layout – older areas require serious additional substation sites and rights-of-way that cannot be obtained in the current area and are forced to use existing, insufficient facilities. * Outdated engineering – traditional tools for power delivery planning and engineering are ineffective in addressing current problems of aged equipment, obsolete system layouts, and modern deregulated loading levels. * Old cultural value – planning, engineering, operating of system using concepts and procedures that worked in vertically integrated industry exacerbate the problem under a deregulated industry.Willis, H. L., Welch, G. V., and Schrieber, R. R. (2001). Aging Power Delivery Infrastructures. Marcel Dekker, Inc. : New York. 551 pgs. * One countermeasure against cascading failures from exploding high-voltage transformers is high-voltage transformer fire barriers. ===Distributed generation=== With everything interconnected, and open competition occurring in a free market economy, it starts to make sense to allow and even encourage distributed generation (DG). Smaller generators, usually not owned by the utility, can be brought on-line to help supply the need for power. The smaller generation facility might be a home-owner with excess power from their solar panel or wind turbine. It might be a small office with a diesel generator. These resources can be brought on-line either at the utility's behest, or by owner of the generation in an effort to sell electricity. Many small generators are allowed to sell electricity back to the grid for the same price they would pay to buy it. As the 21st century progresses, the electric utility industry seeks to take advantage of novel approaches to meet growing energy demand. Utilities are under pressure to evolve their classic topologies to accommodate distributed generation. As generation becomes more common from rooftop solar and wind generators, the differences between distribution and transmission grids will continue to blur. In July 2017 the CEO of Mercedes-Benz said that the energy industry needs to work better with companies from other industries to form a \\"total ecosystem\\", to integrate central and distributed energy resources (DER) to give customers what they want. The electrical grid was originally constructed so that electricity would flow from power providers to consumers. However, with the introduction of DER, power needs to flow both ways on the electric grid, because customers may have power sources such as solar panels. ===Modernization=== Thirty-seven states plus the District of Columbia took some action to modernize electric grids in the first quarter of 2017, according to the North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center. The states did so to make electricity systems \\"more resilient and interactive\\". The most common actions that states took were \\"advanced metering infrastructure deployment\\" (19 states did this), smart grid deployment and \\"time-varying rates for residential customers\\". Legislatively, in the first quarter of the year 82 relevant bills were introduced in different parts of the United States. At the close of the quarter, most of the bills remained pending. For example, legislators in Hawaii introduced a bill that would create an energy storage tax credit. In California, the state Senate had a bill that would \\"create a new energy storage rebate program\\". In August 2018, Advanced Energy Economy (AEE) and Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions Forum (CRES Forum) published a policy paper that gave five recommendations on ways to modernize the U.S. electric power grid. These recommendations are to streamline the federal permit process for advanced energy projects; encourage grid planners to consider alternatives to investment in transmission; allow energy storage and energy efficiency to compete with additional energy generation; allow large customers to choose their own sources of electricity; and allow utilities and consumers to benefit from cloud computing software. ===Smart grid=== The smart grid would be an enhancement of the 20th century electrical grid, using two-way communications and distributed so-called intelligent devices. Two-way flows of electricity and information could improve the delivery network. Research is mainly focused on three systems of a smart grid - the infrastructure system, the management system, and the protection system.Smart Grid - The New and Improved Power Grid: A Survey; IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials 2011; X. Fang, S. Misra, G. Xue, and D. Yang; . The infrastructure system is the energy, information, and communication infrastructure underlying of the smart grid that supports: * Advanced electricity generation, delivery, and consumption * Advanced information metering, monitoring, and management * Advanced communication technologies A smart grid would allow the power industry to observe and control parts of the system at higher resolution in time and space.Alexandra Von Meier (2013). Electrical Engineer 137A: Electric Power Systems. Lecture 2:Introduction to Electric Power Systems, Slide 33. One of the purposes of the smart grid is real time information exchange to make operation as efficient as possible. It would allow management of the grid on all time scales from high- frequency switching devices on a microsecond scale, to wind and solar output variations on a minute scale, to the future effects of the carbon emissions generated by power production on a decade scale. The management system is the subsystem in smart grid that provides advanced management and control services. Most of the existing works aim to improve energy efficiency, demand profile, utility, cost, and emission, based on the infrastructure by using optimization, machine learning, and game theory. Within the advanced infrastructure framework of smart grid, more and more new management services and applications are expected to emerge and eventually revolutionize consumers' daily lives. The protection system of a smart grid provides grid reliability analysis, failure protection, and security and privacy protection services. While the additional communication infrastructure of a smart grid provides additional protective and security mechanisms, it also presents a risk of external attack and internal failures. In a report on cyber security of smart grid technology first produced in 2010, and later updated in 2014, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology pointed out that the ability to collect more data about energy use from customer smart meters also raises major privacy concerns, since the information stored at the meter, which is potentially vulnerable to data breaches, can be mined for personal details about customers.Nunez, Christina (December 14, 2012). \\"Who’s Watching? Privacy Concerns Persist as Smart Meters Roll Out \\". National Geographic. nationalgeographic.com. Retrieved 2018-03-16. In the U.S., the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and Title XIII of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 are providing funding to encourage smart grid development. The objective is to enable utilities to better predict their needs, and in some cases involve consumers in a time-of-use tariff. Funds have also been allocated to develop more robust energy control technologies.DOE Provides up to $51.8 Million to Modernize the U.S. Electric Grid System , June 27, 2007, U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) ===Grid defection=== As there is some resistance in the electric utility sector to the concepts of distributed generation with various renewable energy sources and microscale cogen units, several authors have warned that mass-scale grid defection is possible because consumers can produce electricity using off grid systems primarily made up of solar photovoltaic technology. The Rocky Mountain Institute has proposed that there may be widescale grid defection.The Economics of Grid Defection - Rocky Mountain Institute This is backed up by studies in the Midwest.Andy Balaskovitz Net metering changes could drive people off grid, Michigan researchers say - MidWest Energy News However, the paper points out that grid defection may be less likely in countries like Germany which have greater power demands in winter. ==Utilities and oligopoly== Due to the enormous capital outlays, utilities were a vertically integrated business throughout the 20th century owning the power generation, the (transmission) lines while also managing the bills (commercialization). Presently, technological progress has enabled individuals and groups to take on the functions that used to be the sole domain of the utility. Adding to the shift is the impact of aging infrastructure on reliability, security and performance factors.Aging And Unstable, The Nation's Electrical Grid Is 'The Weakest Link'. ==See also== * Grid connection * High-voltage transformer fire barriers * North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) * Rural Electrification Act ==References * Map of U.S. generation and transmission * U.S. electric system is made up of interconnections and balancing authorities, U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).

The team was part of the Dynamo Sports Club with players being provided by Uralochka which at the time had up to three teams competing in the Russian leagues and was the dominant Russian force in women's volleyball. Olga Fateeva was the first of these players, who came for the club's first season in 2002–03 at the second division. The club gained promotion by finishing second place in that season. The club's second season of existence (2003–04), marked its debut in the Super League, the country's highest league. For that season, young but experienced players such as Irina Tebenikhina, Marina Sheshenina, Elena Sennikova, Yelena Plotnikova, Natalia Vdovina and Yekaterina Gamova came from the Uralochka teams. That made the club very competitive, finishing the Super League as runners-up. The club had a disappointing season in 2004–05 when it finished sixth place. The following season (2005–06) results were better and the club finish third. In 2006, following a proposition between the Volleyball Federation of Russia and the Government of Kaliningrad, it was decided to relocate the team to Kaliningrad under the name , but the club continued to play its home matches at Moscow's Dynamo Sports Palace in the 2006–07, 2007–08, 2008–09, 2009–10 seasons. During that time the club's results were also not enough to compete for the titles, with the best finish coming as a 6th place in the 2006–07 season. By the time the club folded in May 2011, after a 12th place finish in the 2010–11 season, it had played a total of two matches in Kaliningrad (both in the 2007–08 season). The club also participated in European competitions without success. It played the CEV Cup (now called CEV Challenge Cup) twice (in 2004–05 and 2006–07) and the Top Teams Cup (now called CEV Cup) twice (in 2004–05 and 2005–06). ==Team squad== This was the club's last squad, from season 2010–2011. {  style=\\"width:100%;\\" - !

According to some recent prosopographical studies, he might have married a daughter (b. ca 480) of Sabinianus (ca 460 - after 505), consul in 505, and had Flavius Anastasius Paulus Probus Sabinianus Pompeius (ca 500 - after 517), consul in 517. He was a Monophysite and a friend of the monk Severus (who later became Patriarch of Antioch), whom Probus introduced to Anastasius when the former went to Constantinople, around 508. In 502 he was appointed consul by the East court. In 519, during the investigation around Peter of Apamea, he was cheered along with Hypatius. In 526 (when he had been probably appointed to the high office of magister militum, surely already a patricius) Probus was sent by the Emperor Justin I as the ambassador to the Huns; the emperor gave him money to hire Hunnic mercenaries to defend the Iberian region from the Persians, but Probus gave the money, with the consent of Justin, to the missionaries who worked among the Huns. In 528 he was accused of slandering Emperor Justinian I; brought to trial before the consistory, the Emperor tore up the documentation and forgave Probus. In January 532, Justinian faced a dangerous uprising, known to history as the Nika revolt. The rebels needed a candidate to the throne in opposition to Justinian, and Probus believed that, as a nephew of Anastasius, the people might choose him or one of his cousins, and for this reason he secretly withdrew from Constantinople. The rebels went to his house, near the port of Julian, and having not found him there, burned it; they then acclaimed Hypatius emperor. After quashing the revolt, Justinian executed Hypatius and banished Probus, confiscating their properties, but the following year he changed his mind and recalled Probus, restoring what was taken away. Probus was still alive in 542, when he leased one of his houses to John of Ephesus. == Bibliography == * Martindale, John R., e John Morris, \\"Fl.

He served in the Union Army during the American Civil War, enlisting at its beginning and rising to a general officer near the end. After the war, Catterson worked in the cotton market, law enforcement, politics, and farming. ==Early life== Catterson was born in 1835 on a farm near Beech Grove in Marion County, Indiana. He was the son of an Irish immigrant, but his father died in 1840 when Robert was only five years old. Catterson's education began at Adrian College in Michigan, and then he attended Cincinnati Medical College in Ohio, precursor to the University of Cincinnati Academic Health Center. After completing his medical studies, Catterson established a medical practice in Rockville, Indiana, just prior to the start of the American Civil War.Warner, p. 75. ==Civil War service== When the American Civil War began in 1861, Catterson chose to follow the Union cause. He gave up his medical practice and volunteered to serve in the Union Army, enlisting in the 14th Indiana Infantry Regiment. On April 23 Catterson was mustered in as a private into Company A of the 14th, and on June 7 was promoted to first sergeant.

He then became commander of the Arkansas Negro militia under Governor Powell Clayton, engaged in fighting against the Ku Klux Klan members operating there, and also as a United States Marshal. During Clayton's successful political run for the U.S. Senate, Catterson was removed as marshal when he lost the favor of Clayton, and replaced by Isaac Mills.Warner, p. 76. \\"But he later fell out with Clayton during the latter's successful campaign for the U.S. Senate, and as a result lost his position of United States marshal.\\" He would later command the Brooks forces, during the Brooks–Baxter War.

A paramilitary force, it also played a significant part in politics from its establishment in 1910 during the Qajar dynasty until the advent of the Pahlavi dynasty in 1921. It continued to serve until the end of the Pahlavi era and was modernized into the Imperial Iranian Gendarmerie.The Making of Modern Iran, page 49 Originally established as a constitutional army, the force employed Swedish officers in command of Iranian personnel to perform both traditional police duties and conduct military campaigns against tribal forces. In 1991 the Iranian Gendarmerie was merged with other police forces to form the Law Enforcement Force of Islamic Republic of Iran. ==History== Throughout the nineteenth century military modernization was a constant preoccupation of Iranian reformers and the history of the Qajar period is peppered with attempts to create a standing army on the European model. As a neutral choice between Britain and Russia, the Persians chose Sweden to be given the task to secure their trade routes and unify the country. On 15 August 1911, the Swedish Major Harald Hjalmarson was given the rank of General and put in command of the Persian Gendarmerie. Many other officers, often recruited from the Swedish nobility, would come to follow in Hjalmarson's footsteps. During the Persian Campaign of the First World War the officers of the Swedish Gendarmerie, who like most of the Iranian intelligentsia and constitutionalists were sympathetic towards Germany, helped the Central Powers. At one point in autumn 1915 they seized control of Shiraz with the connivance of the German-trained provincial governor Mehdi-Qoli Mokhber'ol Saltaneh Hedayat.Sykes vol.II. 444- 446 After the 1921 coup d'état the War Minister Reza Khan merged the two viable military forces which existed in Iran at that point i.e. the Cossack division and the Gendarmerie; to create the modern Iranian national army. A rural police, amnieh, was created and the nazmieh or the police force was also revamped and placed under Iranian officers.Aqeli, Roozshomari, vol. II., pp. 164–8 The disbanding of the Swedish Gendarmerie would greatly weaken the Qajar monarchy and with the Persian Cossack Brigade being the only remaining army unit, it greatly facilitated Reza Shah’s coup in 1921. Hjalmarson would return to Sweden and take command of the volunteer Swedish Brigade serving on the White side in the Finnish Civil War.

In 1992 it was merged with the Shahrbani (Persian: , Šahrbānī) and the Islamic Revolutionary Committees (Persian: , Komīte) into a single national law enforcement force. ===Organisation=== The Gendarmerie's purpose was to guard the frontiers and the interior. It consisted of a number of battalions, each of 4 to 6 companies. For discipline and administrative purposes, the corps was under the supervision of the general officer commanding the division in whose area it was stationed. For police administration work, it came under local civil authorities. The force was armed with old pattern rifles of various makes plus some Soviet, French and British carbines, but not many modern. It consisted of a total of 7 Independent Mixed Regiments and 15 Mixed Battalions, forming a Corps.Unknown Armies vol.2, Persia/Iran by Peter Abbott, Raider Books (1989) Commanders {  - ! Name !

When a second color is used, it is usually red. Even if only a single type of blue ink was used, variations in lightness and darkness (value) could be achieved by superimposing multiple printings of parts of the design or by the application of a gradation of ink to the wooden printing block (bokashi). The development of aizuri-e was associated with the import of the pigment Prussian blue from Europe in the 1820s.Henry D Smith II, \\"Hokusai and the Blue Revolution in Edo Prints\\", in John T.

It was more vivid, had greater tonal range and was more resistant to fading.Philip McCouat, \\"Prussian blue and its partner in crime\\", Journal of Art in Society, http://www.artinsociety.com It proved to be particularly effective in expressing depth and distance, and its popularity may have been a major factor in establishing pure landscape as a new genre of ukiyo-e print.Timothy Clark, 100 Views of Mount Fuji, The British Museum Press, London, 2001, at 46 Early adopters included Hokusai in his Thirty Six Views of Mount Fuji (1830), most notably in The Great Wave off Kanagawa. Hiroshige also used Prussian blue extensively in his landscape prints. Other prominent Japanese artists to use it included Keisai Eisen, Utagawa Kunisada and Utagawa Sadahide. The theory that aizuri-e production was prompted by the 1842 sumptuary laws known as the Tenpō Reforms is no longer widely accepted.Newland, Amy Reigle. (2005).

Its members were: * John Camidge (1735–1803, in office 1756–1799) * John's son Matthew Camidge (1758 or 1764–1844, in office 1799-1842), as well as some psalm chants still in the Anglican repertoire, Matthew wrote \\"Six Concertos for the Organ or grand Piano Forte\\" * Matthew's son Dr John Camidge II (1790–1859, in office 1842-59) * John's son Thomas Simpson Camidge (1828–1913) * Thomas's son John Henry Norrison Camidge (1853–1939) *William Camidge, the son of John Camidge II, wrote a biography of William Etty. ==Individual members== John Camidge 1 (bap. 1734–1803) was a composer and organist of York Minster from 1756. He gave Matthew, the sixth son, his early musical training. John Camidge 2 (York 1790 – York 21 September 1859) was the grandson of JC1, and also organist of York Minster (1842–1848). He suffered a paralytic stroke while playing the organ in 1848 and never played again. Like his father and his grandfather, he is best known as a composer of chants. JC2 had one daughter and three sons, Charles, John, and Thomas Simpson (1828–1912). John and Thomas Simpson followed their father's profession. The latter, having acted as his father's deputy following his paralysis, went on to become organist of Hexham Abbey. His elder brother John briefly took over the post at York until Edwin George Monk was appointed in 1859. John Henry Norrison Camidge (1853–1939), a son of Thomas Simpson Camidge, was organist of Beverley Minster from 1876 until his death—the fifth generation in which the family produced an organist. Matthew Camidge (25 May 1758 – 23 October 1844 in York) was a well-known local musician in Northern England, famous for his organ playing and conducting oratorios. His compositions are solid in craftsmanship though quite conservative. He was the son of JC1 and Elizabeth Camidge, and the father of JC2. After some time as a chorister of the Chapel Royal under James Nares, Matthew returned to York where he lived the rest of his life. He served as his father's assistant and in 1799 he succeeded his father as organist of York Minster. He played an active part in the musical life of York, appearing as a soloist in piano and organ concertos and promoting music festivals in York Minster. After Matthew retired in 1842, his son, JC2, succeeded him as organist. Matthew married Mary Shaw of York in 1789. They had three sons. One, John, succeeded Matthew on his own retirement, and then passed on the post to his own son. Matthew's other sons took orders, and one of them became canon of York Minster. Matthew Camidge was known for his brilliant organ improvisations. He organized huge music festivals given at York in 1823, 1825, and later. As a violinist, he led the orchestra of the York Musical Society. He contributed 30 excellent hymn tunes for William Richardson's Collection of Psalms, which in later editions became widely known as The York Psalm and Hymn Book. It is likely that Camidge introduced the practice of psalm chanting to St Michael-le-Belfrey, his other church job, which he obtained in 1801. His sonatas, for piano with accompanying violin and cello, are very pleasant works, and representative of the better English music of the time, though not original. He frankly acknowledged, in the preface to his set of organ concertos published in 1817, that he was writing them in the \\"so long admired\\" style of Handel and Corelli. ~ Joseph Stevenson, All Music Guide Matthew Camidge published works of practical material written for his work as a church musician and teacher as well as anthems and service settings in Cathedral Music, Hymn and psalm tunes, an edition of Henry Lawes' Psalmody for a single voice, Instructions for the Piano forte or Harpsichord and some songs. ==Publications== * Matthew Camidge (c.1815) \\"Six Concertos for the Organ or grand Piano Forte composed and dedicated with greatest Respect to his much esteemed friend William Shield Esqr. by Matthew Camidge.

Hjelt studied chemistry in Finland and in Germany and became rector of the University of Helsinki in 1899. He opposed the increasing influence of Russia in the Grand Duchy of Finland and started his career in politics. Good connections to Germany created during his chemistry studies before and after his graduation made it possible for him to get military help during the Finnish Civil War. Hjelt organized the training of the Finnish Jäger troops in Germany. ==Early life and education== Hjelt was born in Vihti, Finland. He was the elder brother of August Hjelt. He studied chemistry at the University of Helsinki, and, like most of the chemists of the 19th century, went abroad to improve his education. From 1877 till 1878 he first studied with Johannes Wislicenus at the University of Würzburg, in 1879 with Emil Fischer, Emil Erlenmeyer and Adolf von Baeyer at the University of Munich. After returning to Helsinki he received his Ph.D, but Hjelt needed a second thesis to become a university professor. After another research stay in Germany at the University of Strassburg, working with Rudolph Fittig he prepared that second thesis and became professor for organic chemistry at the University of Helsinki. ==University rector== Hjelt served as vice rector of the University of Helsinki from 1896 till 1899 and as rector from 1899 till 1917. The political turmoil after the announcement of the February Manifesto of 1899 by Russian Emperor Nicholas II, which was meant to start a Russification of Finland and tie the Grand Duchy of Finland closer to the Russian empire, induced student demonstrations. The Russian authorities, especially the Finnish Minister Secretary of State Vyacheslav von Plehve and the Governor-General of Finland Nikolay Bobrikov, had to deal with the reactions of the people. Hjelt was able to reduce the pressure on the students and the university and also to stop aggressive reaction of the students to the oppression. With a short relieve after the defeat in the Russo-Japanese War the oppression continued. ==Political career== With the start of the First World War Hjeld saw a chance to gain independence from Russia after a defeat of Russia by Germany. Germany on the other hand would benefit from troop withdrawal from the frontline to deal with a Finnish uprising. His good relations with Germany allowed Hjelt to get in contact with leading military personnel to negotiate a German support for Finland. A small group of Finnish volunteers reached Germany via Sweden in 1915. Their training started in autumn 1915; at the end, the group of 2,000 men formed the 27th Jäger Battalion. This unit was the core of the Finnish White Guard during the Finnish Civil War (January to May 1918). On November 26, 1917 Hjelt, together with Adolf von Bonsdorff, met with General Erich Ludendorff and Marshal Paul von Hindenburg at the German army headquarters at Kreuznach to get more help for the coming civil war. Six German battalions landed in Hanko and helped the Finnish army to drive the Red Guards from most of their strongholds. Hjelt signed a peace treaty between Germany and Finland in Berlin on 7 March 1918. After the end of the civil war he signed a peace treaty with Austria-Hungary. He also searched for a king in the new, planned monarchy of Finland. His first suggestion was Adolf Friedrich, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, but after Prussian opposition Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse was chosen to become the King of Finland. After the victory of the Allied powers the idea of a monarchy was dropped and Kaarlo Juho Ståhlberg became first president of Finland. Hjelt's strong connections to Germany and his animosity against France, made him no longer suitable as diplomat after the First World War, in which Germany lost most of its influence to France, the United States and Great Britain. ==Works== * Geschichte der organischen Chemie von der ältesten Zeit bis zur Gegenwart : mit 3 Figuren .

The ordinal number given to the early Courtenay Earls of Devon depends on whether the earldom is deemed a new creation by the letters patent granted 22 February 1334/5 or whether it is deemed a restitution of the old dignity of the de Redvers family. Authorities differ in their opinions,Watson, in Cokayne, The Complete Peerage, new edition, IV, p.324 & footnote (c): \\"This would appear more like a restitution of the old dignity than the creation of a new earldom\\"; Debrett's Peerage however gives the ordinal numbers as if a new earldom had been created.

(ed.), Debrett's Peerage, Baronetage, Knightage and Companionage, Kelly's Directories Ltd, Kingston- upon-Thames, 1968, p.353) and thus alternative ordinal numbers exist, given here. ==Family== Edward Courtenay, born about 1357, was the elder of two sons of Sir Edward de Courtenay (d. between 2 February 1368 and 1 April 1371) and Emeline or Emme Dawnay (c.1329 - 28 February 1371), daughter and heiress of Sir John Dawney (d.1346/7) by Sybil Treverbyn. He succeeded to the earldom at the age of 20 at the death of his grandfather, Hugh Courtenay, 10th Earl of Devon, on 2 May 1377.; . Courtenay had a younger brother, Sir Hugh Courtenay of Haccombe and Bampton (after 1358 - 5 or 6 March 1425), who married successively Elizabeth Fitzpayn, Elizabeth Cogan, Philippa Arcedekne, and Maud Beaumont.; . ==Career== Sir John Dawney (d.1346/7) is said to have held 'fifteen large manors in Cornwall' which came to the Courtenay family through Edward Courtenay's marriage to Emeline Dawney.. In 1378 Courtenay proved his age, and had livery of the lands of his mother and his grandfather, the 10th Earl.. Like his ancestors, Courtenay was a soldier. He served in the Scottish wars and after some success was knighted in 1380 by the Earl of Buckingham. The following year King Richard II sent Courtenay as an emissary to escort his Queen Elizabeth of Bohemia from Gravelines harbour to London for her marriage. In 1383 he was appointed Admiral of the West, responsible for policing the seas off the coasts of Devon and Cornwall; his brother Sir Hugh Courtenay was a famed pirate. The Council believed that the Earl should protect the River Exe as French pirates had attempted several incursions into the Devonshire interior. Edward however was more of a soldier and relinquished his naval post. He was appointed to the King's Council which in 1395 attended Richard II in Westminster Hall. By 1400, the Earl was blind. He had probably contracted a disease such as leprosy or erysipelas which attacked the retina in his eyes. Courtenay died on 5 December 1419, directing in his will that he be buried at Forde Abbey. A 'magnificent monument' at Tiverton Castle, said to be his and destroyed about the end of the 16th century, bore the following inscription, according to Thomas Risdon's Survey of Devon (1630): > Ho, ho who lies here? > I, the good Earle of Devonshire, > And Mauld my wife that was full deare, > We lived together LV yeare. > That we spent we had: > That we gave we have: > That we left we lost.' > However, as Cokayne points out, this inscription is 'certainly far from contemporary' with the 11th Earl's death.. ==Marriage and children== Alabaster effigy of Elizabeth Courtenay (d.1471) in St Dubricius Church, Porlock, Somerset Drawing from 1890 of effigies in Church of St Dubricius, Porlock, of John Harington, 4th Baron Harington (d.1418) and his wife Elizabeth Courtenay (d.1471), daughter of Edward de Courtenay, 3rd Earl of Devon (d.1419) boar, which animals were used as heraldic supporters by the Courtenay Earls of Devon, serves as the footrest to the effigy of Elizabeth Courtenay at Porlock Church Courtenay married Maud Camoys, the daughter of Sir John de CamoysCokayne misidentifies her as the daughter of Thomas, Lord Camoys. of Gressenhall, Norfolk by his second wife, Elizabeth le Latimer, the daughter of William le Latimer, 3rd Baron Latimer..

After the jungle primary election, state treasurer Mary Landrieu went into a runoff election with State Representative Woody Jenkins of Baton Rouge, a former Democrat who had turned Republican two years earlier. She prevailed by 5,788 votes out of 1.7 million cast, the narrowest national result of the thirty-three races for the U.S. Senate that year and one of the closest election margins in Louisiana history. At the same time, Democrat Bill Clinton carried Louisiana by a considerable margin of 927,837 votes to 712,586 cast for Republican Bob Dole. ==Jungle primary elections== The multi-candidate field for the primary included Democratic state Attorney General Richard Ieyoub and David Duke, the former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, running again as a Republican. Among the minor candidates was Peggy Wilson, an at-large member of the New Orleans City Council, and Troyce Guice, who had sought the same seat thirty years earlier when it was held by the veteran Senator Allen J. Ellender. thumb275pxResults by parish ==Runoff election results== Certified Results After Recount -  colspan=5 Democratic hold - ===Allegations of election fraud=== Landrieu carried the Democratic stronghold of New Orleans by about 100,000 votes; in the days after the runoff election, Jenkins's campaign manager Tony Perkins alleged voting irregularities there. Jenkins refused to concede and claimed to have received many complaints about election fraud in New Orleans for incidents such as vote hauling and participation by unregistered voters. In April 1997, Jenkins appeared before the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate and petitioned for Landrieu's unseating pending a new election. In a party-line 8-7 vote, the Senate Rules Committee agreed to investigate the charges. Only a month into the probe, however, it emerged that Thomas \\"Papa Bear\\" Miller, a detective hired by Jenkins to investigate claims of fraud, had coached witnesses to claim they had participated in election fraud. Three witnesses claimed Miller had paid them to claim that they had either cast multiple votes for Landrieu or drove vans of illegal voters across town. The others told such bizarre tales that FBI agents dismissed their claims out of hand. It also emerged that Miller had several felony convictions on his record, including a guilty plea to attempted murder. The Democrats walked out of the probe in protest, but the probe continued. The investigation dragged on for over ten months, angering the Democrats and exacerbating partisan friction in the day- to-day sessions of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee to which Landrieu was assigned as a freshman member of the 105th Congress. Finally, in October 1997, the Rules Committee concluded that while there were major electoral irregularities, none of them were serious enough to burden Louisiana with a new election at that stage. It recommended that the results stand. The Landrieu-Jenkins contest was not the only U.S. Senate election in 20th century Louisiana in which the results were hotly disputed. In 1918, future Senator John H. Overton claimed the renomination and hence reelection of Senator Joseph E. Ransdell was tainted by fraud. In 1932, Senator Edwin S. Broussard claimed that his primary defeat by Overton was fraudulent. In both cases, the Senate seated the certified winners, Ransdell and Overton, respectively. == See also == * United States Senate elections, 1996 == References  * November 5, 1996 runoff results from Louisiana Secretary of State * Archive of stories from November 9, 1996 to June 28, 1997 about election dispute from The Advocate of Baton Rouge Category:1996 Louisiana elections Louisiana 1996 ","title":"1996 United States Senate election in Louisiana"},{"id":"20344856","text":"Platon Ivanovich Ivanov (surname Iivola from 1938 onward) (March 31, 1863 – November 15, 1939) was a Russian-Finnish civil servant.

In 2008, her writing revealed that scholarly and popular accounts regarding humans who display the personality traits of introversion and extraversion were flawed, and that, instead of representing a 25-30% of the population, introverts make up 57% of the population. The identified flaw was a dated reliance on the early work of Isabel Briggs Myers, and the failure to note results of the latest nationally representative surveys using the Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), a questionnaire used by psychologists to classify human personality traits. Helgoe discussed these findings in the book Introvert Power: Why Your Inner Life is Your Hidden Strength (Sourcebooks, 2008, 2013). In 2019, Helgoe explored the relationship between narcissism and American political and interpersonal discourse in her book Fragile Bully: Understanding Our Destructive Affair with Narcissism in the Age of Trump (Diversion Books, 2019). Paul L. Wachtel, Ph.D., distinguished professor at CCNY and integrative psychology theorist, noted that Helgoe's writing provides “seemingly effortless linkage between the intimately psychological and the broadly social and cultural” and that “[s]he probes the depth of individual experience, explores the dynamics of couples and families, and makes plain how all of this derives both from the powerful impact of our earliest experiences and from the equally powerful impact of our current interactions and current social and cultural context. In her hands, there is no contradiction in this complex web of causality, just a rich tapestry of interwoven threads that create a life.”Wachtel, P. L. (2019). Foreword. In L. Helgoe, Fragile Bully: Understanding Our Destructive Affair with Narcissism in the Age of Trump. == Biography == Helgoe was born in 1960 in Billings, Montana. Her father is a Lutheran Minister; her mother was a homemaker. Raised as the ninth of ten children, she was surrounded by gregarious siblings and sought out solitude, reflection and writing to replenish her energy. This early discovery of the power of solitude had a profound influence on her later work. She was educated at Gustavus Adolphus College, St. Peter, Minnesota, and the University of Nevada, Reno. She is married and has two sons. Dr. Helgoe is an Associate Professor of Behavioral Sciences at the Ross University School of Medicine. Dr. Helgoe served as a Clinical Assistant Professor at the West Virginia University School of Medicine, and was an Assistant Professor of Psychology and Social Sciences Division Chair at Davis & Elkins College. Dr. Helgoe authors a blog for PsychologyToday.com entitled Introvert Power: Food for the Inner Life. She connects with readers through the Introvert Power and Fragile Bully pages on Facebook. == Notability == Publishers Weekly, an American publication which critiques new literature, awarded Helgoe's Introvert Power a starred review.

He served as a government minister, rising to Vice President of Madagascar. Rabemananjara was said to be the most prolific writer of his negritude generation after Senghor, and he had the first négritude poetry published. ==Early life== Rabemananjara was born in Maroantsetra in Antongil Bay in eastern Madagascar on 23 June 1913 of Betsimisarakan origin. He began his education on the island of Sainte Marie, but soon left to finish his studies at the seminary at Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar. In 1935-36 the Madagascan authorities prohibited any further publication of a monthly journal of young people of Madagascar, which he was responsible for. The magazine Revue des Jeunes de Madagascar had 10 issues.Jacques Rabemananjara, Lehman University English Translation The journal was an early example of political writing pre-dating later more well-known examples of négritude.Albert S. Gérard, European-language Writing in Sub-Saharan Africa, p.471, accessed 21 November 2008 ==Writing== Despite his leadership of the journal, Rabemanajara was chosen in 1939 to attend a commemoration in Paris for the 150th anniversary of the French revolution. Having travelled to Paris he was able to not only gain entry to the Sorbonne and took courses in administration, but also to get his first collection of poetry, On the Steps of the Evening, published. In Paris he met the Senagalese poet and politician Léopold Sédar Senghor and Alioune Diop who all participated in the important African studies journal Presence Africaine. The Surreptitious Speech, V. Y. Mudimbe, , accessed 21 November 2008] His early work dealt in classical alexandrian metre with the early history of Madagascar. His 1940 work Sur les marches du soir dealt with the forced exile of Queen Ranavalona III. She had been removed by the French colonial powers in 1897. Rabemananjara published his play Les dieux malgaches, the first modern Malagasy play in French, This play dealt with the pre-colonial past and with the coup that unseated King Radama II in 1863. ==Politics== After the war he also met Raset Ravoahangy who was a partner with Rabemananjara in the creation of the MDRM (Democratic Movement for the Renovation of Madagascar). He was elected to represent the Tamatave region in 1946 as the third member of the National Assembly from Madagascar.The Cambridge history of Africa 8, Desmond J. Clark, J. D. Fage, Roland Anthony Oliver et al., p675, accessed 21 November 2008 As a journalist at this time he interviewed Ho Chi Minh including his association with the Malagasy politician Jean Ralaimongo.Ho Chi Minh, Pierre Brocheux, Claire Duiker, accessed 21 November 2008 He was suspected of being involved in the instigation of the 1947 Malagasy Uprising, despite the fact that he had urged the rioters to be calm. He was arrested, and sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour. During his captivity he wrote the poems Antsa, Lamba and Antidote. Rabemanajara was eventually pardoned in 1956. Rabemananjara's freedom allowed him to attend the first International Congress of Black Writers and Artists in Paris. He was one of the main speakers and earned a place at the top table of this important conference which was funded by UNESCO and was still celebrated 50 years later.50th anniversary of the first International Congress of Black Writers and Artists , Harvard.edu, accessed 24 November 2008 He was exiled in France until Madagascar's independence in 1960. The new government under President Philibert Tsiranana asked him to join a number of ministries and take the post of Vice President. ==Later years== Rabemanajara was again exiled after the 1972 revolution, but this was his choice and he was not to return for 20 years.

Samberg (February 6, 1941 – July 14, 2020) was an American businessman. He founded Pequot Capital Management and served as the chief executive officer, president and chairman of the company. Samberg's flagship Pequot fund, started in 1986, netted 17.8percent over the life of the fund. After the fund closed, he managed his family office through Hawkes Financial. == Early life and education == Arthur Jay Samberg was born on February 6, 1941, to Rena Samberg, a clerical assistant, and Philip Samberg, an electrician. He grew up in the Bronx, four blocks from the Yankee Stadium. When he was eight years old, his family, including his younger brother, moved to Tenafly, New Jersey. Arthur grew to and loved playing basketball. He tried out for his high school basketball team every year and finally qualified in his senior year. The 1957 launch of Sputnik 1 had made a large impression on him. After graduating high school in 1958, he studied Aeronautics and Astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He earned his undergraduate degree in 1962 and worked at Lockheed Missiles and Space Company for three years as a satellite control systems engineer in Palo Alto, California. While at Lockheed, Samberg worked on the Polaris missile and, at the same time, he earned his M.S. from Stanford University but came to believe he would not make a good engineer. He became interested in the stock market and enrolled in the business school at Columbia University, earning his M.B.A. in 1967. == Career == Samberg began his career in the investment industry as an analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Co. in New York City. In 1970, he was the first professional hire at the start-up investment management company Weiss, Peck & Greer. He later assumed a partner role, and he additionally served on the management committee during his last five years with the firm. During his 15-year tenure, Weiss, Peck & Greer grew to $8billion in assets under management. In 1985, he became a founder and the president of Dawson–Samberg Capital Management, Inc., in Southport, Connecticut, where the following year they established the first Pequot hedge fund. In its first year, the fund lost 20 percent before becoming successful in subsequent years. In 1999, Samberg spun out his funds into the newly formed Pequot Capital Management, where Daniel C. Benton joined him as co-founder. By 2001, Pequot was the largest hedge fund globally with $15billion in assets under management. That year, he and Benton decided to split their hedge fund, each taking $7.5billion in assets. Samberg's firm kept Pequot as its name while Benton formed Andor Capital Management. Since joining in 2003, Samberg was a life member of the MIT Corporation and a member of its executive committee. He also served as chairman of the MIT Investment Management Company, sat on the board of the MIT Energy Initiative, and was on the dean's advisory council of the MIT School of Science. In 2004, the SEC began an investigation of Pequot's trading in the securities, including trades by funds for which Samberg was the portfolio manager. The SEC also involved the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. An area of focus of the investigations was Samberg's hiring of David Zilkha, who previously had been employed by Microsoft Corporation, and subsequent trading in Microsoft securities in 2001. In late 2006, the investigation was closed without filing any charges or taking other action, but was reopened in late December 2008. In May 2010, Pequot and Samberg resolved this matter by agreeing to a settlement whereby, without admitting or denying the allegations, Pequot and Samberg consented to be permanently enjoined from violating the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities law and to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties. As of 2008, Pequot managed approximately $5billion in assets and had over 150 employees worldwide, with offices in Connecticut, New York, California, and London. In 2009, Samberg decided to shut down Pequot Capital. He continued to manage his family's holdings through Hawkes Financial. His family firm was a lead investor in TAE Technologies, a company working towards a new source of clean energy, and Samberg served as chairman of company. == Philanthropy == In 2006, alongside fellow alumni Russell L. Carson and Henry R. Kravis, he donated a total of $45million to Columbia Business School; out of the total contribution, $25million was solely donated by Samberg. In 2012, Samberg and his wife, Rebecca, gave $25million to New York-Presbyterian/Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital. The donation made possible the Samberg Scholars in Children's Health Program, an initiative to recruit and train as many as 40 top scholars in pediatric medicine. == Personal life == Samberg was married to Rebecca Samberg. Their daughter, Laura Samberg Faino, is a director of the Samberg Family Foundation, a charitable trust founded to support Jewish education, health and housing in the New York area. Samberg died on July 14, 2020, at the age of 79. == References == Category:1941 births Category:2020 deaths Category:20th-century American businesspeople Category:21st-century American businesspeople Category:American Jews Category:American aerospace engineers Category:American chief executives of financial services companies Category:American financiers Category:American hedge fund managers Category:Businesspeople from New York City Category:Columbia Business School alumni Category:Engineers from New York City Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology people Category:People from the Bronx Category:Place of birth missing Category:Place of death missing Category:Stanford University alumni ","title":"Arthur J.

The great bulk of Richardson's first-class career came between 1920 and 1922, and indeed the 23 wickets he claimed in his debut season formed more than half his career aggregate, while the 15 matches he played in 1920 were exactly half his final tally. After a wicketless debut against Hampshire in May 1920, his next game was against Gloucestershire. He took nine wickets in the match, including what was to remain a career-best 6/48 in the second innings. After 1922 Richardson did not appear at first-class level again until 1926, when he played one match. He also turned out once in 1927 and twice in 1928. After that, he played occasionally at minor level for Gentlemen of Worcestershire, taking six wickets against Bromsgrove School in a single- innings game in 1929. ==NotesReferences== * * Category:English cricketers Category:Worcestershire cricketers Category:1894 births Category:1971 deaths ","title":"William Richardson (Worcestershire cricketer)"},{"id":"20345023","text":":For other people with a similar name, see Brendan Foster and Brandon Foster.

In Seattle, volunteers from the Emerald City Lights Bike Ride passed out over 200 sandwiches to the homeless. Inspired viewers took part in the \\"Stuff the Truck\\" food drive in Brenden's honor, filling seven trucks of groceries and $95,000 in cash to benefit the Northwest Harvest and Food Lifeline. ==Broader impact== Brenden's story also reached KOMO's sister station KATU (Portland, Oregon), which reported actions inspired by Brenden in Los Angeles, California and Pensacola, Florida, among other places. At the Union Rescue Mission in Los Angeles, for instance, over 2,500 meals have been served in Brenden's name. His advocacy for the homeless housed in tent cities continues to be remembered. A Vietnam War veteran from Kentucky who lost his leg in the war was so touched by the story, he gave Brenden his Purple Heart.

Sweden stands out with 70% of all flexifuel vehicles operating in the EU. BEST sites also evaluated both dedicated E85 pumps and flexifuel pumps and found very few problems. ===Ethanol-powered buses=== ED95-powered Scania OmniCity bus in Stockholm. The project included the demonstration of two types of bioethanol-powered buses, a diesel engine Scania bus running on ED95 (sugarcane ethanol plus an ignition improver) and a Dongfeng bus capable of running on both E100 and petrol (flexible-fuel bus). Fuel pumps were also installed at bus depots in the five participating cities. BEST demonstrated more than 138 bioethanol ED95 buses and 12 ED95 pumps at five sites, three in Europe, one in China and one in Brazil. These trials helped increase knowledge about bioethanol buses in the participating cities. An innovation within BEST was the demonstration of two dual-tank E100 buses developed by the Chinese vehicle producer Dongfeng Motor. All BEST sites will continue to drive their bioethanol buses in regular traffic and some cities are already planning to expand their fleets. The trial demonstrations showed that ethanol-powered ED95 buses: *reduce greenhouse gas emissions and local air pollution. *are reliable and appreciated by drivers and passengers. *cost more to purchase and operate than diesel buses. *require more scheduled maintenance than diesel buses. *Taxing fuel by volume instead of energy content penalises bioethanol buses. *ED95 can be safely handled at depots and has the potential for wider use in heavy vehicles such as trucks. Brazil President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden inspecting one of the 400 buses running on ED95 in Stockholm Under the auspices of the BEST project, the first ED95 bus began operations in São Paulo city in December 2007 as a trial project. The bus is a Scania with a modified diesel engine capable of running with 95% hydrous ethanol with 5% ignition improver. Scania adjusted the compression ratio from 18:1 to 28:1, added larger fuel injection nozzles, and altered the injection timing. During the first year trial period performance and emissions were monitored by the National Reference Center on Biomass (CENBIO - ) at the Universidade de São Paulo, and compared with similar diesel models, with special attention to carbon monoxide and particulate matter emissions. Performance is also important as previous tests have shown a reduction in fuel economy of around 60% when E95 is compared to regular diesel. In November 2009, a second ED95 bus began operating in São Paulo city. The bus was a Swedish Scania engine and chassis with a CAIO bus body. The second bus was scheduled to operate between Lapa and Vila Mariana, passing through Avenida Paulista, one of the main business centers of São Paulo city. CENBIO laboratory tests found that as compared to diesel, carbon dioxide emissions are 80% lower with ED95, particulate drops by 90%, nitrogen oxide emissions are 62% lower, and there are no sulphur emissions. During the trial was observed that the first bus began presenting sudden halts of the engine in slow running. The problem manifested more frequently in hot days, when the ambient temperature reached 26 °C or more and on top of long grades. After analyzing carefully the problem in the engine's fuel power line, it was discovered that the bus was developed for the European temperate climate, where average temperatures are lower than in tropical climate. In hotter days, the temperature of the fuel line reached up to 58 °C, a temperature that could increase even more when the engine would be slow running. The excessive heating was causing the vaporization of the fuel in the power line of the engine. The solution found was to deviate the fuel return from the engine straight to the tank, and thus, adapting the engine to Brazilian climate conditions. Report 2010-36-0130I Based on the satisfactory results obtained during the 3-year trial operation of the two buses, in November 2010 the municipal government of São Paulo city signed an agreement with UNICA, Cosan, Scania and Viação Metropolitana\\", a local bus operator, to introduce a fleet of 50 ethanol-powered ED95 buses by May 2011. The city's government objective is to reduce the carbon footprint of the city's bus fleet which is made of 15,000 diesel-powered buses, and the final goal is for the entire bus fleet to use only renewable fuels by 2018. The first ethanol-powered buses were delivered in May 2011, and the 50 ethanol- powered ED95 buses will begin regular service in June 2011. China In Nanyang, Henan, a new type of bioethanol flexible-fuel bus capable of running on petrol or neat ethanol fuel (E100) was developed by Dongfeng Motor. The buses look like conventional buses and have two fuel tanks, one for petrol and one for E100. Two buses were demonstrated by local bioethanol producer Tianguan, who also supplied E100 for the buses. One fuel pump was set up for the trial. One of the buses uses a modified petrol-engine and the other uses a modified natural gas engine. The new bus types were developed to overcome import duties and are a low-cost alternative for Chinese cities seeking to introduce bioethanol to their public transport systems. Each E100 bus developed by Dongfeng costs around , which is more expensive than a conventional petrol bus. Italy Three ED95 buses and one fuel pump was installed in La Spezia. Spain Five ED95 buses operated in Madrid and one fuel pump was installed. Sweden In Stockholm a total of 127 ED95 buses and five ED95 ethanol fuel stations were funded within the BEST project. ==See also== *Common ethanol fuel mixtures *Electric bus *Ethanol fuel * Ethanol fuel by country *Ethanol fuel in Brazil * Ethanol fuel in Sweden *Flexible-fuel vehicle *Fuel cell bus *Green vehicle *Hybrid electric bus *Neat ethanol vehicle ==References * BEST Europe home website (in English) * BEST project website in Brazil - CENBIO) (in Portuguese) * BEST project website in Italy (in Italian) * BEST project website in the Netherlands (in Dutch) * BEST project website in Spain (in Spanish) * Report: Results and recommendations from the European BEST project Category:Ethanol fuel Category:Flexible-fuel vehicles Category:Sustainable transport Category:Ethanol Category:Petroleum products Category:Vehicles by fuel ","title":"BioEthanol for Sustainable Transport"},{"id":"20345233","text":"Agrupación Deportiva Villaviciosa de Odón is a Spanish football team from Villaviciosa de Odón, in the Community of Madrid.

They include interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-12, and IL-18, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interferon gamma (IFNγ), and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and play an important role in mediating the innate immune response. Inflammatory cytokines are predominantly produced by and involved in the upregulation of inflammatory reactions. Excessive chronic production of inflammatory cytokines contribute to inflammatory diseases, that have been linked to different diseases, such as atherosclerosis and cancer. Dysregulation has also been linked to depression and other neurological diseases. A balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines is necessary to maintain health. Aging and exercise also play a role in the amount of inflammation from the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Therapies to treat inflammatory diseases include monoclonal antibodies that either neutralize inflammatory cytokines or their receptors. ==Definition== An inflammatory cytokine is a type of cytokine (a signaling molecule) that is secreted from immune cells and certain other cell types that promotes inflammation. Inflammatory cytokines are predominantly produced by T helper cells (Th) and macrophages and involved in the upregulation of inflammatory reactions. Therapies to treat inflammatory diseases include monoclonal antibodies that either neutralize inflammatory cytokines or their receptors. Inflammatory cytokines include interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-12, and IL-18, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interferon gamma (IFNγ), and granulocyte- macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). == Function == Inflammatory cytokines play a role in initiating the inflammatory response and to regulate the host defence against pathogens mediating the innate immune response. Some inflammatory cytokines have additional roles such as acting as growth factors. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α also trigger pathological pain. While IL-1β is released by monocytes and macrophages, it is also present in nociceptive DRG neurons. IL-6 plays a role in neuronal reaction to an injury. TNF-α is a well known proinflammatory cytokine present in neurons and the glia. TNF-α is often involved in different signaling pathways to regulate apoptosis in the cells. Excessive chronic production of inflammatory cytokines contribute to inflammatory diseases. that have been linked to different diseases, such as atherosclerosis and cancer. Dysregulation of proinflammatory cytokines have also been linked to depression and other neurological diseases. A balance between proinflammatory and anti- inflammatory cytokines is necessary to maintain health. Aging and exercise also play a role in the amount of inflammation from the release of proinflammatory cytokines. == Negative impacts == Due to its proinflammatory action, a proinflammatory cytokine tends to make the disease itself or the symptoms correlated to a disease worse by causing fever, inflammation, tissue destruction, and in some cases, even shock and death. Excessive amounts of proinflammatory cytokines have been shown to cause detrimental effects === In the kidney === A proinflammatory cytokine affects functions of transporters and ion channels from the nephron. As a result, there is a change in the activity of the potassium ion (K+) channels that changes the transepithelial transport of solutes and water in the kidney. The kidney proximal tubule cells produce proinflammatory cytokines in response to lipopolysaccharide. Proinflammatory cytokines affect the renal K+ channels. IFNγ causes delayed suppression and acute stimulation of the 40 pS K+ channel. Also, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) activates the calcium-activated potassium channel (KCa3.1) which could be involved the detrimental effects of renal fibrosis. === Graft-vs-host disease === Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) targets JAK 1 and 2, the human tyrosine kinase protein required for signaling in multiple cytokines. When these kinases are activated, signal proteins of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein family - which include transcription factors for target genes that serve proinflammatory roles - are phosphorylated. The severity of GvHD is highly variable and is influenced by the amount of native cells present in the environment along with other regulatory T cells, TH1, TH2, or TH17 phenotypes. Both CD4+ and CD8 IL-17 producing T cells have been shown to cause aTH1, causing tissue inflammation and resulting in severe GVHD. === In cystic fibrosis === A proinflammatory cytokine causes hyperinflammation, the leading cause of lung tissue destruction in cystic fibrosis. With such a strong inflammatory response and an elevated number of immune cells, lungs of cystic fibrosis patients cannot clear the bacteria and become more susceptible to infections. A high prevalence (40-70%) of patients with cystic fibrosis show signs of asthma, possibly due to the primary deficiency in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CFTR-deficient T-helper cells create an inflammatory environment that has high concentrations of TNF-α, IL-8, and IL-13, which contributes to increased contractility of airway smooth muscle. === In cardiovascular disease === Atherosclerosis induces a dysfunctional endothelium, which recruits immune cells that form lesions. Proinflammatory mediators cause inflammation after ligands in the heart vasculature activate immune cells. Recent studies have shown the ability of exercise to control oxidative stress and inflammation in cardiovascular disease. === In adipose tissue metabolism and obesity === A proinflammatory cytokine may be present in adipose tissues. Adipocytes generate TNF-α and other interleukins. Cytokines derived from adipose tissue serve as remote regulators such as hormones. Studies have shown that TNF-α and IL-6 concentrations are elevated in obesity. Obesity leaves an excess of nutrients for the body, thereby causing adipocytes to release more proinflammatory cytokines. Classically activated macrophages in the visceral fat accumulate in the fat tissues and continuously release proinflammatory cytokines, causing chronic inflammation in obese individuals. === In osteoarthritis === TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6 have been found to play a pivotal role in cartilage matrix degradation and bone resorption in osteoarthritis. Animal studies indicate that inflammatory cytokines may stimulate chondrocytes to release cartilage- degrading protease in osteoarthritis. This finding does not, however, necessarily translate to Homo sapiens, as osteoarthritis in humans is considered to be more complex than any animal model. == Clinical implications == Reducing the biological activity of proinflammatory cytokine can reduce the brunt of attack from diseases. Blocking IL-1 or TNF-α has been highly successful in helping patients with rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, or graft-vs-host disease (GvHD). However, the strategy has not yet been successful in humans with sepsis. Therapeutic effects of acupuncture may be related to the body's ability to suppress a range of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), IL-1B, IL-6, and IL-10. Estrogen has been shown to promote healing by decrease the production of various proinflammatory cytokines like IL-6, TNF-α, and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). Increased MIF levels are often found at the site of chronic non-healing ulcers, with those levels dropping significantly with successful healing. A 2005 review of current experimental data shows that \\"estrogen regulates healing almost exclusively via MIF down-regulation and identifies novel MIF-regulated gene targets and clusters associated with aberrant healing.\\" By down-regulating MIF, estrogen can promote healing, as correlated by clinical studies on aging skin and skin wounds. Unfortunately, estrogen-therapy has known carcinogenic effects as mentioned by the American Cancer Society (increased incidences of breast cancer in women who undergo HRT). However, scientists could make important discoveries in the future by studying \\"downstream effects on genes/factors that mediate the effects of estrogen on healing.\\" Histone deacetylate inhibitors (HDACi) can suppress proinflammatory cytokine production and reduce GvHD. == References == Category:Cytokines ","title":"Inflammatory cytokine"},{"id":"20345290","text":"Lol (also known as Lot) is a populated place in Dordogne, Aquitaine, France.GEOnet Names Server (GNS) ==See also== *Saint-Laurent-des-Bâtons *Sainte-Alvère *Sainte-Foy-de-Longas ==References== Category:Geography of Dordogne ","title":"Lol, Dordogne"},{"id":"20345291","text":"Captive () is a 2003 Argentinian film that concerns itself with what happened to the children of the people killed after the 1970s military coup.

It is also known for its challenging weather conditions above the treeline, which can be a problem for hikers who can lose sight of trails. The trail is recognized as one of the best backpacking trails in the Canadian Rockies. With 25 km of the total 44.1 km of the trail at or above the treeline, it has views of the surrounding mountains and valleys. It is normally hiked over two days from Maligne Lake to the bottom of Signal Mountain, but it alternatively may be hiked at a more moderate pace over 3 to 4 days. It is recommended to hike the trail south to north from Maligne Lake, as the fire road descending to Signal Mountain on the north end is an 800m elevation loss. There are three challenging passes to conquer, including the highest section of trail in Jasper National Park. There are campgrounds at 5 km, 8 km, 12 km, 19 km, 30 km, and 35 km (Evelyn Creek, Little Shovel, Snowbowl, Curator, Tekarra, and Signal respectively). The campgrounds have tent pads, picnic tables, bear poles with metal cables and connectors and toilets. Hikers must bring their own stoves as campfires are banned. Camping is only permitted at the designated campgrounds, which must be reserved in advance. Visitors are recommended to book sites as early as possible, as the Skyline Trail is one of the busiest backpacking trails in the Rockies. ==Route== There are two main ways to enter the Skyline Trail. The majority of visitors opt for the main trail; from the parking lot at Maligne Lake, the hike begins with a gentle walk through the forest past Lorraine and Mona Lakes, before crossing the Evelyn Creek bridge to the campground. The second option, adding 4 km and 500m of elevation gain, is to climb the Bald Hills by using a well-established short cut for a view of Maligne Lake before heading down the fireroad and joining the trail to the Evelyn Creek bridge. Evelyn Creek campground is a camping spot in the forest adjacent to the creek, but it is recommended that it be passed over for campgrounds at higher elevations. Following Evelyn Creek Campground the trail climbs to Little Shovel Pass. Because the campground after Little Shovel, Snowbowl, is heavily used, if possible Little Shovel Campground is an option for an overnight stay, especially as it is situated part way up Little Shovel Pass so it offers a respite from the steady climb. From Little Shovel Campground, the trail breaks out of the trees into the upper subalpine, continuing its climb to Little Shovel Pass at 10 km. Entering the Snowbowl, the Skyline Trail can be seen meandering through open meadows until it enters the trees wherein the Snowbowl Campground is sheltered. Snowbowl is as popular in winter as it is in summer, and it contains a small cabin called Shangrila, built by guide, Donald \\"Curly\\" Phillips, in 1936 for skiing enthusiasts. The cabin, administered by the Maligne Lake Ski Club, is not available to summer hikers. From Snowbowl Campground, the ascent rises through flower-filled meadows to Little Shovel Pass at 17 km. Crossing into the Curator Basin, the trail swings right, past the junction with the Watchtower Trail. A 4 km descent into this valley leads to the Watchtower Campground, an option as Curator Campground is heavily used and often fully booked. Returning to the trail section in the Curator Basin, the Skyline Trail continues to the Wabasso Creek Trail junction at 19 km. Less than 1 km further along this trail is Curator Campground. A little further still is Shovel Pass Lodge, which does allow use by hikers; more frequently, however, horse trips use this lodge as a waypoint. Both the Watchtower and Wabasso trails are good foul weather escape routes off the Skyline, which as mentioned can be necessary as the weather along the Skyline Trail can be treacherous. Beyond the Wabasso junction the Skyline Trail passes Curator Lake then makes a sudden, steep ascent to the Notch at 22 km the highest point on the Skyline at 2511m. The next 4 km of the trail are along the crest of the Maligne Range, which is exposed to both mountain views and to mountain weather. The descent to Tekarra Campground follows a trail through rocky valley with Mount Tekarra on the left and Excelsior on the right. Centre Mountain dominates the head of the valley, lending its name to the creek and lakes below. Following Lower Centre Lake, the trail enters Tekarra Campground at 30 km. From Tekarra Campground, the trail crosses Centre Creek and borders the shoulders of Tekarra and Signal Mountains to the junction with the Signal Mountain Fire road. The fire road climbs uphill for 1 km to the old Signal Mountain fire lookout site, which is recommended if time and energy allow. Descending to the right, the fire road passes the junction into Signal Campground, then quickly descends further into the forest for the final leg of the trip. 800m of vertical are surrendered over the final 9 km. The Maligne Lake Shuttle offers frequents trips back to the Maligne Lake Parking Lot for those without two vehicles, but as they are often busy reservations should be made. ==Wildlife== The Skyline Trail is the home range of mammalian species that stand today as icons inhabiting the mountain wilderness or near this area of the park which are the timber wolf, black bear, coyote, grizzly bear, moose, white-tailed deer, bighorn sheep, marten, pika, mountain goat, lynx, marmot, mule deer, porcupine, beaver, elk, wolverine, and cougar. Raptors that inhabit in the trail's forest are great grey owls, golden eagles, great horned owls, and bald eagles. The trail has recently been recognized as critical woodland caribou habitat. The Boreal woodland Caribou is a threatened Species- at-Risk in Canada. In an attempt to reduce stressors, Parks Canada has banned dogs from all Caribou habitat in Jasper National Park. ==History== In 1911 Jack Otto guided Mary Schaffer to Little Shovel Pass on the way to her survey of Maligne Lake. Their party found the way blocked by snow, and dug their way through the pass using shovels fashioned from trees. The shovels were left behind and Mary named the pass \\"Shovel Pass.\\" The shovels are now displayed at the museum in Jasper. ==References== Category:Hiking trails in Alberta Category:Jasper National Park ","title":"Skyline Trail (Jasper National Park)"},{"id":"20345321","text":"Ituzaingó, 2004. Roberto Escobar (born 1927 in Buenos Aires) and Igón Lerchundi (born 1934 in Basque Country) were pioneers in the art of miming in Argentina and in Latin America. In 1959 they both founded the \\"Compañía Argentina de Mimos\\" (Argentine Mime Company) and toured around many countries in America and Europe. They later participated in the First International Pantomime Festival, which took place in Berlin in 1962, along with the most renowned mimes in the world (Marcel Marceau, Kabuki from Tokyo, etc.) Based on their success in this Festival they organized a long tour throughout Europe. At that time they had the opportunity to study in Paris with Etienne Decroux, the creator of 20th-century miming. Throughout their long careers they have obtained innumberable national and international awards. In 1973 they created the \\"Mimoteatro Escobar-Lerchundi\\" (Escobar-Lerchundi Mimetheatre), the only theatre dedicated to miming in America and one of the few in the world. Their Miming School is located at this theatre, in the traditional San Telmo district, where they receive students from all over the country and the world. == External links == *Escobar-Lerchundi Theatre *Igón Lerchundi at the Internet Movie Data Base *Konex Foundation 1991 (Spanish) Category:Argentine male film actors Category:People from Buenos Aires ","title":"Roberto Escobar and Igón Lerchundi"},{"id":"20345327","text":"Michael Evan Bloom (born April 5, 1975 in Manhasset, New York) is an American singer-songwriter, producer, multi-instrumentalist, and mixerhttps://www.allmusic.com/album/verdugo-mw0003155509/credits who has performed, produced or recorded with artists such as Rilo Kiley, Jenny Lewis, Julian Casablancas,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cru1TWtjXIc Johnathan Rice, Margot & the Nuclear So and So's, Rachael Yamagata, and was a co-founder of The Elected.https://www.theaquarian.com/2011/06/23/interview-with-blake- sennett-from-the-elected-stepping-back-into-the-light/ Bloom plays guitar, bass, lap steelhttps://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2902-sun-sun-sun/ guitar, keys, drums, banjo, and harmonica.

It was named Beis Aharon (House of Aaron) after a work authored by Rabbi Aharon II Perlow of Karlin (1802–1872). After it was destroyed during the 1948 Israel War of Independence, a new centre was established in Jerusalem's Beis Yisrael neighbourhood. * Chesed El Synagogue, a synagogue located on Chabad Street in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem. It was established by immigrants from Iraq in 1853 and served as a centre for Jews of Iraqi descent living in Jerusalem. It also served as a yeshiva for kabbalists and had a famous library of Kabbalistic works. The synagogue was active until the fall of the Jewish Quarter during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War when it was taken over by an Arab family. After the Six-Day War the building became the centre of Bnei Akiva and didn't revert to use as a synagogue.Jerusalem Quartered: The 'Armenian' Quarter, by Rabbi Yakov Goldman * \\"Tiferet Yisrael Synagogue\\" has been destroyed in 1948, but, as of 2019, is in the process of being rebuilt, much like the Hurva Synagogue. * Yanina Synagogue, a Romaniote synagogue established by the Jews of Ioannina, Greece. It was located in the Christian Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem. The community also has a synagogue in the \\"new city\\", located in the Ohel Moshe neighborhood of Nahlaot. ==Active synagogues Old City - Armenian Quarter === Orthodox Judaism *Ari Synagogue *Ohr ha-Chaim Synagogue ===Old City - Jewish Quarter=== Orthodox Judaism Hurva Synagogue Menachem Zion Synagogue Tzemach Tzedek Synagogue *Beit El Synagogues: there are two with this name in Jerusalem, along with the Yeshivat HaMekubalim school of Kabbalah. One is located in the Jewish Quarter, but another one, continuing the same pre-1948 tradition and functioning under the same name (Beit El Synagogue and Yeshivat HaMekubalim), is located in the Ruhama neighbourhood of West Jerusalem. * Four Sephardic Synagogues: **Yochanan ben Zakai Synagogue, also Rabban Yochanan ben Zakai Synagogue and Kahal Kadosh Gadol **Istanbuli Synagogue **Eliahu Ha'navi Synagogue, aka Kahal Talmud Torah **Emtsai or Middle Synagogue, aka Kahal Tzion Synagogue * Hurva Synagogue (English: Ruined Synagogue) is the currently largest synagogue in the Jewish Quarter. It was originally intended for construction in the 18th century. A small building was constructed, but due to financial difficulties, the intended larger building was not completed. The building was destroyed by an earthquake, and a second attempt to build a large synagogue was blocked by Arab landowners in the early 19th century failed. In the 1830s, multiple small synagogues were built around the site. In the 1860s, the large synagogue was completed. It was destroyed by the Jordanians following the 1948 Israeli War of Independence. The synagogue was rebuilt in 2010 and is a distinguished feature of Jerusalem's Old City skyline. * Menachem Zion Synagogue, completed in 1837. Built by the Perushim, it was named after their leader Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Shklov and after the blessing of consolation recited on Tisha B'Av: \\"Blessed be He who consoles (menachem) Zion and rebuilds Jerusalem.\\" Rabbi Daniel Sperber leads the congregation. *Ramban Synagogue, the oldest Rabbinic synagogue of the Jewish Quarter * Tzemach Tzedek Synagogue * Tzuf Dvash Synagogue, a Sephardic synagogue which was founded in 1860 *Western Wall, the holiest Jewish site alongside the Temple Mount, functions as a synagogue including the area beneath Wilson's Arch.

Agnon\\". * Zoharei Chama Synagogue, on Jaffa Road The Talpiot neighborhood in Jerusalem was established immediately after World War I. Its planners' intention was to make it into the capital city of the nascent State of Israel. The first synagogue in the neighbourhood was in a hut, which was established to serve as a structure for the builders of the neighbourhood and after the completion of the construction was converted into a mixed Ashkenazi and Sephardic synagogue. Among the first worshipers of the minyan in the hut was the writer Shmuel Yosef Agnon, who lived in the neighbourhood. He described the hut and how the prayer was conducted in it in the short story \\"The Symbol\\" (The Fire and the Trees), Tel Aviv Press 1961. The cornerstone of the current building was laid in Chanukah 1934, in the presence of Rabbi Avraham Yitzhak HaCohen Kook. With the outbreak of the 1936–1939 riots, the construction of the synagogue was delayed and the structure remained neglected. After the outbreak of World War II in 1939 the British confiscated the building and established in it a police station and a warehouse. After the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, during the period when Talpiot was a transit camp (ma'abara), the State used the building as a warehouse of equipment for the transit camp. In the 1950s the building was leased to the Hebrew University and served as a warehouse of its medical school. In the late 1960s the building returned to the Jerusalem municipality, who renovated the building with the assistance of the Jerusalem Foundation and with a contribution received from author S. Y. Agnon, a resident of the neighbourhood, out of the money he received for the Nobel Prize. In the month of Elul 5772 (1972) the synagogue was again inaugurated in a procession where the Torah scrolls from the hut were brought in.The synagogue's Hebrew-language website * Yad Tamar Synagogue, Rehavia * Yakar Synagogue, Old Katamon neighborhood, including the Yakar Center for Social Concern and the Center for Arts and Creativity--Anglo and Israeli congregation * Yeshurun Synagogue, King George Street Conservative Judaism * Conservative Yeshiva * Schechter Institute of Jewish Studies Reconstructionist Judaism * Mevakshay Derekh, Shai Agnon Street Reform Judaism * Hebrew Union College, King David Street * Kehillat Har-El, the first Reform synagogue in Jerusalem, on Shmuel haNagid Street * Kehillat Kol HaNeshama, Reform synagogue in the Baka neighbourhoodThe Heart of Israel's Reform Judaism * Kehillat Mevakshei Derech, Reform synagogue in the San Simon neighbourhoodCongregations: Jerusalem region, Israel Movement for Reform and Progressive Judaism.

His reputation as a composer, already strong during his lifetime, rose rapidly in the years after his death, and he became (as he has remained to this day) one of the most celebrated of all composers. Shortly after Mozart's death, biographers began to piece together accounts of his life, relying on the testimony of those still living who knew him, as well as surviving correspondence. The creation of Mozart biographies has been an activity of scholars ever since. ==Early biographers== Portrait of Friedrich Schlichtegroll; artist unknown Friedrich Schlichtegroll was a teacher and a scholar who published Mozart's obituary in 1793. The obituary was part of a volume of obituaries referred to as Nekrolog. The two had never met. Most of the information was obtained from Nannerl, Mozart's sister, and Johann Andreas Schachtner, a friend of the family in Mozart's early years. Therefore, what Schlichtegroll knew and wrote about was the period before Vienna. Franz Xaver Niemetschek was a citizen of Prague, a teacher and writer. Niemetschek allegedly met with Mozart and claimed to have been acquainted with Mozart's friends in Prague. After Mozart's death, his widow Constanze sent Carl, the elder son, to live with him from 1792-97. Through these relationships with the family, Niemetschek gathered the information needed to write a biography of Mozart. His main source was Constanze and Mozart's friends in Prague. Therefore, his emphasis was on Mozart's years in Vienna and his many trips to Prague. Based on research by Austrian scholar Walther Brauneis, much doubt has recently been cast on the veracity of Niemetschek's claim that he actually made Mozart's personal acquaintance. Friedrich Rochlitz, portrait by Veit Hanns Schnorr von Carolsfeld, c 1820 Friedrich Rochlitz was the editor of the Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung (AMZ), a journal published by Breitkopf & Hartel. Motivated by the wish to publicize the company's edition in progress of the composer's works, he published a number of anecdotes about Mozart, many of them vivid and entertaining. However, since the research of Solomon 1991, Mozart scholars have considered Rochlitz's stories so contaminated by Rochlitz's own fictional additions that they must be considered completely unreliable.See, for instance, Halliwell (1998). They continue to play a role in forming the popular image of the composer. I. T. F. C. Arnold, an author of Gothic novels, wrote Mozart's Geist, published in Erfurt in 1803. According to William Stafford, the work is \\"almost entirely plagiarized from Schlichtegroll, Niemetschek, and perhaps Rochlitz\\";Stafford 1993, 19 Stafford does not trust any other material that appears in this work, though he notes that some of it was adopted for appearance in later Mozart biographies. Georg Nikolaus Nissen. Painting by Ferdinand Jagemann, 1809 Georg Nikolaus Nissen was the second husband of Mozart's wife Constanze. Both he and Constanze had a strong interest in Mozart biography. They were able to pursue this interest following Nissen's retirement from the Danish civil service, when the couple moved to Salzburg (where Mozart had lived for much of his life up to age 25). Much of the Nissen biography included what had been previously written by Schlichtegroll, Niemetschek, and Rochlitz, but Nissen also had access to a great number of Mozart family letters given him by Nannerl. Unfortunately, Nissen died in 1826 having only written a small portion of the work, and it was completed (1828) from his notes by others.Halliwell 1998 Stafford (1993) writes: \\"Sometimes Nissen corrects the chunks he borrows, and occasionally he tells the reader that he has done this ... unfortunately, he does not always correct and revise in this way. Assembling his narrative with scissors and paste, he allows contradictions to creep in.\\" Vincent and Mary Novello made a pilgrimage to Salzburg in 1829, to visit Mozart's surviving relatives and to provide financial support to Nannerl (whom they mistakenly imagined to be impoverished). They did interviews of Nannerl, Constanze, and Mozart's sister- in-law Sophie Haibel, but never converted this material into a biography. The diaries were discovered and published in 1955.Stafford 1993, 25 ==Later biographies== A very important Mozart biography was that published in 1856 by Otto Jahn. Jahn brought a new standard of scholarship to the field. It is still active as a scholarly document, circulating in versions revised first by Hermann Abert, then by the contemporary Mozart scholar Cliff Eisen. The Mozart scholar Otto Erich Deutsch produced (English version 1965) a widely cited \\"documentary\\" biography, in which most of the material is reprinted documentary evidence, tied together by Deutsch's own commentary. A follow-up volume with additional documents was published in 1991 by Eisen.Eisen, Cliff (1991) New Mozart Documents: A Supplement to O.E. Deutsch's Documentary Biography. Stanford: Stanford University Press. A great number of additional biographies exist, of which notably recent ones include those by Volkmar Braunbehrens, Maynard Solomon, and Ruth Halliwell. ==Adding to the documentary evidence== An important 20th century trend was the use of careful analysis of both handwriting and watermarks to provide more accurate (and often, surprising) dates for the works Mozart composed. Two standouts were Wolfgang Plath, who analyzed handwriting; and Alan Tyson, who mastered the exacting methodology for interpreting watermarks. The two often obtained converging evidence; Sadie writes, \\"the very fact that the two methods have on almost every occasion borne each other out strongly implies that each of them is actually more precise than its protagonist could dare claim.\\"Stanley Sadie \\"Preface: Mozart scholarship and the musical world over 35 years,\\" in Sadie (1996), pp. xiii-xvi. Quotation from p. xiii. 21st century scholarship has made clear that the old government archives and parish records have by no means been fully exhausted for the purpose of finding out new facts about Mozart. Work by Michael Lorenz has established the correct name of the person for whom the Ninth Piano Concerto was written;Michael Lorenz, \\"»Mademoiselle Jeunehomme« Zur Lösung eines Mozart-Rätsels\\", Mozart Experiment Aufklärung, (Essays for the Mozart Exhibition 2006) Da Ponte Institut, Vienna 2006, pp. 423–29. also the surprising information that Mozart was living in spacious, expensive suburban quarters at a time when conventional scholarship asserted that he had moved to the suburbs to cope with poverty.Lorenz, Michael (2010) \\"Mozart's Apartment on the Alsergrund\\", Newsletter of the Mozart Society of America 14:2. On line at . A web site launched by Dexter Edge and David Black continues the tradition established by Deutsch and Eisen, with a compilation of newly discovered or noticed documents.The site is located at . Mozart lived his life in complex society and culture, where many of the details of ordinary life were very different from the way they are today. Some modern Mozart scholars have attempted to increase our understanding by delving into the available information about Mozart's own life context. Dexter Edge writes, > Careful contextual readings of [Mozart's] Viennese letters have been few, > perhaps because Mozart is such a towering figure that most historians and > musicians have tended to see him as the sun around which all else revolved, > and they have therefore paid little attention to the mundane contexts in > which he lived, composed, and corresponded. Mozart was, of course, a supreme > musical genius, ... but he was also a man, living in day-to-day world of > traditions, practices, and constraints. ... Thus my readings of his letters > and those of his family will often deal with quite mundane contextual > matters, such as days of the week, exchange rates, and current events. ... > Often enough, we shall find that the implications of such simple matters > have been overlooked.Edge (2001:18) In connection with this effort to understand the context of Mozart's life, Edge approvingly cites the work of Halliwell (1998) as well as studies by Michael Lorenz. ==Revisionism in Mozart biography== Another trend in modern Mozart biography is to reject certain earlier claims as credulous and romanticized. The older tradition of scholarship is criticized by David J. Buch thus: > The composer's deification in the pantheon of German 'masters' following his > death, and his subsequent association with burgeoning German national > identity, led to hagiography. When the holes in Mozart's biography needed > plugging, rumor and imagination filled the gaps.Buch (2004:194) A possible instance of romanticizing is the belief that Mozart wrote his last symphonies not with the goal of performances and income, but as an \\"appeal to eternity\\" (Alfred Einstein); a claim that has been argued against by Neal Zaslaw on factual grounds; for detailed discussion see Symphony No. 40 (Mozart). Recent scholarship has also shown an increased reluctance to take historical documents at face value when their author had strong reasons to deviate from the truth. For instance, Constanze Mozart had strong motivation to paint a tragic picture of her husband's final decline and demise, since she was seeking both a pension from the Emperor and income from memorial benefit concerts. Cliff Eisen, inserting footnotes in Hermann Abert's book, expresses sharp skepticism about Constanze's account of the end of Mozart's life, contradicting the more credulous view of Abert; for details see Death of Mozart. The content of Mozart's letters also receives a very different interpretation under the view that they often reflect a desire to placate, and reduce the alarm of, his stern father Leopold; this view is put forth, for instance, by Schroeder (1999). Revisionism is, perhaps, likely to continue. Assessing the whole tradition of Mozart biography, Steptoe concludes: > There is little doubt that successive generations of scholars have been > sincere in their views of the composer, each claiming to be more 'objective' > than the last, stripping away the veneer of speculation to arrive at 'the > real man'. It is sobering to realize that these different opinions about > Mozart as a person are all based on a very similar set of data.Steptoe, > Andrew (1996) \\"Mozart's personality and creativity,\\" in Sadie (1996:21-34); > quotation from p. 21. ==NotesReferences== *Buch, David J.

It may present with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism and with or without a goiter. == Signs and symptoms == The symptoms may vary depending on the thyroid function, i.e. hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism can cause sweating, rapid heart rate, anxiety, tremors, fatigue, difficulty sleeping, sudden weight loss, and protruding eyes. Hypothyroidism can cause weight gain, fatigue, dry skin, hair loss, intolerance to cold, and constipation. The effects of this disease may be permanent but can sometimes be transient. Symptoms may come and go depending on whether the person receives treatment, and whether the treatment takes effect. ==Causes== Thyroid autoimmunity is familial. The disease is said to be inherited as a dominant trait since it has been reported that as many as fifty percent of the first degree relatives of patients with some type of autoimmune thyroiditis present with thyroid antibodies in serum. Some studies have even related it to chromosome 21 because of its high correlation with patients with Down syndrome and familial Alzheimer disease. This theory is controversial, since patients with Turner syndrome also present a high prevalence of autoimmune thyroiditis (up to fifty percent). === High iodine consumption === Autoimmune thyroiditis has a higher prevalence in societies that have a higher intake of iodine in their diet, such as the United States and Japan. Also, the rate of lymphocytic infiltration increased in areas where the iodine intake was once low, but increased due to iodine supplementation. “The prevalence of positive serum tests in such areas rises to over 40 percent within 0.5 to 5 years.” === Age === It has been shown that “the prevalence of positive tests for thyroid antibodies increases with age, with a frequency as high as 33 percent in women 70 years old or older.” The mean age of prevalence in women is higher than in men by one year, (58 and 59 years old respectively).Autoimmune thyroiditis can affect children. It is very rare in children under the age of five, but can occur;it accounts for around 40 percent of cases in adolescents with goiters. People with hypothyroidism over the age of 40 have an increased chance of developing autoimmune thyroiditis. ==Mechanism== Thyroid autoantibodies appear mostly with the presence of lymphocytes in the targeted organ. Lymphocytes produce antibodies targeting three different thyroid proteins: Thyroid peroxidase Antibodies (TPOAb), Thyroglobulin Antibodies (TgAb), and Thyroid stimulating hormone receptor Antibodies (TRAb). Some patients who are healthy may be positive for more than one of these antibodies. Doctors who attend to such patients will most likely do routine follow-ups on the patient's health since, even though it is highly unlikely that they will present any thyroid problems, there is still a chance that they will develop some type of dysfunction with time. == Diagnosis == Various tests can be chosen depending on the presenting symptoms. Doctors may search for Thyroid peroxidase Antibodies (TPOAb) when a person has symptoms of hypothyroidism, or when a person will be started on a drug therapy associated with risks of developing hypothyroidism, such as lithium or Interferon alfa. This antibody is related to Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease. If the person presents symptoms of hyperthyroidism, doctors are more likely to test for Thyroid stimulating hormone receptor Antibodies (TRAb), and monitor the effects of anti-thyroid therapy, also associated with Graves' disease. Doctors may check Thyroglobulin Antibodies (TgAb) also, whenever a thyroglobulin test is performed to see if the antibody is interfering. TgAb may also be ordered in regular intervals after a person has been diagnosed with thyroid cancer, and just like TPOAb, it can be associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. ===Categories=== Specialists separate autoimmune thyroiditis into two clinical categories. # If goiters are present, it is understood as Hashimoto's thyroiditis. # If the thyroid is atrophic, and does not present goiters, it is called atrophic thyroiditis. It can also refer to Graves' disease. If the symptoms of thyroiditis appear in women after giving birth, it is called postpartum thyroiditis. ==Treatment== The usual therapy is Levothyroxine.https://www.btf-thyroid.org/thyroiditis ==References External links == Category:Thyroid disease ","title":"Autoimmune thyroiditis"},{"id":"20345430","text":"Trentham Mausoleum, Stone Road, Trentham, built 1807-8 to a design by Tatham. Charles Heathcote Tatham (8 February 1772 in Westminster, London – 10 April 1842 in London), was an English architect of the early nineteenth century. ==Early life== He was born in Duke Street, Westminster, the youngest of five sons of Ralph Tatham who had come to London from Stockton in County Durham, by his wife Elizabeth Bloxham, the daughter of a well to doWill of Jabez Bloxham in National Archives hosier in Cateaton Street. The father was first a \\"Spanish merchant\\", went bankrupt, became a horse breeder in Essex, went bankrupt again, and was then asked in 1779 by Captain (afterwards Lord) Rodney, whom he had sheltered from his creditors \\"a great deal of his time\\" at Havering, if he would like to be his secretary in his command of the Leeward Islands fleet. Ralph Tatham, at 47, rose to the challenge, accepted, and set out for Portsmouth. Unfortunately he fell ill on the way and died of cholera at the Castle & Falcon in Aldersgate Street.NOTES for a PEDIGREE of THE TATHAMS OF CO. DURHAM, ENGLAND…Compiled by Henry Curtis, F.R.C.S. (retired). London 1921; bankruptcies from The Times Digital Archive Charles was educated at Louth grammar school in Lincolnshire (Lincs), as was his elder brother Henry, later a gun-maker and sword-cutler by Charing Cross; his eldest brother Thomas became a cabinet maker and \\"upholsterer to the Prince Regent\\", his brothers William and John respectively a naval officer and a London solicitor.Henry Curtis ==Career== Returning to London at the age of 16, he was engaged as a clerk by Samuel Pepys Cockerell, architect and surveyor. Learning nothing there, as he thought, he ran away, and returned to his mother's lodgings, where he remained working hard for a year or more at the five orders of architecture and French ornament and studying mathematics. When he was nearly 19 Henry Holland, the Prince of Wales's architect in the alterations of Carlton House and the Pavilion, Brighton, received him into his house, and two years later offered him £60 a year for two years to enable him to pursue his studies at Rome. He was introduced to Holland through his relative John Linnell who was in charge of one of London's leading cabinet-maker and upholsterer's firms and a rival to Thomas Chippendale. At Holland's office Tatham designed and drew at large all the ornamental decorations for Drury Lane Theatre. The whole proscenium was marked off from his drawings by Charles Catton the younger, who painted the designs in fresco. The executed design for the boxes in the theatre were by Linnell and they survive at the V&A; in the Print Room. Together with Samuel Wyatt he also designed Dropmore House in Buckinghamshire which was built in the 1790s for Lord Grenville, later the Prime Minister who pushed through the law abolishing the slave trade. With Holland's help, and a loan of £100 from John Birch, surgeon-extraordinary to the king, he felt justified in May 1794 in starting for Italy. Until 1797 he spent his time industriously, chiefly in Rome and Naples in company with Signor Asprucci, architect to Prince Borghese and Don Isidoro Velasquez, an exhibitioner from the academy of Madrid, both, like Tatham, students of classical architecture. Tatham's chief friends during his stay in Italy were Canova, Madame Angelica Kauffman and her husband; Abbate Carlo Bonomi, brother of Joseph Bonomi, RA ; Sir William and Lady Hamilton at Naples; and lastly, Frederick Howard, 5th Earl of Carlisle, to whose long friendship and patronage he owed much of his success. He left Rome a month or so before Bonaparte's first attack on the papal states in 1797; returning through Dresden, Berlin, and Prague, and making architectural drawings on the way. As the result of his studies he etched and published in 1799 Ancient Ornamental Architecture at Rome and in Italy. A second edition, containing more than a hundred plates, appeared in 1803, and a German translation was published at Weimar in 1805. His old master, Holland, had also commissioned him to collect in Italy antique fragments relating to ornamental architecture. He got together a noble assemblage, which was brought to England two years later. Tatham published a description of them in 1806. As of about 1895, they, along with his own collection of architectural drawings made at the same time, were in the collection of Sir John Soane in Lincoln's Inn Fields. Tatham first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1797, and continued to do so until 1836, contributing in all fifty-three designs. On 15 August 1799 the treasury issued a general invitation to artists to send competitive designs for a national monument of a pillar or obelisk two hundred feet high upon a basement of thirty feet \\"in commemoration of the late glorious victories of the British navy.\\" Tatham sent in three designs. Finding, after more than two years had passed, that no decision had been made, he published them as etchings, with descriptive text and a dedication to the Earl of Carlisle, in 1802. The project ultimately took shape in the Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square, William Railton in 1843. In 1802 Tatham designed the sculpture gallery at Castle Howard, and did work at Naworth, Cumberland, for the Earl of Carlisle; and in 1807 the picture gallery at Brocklesby, Lincolnshire, for Lord Yarborough. His etchings for the designs of these galleries, both in the severe classical style in vogue at the time, were published in 1811. Before 1816 he designed for the Duke of Bridgwater the portion of Cleveland House, St. James's, which lay to the west of the gallery. This building was destroyed when Sir Charles Barry designed the later Bridgwater House in 1847. Tatham moved from 101 Park Street, Mayfair, first to York Place, and then to a house with a beautiful garden in Alpha Road, which he built for himself. He lived on intimate terms with Thomas Chevalier, surgeon to George III, Benjamin Robert Haydon, Samuel Bagster the publisher, and John Linnell. At the same time he was apt to be masterful and litigious in professional matters, and engaged in lawsuits most unwisely with more than one of his employers. Refusing work for builders and others, he lost his practice. In 1834 he fell into pecuniary difficulties and his house and collection of objects of interest were sold, and at the age of 62 it seemed that he would have to begin life anew. His friends, however, the Right Hon. Thomas Grenville, the Duchess of Sutherland and others rallied round him, and in 1837 obtained for him the post of warden of Holy Trinity Hospital, Greenwich, where he ended his days happily and usefully. ==Family== Tatham married, in 1801, Harriet Williams, the daughter of a famous button-maker in St. Martin's Lane. By her he had four sons and six daughters. His eldest son Frederick Tatham, sculptor and afterwards portrait-painter, exhibited forty-eight pictures in the Royal Academy between 1825 and 1854. He was the close friend of William Blake and his wife.Alexander Gilchrist, Life of William Blake His second son, Arthur Tatham, was for more than forty years rector of Broadoak and Boconnoc in Cornwall, and prebendary of Exeter Cathedral. His second daughter, Julia, in 1831, married George Richmond the portrait-painter, the father of Sir William Blake Richmond, KCB RA. Tatham, who was member of the Academy of St. Luke at Rome, of the Institute of Bologna, and of the Architects' Society of London, left behind him copious reminiscences which had not been published by 1895. Also around 1895, a portrait of Tatham by Thomas Kearsley was in possession of his grandson, the Rev. Canon Richmond, and recently purchased at Sotheby's by his twice great-great-great grandson William Rann Kennedy. Also a large crayon portrait by Benjamin Robert Haydon was in the print-room of the British Museum. ==References * http://hdl.handle.net/2346/58806 Texas Tech Public Domain Books Category:1772 births Category:1842 deaths Category:19th-century English architects Category:Architects from London ","title":"Charles Heathcote Tatham"},{"id":"20345432","text":"The Canon de 4 de Vallière was a type of cannon designed by the French officer Florent-Jean de Vallière (1667-1759), Director-General of the Battalions and Schools of the Artillery. The cannon was a result of the Royal Ordonnance of October 7, 1732, enacted to reorganize and standardize the King's artilleryA Dictionary of Military History and the Art of War By André Corvisier, p.837 Whereas numerous formats and designs had been in place in the French army, De Vallière standardized the French sizes in artillery pieces, by allowing only for the production of 24, 12, 8 and 4 pound guns, mortars of 13 and 9 inches, and stone-throwing mortars of 16 inches. The 24-pdr was the largest caliber available to French artillery in this system. The cannon used core drilling of the bore of cannons founded in one piece of bronze, a method developed at that time by Jean Maritz, which allowed for much higher precision of the bore shape and surface, and therefore higher shooting efficiency. As with other de Valliere guns, the 4-pdr was also highly decorated and contained numerous designs and inscriptions. ==Front part== Starting with the front part, the gun had a sight design at it extremity. The followed the name of the gun (here Le Pénétrant). Then, a Latin phrase \\"Ultima Ratio Regum\\", initially introduced by Louis XIV, and rather descriptive of the role of the gun: \\"The Last Argument of the King\\". Under that appears the name \\"Louis Charles de Bourbon, comte d'Eu, duc d'Aumale\\", the Grand Maître de l'artillerie de France (Grand Master of the Artillery of France), followed by a royal emblem. In the middle of the cannon are trunnions, used to position the gun in place and elevate or depress it. On top of the trunnions are dolphin-shaped ornaments, which are used in lifting the gun.Springfield Armory ==Back part== The back part consists in, sometimes, an inscription showing the weight of the cannonball (for example a \\"4\\" for a 4-pounder), followed by a Latin inscription \\"Nec pluribus impar\\", meaning that the King is \\"Not unequal to many (suns)\\". This is followed by the royal crest of the Bourbon dynasty. At the bottom of the gun, the location and date of manufacture are inscribed, and finally the name and title of the founder (in the example \\"Fondu par J. Gor, Commissaire des Fontes\\"). The breech is decorated with an animal face showing the rating of the gun (\\"Face in a sunburst\\" for a 4-pounder). ==Operational activity== The surrender at Saratoga\\" shows General Daniel Morgan in front of a de Vallière 4-pounder. US Army personnel with a de Vallière 4-pounder in the 60s. Numerous de Valliere guns were used in the American War of Independence, especially the smaller 4-pdr field guns.

Originally the family encompassed all species of fungi that produced basidiocarps (fruit bodies) having a hymenium (spore-bearing surface) consisting of slender, downward-hanging tapering extensions referred to as \\"spines\\" or \\"teeth\\", whether they were related or not. This artificial but often useful grouping is now more generally called the hydnoid or tooth fungi. In the strict, modern sense, the Hydnaceae are limited to the genus Hydnum and related genera, with basidiocarps having a toothed or poroid hymenium. Species in the family are ectomycorrhizal, forming a mutually beneficial relationship with the roots of trees and other plants. Hydnum repandum (the hedgehog fungus) is an edible species, commercially collected in some countries and often marketed under the French name pied de mouton. ==TaxonomyHistory=== The family was originally described in 1826 by French botanist François Fulgis Chevallier to accommodate all the larger fungi with a toothed or spiny hymenium. As such, the family was entirely artificial, bringing together a diverse assemblage of species that have subsequently been reassigned to various families. In 1933, Dutch mycologist Marinus Anton Donk radically limited the Hydnaceae (which he referred to the tribe Hydneae) to Hydnum repandum and related species that produced \\"stichic\\" basidia (basidia with nuclear spindles arranged longitudinally). He considered this feature placed these species closer to the chanterelles (Cantharellaceae) than to other hydnoid fungi. Donk's disposition of the family was widely accepted and a standard 1995 text placed Hydnum and the Hydnaceae within the Cantharellales, though still retaining some additional genera (Amylodontia, Climacodon, Corallofungus, Dentinum, Gloeomucro, Nigrohydnum, Phaeoradulum, and Stegiacantha) within the family. Most of these have now been placed elsewhere. ===Current status=== Sistotrema confluens Molecular research, based on cladistic analysis of DNA sequences, has confirmed Donk's placement of the Hydnaceae as a family within the Cantharellales. The precise boundaries of the family have not been investigated, but it appears that the type and related species of the genus Sistotrema belong within the Hydnaceae, as well as most species of Hydnum itself. These Sistotrema species have poroid basidiocarps and are not closely related to the majority of \\"Sistotrema\\" species which may belong within the Clavulinaceae. The status of Corallofungus has not been investigated. According to the Dictionary of the Fungi (10th edition, 2008), the family contains 9 genera and 190 species. ==Description== The fruit bodies of species in the family have caps and stems that are usually centrally attached. Colors typically range from white to yellow to orange, and the teeth are typically lighter than the cap surface. The flesh is fleshy and brittle, and monomitic (consisting of generative hyphae only). The generative hyphae are thin-walled, branched, contain septa, and have clamp connections. Spores range in shape from roughly spherical to egg-shaped, have a smooth surface, and are colorless. A distinctive characteristic of many species in the family is the structure of the hymenium (spore-bearing surface), which consists of pendant, toothlike spines. ==Habitat and distribution== All species within the Hydnaceae are believed to be ectomycorrhizal, forming a mutually beneficial relationships with the roots of living trees and other plants. Basidiocarps typically occur on the ground or in leaf litter in woodland. The family has a cosmopolitan distribution. ==Economic importance== Several species of Hydnum are edible and Hydnum repandum is commercially collected and marketed in Europe, often under the French name pied de mouton. In North America, the related Hydnum umbilicatum is also commercially collected, sometimes under the name \\"sweet tooth\\". ==References== Category:Cantharellales Category:Basidiomycota families ","title":"Hydnaceae"},{"id":"20345569","text":"Otis Whitfield Williams Jr. (born November 23, 1981) https://mugshots.com/US- States/Georgia/DeKalb-County-GA/Otis-Whitfield-Williams.5013261.html, better known by his stage name OJ da Juiceman, is an American rapper, actor, and songwriter.

Work began in 1914, and electricity was being generated by 1916, although the project was not officially completed until 1922. In 1923 the electricity plant comprised 2 × 4 MW and 1 × 5 MW steam turbines driven by 100,000 lb/hr (12.60 kg/s) of steam. Electricity was available as 3-phase AC, at 400 and 230 V, and DC at 210 and 105 V. In 1923 the station generated 13.17 GWh of electricity, some of this was used in the plant, the total amount sold was 10.22 GWh. The revenue from sales of current was £84,927, this gave a surplus of revenue over expenses of £40,522. Cooling water was supplied by a pumping station on the Anson Branch canal, equipped with two Mather and Platt pumps capable of delivering 10.6 million gallons (48 Megalitres) per day. Spent water was discharged into the Wyrley and Essington Canal. Ownership of the station passed to the West Midlands Joint Electricity Authority in 1927, and then to the British Electricity Authority following nationalisation in 1948.Shill (2011) Construction of a second station, Walsall B, began soon after nationalisation. The station was officially opened on 30 September 1949. Comprising six cooling towers and six chimneys, with a total output of 191MW, (one of the largest and high output power plants, when it was first operational in 1949) the station burned 'slack' coal, which consisted of fragments of coal and coal dust. Coal was delivered by road, rail and canal. Water from the canal was used for cooling. The electricity output from the station is shown in the table.CEGB, Annual report and accounts, 1961, 1962 & 1963Electricity Commission, Generation of Electricity in Great Britain year ended 31st December 1946.

The power station was closed as it was no longer deemed to be efficient, when much newer coal power stations built later in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s with six or eight cooling towers can generate up to ten times more electricity as technology improves with bigger generators becoming more apparent on less coal consumption i.e. 2000MW+ than Birchills could. It stood dormant or mothballed for nearly five years afterwards, finally being demolished in March 1987. The substation it fed power to, also in Birchills is still in existence today, but is now fed from Rugeley 'B' station. ==ReferencesBibliography=== * Category:Coal-fired power stations in England Category:Power stations in the West Midlands (region) Category:Buildings and structures in the West Midlands (county) ","title":"Birchills Power Station"},{"id":"20345611","text":"Tyrilla Gouldson is a beauty pageant contestant who represented Sierra Leone in Miss World 2008 in South Africa.

Eden II was founded by six families in 1976, beginning on Staten Island with just six children and one special education teacher. The mission of Eden II Programs is to support people with autism throughout their lives to achieve their full potential through service, science, and passion. Over the past 40 years, Eden II's highly successful model has led to the expansion and development of a number of programs and services for individuals with autism. In 1994, Eden II opened its preschool program to serve children with autism, ages 3–5. This intensive program focuses on learning readiness skills, academics, social and self-help skills. Realizing a need for services on Long Island, the Genesis School, an educational annex of Eden II, opened in Plainview, New York in September 1995. Initially serving twelve students, the Genesis School now provides educational, residential and outreach services to more than 100 individuals throughout Long Island. Eden II employs more than 400 full-time and 200 part-time staff and greatly benefits from a number of volunteers, including its board of directors. Eden II developed its Adult Services Program in 1982 to meet the needs of the students aging out of the school program. This program is a highly specialized program designed to serve those individuals with the most significant challenges, often excluded from all other options. Today, Eden II serves over 90 young men and women in its Adult Services Programs. In 1993, Eden II developed its first residence for ten young men with autism. This house was developed in response to Eden II's mission statement: to serve individuals with autism and their families across their lifespans. Eden II opened its second residence in 2003, serving six children with autism, and had opened three more residences by 2010. Eden II is committed to serving not only the needs of individuals with autism but also the needs of their families. To that end, Eden II developed its Family Support Department in 1984. This program began with a small parent training class and some respite trips serving approximately 15 families a year and has grown into a complex array of respite services, summer camp, afterschool programs, holiday trips, service coordination and in-home habilitation programs. Currently, the Family Support Department assists more than 200 families. ==External links== * Eden II Category:Schools for people on the autistic spectrum Category:Schools in Nassau County, New York Category:Special schools in the United States Category:Private elementary schools in Staten Island Category:Private middle schools in Staten Island Category:Private high schools in Staten Island Category:Autism-related organizations in the United States Category:1976 establishments in New York (state) Category:Educational institutions established in 1976 Category:Mental health organizations in New York (state) ","title":"Eden II School for Autistic Children"},{"id":"20345674","text":"Joseph Samuel Perry (November 30, 1896 – February 18, 1984) was a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. ==Early life and education== Born in Carbon Hill, Alabama, Perry was the son of a coal miner named Jack Perry, and Mary Elizabeth Brown. He worked on local farms and in area coal mines before joining the United States Navy and serving in Europe during World War I. After the war, he returned home to finish high school. Perry then earned an Artium Baccalaureus degree Phi Beta Kappa in 1923 from the University of Alabama and a Master of Arts degree from the University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration in 1925. He earned a Juris Doctor from the University of Chicago Law School in 1927. ==Professional career== Perry worked in private law practice in Chicago, Illinois from 1928 until 1933, when he began working as a master in chancery in DuPage County, Illinois and as a private lawyer in Wheaton, Illinois. In 1936, Perry was elected to the Illinois Senate as a Democrat from the 41st district. He served from 1937 until 1943 and served as a floor leader for Governor Henry Horner. He served in the Illinois Militia from 1942 to 1944. In 1943, Perry returned to private law practice in Wheaton. He was the last Democrat from DuPage County to serve in the Illinois Senate until Tom Cullerton of Villa Park seventy years later. After World War II, Perry was unsuccessful in efforts to be elected as a state senator and a congressman, largely because he was a Democrat in heavily Republican DuPage County. Perry remained a lawyer in Wheaton until he became a federal judge in 1951. Perry also worked from 1949 until 1951 as DuPage County's public administrator. ==Federal judicial service== Perry was nominated by President Harry S. Truman on July 13, 1951, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois vacated by Judge Elwyn Riley Shaw. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on August 21, 1951, and received his commission on August 22, 1951. He assumed senior status on November 29, 1971. His service terminated on February 18, 1984, due to his death. ===Notable cases=== During his tenure, Perry presided over a large number of high-profile trials, including an 18-month-long wrongful-death suit initiated by the survivors and family members of two members of the Black Panther Party who were killed during a 1969 raid on the group's headquarters. At the end of the trial, which at that time was the longest trial before a federal court jury in United States history, Perry dismissed all charges against law enforcement officials who had been sued for $47 million in a wrongful-death suit when jurors could not reach a verdict. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit eventually overturned Perry and ordered a new trial, but an out-of-court settlement eventually was reached. ==Mastodon discovery== On October 16, 1963, a man named Marshall Erb (1910–1989) was excavating a pond in the back yard of Perry's house, at 683 Riford Road in Glen Ellyn, Illinois when Erb found a large, 42-inch bone. The bone was taken to a geologist at Wheaton College in nearby Wheaton, who judged it to be the fossilized bone of a prehistoric mastodon that became extinct more than 8,000 years ago. Diggers uncovered more bones, and Perry then gave Wheaton College permission to excavate the site. Geologists eventually found more than 100 of the mastodon's 211 bones, including the complete skull with well-preserved teeth. Geologists eventually reassembled the mastodon skeleton, and it is now on display at Wheaton College's Meyer Science Center.

The telephone interpreter converts the spoken language from one language to another, enabling listeners and speakers to understand each other. Interpretation over the telephone most often takes place in consecutive mode, which means that the interpreter waits until the speaker finishes an utterance before rendering the interpretation into the other language. Telephone interpreting is one modality or delivery mechanism for providing interpreting services. Other forms of delivering interpreting services include in-person interpreting and video interpreting for the deaf and hard of hearing. == Historical timeline == * 1950s: Telephone lines first proposed as a medium for the delivery of interpreting services. *1973: Australia introduces telephone interpretation as a fee-free service to respond to its growing immigrant communities. * 1981: The first Over-the-Phone Interpretation (OPI) service is offered in the United States. * 1981–1990: Telephone interpreting enters major U.S. industries including financial services, telecommunications, healthcare, and public safety. * 1990s: The demand for telephone interpreting grows significantly; contributing factors include decreased prices in long-distance calls, toll-free number access, and immigration trends. * 1995: Language services company Kevmark, later known as CyraCom, patents a multiple-handset phone adapted for telephone interpreting. , Google Patents listing. * 1999: AT&T; sells language services company Language Line Services. * 2000s: Telephone interpretation becomes more sophisticated; quality of interpreting, faster connection speeds, and customer service become important to consumers. * 2005: The U.S. telephone interpreting market is estimated at approximately $200 million. *2013: Language Lines Services acquires Pacific Interpreters. *2016: France-based company Teleperformance announces plans to buy LanguageLine Solutions for $1.52 billion. == Providers == There are many types of organizations that provide telephone interpreting services, including for- profit companies, governmental organizations, non-profit groups, and internal divisions within organizations. For example, the government of Australia operates a telephone interpreting service,Australian Telephone Interpreting Service as do the governments of South Africa and New Zealand.South Africa Interpretation Service New Zealand Interpretation Service === United States === In the United States, telephone interpreting is widely used by its federal courts. Numerous commercial providers are also available and commonly used. Many of the commercial telephone interpreting providers connect users with interpreters for more than 150 languages. Some providers claim to have the ability to connect an interpreter at any time of day, within a matter of seconds. Some hospitals and health care systems also provide telephone interpreting services. Major providers of telephone interpretation in the United States include Language Line Services, Lionbridge, CyraCom International, Pacific Interpreters. In 2009, CyraCom was the second largest supplier of telephone interpretation in the world behind Language Line Services ranked #1, while Pacific Interpreters was the fifth largest.Kelly, Nataly; DePalma, Donald A. \\"Top 15 Telephone Interpreting Suppliers\\" Common Sense Advisory (September, 2009) In 2013, Language Line Services acquired Pacific Interpreters. === United Kingdom === Language Line Inc. is an American commercial interpreting provider that in 2006 acquired a UK company Language Line Limited: British social activist Michael Young noticed that language barriers were leading to substandard services for ethnic minorities at Royal London Hospital, so he obtained grant funding to provide free telephone interpreters starting in 1990. Police on the Isle of Dogs became his second client, and he later began serving corporate clients and converted the charity into a commercial service.Language Line History , Language Line website. There is now a prevalence of companies that offer this service, many on a more global basis which is a natural benefit of \\"virtualising\\" interpretation. Similarly to translation, the diversity of organisations cover generic interpretation, as well as domain-specific services such as legal, medical, pharmaceutical and other technical. == Equipment == Users typically access telephone interpreting services with a telephone or computer with VoIP. However, if the two parties wishing to communicate are in the same location, using a dual handset phone, a phone with two receivers, can relieve the two parties from passing a phone back and forth. Speakerphones are also sometimes used, but these can create challenges both in terms of confidentiality, and for the interpreter, especially due to background noise, which can hinder the interpreter's ability to hear. Where one party is deaf, hard-of-hearing or speech-impaired, communication via an off-site sign language interpreter can be performed using a video link using the necessary video telecommunication equipment. == Access == The provisioning of telephone interpreting generally fits into two main categories: * Automated: an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) application is employed to convert spoken or keyed Dual Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF) data into a request for connecting to an interpreter in a specific language (identified by unique language-codes). * Operator-led: utilise customer-care staff to answer the call, gather the required information from the caller, and facilitate the connection to the interpreter. A service of this nature can be preferred by organisations such as emergency services, where the client's knowledge of language codes is absent. Additionally, some of the companies that have the required capability will offer a hybrid of the two principles, where for example a customer can: * Call in to the service * Input their \\"account code\\" into a single-layer Interactive Voice Response (IVR) using the phone keypad * Be connected to a call-centre agent who will already know who the caller is, and will facilitate other data capture relevant to the call (including the required language) == Uses == Telephone interpreting is widely used in a number of settings, including health care, government, financial, emergency telephone call centres (e.g. '9-1-1' or '1-1-2'), and others. Telephone interpreting is especially helpful for settings in which the two parties would communicate via telephone anyway, such as interactions between call centers and consumers, calls between members of the public and emergency telephone call centres, etc. Telephone interpreting can be used to take applications over the phone and help individuals with account issues. Telephone interpretation via Video Remote Interpreting (VRI) or a Video Relay Service (VRS) are also useful where one of the parties is deaf, hard-of-hearing or speech-impaired. In such cases the interpretation flow is normally within the same principal language, such as French Sign Language (FSL) to spoken French, Spanish Sign Language (SSL) to spoken Spanish, British Sign Language (BSL) to spoken English, and American Sign Language (ASL) also to spoken English (since BSL and ASL are completely distinct), etc. Multilingual sign language interpreters, who can also translate as well across principal languages (such as to and from SSL, to and from spoken English), are also available, albeit less frequently. Such activities involve considerable effort on the part of the translator, since sign languages are distinct natural languages with their own construction and syntax, which are different from the aural version of the same principal language. == Market == In 2007, the global telephone interpreting market was worth $700 million, with an estimated $500 million generated in the United States. Industry analyst firm Common Sense Advisory estimates that in 2012, the market will be worth $1.2 billion, an increase of 70% from 2007. The market for telephone interpreting is global in scope and includes companies from the United States, the Netherlands, Sweden, France, the United Kingdom, Canada, India, China, Norway, Spain, and Hong Kong. == See also == * Language interpretation * Video Relay Service: for use where a deaf/hard-of- hearing/speech-impaired person is not located at the same place as the hearing person. The sign language interpreter is additionally situated in a third location, typically a video-enabled relay call centre. * Video Remote Interpreting: for use where a deaf/hard-of-hearing/speech-impaired person and the hearing person are located at the same place, such as a hospital, with the sign language interpreter located off-site. == References == ;Notes ;Bibliography * Kelly, Nataly: Telephone Interpreting: A Comprehensive Guide to the Profession, 2008, .

They organized the Salado College Joint Stock Company and raised $5,000 for the college through sale of stock. The board of the company had seven trustees. Colonel Elijah Sterling Clack Robertson was elected President of the board. Robertson donated of land to the college on October 16, 1859. Ten acres of the land was for the college grounds and ninety acres was to subdivided and sold to families moving to the area. The proceeds of the land sale provided money for building the school. Salado College was the first college in the state to operate without church or state funds. On February 8, 1860, Salado College was incorporated by the Texas Legislature for twenty years to grant diplomas, confer degrees and perform other corporate functions. Unlike most colleges of the era in the United States, Salado College was to be coeducational. The college erected a temporary wooden building, and the first classes began on February 20, 1860. Seventy-five students were enrolled the first term. Students that did not live in the area boarded with local families as the college had no dormitory. Teachers temporarily lived in tents. On July 4, 1860, area Masons laid the cornerstone for the college's permanent two-story limestone building. The ceremony attracted visitors from as far away as Austin and Waco. The college sold many more lots as families moved to Salado to get their children a good education. Attendance increased to 124 students the next year. Attendance at the school peaked at 307 students in 1865 with an average of 250 from 1866 to 1872.\\"Salado College,\\" The Handbook of Texas Online. Retrieved Nov. 22, 2008. In 1871, the college added a two-story annex. However, enrollment dropped sharply because of the Panic of 1873. The number of students also decreased as more state-funded colleges were established. Finally, Colonel Robertson had to step in and buy the college in 1877 to keep it from being closed due to foreclosure on the property. Colonel Robertson died in 1879. The state charter expired on February 8, 1880. A new corporation formed in 1882 and purchased the land on which the college building stood from Robertson's heirs. The school operated as Salado College until 1885. However, the college was not rechartered with the state, so it granted no degrees between 1880 and 1884. In 1885, Salado College ceased operating as a college. The college had operated for its entire existence without endowments, sustained solely by tuition. The Salado College Board of Trustees leased the site to Dr. S. J. Jones who established a private high school. He operated it as Thomas Arnold High School from 1890 until 1913 when he retired. The school closed in 1918 and became a free public school until 1924. A fire destroyed the main building in 1901 and again in 1902. The building was rebuilt each time. A fire in 1924 destroyed the building again. This time the citizens could not afford to rebuild. Oral history recounts the nature of these fires as \\"suspicious,\\" but the basis for the claim of arson is lost in local legend. The site was subjected to an archaeological survey. The ruins of the building were stabilized, and the site is now open to the public. In 2011 the site came under the governance of the Robertson Colony - Salado College Foundation, Inc. under the direction of President Doris Kemp. The foundation has beautified the site, made improvements and maintains it as the Salado College Memorial Public Park. Contributions from the community and friends of the college support the endeavor. The Foundation can be reached at P.O. Box 143, Salado, Texas 76571. ==Beautification effort== The beautification effort was launched into full swing when community volunteers joined 24 soldier volunteers from the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment stationed at Fort Hood.

The band has included prominent Czech musicians Iva Bittová and Pavel Fajt and influenced many Czech artists, with AllMusic critic François Couture calling their sophomore album Rosol from 1991 \\"the blueprint for the future music of [...] most of the Czech avant rock scene.\\" The band's name translates in English to \\"Danube\\", referring to the river of this name. == History Early years, first two albums (1986–1991)=== Iva Bittová and Vladimír Václavek (shown here) are among Dunaj members with active solo careers. Initially known as Kolektiv, the group began performing in 1986. The lineup included vocalists Bittová and Jiří Kolšovský, guitarists Josef Ostřanský and Pavel Richter, bassist Vladimír Václavek, and drummer Fajt. The group, all members of which were active in other projects, performed only sporadically at the time. Fajt and Bittová collaborated on the Svatba (The Wedding) album in 1987, which was successful internationally. This led to the international re-release of their first collaborative LP from 1985. Following this, the band decided to record their material. They changed their name to Dunaj in 1989, released their debut record Dunaj a Bittová, and performed a handful of well-received concerts. Bittová and Richter left shortly after this period, with Kolšovský becoming the band's lead vocalist. Zdeněk Plachý also briefly joined as the group's keyboardist, performing on the group's second album, Rosol (Jelly). This album was released in 1991 on the Pavian Records label, shortly after the Velvet Revolution. Couture called the album \\"one of the band's most powerful achievements\\" and \\"a collection of memorable avant prog rock anthems\\" that is \\"an essential\\". They temporarily disbanded after the album's release. ===Dudlay through La La Lai, breakup (1992–1998)=== In 1992, the band reformed in its third and longest-lasting incarnation, including Kolšovský, Václavek, Ostřanský, and new drummer Pavel Koudelka. They recorded and released their third record, Dudlay, in 1993. The following year, they issued their next record, IV. The four members were briefly rejoined by Bittová and Fajt in 1995. This lineup re-recorded their debut album and released it, along with new material, as Pustit musíš. The band toured in this incarnation prior to returning to the four-piece lineup and recording La La Lai in 1996. The group disbanded in 1998, shortly before Kolšovský's death. All surviving members remained active in the Czech music scene. ===Later activity and reunions (2001–present)=== Indies Records re- released Rosol in 2001 with bonus live material. In 2002, the group played a series of reunion concerts featuring participation from most members. Václav Bartoš, singer of Fajt's group Pluto, replaced Kolšovský for these performances. Beginning in 2015, Ostřanský and Václavek began performing Dunaj material together live in the group Dunajská vlna with drummer Michaela Antalová. Later that year, Dunajská vlna released the album Jednou, featuring new recordings of songs from all five Dunaj LPs. Critics praised the album's clean, minimalist sound. In 2018, Ostřanský, Václavek, and Koudelka officially reformed Dunaj. The trio began performing old material and writing new songs, while a film about the band also began production. Also in this year, Plachý died unexpectedly after a prolific career in music and theater. == Discography == * Dunaj a Bittová (1989) * Rosol (1991) (re-released in 2001) * Dudlay (1993) * IV (1994) * Pustit musíš (1995) * La La Lai (1996) == Members == Current * Josef Ostřanský – guitar, vocals (1986–1991, 1992–1998, 2002, 2018–present) * Vladimír Václavek – bass, guitar, vocals (1986–1991, 1992–1998, 2002, 2018–present) * Pavel Koudelka – drums (1992–1998, 2002, 2018–present) Former * Jiří Kolšovský – vocals, guitar (1986–1991, 1992–1998; died 1998) * Pavel Fajt – drums, percussion (1986–1991, 1995, 2002) * Iva Bittová – vocals, violin (1986–1989, 1995, 2002) * Pavel Richter – guitar (1986–1989) * Zdeněk Plachý – keyboards (1991; died 2018) * Václav Bartoš – vocals (2002) Timeline ImageSize = width:900 height:auto barincrement:20 PlotArea = left:100 bottom:60 top:0 right:30 Alignbars = justify DateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy Period = from:01/01/1986 till:12/31/2018 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Colors = id:Vocals value:red legend:Vocals id:Guitar value:green legend:Guitar id:Keyboards value:purple legend:Keyboards id:Violin value:yellow legend:Violin id:Bass value:blue legend:Bass id:Drums value:orange legend:Drums id:Album value:black legend:Studio album Legend = orientation:horizontal position:bottom ScaleMajor = increment:3 start:1986 ScaleMinor = unit:year increment:1 start:1986 LineData = layer:back color:Album at:01/01/1989 at:06/01/1991 at:06/01/1993 at:06/01/1994 at:06/01/1995 at:06/01/1996 BarData = bar:Jiri text:\\"Jiří Kolšovský\\" bar:Iva text:\\"Iva Bittová\\" bar:Vaclav text:\\"Václav Bartoš\\" bar:Josef text:\\"Josef Ostřanský\\" bar:Richter text:\\"Pavel Richter\\" bar:Vladimir text:\\"Vladimír Václavek\\" bar:Zdenek text:\\"Zdeněk Plachý\\" bar:Fajt text:\\"Pavel Fajt\\" bar:Koudelka text:\\"Pavel Koudelka\\" PlotData= width:11 bar:Jiri from:01/01/1986 till:09/01/1991 color:Vocals bar:Jiri from:01/01/1986 till:09/01/1991 color:Guitar width:5 bar:Jiri from:09/01/1992 till:06/01/1998 color:Vocals bar:Jiri from:09/01/1992 till:06/01/1998 color:Guitar width:5 bar:Iva from:01/01/1986 till:12/01/1989 color:Vocals bar:Iva from:03/01/1995 till:12/01/1995 color:Vocals bar:Iva from:04/01/2002 till:08/01/2002 color:Vocals bar:Iva from:01/01/1986 till:12/01/1989 color:Violin width:5 bar:Iva from:03/01/1995 till:12/01/1995 color:Violin width:5 bar:Iva from:04/01/2002 till:08/01/2002 color:Violin width:5 bar:Vaclav from:04/01/2002 till:08/01/2002 color:Vocals bar:Josef from:01/01/1986 till:09/01/1991 color:Guitar bar:Josef from:09/01/1992 till:06/01/1998 color:Guitar bar:Josef from:04/01/2002 till:08/01/2002 color:Guitar bar:Josef from:06/01/2018 till:end color:Guitar bar:Josef from:01/01/1986 till:09/01/1991 color:Vocals width:5 bar:Josef from:09/01/1992 till:06/01/1998 color:Vocals width:5 bar:Josef from:04/01/2002 till:08/01/2002 color:Vocals width:5 bar:Josef from:06/01/2018 till:end color:Vocals width:5 bar:Richter from:01/01/1986 till:12/01/1989 color:Guitar bar:Vladimir from:01/01/1986 till:09/01/1991 color:Bass bar:Vladimir from:09/01/1992 till:06/01/1998 color:Bass bar:Vladimir from:04/01/2002 till:08/01/2002 color:Bass bar:Vladimir from:06/01/2018 till:end color:Vocals bar:Vladimir from:01/01/1986 till:09/01/1991 color:Vocals width:7 bar:Vladimir from:09/01/1992 till:06/01/1998 color:Vocals width:7 bar:Vladimir from:04/01/2002 till:08/01/2002 color:Vocals width:7 bar:Vladimir from:06/01/2018 till:end color:Bass width:7 bar:Vladimir from:01/01/1986 till:09/01/1991 color:Guitar width:3 bar:Vladimir from:09/01/1992 till:06/01/1998 color:Guitar width:3 bar:Vladimir from:04/01/2002 till:08/01/2002 color:Guitar width:3 bar:Vladimir from:06/01/2018 till:end color:Guitar width:3 bar:Zdenek from:01/01/1991 till:09/01/1991 color:Keyboards bar:Fajt from:01/01/1986 till:09/01/1991 color:Drums bar:Fajt from:03/01/1995 till:12/01/1995 color:Drums bar:Fajt from:04/01/2002 till:08/01/2002 color:Drums bar:Koudelka from:09/01/1992 till:06/01/1998 color:Drums bar:Koudelka from:04/01/2002 till:08/01/2002 color:Drums bar:Koudelka from:06/01/2018 till:end color:Drums == References  External links == * Dunaj at MySpace.com Category:Czech alternative rock groups Category:Czech rock music groups ","title":"Dunaj (band)"},{"id":"20345798","text":"Felix Saarikoski (June 21, 1857 in Kuopio - July 4, 1920) was a Finnish politician.

He was two years younger than his brother Tuvia, who later commanded the Bielski Otriad. The Bielskis were the only Jewish family of Stankiewicze, a small village in pre-war Poland, currently Western Belarus. It was located between Lida and Navahrudak (called Nowogródek in Polish), both of which later housed Jewish ghettos during World War II. He was quieter and more reserved than his brothers, and was content to stay on the farm and around those he knew well. With his older brothers leaving home and his father’s health deteriorating, Asael was becoming the new head of the household. As the male leader of the family, he had to arrange the marriage of his sister Tajba to an upper-class man named Avremale. Avremale had a sister named Chaja who was a high school graduate, which was rare for the time and place. Hearing that Asael needed help with bookkeeping, Chaja offered to tutor him. ==World War II== When Operation Barbarossa broke out, Tuvia, Zus and Asael were called up by their army units to fight against the Nazi German occupiers. Owing to so much chaos the units disbanded and they returned to Stankiewicze, where their parents lived. In early July 1941, a German army unit arrived in Stankiewicze, and Jewish residents were moved into a ghetto in Nowogródek. After Operation Barbarossa, Asael and two of his brothers, Tuvia and Zus, went into hiding in nearby forests. Before joining them, Chaja had lived in a ghetto at first, then fled, leaving her boyfriend there. She lived in an underground hiding spot near the home of a Christian peasant, along with her two nephews. Asael and Chaja were married shortly before the war's end. After the Soviet occupation of the area, Asael was drafted into the Soviet Red Army, and six months later he was killed in the Battle of Königsberg of 1945. Piotr Głuchowski, Marcin Kowalski, Wojna polsko-ruska pod bokiem niemieckim, Gazeta Wyborcza, 13 January 2009 He never lived to see his daughter Assaela, whom he had fathered with Chaja. ==Asael in history and in film== In the film Defiance (2008), Asael (portrayed by British actor Jamie Bell) is the third of four brothers and seems to be about 20 years of age, or perhaps younger. In actuality, Asael was about 33 years of age (born in 1908) at the time of the invasion and was older than Zus (born in 1912), which is contrary to the relationship depicted in the film. The film has been criticised in Poland due to its complete omission of all Polish aspects in the narrative, even though the setting is on territory that was part of Poland before the war and inhabited by a large number of ethnic Poles. Specifically, Tuvia was a veteran of the Polish army, and other Polish partisans were also active in the forests of present-day Belarus, but the film only presents the roles of Jews, Russians, and Germans. There was also controversy about the alleged involvement of the Bielski group in a massacre of Polish civilians conducted by Soviet-aligned partisans in Naliboki. The Bielski partisan group was the subject of an official inquiry by the Polish Institute of National Remembrance's Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation after witnesses testified that Bielski partisans were among the perpetrators of the Naliboki massacre; however, the investigation found no conclusive evidence linking the Bielski group to the crime. ==References== Category:1908 births Category:1945 deaths Category:People from Lida District Category:Belarusian Jews Category:Belarusian partisans Category:Polish Jews Category:Soviet partisans Category:Jewish partisans Category:Holocaust survivors ","title":"Asael Bielski"},{"id":"20345805","text":"Twelveheads Press is an independent publishing company based in Chacewater near Truro, Cornwall, UK.

Established on September 30, 2003, about four months after the 2010 games were awarded to Vancouver, British Columbia, it performed these roles with \\"the mandate to support and promote the development of sport in Canada.\\" VANOC was led by chief executive officer John Furlong, an Irish-born long-time member of the Canadian Olympic Committee. Its board of directors consisted of 20 members, with seven chosen by the Canadian Olympic Committee, one from the Canadian Paralympic Committee, three each from Canadian and British Columbian provincial governments, two from the City government of Vancouver, two from the Resort Municipality of Whistler, one chosen jointly by the Band Councils of the Lil'wat and Squamish Nations, and a final director chosen by the other 19 members. ==Goals== On January 30, 2009, VANOC announced its updated budget for the 2010 games. The operating budget was set at CAN$1.76 billion, with a contingency of $77 million. This reflected an increase of $130 million over the $1.63 billion operating budget announced in May 2007, though VANOC said that if the accounting principles applied for the 2009 budget were retroactively applied to the May 2007 budget, the operating budget would have remained \\"relatively unchanged.\\" The VANOC operating budget was financed by private sector sources such as sponsorships, licensing, merchandising, ticket sales and fundraising, as well as with a contribution from the International Olympic Committee; it was separate from the CAN$580 million spent on venue construction, costs for which were shared equally by the government of Canada and the provincial government of British Columbia. One of VANOC's goals was to achieve \\"unprecedented\\" First Nations, Inuit, and Métis participation in the planning and hosting of the 2010 Winter Games. VANOC also sought to place a broader emphasis on sustainability, integrating it into purchasing and daily operations and expanding to include \\"social and economic dimensions\\", such as an effort to include \\"inner-city residents and businesses in the economic opportunities.\\" ==Site preparation== VANOC spent $16.6 million to upgrade facilities at Cypress Mountain, where the freestyle (aerials, moguls, ski cross) and snowboarding events were held. With the opening in February 2009 of the $40-million Vancouver Olympic/Paralympic Centre at Hillcrest Park, every sports venue for the 2010 games was completed on time and about a year prior to the start of the games. The Vancouver Games were the first to officially integrate social media into their official communication channels and strategies.

From the late 1930s to the 1980s it was rented out to various organizations, including the Manhattan Theater Club, which began there.

In return, the Czech government agreed to renovate the building. Its first use after the change of ownership came in 2005, when it served as the venue for a celebration of the 70th birthday of Václav Havel, a kickoff event for Untitled Theater Company #61's Havel Festival.

Ten were built by Brighton railway works in 1906 to the design of Douglas Earle Marsh. ==History== This class was intended to replace the smaller Robert Billinton C2 class 0-6-0 on the heaviest freight services. However, although they had an effective boiler, their performance proved to be disappointing and the fuel consumption high. Rather than building any further examples Marsh preferred to rebuild the existing locomotives into the C2X class. The members of the C3 class therefore spent their days on secondary freight trains in mid Sussex. Seven of the class spent most of their lives at Horsham and as a result the class was nicknamed \\"Horsham Goods\\". The boiler designed by Marsh for the C3 class was later used with considerably more success on the SR Z class 0-8-0 of 1929.Bradley, D.L. (1975). Locomotives of the Southern Railway Part 1. London: Railway Correspondence and Travel Society. . pp.43-7. ==Grouping and Nationalisation== All of the class passed to the Southern Railway in 1923, but the trade recession of the 1930s caused a decline in freight traffic resulting in the withdrawal of two locomotives in 1936/7. However, the advent of the Second World War ensured that the remaining examples all survived until after the nationalisation of the railways to British Railways in 1948. The remaining locomotives in the class were all withdrawn between 1948 and 1952. No examples have been preserved. ==ReferencesSources== * Bradley, D.L.

The organization was formerly known as the Michigan chapter of the AFA. ==ActivismDetroit Pistons dancers=== In 2006, the ADA opposed the distribution of a calendar depicting Detroit Pistons dance group, \\"Automotion\\" members in swimsuits. The calendar was given away to fans during a December basketball game, and then sold to legal adults for $13 in Pistons' stores. A member of the ADA described the calendar as \\"legalized prostitution.\\" The ADA opposed the calendar by means of its e-mail newsletter, and said that since the basketball team counted women and young children among its fans, the calendar was inappropriate. The proceeds of the calendar went to charity. In January 2006, Brother Rice High, a Michigan Catholic school disinvited Automotion to an alumni fundraising event after repeated urging by the ADA. The ADA held that the event \\"legitimizes pornography and the objectification of women.\\" Though the high school's decision was made in response to public pressure instead of an admission of wrongdoing by the principal, the ADA still viewed it as a victory. The dancers planned to donate their time to the fundraising event. ==Supporters== The ADA receives some funding from the Holland, Michigan-based Prince Foundation (formerly the Edgar and Elsa Prince Foundation), which funds many other Christian right groups including the Family Research Council and Focus on the Family, which each received a little over a million dollars in 2003 and 2004, and 2003 and 2005, respectively.

It is the oldest existing church in the city of Detroit, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1971. ==History== In 1844, Bishop Peter Paul Lefevere, who served as coadjutor bishop of the Diocese of Detroit, began construction on Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral; the cornerstone is dated June 29, 1844. Francis Letourneau drew the plans and Peter Kindenkens supervised the construction. Construction was completed over four years, as the bishop paid for each stage of construction with cash. The church was consecrated on June 29, 1848 as the cathedral church of the diocese. /> The original parishioners were predominantly Irish, with some French families attending. Following Lefevere's death, under Caspar Borgess, the second Bishop of Detroit, the church remained the cathedral until 1877, when he gave the title to the building to the Jesuit Order with the intention of starting Detroit's first Catholic college. The church then became SS. Peter & Paul Jesuit Church. The Jesuit college eventually became the University of Detroit-Mercy, and UDM's law school still occupies the building adjacent to the church. The church was altered in 1879 and 1882, completely renovated in 1892, and remodeled again in 1911. A chapel was added to the rear of the building in 1918. Although these alterations changed the look of the church, the original plan has been substantially preserved. The church is still in use, offering Sunday and some weekday masses. ==Description== Saints Peter and Paul Church is a three-aisled church, built of Detroit common brick. The front façade is gabled and topped by a short square belfry. The tower was originally intended to support a tall spire, which was never built. There is a central entrance pavilion, set between arched windows and Ionic pilasters. The pilasters continue along the side, separating the side elevation into seven bays with tall, rounded arch windows. A heavy frieze surmounts the walls. The interior of the church features hand-carved oak confessionals, a barrel vaulted ceiling painted with murals of the apostles, and an extraordinary Carrara marble altar designed by Gustav Adolph Mueller and featuring a bas relief of the crucifixion by Joseph Sibbel.. These details were added during later renovations; the organ case is the only surviving original element. ==Gallery== File:Saints Peter and Paul Church Detroit original plan.jpgOriginal planned appearance.

He therefore traveled with Frederick Campbell to visit his father in Vienna, where he was Minister and look for military employment. In 1755, he was recalled to the Scots Brigade, but rejoined the British army in 1757 as a captain in the 73rd Regiment of Foot. On the recommendation of Colonel Henry Seymour Conway, he was made aide-de-camp to Lord George Sackville and fought at the Battle of Minden. A month later he carried news of Sackville resignation to London, where he met William Pitt the Elder. He employed Keith to raise companies of Highland Volunteers, later called 87th Regiment of Foot (Keith's Highlanders), with him as major commandant, and from 1760 colonel commandant. From 1760 to 1762, his regiment served in Germany, involved in several engagements. However, after the war, his regiment was disbanded, and he was placed on half pay. After visiting Paris, he settled in London. ==Diplomat and Later Life== Keith's knowledge of German and friendship with Pitt and Conway enabled him to be appointed Envoy-extraordinary to Saxony in 1769. He transferred in 1771 to be minister in Copenhagen. In the face of a worsening political situation for Johan Friedrich Struensee the minister who ruled Denmark for the insane Christian VII and his Queen Caroline Matilda, a sister of George III of Great Britain (and without instructions), he threatened a British naval bombardment of Copenhagen if the queen was harmed. This frightened the Danes and earned the gratitude of the king who made him a Knight of the Bath. They allowed the queen to withdraw to Hanover. After escorting her there he returned to London. His next appointment was as Envoy- extraordinary to Vienna, where he remained 20 years. This post was a difficult one as he at times rarely received instructions from London. Furthermore, relations were at times strained during Austria's War with Turkey at the end of his time there. He returned home in 1774 to settle his father's estate. His London friends wanted him to enter Parliament for Peeblesshire in 1775, a seat which he retained until 1780, without ever attending the House of Commons. His financial position was improved by his being appointed Colonel of 10th Regiment of Foot in 1781 and a Lieutenant-General the following year. He came home in 1788 and was made a Privy Councillor in 1789, but then returned to Vienna, where his final duties included attending the Congress of Sistovo, which ended the Turkish war. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1786. His proposers were James Gregory, William Miller and Robert Arbuthnot of Haddo. He retired in 1792 and settled in Hammersmith, where he died suddenly three years later. ==References== * Category:1730 births Category:1795 deaths Category:People from Edinburgh Category:Knights Companion of the Order of the Bath Category:Royal Lincolnshire Regiment officers Category:British Army personnel of the Seven Years' War Category:Ambassadors of Great Britain to Denmark Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for Scottish constituencies Category:British MPs 1774–1780 Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh Category:Ambassadors of Great Britain to the Holy Roman Emperor ","title":"Robert Murray Keith (the younger)"},{"id":"20346161","text":"The La Hitte system (French: \\"Système La Hitte\\"), named after the French general Ducos, Count de La Hitte, Rifled Field Pieces: A Short Compilation of what is Known of the New Field - Page 32 by Franck Taylor 1862 was an artillery system designed in March 1858 to implement rifled muzzle-loading guns in the French Army. ==Conception== The La Hitte system was developed through the collaborative work of Lieutenant-colonel Treuille de Beaulieu (\\"Directeur de l'atelier de précision\\") who had developed the principle and General de La Hitte (\\"Président du Comité d'Artillerie\\") who had implemented it:The Edinburgh Review - Page 499 1864 ==Specifications== The new rifled guns were used from 1859 during the Franco-Austrian War in Italy.French Army 1870-71 Franco-Prussian War (1) by Stephen Shann p.37 These guns were a considerable improvement over the previous smooth-bore guns which had been in use. They were able to shoot at 3,000 meters either regular shells, ball- loaded shells or grapeshot. They appear to have been the first examples of rifled cannons used on a battlefield.The Long Arm of Lee by Jennings Cropper Wise, Gary W. Gallagher p.30 The system was muzzle-loading, and the shells could only be detonated at one of two set distances. The shells, based on the 1847 invention of Captain Tamisier, were oval-shaped, and had small protrusions to follow the grooves of the bore. Previous guns, such as the Canon obusier de 12, were rifled to accommodate the system.\\"Napoleon went so far, however, in 1858, as to order his SB guns rifled, under the bastard system known as the \\"Lahitte System,\\" which continued in general use in France until 1870\\" in The Long Arm of Lee by Jennings Cropper Wise, Gary W. Gallagher p.30 The system included newly rifled siege guns of 12 cm, 16 cm and 24 cm bore, new field guns of 4 cm and 12 cm bore, new siege guns of 12 cm and 24 cm bore, and a mountain gun of 4 cm bore. ==Change in meaning of gun designations== With the introduction of rifling and elongated shells replacing the old roundshot, guns could fire projectiles of nearly twice the previous weight possible for a given bore (calibre). The rifling gave a far greater range for a given propellant charge, hence a minimal increase in gunpowder was needed for the heavier shells. While the La Hitte guns retained the traditional 4 designation, the number now approximated to kg rather than the livre (French pound) as previously. Hence the Canon de campagne de 4 La Hitte fired a shell weighing nearly 4 kg. ==Obsolescence== The La Hitte system was superseded in 1870 with the work of Jean-Baptiste Verchère de Reffye and the development of breech-loading rifled guns. ==Image gallery== Image:Canon de campagne raye 1858.jpgRifled muzzle-loading gun \\"Canon de campagne de 4 rayé modèle 1858, L' Aubry\\".

It used a diameter primary mirror with a focal length (hence its name \\"Forty-Foot\\"). It was the largest telescope in the world for 50 years. It may have been used to discover Enceladus and Mimas, the 6th and 7th moons of Saturn. It was dismantled in 1840 by Herschel's son John Herschel due to safety concerns; today the original mirror and a section of the tube remain. == Construction == The telescope was constructed by Sir William Herschel, with the assistance of his sister Caroline Herschel, between 1785 and 1789 in Slough, with components made in Clay Hall near Windsor. The tube was made of iron. The telescope was mounted on a fully rotatable alt- azimuth mount. It was paid for by King George III, who granted £4,000 for it to be made. During construction, whilst the telescope tube lay on the ground, the King as well as the Archbishop of Canterbury visited the telescope. Just prior to them entering the open mouth of the tube, the King commented \\"Come, my Lord Bishop, I will show you the way to Heaven!\\" Two concave metal mirrors were made for the telescope, each with a focal ratio of f/10. The first was cast in a London foundry on 31 October 1785, and was made of speculum (an alloy of mostly copper and tin) with arsenic to improve the finish. It weighed 1023 lb after being cast, but it was found to be 0.9 inches thinner at the centre than at the edge (where it was around 2 inches thick). Over a year was spent grinding and polishing the mirror; however, Herschel found it to be \\"much too thin to keep its figure when put into the telescope\\" (despite weighing half a ton). A second mirror with twice the thickness of the original was cast a few years later, and this was used rather than the original. However, this required more frequent polishing due to the fast tarnishing nature of the metal, and the original mirror was used when the second was being polished. The mirrors remained the largest in the world until 1845. Herschelian telescope. Herschel eliminated the small diagonal mirror of a standard newtonian reflector from his design and instead tilted his primary mirror so he could view the formed image when he stood in an observing cage directly in front of the telescope. This saved on the severe light loss the image would suffer if he had used a speculum metal diagonal mirror. This design has come to be called a Herschelian telescope. == Use == Photograph of the 40-foot telescope's frame taken in 1839 by William Herschel's son, John Herschel. The telescope was located on the grounds of Observatory House, Herschel's house in Slough, between 1789 and 1840. The first observation with the telescope was on 19 February 1787, when Herschel pointed the then- incomplete telescope towards the Orion nebula, which he observed by crawling into the telescope and using a hand-held eyepiece: \\"The apparatus for the 40-foot telescope was by this time so far completed that I could put the mirror into the tube and direct it to a celestial object; but having no eye- glass fixed, not being acquainted with the focal length which was to be tried, I went into the tube, and laying down near the mouth of it I held the eye- glass in my hand, and soon found the place of the focus. The object I viewed was the nebula in the belt of Orion, and I found the figure of the mirror, though far from perfect, better than I had expected. It showed four small stars in the nebula and many more. The nebula was extremely bright.\\" The one achievement of the telescope was to discover Enceladus and Mimas, the 6th and 7th moons of Saturn, although this is not certain, as Herschel used other telescopes at the same time. Herschel described the view of Sirius through the telescope: \\"... the appearance of Sirius announced itself, ... and came on by degrees, increasing in brightness, till this brilliant star at last entered the field of view of the telescope, with all the splendour of the rising sun, and forced me to take the eye from that beautiful sight.\\" As part of the funding deal with the telescope, Caroline Herschel was granted a pension of £50 per year to be William's assistant. As a result, she was the first woman in England to be paid to carry out astronomy. The telescope was a local tourist attraction, visited by rich and famous people on their way to the nearby Windsor Castle to visit the King, and was featured on Ordnance Survey maps. It was the largest telescope in the world for 50 years. It was called the \\"40-foot telescope\\" as at the time telescopes were referred to by the length of their tube rather than the diameter of the mirror. Due to problems with the mirrors and because the telescope was unwieldy, the telescope did not prove to be a substantial improvement over smaller telescopes. The weather was rarely suitable for the telescope, and most objects observed by Herschel were also visible in his smaller telescopes. The final observation made by the telescope was in 1815. The telescope was featured in Herschel's coat of arms: \\"Argent on a mount vert a representation of the forty-feet reflecting telescope with its apparatus proper; a chief azure thereon the astronomical symbol of Uranus or Georgium Sidus irradiated Or.\\" == Decommissioning and preservation == Science Museum, London. The telescope's frame was dismantled at the end of 1839 by William Herschel's son, John Herschel, on his return from carrying out observations in South Africa. It was dismantled as it was feared that the frame might collapse due to rot, and John feared for the safety of his young children. A small ceremony was conducted to commemorate its dismantling. The tube was left lying horizontally in the garden, supported by stone blocks at either end, where it was crushed in 1867 by a falling tree. The remaining piece is a length of the mirror end, which is 3,048 by 1,465 mm (120\\" x 57.7\\"). This was still located in the garden of Observatory House in 1955, but was subsequently moved and is now located in the Herschel Collection of the National Maritime Museum, in the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, London. The first mirror was last polished in 1797, and was subsequently stored away and lost. When John Herschel moved from Observatory House to Hawkhurst in 1840, a number of items (including the 40-foot telescope) were left behind. In an inventory written at the time, he recorded \\"In the Observatory, beneath stair, one 40-foot mirror, with case and cover.\\" A workman later reported that only a light metal cover of a 4-foot mirror was present, rather than the mirror itself. The mirror was rediscovered on 2 February 1927: \\"All that could be seen on a casual inspection was a somewhat rusty iron ring, about 4 feet in diameter and 5 inches thick ... covered in front with a close-fitting lid of thin metal. The iron ring, which was not unlike the tyre of a cart-wheel, was obviously the cell of a large mirror and was quite separate from the tin cover. On removing the latter, which was provided with six handles, the mirror itself was at once seen, occupying the front portion of the cell, close under the cover.\\" The remaining 10 ft section of the telescope, now at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. On 4 March 1927 the mirror was moved to the Cottage library, and was once more polished some 130 years after the mirror was last properly polished. The original mirror now resides in the Science Museum, London. The second mirror was left in place in the telescope when it was dismantled, but was removed when the tube was crushed. In 1871 it was moved into the hall of Observatory House. A scale model of the telescope at the Herschel Museum of Astronomy in Bath. A scale model of the telescope, as well as an early photo of it that is framed in wood from the telescope, is on display at the Herschel Museum of Astronomy in Bath. The telescope was surpassed in 1845 as the largest ever built by Lord Rosse's great reflecting telescope. The image of the 40-foot telescope remains as one of the great icons of astronomy. ==See also== *List of largest optical telescopes historically *List of largest optical telescopes in the 18th century *List of largest optical telescopes in the 19th century *List of largest optical telescopes in the British Isles ==References== Category:Optical telescopes ","title":"40-foot telescope"},{"id":"20346321","text":"Friedrich Julius Richelot (6 November 1808 – 31 March 1875) was a German mathematician, born in Königsberg.

Like the Yorkshire, these then returned to a central smokebox and chimney. The outside cylinders were rear-mounted and drove only the leading axle, without coupling rods. The locomotive units were dispatched separately to Newton Heath, where their semi-trailers were attached. Their coaches were semi-trailers, with reversible seats for 48 passengers and electric lighting. There were also a luggage compartment and a driving compartment for use in reverse.

The first was withdrawn in 1927, and only one survived by nationalisation in 1948. That railmotor, LMS No. 10617, was withdrawn in 1948 without being given a British Railways number. None was preserved. The best-remembered of these railmotors was the 'Altcar Bob' service from Southport to Barton railway station (also known as 'Downholland') (before 1926, it ran to ) and the 'Horwich Jerk' service from Horwich to Blackrod.

Jefferson also served as a captain in the United States Army Reserve - Judge Advocate General's Corps and was honorably discharged. ==Professional career== After beginning his career in private legal practice, Jefferson became an assistant criminal district attorney for Bexar County in 1962, and later that year became the chief assistant to U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy for the Western District of Texas – a role he held for six years. In 1968, Jefferson became a trial and labor relations lawyer for Humble Oil, which later became Exxon. From 1970 until 1975, Jefferson was a judge in Harris County, Texas. In 1975, Jefferson went into private legal practice in Houston, Texas. Judge Jefferson has received the Anti-Defamation League National Torch of Liberty Award, the Forward Times Newspaper Community Service Award, the Charles A. George Community Service Award and the League of United Latin American Citizens National Community Service Award from LaRaza. Judge Jefferson was known in the Houston community as a leader, pioneer and coalition builder who helped bridge the gap between young and old and those of different cultural backgrounds. Jefferson also served as chairman of the board of the Dallas Branch of the Federal Reserve Bank and of the Texas Southern University Foundation. In 1996, Jefferson became a member of the International Society of Barristers, a society of outstanding trial lawyers chosen by their peers on the basis of excellence and integrity in advocacy. ==Nomination to the Fifth Circuit== On October 11, 1979, President Jimmy Carter nominated Jefferson to a new seat as a federal judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. During the Iran hostage crisis that began on November 4, 1979, many of President Carter's initiatives as well as his run for reelection were crippled. Despite Democrats holding a majority of 58 seats in the United States Senate at the time, the Senate did not act on President Carter's nomination of Jefferson before his presidency ended, and newly seated President Ronald Reagan, declined to renominate Jefferson to the seat. The seat to which Jefferson was nominated was filled by Reagan appointee William Lockhart Garwood on October 21, 1981. ==Trial Advocacy Endowment at Texas Southern University== In 2006, The Andrew L. Jefferson Endowment for Trial Advocacy at the Thurgood Marshall School of Law was established at Texas Southern University. The endowment exists to preserve the jury trial in order to consider issues of ethics and excellence in advocacy and the role of litigation in society. As of 2016, the university has created no publicized initiatives in conjunction with the reported 1 million dollars donated. ==See also== * Jimmy Carter judicial appointment controversies ==References External links == * Jefferson Jr., Andrew L.

He can play as either a centre or left back. Kolodziejczak is a French youth international and has competed at all levels. He played on the under-19 team that won the 2010 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship. Due to the difficulty of pronouncing his surname, he is a commonly referred to as Kolo. ==Personal life== Kolodziejczak was born on 1 October 1991 in Arras, France, to a Polish father and a Martiniquais mother. ==Club careerEarly career=== Kolodziejczak began his career at the age of seven playing for local club US Saint-Maurice Loos-en-Gohelle. In July 1999, he moved to hometown club CS Avion where he spent a year. In June 2000, Kolodziejczak joined the professional club of RC Lens. While in the club's youth academy, he trained alongside youth and international teammate Gaël Kakuta at the Centre de Préformation de Football in nearby Liévin, a training center exclusively for players brought up in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region. He spent two years at the center training there during the weekdays and playing with Lens on the weekends. One of his trainers at the facility was former Polish international Joachim Marx. After graduating from the club's youth academy, he was offered a five-year professional contract as Lens were attempting to tie down the defender who was being scouted by several prominent European clubs, most notably Manchester United. Kolodziejczak turned down the offer with hopes of signing elsewhere stating he had no confidence in the club. Following negotiations, it was announced on 21 August 2008 that Kolodziejczak agreed to join seven-time Ligue 1 champions Olympique Lyonnais on a season-long loan with a view to a permanent deal with Lens demanding at least €3 million in compensation for the player. ===Lyon=== Upon his arrival to the club, Kolodziejczak was given the number 12 shirt on the first-team. However, due to signing late in the transfer window, he missed Lyon's entire pre-season campaign and was placed on the club's Championnat de France amateur team in the fourth division by manager Claude Puel. He made his reserve debut on 13 September 2008 in the derby match against Saint-Étienne's reserve team. The match resulted in a 2–1 victory with Kolodziejczak playing the entire match picking up a yellow card. Two months later, Kolodziejczak was called up to the first team for a league match against Paris Saint-Germain on 23 November 2008 to serve as the backup left back. In the match, he made his professional debut coming on as a substitute for the severely injured Anthony Réveillère in the 11th minute. Lyon lost the match 1–0 with Kolodziejczak being penalized with a yellow card late in the second half. Following the season, Lyon signed Kolodziejczak on a permanent deal with the player agreeing to a four-year deal and the transfer fee being priced at €2.5 million.http://www.actusnewswire.com/documents/ACTUS-0-3288-OL-DDR-0809-GB.pdf For the 2009–10 season, Kolodziejczak's playing time was limited. On 29 September 2009, he made his UEFA Champions League debut in the team's 4–0 victory over Hungarian club Debrecen appearing as a substitute for starting left back Aly Cissokho. Four days later, Kolodziejczak made another substitute appearance in a 2–0 win against his former club Lens. On 21 November, he made his first professional start playing 76 minutes in a 1–1 draw against Grenoble. ===Nice=== In the summer of 2012, he moved to fellow Ligue 1 club Nice on a four-year contract. ===Sevilla=== Kolodziejczak joined Sevilla FC on 27 August 2014, signing a three-year contract on a transfer fee of €3 million. On 18 September he made his first appearance, as the club defeated Feyenoord 2-0 in the UEFA Europa League. He debuted in La Liga six days later, playing the entirety of a 1-0 home win against Real Sociedad. On 2 October, he was shown a straight red card in a Europa League match at HNK Rijeka for conceding a penalty on Andrej Kramarić. This was converted for the first equaliser in an eventual 2-2 draw. He scored his first goal on 29 October, opening a 6-1 win at CE Sabadell in the first leg of the Copa del Rey round of 32. He made nine appearances as they won the Europa League in his first season, including the 3–2 win over FC Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk in the final in Warsaw. ===Borussia Mönchengladbach=== On 4 January 2017, Kolodziejczak signed for German club Borussia Mönchengladbach. ===Tigres UANL=== On 4 September 2017, Kolodziejczak joined Liga MX club Tigres UANL. ==International career== Kolodziejczak has featured for all of France's national youth teams beginning with the under-16 team. He made his debut with the team in the team's last match against Germany at the Olympic Stadium in Berlin on 30 May 2006. Germany won the match 1–0 with Felix Kroos scoring the lone goal. With the under-17 team, Kolodziejczak was a regular and made his debut in the team's opening match against Switzerland in a 4–0 victory. In qualification for the 2008 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship, he appeared in both rounds of qualification with the team finishing the Elite Round portion unbeaten, which led to qualification to the UEFA-sanctioned tournament. At the tournament, Kolodziejczak scored his first youth international goal against Turkey in the semi-finals. The goal came in the 69th minute with France trailing 1–0. The team later won the match 4–3 on penalties. In the final, France were defeated 4–0 by Spain. On under-18 duty, Kolodziejczak made his debut in the team's opening match against the Ukraine. He only made six appearances with the team. With the under-19 team, Kolodziejczak was again called upon by coach Francis Smerecki making his first appearance with the team on 9 October 2009 in 4–2 defeat to the Netherlands. After consistently appearing with the team for the campaign, on 7 June 2010, he was named to coach Smerecki's 18-man squad to participate in the 2010 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship. Kolodziejczak played in all five of the team's matches including the final match against Spain, which France won 2–1. The title is the country's second UEFA Under-19 championship. Due to France's victory at the UEFA Under-19 championship, the nation qualified for the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup, which merited under-20 team appearances for Kolodziejczak. He made his debut with the team on 7 October 2010 in a friendly match against Portugal, which ended 3–3. Kolodziejczak, subsequently, appeared in four matches for the team during the 2010–11 campaign and, on 10 June 2011, was named to the 21-man squad to participate in the U-20 World Cup. He made his debut in the competition on 30 July 2011 in the team's 4–1 defeat to the hosts Colombia. Due to his Polish descent, Kolodziejczak is also eligible to represent Poland at international level. At the age of 15, he was issued a proposal by the Polish Football Association (PZPN) who sought for the player to play for the country's youth international teams. However, due to not having Polish citizenship, Kolodziejczak would have been unable to play in an official match for Poland, which led to his father declining the opportunity and, instead, deciding that it would be better to wait a few years until coming to a decision. ==Career statistics== {  style=\\"text-align: center\\" + Appearances and goals by club, season and competition - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"National Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"League Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Continental !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=\\"5\\"Lyon 2008–09 rowspan=\\"4\\"Ligue 1 1000000010 - 2009–10 2000001Appearances in the Champions League030 - 2010–11 8000001090 - 2011–12 1000000010 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !12!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!2!!0!!14!!0 - rowspan=\\"3\\"Lyon II 2010–11 rowspan=\\"2\\"CFA 123colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—123 - 2011–12 111colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—111 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !23!!4!!colspan=\\"2\\"—!!colspan=\\"2\\"—!!colspan=\\"2\\"—!!23!!4 - rowspan=\\"3\\"Nice 2012–13 rowspan=\\"2\\"Ligue 1 3702021colspan=\\"2\\"—411 - 2013–14 34230212Appearances in the Europa League0413 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !71!!2!!5!!0!!4!!2!!2!!0!!82!!4 - rowspan=\\"4\\"Sevilla 2014–15 rowspan=\\"3\\"La Liga 18151colspan=\\"2\\"—90322 - 2015–16 29080colspan=\\"2\\"—13Six appearances in the Champions League; seven appearances and a goal in the Europa League1501 - 2016–17 5020colspan=\\"2\\"—2One appearance in the UEFA Super Cup and one in the Champions League090 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !52!!1!!15!!1!!colspan=\\"2\\"—!!24!!1!!91!!3 - Borussia Mönchengladbach 2016–17 Bundesliga 1000colspan=\\"2\\"—1020 - rowspan=\\"3\\"Tigres UANL 2017–18 rowspan=\\"2\\"Liga MX 6010000070 - 2018–19 0000000000 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !6!!0!!1!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!7!!0 - Saint-Étienne (loan) 2018–19 rowspan=\\"2\\"Ligue 1 363200000383 - Saint- Étienne (loan) 2019–20 150311000191 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Career total !216!!10!!26!!2!!5!!2!!29!!1!!276!!15 } ==HonoursClub=== Sevilla *UEFA Europa League: 2014–15, 2015–16 UANL *Liga MX: Apertura 2017 ===Individual=== *UEFA Europa League Squad of the Season: 2014–15 ==References* Timothée Kolodziejczak at Official Liga MX Profile Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Pas-de-Calais Category:Association football defenders Category:French footballers Category:French-Polish footballers Category:French people of Martiniquais descent Category:French people of Polish descent Category:Olympique Lyonnais players Category:RC Lens players Category:OGC Nice players Category:Sevilla FC players Category:Borussia Mönchengladbach players Category:Tigres UANL footballers Category:AS Saint- Étienne players Category:Ligue 1 players Category:La Liga players Category:Bundesliga players Category:Liga MX players Category:UEFA Europa League winning players Category:France youth international footballers Category:French expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Spain Category:French expatriate sportspeople in Spain Category:Expatriate footballers in Germany Category:Expatriate footballers in Mexico ","title":"Timothée Kolodziejczak"},{"id":"20346406","text":"The 2000–01 Scottish League Cup was the 55th staging of the Scotland's second most prestigious football knockout competition, also known for sponsorship reasons as the CIS Insurance Cup.

Founded by Jeff Nuttall, John Darling, Laura Gilbert, and Mark Long in 1966, and performing its first show in the basement of Better Books in London's Charing Cross Road, the People Show was London's first performance art company and has played a seminal role in the evolution of British experimental theatre. Though some People Show performances begin with scripts, these scripts serve mostly as starting points for devised, site-specific theatre by actors, musicians, poets, and artists. In 1969, they staged a performance at London's Royal Court Theatre during which they invited passersby into a telephone booth to look at \\"dirty postcards\\", only to present them with \\"two sugar lumps... coloured with red ink or, alternatively, a bra stuffed with baked beans.\\" The People Show has also toured internationally. During the early 1970s, they produced four shows at La MaMa Experimental Theatre in New York City. These included shows 39 and 44, both in 1972, and shows 51, 52, and 53, in 1973.

The system was established in 1957 and was inspired by the residential college systems at the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge as well as the American adaptations of the same at Harvard and Yale. Each student is randomly affiliated with a residential college upon matriculation and becomes a lifetime member of the college. The residential college system takes the place of a Greek system and has contributed to a sense of community that other universities have sought to emulate. At academic ceremonies, including matriculation and commencement, the colleges proceed first with the four original colleges in the order Baker, Will Rice, Hanszen, and Wiess, followed by the other colleges in order of founding: Jones, Brown, Lovett, Sid Richardson, Martel, McMurtry, and Duncan. For the original four colleges, which were founded simultaneously in 1957, the processional order reflects the order in which the original buildings were constructed. For McMurtry and Duncan, which were constructed and opened simultaneously in August 2009, the processional order reflects the order in which the founding gifts were made. The colleges are often classified by geographical location: Jones, Brown, Martel, McMurtry, and Duncan are the North colleges; Baker, Will Rice, Hanszen, Wiess, Lovett, and Sid Richardson are the South colleges. == History of the college system == The residential college system was instated in 1957 by converting East, South, West, and North Halls into the men's colleges of Baker, Will Rice, Hanszen, and Wiess, respectively. Jones, the first residential college built on campus for that purpose, was constructed the same year and became the singular women's college. Brown, Lovett, and Sid Richardson colleges composed the initial expansion founded between 1965 and 1971. To cope with increasing enrollment,Total enrollment '96-'08 Martel, McMurtry, and Duncan colleges were constructed in the period between 2001 and 2009. Today, when undergraduates are asked where they are from, many respond with the name of their college, not their home state. This is a testament to the centrality of the residential college system to the social life on the Rice campus. ==Common characteristics Architecture === Each college except Sid Richardson is built around a quadrangle, which serves as the central court of the college. Each college building includes three principal structures: * A residential building, where on-campus members of the college live. In addition to student rooms in various configurations, the building includes at least two apartments for resident associates. Resident associates are typically junior faculty members; their role is to serve as mentors and counselors to the students of the college. * A house, usually immediately adjacent to the residential building, in which the college Magister or Magisters live. A Magister is typically a tenured or other senior faculty member who lives at the college with his or her spouse, providing leadership and guidance to the college as a whole and to individual students. (Historically the term Master was reserved for faculty members, while a non-faculty spouse held the title Co-Master. Today, both spouses are known as Magisters.) * A commons, where college members (including on-campus and off-campus students, Magisters, resident associates, and non-resident associates from the faculty and the community) take their meals and conduct other activities of college life, including study groups, lectures, theatrical productions, and parties. In addition to a large multi-purpose dining hall, each commons typically includes an administrative office, a private dining room for small group meetings, and other specialized areas. Each college has a unique architectural style, and as a result there are a great number of different room configurations, with varying levels of modernity and condition. Each college is also connected to a dining hall, known as a servery. Martel, Jones, and Brown colleges are served by the North Servery, while McMurtry and Duncan are served by the West Servery. In the South, Hanszen and Wiess colleges are served by the South Servery, and Will Rice and Lovett Colleges are served by the Seibel Servery. Baker and Sid Richardson each have their own servery, called college kitchens. === Magisters and Resident Associates === Each of the residential colleges at Rice has two College Magisters, a faculty member and his or her spouse. The Magisters reside in a home adjacent to the college, and help cultivate a variety of cultural and intellectual interests among the students, as well as support an effective system of self-government. They administer the college and serve as liaisons between the students of the college and Rice. Resident Associates (RAs) are Rice faculty or staff members who reside on campus with students. While each college has many associates, the RAs are selected to live on campus at the college to interact more extensively with the students. They live in apartment suites at the colleges, regularly attend meals with students, and are generally active members of student life. McMurtry College and Duncan College, due to their population size, also have Head Resident Fellows, who are meant to ease communication between RAs, the Magisters, and the students. Two of the longest-serving resident associates in Rice history are Dr. Gilbert Cuthbertson, professor of political science and resident associate at Will Rice College, and Dr. Bill Wilson, professor of electrical engineering and resident associate at Wiess College. === Governance === Each college is in charge of an annual budget in excess of $50,000 and elects a government from its students to administer the college and the budget. The college governments can exert control over everything from event organization to upgrades to the college facilities. Governing documents for many of the colleges can be found online.Will Rice ConstitutionBrown Constitution Singular student presidents and chief justices are university mandated features of each college's government. Additional members vary per college, but typically include Treasurer, Secretary, and a plurality of representatives from each class. The executive officers, such as the President, Treasurer, and Secretary, form the Executive council, and the representatives combine with the council to form the college government, known by names such as Cabinet or Parliament, depending on the college. These councils meet weekly to dispense with business related to the organizational and social functioning of the college. The meetings are akin to town hall meetings and typically include refreshments; they also serve as a forum for members of the various clubs, theater groups, and intramural sporting clubs to announce and advertise upcoming events. In addition, each college elects and sends one senator to represent the college at the Student Association. === Traditions === The traditional campus-wide Beer Bike competition is the largest annual student event held on Rice campus and the source of many rivalries and traditions among the residential colleges. In recent years, a tradition has emerged wherein the Sid Richardson men's team intentionally disqualify themselves using any of a variety of means, most recently with a fire extinguisher-powered \\"rocket bike.\\" Sid Richardson has been disqualified in at least one race each year since 2000, with the exception of 2003 and 2007 when the biking was replaced with running due to inclement weather. On the other end of this spectrum, Will Rice is known as the most competitive of the residential colleges and the only one to ever \\"sweep\\" (win the mens, women, and alumni race). However, Martel College is undefeated in Men's Beer Runs (alternate race due to inclement weather) ==Baker College== James Addison Baker College is named in honor of Captain James A. Baker, friend and attorney of William Marsh Rice, and first chair of the Rice Board of Governors. He served as the Rice Institute's first chairman on the Board of Trustees from June 24, 1891, until his death in 1941. He is known for having helped unravel the conspiracy surrounding the murder of the millionaire, who was chloroformed by his butler, Charles F. Jones, on September 23, 1900. The suspicious death of the Rice founder was concocted by Albert T. Patrick, a New York attorney, who forged a will naming himself the primary beneficiary to the large fortune, enlisting the Butler's help. Captain Baker, however, began an intensive investigation into the death of his employer, discovering the forgery, and returning the foundation to what would become Rice University. As part of the university's original on-campus housing for male students, a dormitory (South Hall, now part of Will Rice College) and a dining room, library and residential tower (now part of Baker College) were built in 1912 by Cram, Goodhue, & Ferguson of Boston, Massachusetts, at the cost of $137,544.52. The now-Baker commons—with beautiful engraved oak beams and the high vaulted ceilings of Elizabethan design—served as the university's central dining hall for 43 years. East Hall, which contained dormitories and is now referred to as the \\"Old Wing\\" of Baker, was completed in summer 1915 (and West Hall (the \\"Old Wing\\" of Hanszen College) was completed in 1916).http://ricehistoricalsociety.org/images/cornerstones/wrc06723.pdf These buildings remained virtually unchanged until the residential college system was instated in 1957. The neoclassical architecture of the former East Hall was joined by a new two-story brick-colored wing, the design of which was shared with equivalent new sections being constructed at Will Rice and Hanszen colleges, in preparation for becoming residential colleges. A house for Baker's Magister was also added. Baker was thus established as one of the five original colleges at Rice in the fall of 1957. In 1973, Baker and Hanszen became the first co-ed colleges at Rice. To include upperclass women, a lottery was held for Jones and Brown women to transfer into Baker. Baker's colors are traditionally red, silver, and black, and the college associates itself with the devil and hell in its Beer Bike themes and college cheers, with the most popular cheer being \\"Baker, hell yeah!\\". The crest was selected, by popular vote, in 1958. The main design is derived from the family crest of Captain Baker's mother, with the owls across the shield indicating the connection to Rice University, and is inscribed with a phrase from Epictetus, which says \\"[d]ifficulties are things that show what men are.\\" Every year, Baker throws the Baker 90's public party, held in the spring. Some of the biggest social traditions include Baker Christmas in September, the annual Christmas Tree brought home by the freshmen after their camping trip, the Baker Shakespearean play, and of course Baker 13. In 2009, construction began on a new residential wing. A portion of the former New Section was renovated and turned over to Lovett College. Baker's new wing is located between the Old Section and the Inner Loop road, and brought with it renovations to Baker's kitchen and the college coordinator's office. It was officially opened back to Baker students in the fall semester of 2010, who returned after a year of co- living with students from Duncan College. == Will Rice College == William Marsh Rice Jr. College, commonly known as Will Rice, is named for William M. Rice, Jr., the nephew of the university's founder William Marsh Rice. It incorporates Rice's first dormitory, South Hall, which was built in 1912. Will Rice College began as an all-male college when Rice created its residential college system in 1957 and became co-ed in 1978. Will Rice shares architectural styles with Baker and Hanszen colleges; all three possess white- painted \\"old\\" buildings and more modern \\"new\\" wings. Will Rice's Old Dorm (former South Hall) features a unique fifth-floor tower which has recently become known as The Perch. The symbol of Will Rice college is the Phoenix, depicted in rust and gold colors. Members of the college are known as Will Ricers. The college commonly refers to itself as the \\"college of Gods and Goddesses.\\" The elected governing body of Will Rice, the Diet, administers a university-sponsored annual budget of approximately $50,000 which supports social, athletic, and entertainment programs for the college's nearly 400 resident and non-resident members. Will Rice is traditionally a strong contender in the university's annual campus-wide Beer Bike competition among the residential colleges. Will Rice has held the longest winning streak on record in the alumni race (11 years from 1996 to 2006). Since the inclusion of an alumni race, Will Rice has been the only college to have won the men's, women's, and alumni races in a given year, called a \\"sweep,\\" which it has done on five occasions—1983, 1986, 1999, 2009, and 2013. Additionally, Will Rice holds the current track records for the men's, women's, and alumni races. In 2009, work began on a new residential building for Will Rice, located on the site of the former New Section, built in 1957; this building was completely demolished. A new servery, Abe and Anne Seibel Servery, was also part of the construction project. The new facility serves both Will Rice and Lovett, replacing two dated cafeterias at each college. During construction, the population of Will Rice lived in McMurtry College, which was founded that year. Notable alumni include current CBS News president David Rhodes, former Major League Baseball player Lance Berkman, and architect Charles Renfro of Diller Scofidio + Renfro.http://www.ricethresher.org/article/2014/03/shepherd- to-build-new-opera-house-in-west-lot == Hanszen College == The new wing of Hanszen college Harry Clay Hanszen College was named for a benefactor to the university and chairman of the Rice Board of Governors from 1946 to 1950. Hanszen's \\"Old Wing\\" was known as West Hall when it was built in 1916 as a part of the original campus construction plan by Boston architectural firm Cram, Goodhue & Ferguson. A new housing wing was built in 1957 in conjunction with the development of the residential college system at Rice in response to the expanding undergraduate enrollment. KTRU Rice Radio, the university's student-run radio station, and Rice Coffeehouse both began at Hanszen College. Hanszen was the first residential college at Rice to use its own crest. Shortly after the founding of the residential college system, the students created the blue, black, and yellow crest that in time became the symbol of the college, setting a precedent for the other colleges. Hanszen often hosts guest lecturers; recent visitors include College World Series champion Coach Wayne Graham, former Rice president and renowned economist S. Malcolm Gillis, Kinder Institute for Urban Research director Stephen Klineberg, Texas Monthly senior editor and Hanszen alumnus Paul Burka (class of 1963), former writer and executive producer of The Daily Show Adam Lowitt, and senior editor of The Atlantic Dr. James Hamblin. University courses recently offered by Hanszen College have included Analytics in Sports, Spirituality in Film, and The Culture of Philanthropy. Hanszen College is governed by the Cabinet, a body consisting of the Executive Board and class representatives elected by members of the college annually. The Cabinet supervises an annual budget of nearly $60,000, regulates the use of public spaces within the college, and serves as an official liaison between the College membership and the university administration. Hanszen's theme song is Hanson's \\"MMMBop\\", believed to have been chosen due to the band and the college being homophones. == Wiess College == The commons at Wiess College Harry Carothers Wiess College was one of the original four colleges created when the residential college system was implemented in 1957. In 2002, Wiess became the only college at Rice to relocate from one building to another. Wiess is currently the southwesternmost residential college, located adjacent to Hanszen and the South Power Plant. Male and female members of Wiess College are known equally as Wiessmen. Wiess College is named for Harry Carothers Wiess (1887–1948), one of the founders and one-time president of Humble Oil, now ExxonMobil. He was elected as a life member of the Board of Trustees of Rice University in 1944 and appointed vice- chairman in 1946. He left money for the construction of a new dorm after his death in 1948. Wiess Hall was completed in 1949, but carried the name \\"North Hall\\" until its dedication in March 1950. It was laid out as a W-shaped building, with three north–south wings, joined on the north ends by a long east–west spine, forming two open quadrangles. The building was two stories high except for the three-story center wing. The hall was designed to house about 200 students in 20 single and 90 double rooms. Each room at Wiess opened directly to an exterior walkway that wrapped around the entire building. This design incorporated two features that were innovative at the time: every room had a semi-private bathroom and every room (except room 228, which was reserved for freshmen) had windows on at least two sides—an important adaptation in the years before air conditioning. Wiess Hall became Wiess College in 1957. Converting the dormitory into a college included the creation of two Resident Associate suites, construction of Wiess House, the home of the Master and family, and construction of the Wiess Commons (designed by Wiess undergraduate architecture students Tim \\"Frog\\" Barry and Dan Canty for a class project), the eating hall and round-the-clock gathering space for college members.Box 1, Folder 8, Harry Carothers Wiess College Records, 1950-1999 WRCUAwiess, Woodson Research Center, Fondren Library, Rice University Because of Wiess's outward-facing architecture, life at Wiess centered on the outdoors. The two quadrangles developed distinct characters. The quad between the center and west wings became known as the \\"Acabowl\\" and was the center of the college's social and recreational activity. At various times students installed a trampoline (\\"Aca-tramp\\") or above-ground pool (\\"Aca-pool\\"). The other quadrangle, between the center and east wings, was known by analogy as the \\"Backabowl\\" and tended to be used for quieter activities, such as sunbathing. The original residential building suffered from rapid deterioration in the 1990s. In 2002, the university opened a new building for the college, located south of the original building. New Wiess encloses a single large quadrangle, which retains the \\"Acabowl\\" name. The new building also preserved what Wiessmen considered a salient feature of the old: the fact that all rooms at Wiess open directly onto exterior walkways or balconies. A glass-walled commons forms the north side of the Acabowl, with three four- story residence wings forming the other sides. The portion of the Acabowl immediately adjacent to the commons is known as the Acaterrace. The original Wiess Hall and its adjoining commons were razed during the winter break between Fall 2002 and Spring 2003. Wiess considers itself to have an intense community spirit, signified by the slogan and cheer \\"Team Wiess\\", which has been used consistently since the 1970s. Aspects of Wiess life include Tabletop Theater, the Ubangee, pumpkin caroling, Night of Decadence, Hello, Hamlet!, the turning of the statue of university founder William Marsh Rice, the Pace Mannion fan club, and the War Pig.http://www.futureowls.rice.edu/futureowls/Wiess.asp?SnID=963453189 One of the most influential persons in Wiess history was electrical engineering professor Bill Wilson, who served as resident associate from 1978 to 2006 and as interim Master in 1982–83, which was also the year in which Wiess became a co-ed college. Wilson, known to generations of students as Dr. Bill, was a fixture of Rice's college system and the keeper of many Wiess traditions. In addition to his many teaching awards, he is the only person to have won the Student Association's Mentor Recognition Award twice. After his unexpected death in January 2009, his memorial service was held at the Wiess commons. In December 2009, the Rice board of Trustees, with the consent of Wiess College, decided that the new Masters' residence at Wiess will be named Wilson House, in honor of Dr. Bill. Dedicated on March 11, 2011, Wilson House is the first building at Rice named after a college Master or Resident Associate, and the first Masters' residence to bear a name distinct from that of its associated college. Notable Wiessmen include Walter Loewenstern (1958), Harold Solomon, Ricky Pierce (1982), and Anthony Rendon. == Jones College == Mary Gibbs Jones College, built as the first women's dormitory at Rice University, is named after Mary Gibbs Jones, wife of prominent Houston philanthropist Jesse Holman Jones. Jesse H. Jones supported its initial construction with a $1 million donation. The college was built in 1957, consisting of two four-story structures named \\"North\\" and \\"South.\\" It was designed by architects Lloyd & Morgan. Not only was it the first housing for women on campus, it was also the first building designed specifically as a residential college and also the first building to be centrally air-conditioned. Lloyd & Morgan used pink marble in the construction of Jones College to indicate its status as housing for female students. In 2002, an additional four-story building, \\"Central,\\" was built in between North and South. The new building connects to both original buildings at every level except the ground floor (a short walk separates South and Central). The wing was designed by noted post-modern architect Michael Graves. In the early days, the culture of the all-female Jones College was quite conservative. At meals, each table had a hostess, and dinner was served family style. Strict rules were enforced by house mothers when men from the south colleges visited the female students. The students even had to abide by a strict curfew - 11 p.m. on weekdays and 2 a.m. on weekends. In the 1970s, Jones began phasing out many of the strictest rules, and in the fall of 1980 Jones became co-ed. Male students from the south colleges were given the chance to apply for transfer to Jones. Lovett, another Rice residential college, went co-ed the same year, so many of the new Jones residents were former Lovett residents. Jones women who disagreed with the decision to go co-ed were allowed to transfer to Brown College, which remained all-female until 1987. In 2001, construction began on the new Jones Commons and Jones Central. The new Jones Commons opened for use in March 2002. Jones Central opened in August 2002. During the same time, Jones lost its parking lot to the newly constructed Martel College. Jones' student government is set up as a Cabinet comprising the Executive Officers, elected representatives from each floor, and one elected off-campus representative. The Cabinet meets bi-weekly. Jones is a college with an indoor setup which has two lounges on every floor. Jones is unique among the colleges due to its large number of singles. Jones also has four 4-single suites and two 6-single suites, along with regular doubles. Previous Jones College Magisters include Dr. Franz Brotzen (former Rice University Dean of Engineering) and Dr. Robin Forman (former Rice University Dean of Undergraduates). Notable alumni from Jones include George P. Bush (1998), former Mayor of Houston Annise Parker (1978), and neuroscientist David Eagleman (1993). == Brown College == The new Brown College commons Margarett Root Brown College is currently the third largest of the eleven residential colleges at Rice, behind both McMurtry College and Duncan College. Founded in 1965 as an all-women's college, Brown became co-ed in 1987. The history of Brown dates back to the early sixties, when Jones College was the only all women's college on campus.http://www.brown.rice.edu/about/history.php This caused such a severe housing shortage that some Rice women were housed in the dorms of nearby Texas Women's University. Through the generous $1 million donation of George R. Brown and his wife Alice Pratt Brown, a new women's residential college was established in the memory of their sister-in-law, Margarett Root Brown. Up until her death in 1985, Alice Pratt Brown was an active patron of the college, giving the college much of the furniture and art in the first floor lobbies and private dining room. The old wing of Brown College In the beginning, Brown College was filled primarily with women who had volunteered to leave Jones in order to start a new college. Brown had a housemother who lived in the resident associate’s apartment and required all women to check in and out of the building at night and on weekends. The first Master of Brown was Frank Vandiver, who later became president of Texas A&M.; In 1966 he resigned from Brown because of a “scandal” – the members of Brown voted to drink alcohol in their own rooms (provided they were of legal drinking age). Vandiver resigned because he considered it inappropriate behavior for young ladies. Brown was the last single-sex female college after Jones went co-ed in 1980; male members were first accepted into Brown in 1987. However, the community bathrooms on all floors remained coed until 1994, when the bathrooms were remodeled and separate facilities for men and women were built on each floor. Brown's main tower consists of mainly of double rooms whose residents share community bathrooms. Each floor also has one single room without a bathroom, as well as a double room with a bathroom, referred to as a suite. The new 4-story wing at Brown opened in 2002. The new wing houses 56 additional students, making Brown the largest residential college on campus (it was previously the smallest) until the opening of McMurtry and Duncan. The new wing is made up of four-person suite, and each suite has four small single rooms, a large common room, and a private bathroom. Besides rooms, Brown offers other facilities. For instance, Brown's basement houses a communal laundry room and music practice rooms. Brown's first floor, referred to as \\"Vator Lobby\\" in reference to its use as an elevator lobby, contains a communal kitchen, a computer lab, couches, and amenities such as a projector and pool tables. == Lovett College == The residential building of Lovett College Edgar Odell Lovett College is the seventh-founded residential college, named after the university's first president. Lovett's first class mostly comprised volunteers from other colleges. Lovett sponsors numerous community and social events throughout the year, including theater productions and the Lovett Undergraduate Research Symposium. Lovett's college crest is based upon the Lovat family crestRice University Woodson Research Center Lovett College Records 1968-2007. Box 1, Folder 2 although the Lovat family is not related to Edgar Odell Lovett. Lovett College during construction The distinctive brutalist architecture of Lovett has led many to compare it to a giant toaster. This is due to the concrete grating that surrounds the third, fourth, and fifth floors, a design feature intended to make Lovett riot-proof in reaction to the student riots of the late 1960s, most notably the Abbie Hoffman riot of April 1970. In 2009, work began on renovating a portion of Baker College's former New Section, which was transferred over to become Lovett's New Section starting in the 2010 fall semester. A new servery, shared with Will Rice College, was recently built as part of the construction project and named Seibel Servery. Notable alumni include James Casey, Luke Willson, José Cruz, Jr., John Doerr, Brock Wagner, John Kline, Ann Saterbak, Alberto Gonzales, and Matt Anderson. Nobel Laureate Robert Curl was the first college Master, and George H.W. Bush served as a community associate.Raphael, Michael: The History of Student Life at Rice University: A Series of Papers, Appendix A. Rice University Centennial Celebration Committee, 1990. == Sid Richardson College == Sid Richardson College as seen from the North side. Sid Richardson College (also referred to as Sid, SRC, or Sid Rich) opened in 1971 as a men's residential college. Like the other residential colleges on the Rice campus, Sid Richardson College provides undergraduate residential and dining facilities, social organizations and student government, as well as faculty, alumni, and community associates. A $2 million pledge from the Sid Richardson Foundation, which was established by Texas oilman, cattleman, and philanthropist Sid W. Richardson (1891–1959), funded the construction of the college. The college became co-ed in 1987. Members of Sid Richardson College are called \\"Sidizens.\\" Sid Richardson College is the tallest building on the Rice campus. It has seven floors, each of which is split into an upper and lower level, effectively giving the building fourteen stories. Unusual among Rice buildings, the high-rise was a response to a shortage of University land and was designed by the architectural firm Neuhaus and Taylor. Sid Rich has enough beds to accommodate 229 students. Original plans called for the eventual construction of a second tower, but the plan was never followed through. In similar fashion to Lovett, the Sid Masters' house is connected to the residential tower; it comprises the first floor of the tower, while the mezzanine of the residential building is actually the second floor of the tower. The first floor of Sid features a commons, a private dining room, and an OC (off-campus) lounge. The lounge consists of a pool table, a ping pong table, and a television set. Although Sid Richardson College is not built around a quad, there is a similar outdoor feature of the college known as the \\"country club.\\" The country club consists of a field, volleyball court, hammock, an adult-sized swing set, and many picnic tables. Aggies copyright Michael Petry In addition to providing basic residential and social services to its residents, Sid Richardson College is rich with traditions, which have included some notorious pranks. For example, Sidizens have made use of the six balconies towering above the main entrance of the college to \\"douche\\" unsuspecting visitors—including past Rice University president George Rupp and his wife—with buckets of water as they climb the steps to the double doors. While such \\"free-flowing water\\" is the only sanctioned projectile, rogue students have also flung flour tortillas, shrimp, and, in one particularly infamous situation, a couch. During the mid-1970s, students moved a Karman Ghia automobile into the dining area. Photographic evidence can be found in the Rice Campanile. Another prank that is quickly becoming a tradition is the Orc Raid. Orc Raids are held twice every year - once during the Orientation Week in August before the start of the Fall semester and a second time during Willy Week in the Spring semester. Sidizens dress up by smearing themselves with black paint, wearing black clothes and carrying around torches with doll heads. They then proceed to run around campus at night to terrorize the other colleges and crash events, often shouting out cheers that boost the morale of the Sidizens as well as anti-cheers meant to belittle the 'lesser' colleges. Sid Richardson College has a wealth of traditions. Every Friday afternoon from 3:00-6:00pm, the college's main speakers, affectionately known as the \\"stacks,\\" blast music in what is known as \\"Radio Free Sid\\" (the named derived from Radio Free Europe of the Cold War era) across the campus from the 7th floor balcony. Radio Free Sid begins and ends each roughly 3-hour-long set of music with AC/DC's \\"Back in Black,\\" widely considered to be the college's theme song. Other traditions include Night of Innocence (a showing of Disney movies in the commons the same night as NOD), Sid 80s (Sid's fall public party), Sid Hi-Liter (spring public party), vatoring of Sidizens who co- advise, Floor Wars (a series of competitive events between the floors), Squid Richardson Day, and more. Sid Richardson has also hosted the five Houston Conferences on Theoretical Neuroscience (2004-2009), thanks to a relationship between the GCC and former Sid Richardson Master Steve Cox. Notable alumni include Steve Jackson, Philip Humber, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest,http://m.ricethresher.org/news/article_ec6e0d2f-f553-553d-9716-4aa3d78a9f6c.html?mode=jqm and Mark Durcan,Durcan's profile on LinkedIn CEO of Micron Technology. == Martel College == Martel's sally port rotunda, with the sundeck The cathedral-like Commons The infamous \\"Beer Goat\\" keg holder Marian and Speros P. Martel College is the ninth-founded residential college. It was established with a $15 million donation from the eponymous Marian and Speros Martel Foundation, a longtime benefactor of Rice University. The college's building was designed by noted architect Michael Graves and housed its first students during the 2002–2003 school year. Martel is one of eleven residential colleges at Rice University, and it is the only one that has a Sallyport of its own; it is located adjacent to Jones and Duncan colleges on the north side of campus, sharing the North Servery with the former. The college prides itself on its adopted Greek heritage, a tribute to its benefactors' country of origin. Aspects of Greek culture are incorporated into a number of college events, and an interior staircase of the college features a four-story map of Athens painted by Joshua Krezinski (class of 2007). The second and fourth quadrants of Martel's crest represent the cross and stripes of the Greek flag, while the other two are reserved for the Athenian owl, a symbol of wisdom taken from the university's academic seal, and the \\"MC\\" glyph representing the College's name. The crest was designed by the building's architect. The Martel College colors are representative of the Greek flag and the building's architecture. The blazon of the Greek flag is \\"Azure, four bars Argent; on a canton of the field a Greek cross throughout of the second.\\" While azure often associates with a deeper blue, Martel College uses a lighter tincture of azure known as bleu celeste or \\"sky blue\\". Also, the argent used by the college favors a bright, reflective white instead of the more silvery tincture. Maroon represents the building's brick and paint scheme. Members of Martel college are known as \\"Martelians\\". As the third-most-recently founded residential college, Martel's history is short, and commonly includes the story of Speros Martel, the Greek immigrant whose estate provided the funding necessary to build the college. The official groundbreaking of the new Martel college took place on April 10, 2000. Among those attending were the newly instated Martel Magisters Joan and Arthur Few, who had previously been Masters at Baker College from 1994 to 1999. The first new students accepted as members of Martel were required to live off campus during the fall 2001 semester until the completion of the College's construction, which was scheduled for early 2002. However, in June 2001, Tropical Storm Allison struck the Houston area and delayed this by two months. Applications for freshman transfers were made available in October 2002. Sixty-three freshmen were accepted, five each from Brown and Jones Colleges, and up to 12 from each of the other colleges. Martel members named physics instructor Gary Morris and intramural sports director Tina Villard as Martel's first resident associates. Martel's student government is named the Parliament, and meets weekly in the College commons. Elected officials include President, Vice President, Prime Minister, Treasurer, Secretary, Chief Justice, and Class Representatives (4 per class). Michael Graves, architect of Martel College, designed the four-story, building. Formed around a central quadrangle, Graves's design follows the style of the 1910 general plan of Boston architect Ralph Adams Cram for the Rice campus. Martel is an open, four-sided shape. Each side of the shape forms a wing of the college. The wings terminate on the side closest to North Servery in a five-story rotunda, a spiral staircase enclosed within a stack of rounded floors, providing the college with its sundeck, where many events are held. The easternmost wing contains common areas, the game room, a kitchen, and the TV room. The rotunda leads into the Commons, a cathedral-like room with a high ceiling that serves as a cafeteria, meeting room, and auditorium, among other functions. The college also includes two apartments for Martel's resident associates and a neighboring house for the College Magisters and their family. Nearly every room at Martel is suite style, and is either referred to as a hex, or a quad. There are two kinds of hexes, sally port and corner hexes. Corner hexes have 6 single rooms and sallyport hexes have 3 double rooms. Every suite at martel has a private bathroom. Rooming is overseen by the Vice President. Martel is also the only college to feature a sally port in its construction; newly matriculated students traditionally walk through it passing a torch between themselves as the final step to becoming new Martelians. Alumni include Chris Boswell, Pittsburgh Steelers kicker, Jason Colwick, 2009 NCAA pole vault champion, Andrew Chifari, Starbucks most expensive drink record breaker, Mithun Mansinghani, the Oklahoma Solicitor General, and Morris Almond, a professional basketball player. == McMurtry College == Burt and Deedee McMurtry College is the tenth college founded as part of Rice's residential college system. McMurtry College was named after Burt and Deedee McMurtry, graduates of the Rice class of 1956. Burt McMurtry was part of the student-faculty committee that evaluated the need for and eventually instituted the college system at Rice University, beginning in 1957 with the original five colleges. The college was conceived jointly with the adjacent Duncan College as part of Rice's vision for the 2nd century, which includes plans to increase the size of the student body by 30%. The college opened on August 16, 2009. View of McMurtry college quad from roof deck Despite its status as a young college, McMurtry has already established its own unique culture. During the Spring 2009 Beer Bike, McMurtry was christened in the Thresher newspaper as the \\"Mongol College\\", as it had not been finished at the time yet it was involved in pranks during Willy Week, and it could not be pranked by any other college as McMurtry wasn't complete. This was due to O-Week coordinators and advisers and co-advisers of McMurtry (chosen a semester ahead) showing their spirit for the upcoming new college. McMurtry has been assuming much of this \\"Mongol\\" culture by referring to the round commons as \\"Yurt,\\" a name that also references the fact that due to construction delays caused by Hurricane Ike, McMurtry was forced to use a tent as its commons for weeks until the actual commons was completed. McMurtry is also known as the banana college, and the fruit is used as a popular symbol by students, including in college cheers like \\"McMurtry is bananas, B-A-N-A-N- A-S.\\" The building was designed by Hopkins Architects, a leading English firm specializing in sustainable architecture. It offers 324 beds for student housing. The college is constructed as a single, squared-off horseshoe-shaped wing surrounding a central quad, rising to a height of five stories. The college has double and single rooms that open directly out onto interior hallways, in contrast to the exterior hallways at Martel and Wiess, which were previously the two most recently renovated colleges. Common showers are located around the stairwells at each \\"elbow\\" in the building, and fully functional pod bathrooms are located in each double bedroom. The first floor contains study rooms, a game room, music room, other amenities, and the only circular commons on campus. McMurtry College is across from Duncan Hall and the Inner Loop road. Duncan College is immediately north of it, connected to McMurtry by West Servery, which is parallel to Abercrombie Engineering Laboratory. It is also identical to Duncan College. The pair are commonly referred to as McDuncan. == Duncan College == Anne and Charles Duncan College is the eleventh college founded as part of Rice's residential college system. Duncan College was named after Anne and Charles Duncan, Jr., long-standing contributors to Rice University who donated money for the new college. The college was conceived jointly with the adjacent McMurtry College as part of Rice's Vision for the 2nd century, which includes plans to increase the size of the student body by 30%. Duncan opened its doors on August 16, 2009, right in time for O-Week 2009, which saw the arrival of the first Duncan freshman class. Due to renovations in Baker College and in order to help the new college adapt to the university, Baker College students lived in Duncan with the first freshman class. This led to the joint name of \\"BaDunc\\" for sporting and other events. Duncan began to operate by itself beginning in fall 2010 with a new freshman class, a returning sophomore class, and upperclassmen consisting of students from other colleges who accepted invitations to transfer. The college's first Masters, Marnie Hylton and Luis Duno-Gottberg, remained with Duncan for several years, and the final constitution went through its final stages before approval. It has also chosen its colors as forest green, white, and gold. It chose government officials, RAs, and a College Coordinator in the spring of 2010, and the crest was revealed during the fall 2010 semester at the dedication ceremony. Due to the request and contribution of Anne and Charles Duncan, Duncan College is one of the \\"greenest\\" buildings on Rice campus, as well as the entire city of Houston. Like nearby McMurtry College, the five-story building was designed by Hopkins Architects of London and offers 324 beds for student housing. The building is the first gold-level Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) facility at Rice and the first LEED student residential-housing in the United States. The facility is designed to retain water for irrigation purposes and has motion detector lights which will turn on or off according to the flow of people. The building will decrease energy consumption by up to 25% as well as cut back on water usage. Air conditioners power off when windows are opened. One of Duncan's traditions is stealing Will Rice's flag Duncan College has also established a Monday night tradition, known as \\"Monday Night Lights.\\" When a few students went down to play ping-pong one night, they noticed that the ping pong table they had played on actually belonged to Baker College, who took its table back. Instead of going to bed, they made a makeshift table in the quad out of extra tables and using toilet paper as the net. People noticed the table and came down to the quad join in, watch and even play acoustic instruments. Monday Night Lights is now a monthly event. Other traditions include \\"Duncing\\" people in the DuncTank outside the commons on their birthdays, temporarily borrowing prized artifacts from other colleges including Will Rice's flag and Jones' trampoline, and a once a semester Nerf Gun capture the flag game throughout the building called Donnybrook. Architecturally, Duncan has the same features as McMurtry with minor differences emphasized in order to establish its uniqueness. For example, Duncan Commons is rectangular in shape, contrasting the round McMurtry Commons. Also, Duncan quad has different features from McMurtry, such as a fountain by the Commons, smaller trees, and walkways that go across the quad. The interior, however, is virtually the same, as both colleges contain mostly doubles in the hallways and single rooms in the corners, with doubles having a pod bathroom inside and singles sharing common bathrooms. Both also have green roofs and fifth floor doubles and suites that open to the outside. The interior hallways of both Duncan and McMurtry were designed as contrasts to the other two most recently built residential colleges, Martel and Wiess, which have exterior hallways. The pair of McMurtry and Duncan are commonly referred to as McDuncan. == References  External links == * Residential College homepage * About Beer Bike * Beer Bike History and Statistics * Will Rice College at the Woodson Research Center * Photographic study of Old Wiess Category:Rice University Category:University and college dormitories in the United States Rice University residential colleges ","title":"Residential colleges of Rice University"},{"id":"20346538","text":"Words and Music contains 10 songs from 1981's Glen Campbell Live and combines them with the only CD release thus far of the 1965 Country Shindig compilation album. ==Track listing== # \\"Rhinestone Cowboy\\" (Larry Weiss) - 3:15 # \\"Gentle on My Mind\\" (John Hartford) - 2:06 # \\"By The Time I Get To Phoenix\\" (Jimmy Webb) - 2:45 # \\"Dreams of the Everyday Housewife\\" (Chris Gantry) - 2:12 # \\"It's Only Make Believe\\" (Conway Twitty, Jack Nance) - 2:39 # \\"Crying\\" (Roy Orbison, Joe Melson) - 3:35 # \\"Southern Nights\\" (Allen Toussaint) - 3:59 # \\"Try A Little Kindness\\" (Sapaugh, Austin) - 2:36 # \\"Medley\\" - 4:29 ## \\"Wichita Lineman\\" (Jimmy Webb) ## \\"Galveston\\" (Jimmy Webb) ## \\"Country Boy (You Got Your Feet In LA)\\" (Dennis Lambert, Brian Potter) # \\"Please Come To Boston\\" (Dave Loggins) - 3:42 # \\"Greenfields\\" (Gilkyson, Dehr, Miller) - 2:20 # \\"The Man With The Golden Gun\\" (John Barry) - 2:25 # \\"Cherry Beat\\" (Bond) - 2:35 # \\"Gospel Harp\\" (Russell) - 2:07 # \\"Shindig Hoot\\" (Glen Campbell) - 2:17 # \\"Greenback Dollar\\" (Axton, Ramsey) - 2:00 # \\"If I Had a Hammer\\" (Trad. arr. by Lee Hays, Pete Seeger) - 2:50 # \\"Walk Right In\\" (Cannon.

The latter, founded in York in 1831, was one of numerous Victorian learned societies dedicated to the advancement of science. Like The Pickwick Papers, The Mudfog Papers claims affinity with parliamentary reports, memoirs and posthumous papers. The serial was illustrated by George Cruikshank. The fictional town of Mudfog was based on Chatham in Kent, where Dickens spent part of his youth. When Oliver Twist first appeared in Bentley's Miscellany in February 1837, Mudfog was described by Dickens as the town where Oliver was born and spent his early years, making Oliver Twist related to The Mudfog Papers, but this allusion was removed when the novel was published as a book.Bentley's Miscellany, 1837 At the conclusion of his first contribution, about the mayor of the provincial town of Mudfog, Dickens explains that \\"this is the first time we have published any of our gleanings from this particular source\\", referring to The Mudfog Papers.

Hurst Reservoir was on the Hurst Brook and Mossy Lea Reservoir was to take water from the Shelf Brook. Only the Hurst Reservoir was constructed before the money ran out. Mossy Lea Reservoir was later constructed privately by the Duke of Norfolk. His engineer and surveyor was John Frederick Bateman. The reservoir was taken over in 1929 by the Glossop Corporation Waterworks. This became part of the Manchester Corporation Waterworks in 1959. Swineshaw Reservoir, Hurst Reservoir and Mossy Lea Reservoir are no longer in service. In 2013, Hurst Reservoir embankment was removed and the silt that had built up over the previous 175 years was dispersed within the Hurst valley. The reservoir was decommissioned because it had not been used for drinking water for 25 years and maintenance of the dam could no longer be justified. Following the removal of the embankment, a small pond (fire break) was retained to benefit wildlife, with the stream being returned to its original course. ==See also== *List of reservoirs and dams in the United Kingdom == References == Category:Reservoirs of the Peak District Category:Drinking water reservoirs in England Category:Reservoirs in Derbyshire ","title":"Hurst Reservoir"},{"id":"20346654","text":"Microfilaria of Dirofilaria immitis (heartworms) in a lymph node impression smear from a dog with lymphoma.

Journal of the Helminthological Society of Washington 62(1):32-34. it is seldom used today. Microfilaria found in blood slides LACEN State Laboratory of Amazonas Brazil The microfilaria (plural microfilariae, sometimes abbreviated mf) is an early stage in the life cycle of certain parasitic nematodes in the family Onchocercidae.Anderson, R.C. (2000) Nematode Parasites of Vertebrates: Their Development and Transmission. Second Edition. CABI Publishing: Wallingford, England, pp. 472-475. In these species, the adults live in a tissue or the circulatory system of vertebrates (the \\"definitive hosts\\"). They release microfilariae into the bloodstream of the vertebrate host. The microfilariae are taken up by blood-feeding arthropod vectors (the \\"intermediate hosts\\"). In the intermediate host the microfilariae develop into infective larvae that can be transmitted to a new vertebrate host. The presence of microfilariae in the host bloodstream is called \\"microfilaraemia\\". The success of filariasis eradication programs is typically gauged by the reduction in numbers of circulating microfilariae in infested individuals within a geographic area.Farid, H.A., Z.S. Morsy, H. Helmy, R.M.R. Ramzy, M. El Setouhy, and G.J. Weil (2007) \\"A critical appraisal of molecular xenomonitoring as a tool for assessing progress toward elimination of lymphatic filariasis.\\" American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene 77(4):593-600. ==Escaping the circulatory system== All parasites need a mechanism for spreading to new individual hosts. Parasites in the lower gastrointestinal tract usually shed eggs in the host feces. Tissue-dwelling parasites, such as Trichinella spiralis (cause of trichinosis), rely on new hosts eating the tissues of their current host. For members of the family Onchocercidae whose adults live in the \\"closed\\" vertebrate circulatory system, transmission to a new host is achieved by the microfilaria stage, with the help of blood-feeding arthropod vectors. This system is seen in the life cycle of Elaeophora schneideri.Hibler, C.P. and C.J. Metzger (1974) Morphology of the larval stages of Elaeophora schneideri in the intermediate and definitive hosts with some observations on their pathogenesis in abnormal definitive hosts. Journal of Wildlife Diseases 10(4):361-369. The adults of E. schneideri typically reside in the carotid artery of its definitive host, the Mule deer. The female may be up to 12 cm (almost 5 inches) long, and releases microfilariae which measure 207 by 13 μm (or 0.008 by 0.00051 inches) into the bloodstream of the host. The blood flow carries the microfilariae away from the female in the carotid artery, and directly into the branching arteries of the head and face. Because of their size, the microfilariae pass easily through successively smaller vessels, becoming physically lodged in the small capillaries near the skin surface of the face and head. Attracted by the carbon dioxide exhaled by the mule deer, the blood-feeding female horse fly often lands on the head or face to feed. The horse fly uses its scissor-like mouthparts to cut the surface of the skin, creating a pool of blood which it takes in through its sucking mouthparts. The microfilariae, which were just under the surface of the skin, are small enough to be ingested whole by the horse fly. Once inside the horse fly, the microfilariae bore through the stomach wall, and mature into infective larvae about two weeks later. These larvae migrate to the head and mouthparts of the horse fly, and enter the bloodstream of another vertebrate host when the horse fly feeds again. ==Microfilaria as a developmental stage== Most recent parasitology textbooks consider the microfilariae to be \\"pre-larvae or advanced embryos\\" which will develop into the first stage larvae (L1) in the arthropod vector (p. 364Bogitsh, B.J., C.E. Carter and T.N. Oeltmann (2005) Human Parasitology. 3rd Edition. Elsevier: Burlington, MA. .). Some consider them to be the first larval stage, such as \\"microfilariae; i.e. first larva (= L1)\\" (p. 361Mehlhorn, H. (ed) (2001) Encyclopedic Reference of Parasitology: Biology, Structure and Function. 2nd Edition. Springer: Berlin). In either case, the microfilaria is the stage which develops from the egg. In most tissue-dwelling species the eggs hatch in the uterus of the female, and the unsheathed microfilariae are released. In most blood-dwelling species, embryonated eggs (or, microfilariae which are said to be sheathed in the envelope of the egg) are released; and they will only exsheath (\\"hatch\\") after being ingested by the arthropod intermediate host. All microfilariae burrow through the stomach wall after being eaten by the arthropod host, and develop into infective third stage (L3) larvae. Many of the organs of microfilariae are in a very early stage of development. For some species, the developmental fates of individual cells have been followed from the microfilaria stage to the adult worm. The microfilariae of many species undergo a development phase called the \\"sausage stage\\", becoming temporarily shorter and thicker, while the first-stage (L1) larval organs develop. In some species of Onchocercidae , the release of microfilariae by the adult female is periodic - occurring daily at a particular time of the day or night. This timing increases the chance that they will be picked up by a blood-feeding arthropod vector, which are often more active at certain times of the day. == References == Kolte SS, Satarkar RN, Mane PM.

MARSA is an acronym for Military Authority Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft. MARSA procedures are used when military aircraft must operate in close proximity and with close coordination. Under such conditions, it may be impractical for standard civilian air traffic controllers to ensure safe separation of the aircraft. MARSA procedures delegate the separation responsibility temporarily to the military authority operating the flights, thereby relieving ATC of the separation workload. When operations in close proximity have concluded, the designated military authority relinquishes responsibility back to ATC, and normal ATC procedures resume. Typical applications of MARSA procedures include military formation flights and in-flight refueling operations. MARSA operations are defined by regulatory documents and agreements between civilian and military aviation authorities. MARSA operations are initiated under specific conditions and terminated under equally specific conditions, using precisely defined steps to formally transfer responsibility to and from military authorities. ==Sources== * FAA, Order JO 7110.65W, Air Traffic Organization Policy Retrieved: 1 Sep 2016. ==ReferencesSee also== *Aerial refueling *GIANT KILLER *Wingman Category:Air traffic control in the United States Category:American military aviation ","title":"MARSA (aviation)"},{"id":"20346716","text":"8HA is a radio station based in Alice Springs, Northern Territory, Australia.

It is also known by its NATO reporting name SS-1b Scud-A. It was the first of several similar Soviet missiles to be given the reporting name Scud. Variant R-11M was accepted into service, with GRAU index 9K51. The R-11 originated from a 1951 requirement for a ballistic missile with similar performance to the German V-2 rocket, but half its size. With the Wasserfall, an anti- aircraft version of the V-2, as a model the R-11 was developed by engineer Victor Makeev, who was then working in OKB-1, headed by Sergey Korolyov. The two men agreed on the use of RP-1 as the fuel, but disagreed over which oxidizer to use, with Korolev favouring the use of liquid oxygen, while Makeev advocated the use of a storable but toxic oxidizer. Makeev's version, that first flew on 18 April 1953, was fitted with an Isayev engine using RP-1 and nitric acid.

In June 1955, Makeev was appointed chief designer of the SKB-385 to oversee the programme and, in July, the R-11 was formally accepted into military service. The definitive R-11M, designed to carry a nuclear warhead, was accepted officially into service on 1 April 1958. The launch system received the GRAU index 9K51, the rocket itself 8K11, and the launcher 8U218.Rochowicz, Robert (2018) (in Polish). Rakiety operacyjne i taktyczne w Siłach Zbrojnych PRL. „Poligon” No. 1/2018(62), p. 56-63, ISSN 1895-3344 Like the V-2, the R-11 relied on inertial guidance, and its flight was controlled by four graphite vanes in the engine exhaust, that were active only while the motor was burning. The R-11M had a maximum range of 270 kilometres, but when carrying a nuclear warhead, this was reduced to 170 kilometres, hence an alternative designation R-170. At maximum range, it was found to have an average range error 1.19 kilometres and an azimuth error of 0.66 kilometres.Zaloga, p.4 It was used as a mobile nuclear strike vector, giving the Soviet Army the ability to hit European targets from forward areas. To give the system sufficient mobility on the battlefield, the R-11 was mounted on the chassis of an IS-2 tank, that became its first transporter erector launcher 8U218. Main payload was a nuclear warhead with an estimated yield of 10, 20 or 40 kilotons. There was also HE-Frag warhead 9N33 with 535 kg of explosive. A naval variant, the R-11FM (SS-N-1 Scud-A) was first tested at Kapustin Yar in February 1955, and was first launched from a converted Project 611 (Zulu class) submarine in September of the same year. While the initial design was done by Korolev's OKB-1, the programme was transferred to Makeyev's SKB-385 in August 1955. It became operational in 1959 as the D-1 launch system, the world's first submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM),Zaloga, p.8 and was deployed onboard Project 611 and Project 629 (Golf Class) submarines, until its replacement by the R-13 in 1961 (SS-N-4) and the R-21 (SS-N-5) in 1963. During its service, 77 launches were conducted, of which 59 were successful. The success of the R-11FM established Makeev as the main designer of submarine- launched weapons for the Soviet military. ==See also== *Hwasong-5 *Hwasong-6 *R-17 Elbrus *Scud == References  External links == * Ballistic Missile Reference from the Federation of American Scientists * Missile Threat: A Project of the George C.

The commoner origins of Ramose and the rise of his son Senenmut were long considered to be prime examples of high social mobility in New Kingdom Egypt. For instance, almost nothing is known of Ramose's origins, but he seems to have been a man of modest means—anything from a tenant peasant or farmer, to an artisan or even a small landowner. When Ramose died he was a man aged 50–60 (based on the dental evidence).Peter F. Dorman, In: The Theban Necropolis, Past, Present and Future, p. 32, note 17 Hatnofer was an elderly lady, with grey or even white hair. They are believed to have been born at Armant, a town only south of Thebes within Upper Egypt presumably during the reign of Ahmose I, the founder of Egypt's illustrious 18th dynasty. ==Tomb of Ramose and Hatnofer== Chair from Ramose and Hatnofer's tomb The Heart Scarab of Hatnefer, on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Ramose is known from a few contemporary sources. He appears on the false doorNeues Reich and likely, also on the chapel of Senenmut's TT71 tomb chapel. Ramose and Hatnofer's own tomb was not located far from the chapel (TT71) of his son Senemut. The tomb of Ramose contained his mummy as well as that of Hatnofer (Hatnefret), who was the wife of Ramose and mother of Senenmut. It was found intact by Wiliam Hayes and Ambrose Lansing of the Metropolitan Museum's Egyptian expedition in excavation work conducted under a hillside terrace at Sheikh Abd el-Qurna hill in Western Thebes during the 1935-1936 archaeological season.Kathryn A. Bard & Steven Blake Shubert, Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt, Routledge, 1999. p.819 Ramose and Hatnofer were buried in the tomb along with six other anonymous poorly wrapped mummies (three women and three unknown children) who are assumed to be family members of the couple. Initially, Lansing and Hayes interpreted the 6 bodies as grisly evidence that Senenmut's family had been struck by a sudden tragedy: : ...that eight persons of the same family or group should have died so nearly at the same time that they could be buried together on one occasion is certainly extraordinary, but seems, nevertheless, to be what actually happened.A. Lansing & W. Hayes, The Egyptian Expedition 1935-36, Bulletin of the Metropolitan Museum of Art (BMMA), New York (1937), 32.2:31-21 Some Egyptologists believe that all burials in their tomb took place at the same time. Peter F. Dorman: 'Family burial and commemoration in the Theban necropolis' In: The Theban Necropolis, Past, Present and Future, Hrsg. N. Strudwick; J.H. Taylor, (David Brown Book Company: March 2004), S.30-41 However, during the New Kingdom, it was often customary to use a tomb's burial chambers for several family members, who died at different times. As Joyce Tyldesley notes, it is far more likely that these 6 additional bodies represent members of Senenmut's immediate family: : who had previously been buried nearby; their decayed [mummy] wrappings and disarticulated skeletons encrusted with mud suggest that they too had been retrieved from less impressive cemeteries. The re-burial of private individuals, while not common, was certainly not unknown at this time, and Senenmut's filial devotion would have met with general approval.Joyce Tyldesley, Hatchepsut: The Female Pharaoh, Penguin Books, 1996 hardback, pp.183 Moreover, the Metropolitan Museum archaeologists convincingly demonstrated that the personal possessions in the tomb chamber of Ramose and Hatnofer were Hatnofer's alone since their items were all appropriate for a woman.Lansing & Hayes, BMMA, op. cit., p.22 Of the mummies in the chamber, Hatnofer's alone: : had been carefully mummified in linen from Hatshepsut's royal estate and equipped with a complete funeral outfit consisting of a gilded mask, a heart scarab, funerary papyri, and canopic equipment. By contrast, Ramose in his painted anthropoid coffin and the other six mummies (three young women and three children) interred in the two plain deal coffins had received no such attention, and their remains were mere skeletons.Peter F. Dorman: The Monuments of Senenmut: Problems in Historical Methadology, London: Kegan Paul Ltd., 1988. p.168 These six other burials, all from the early 18th dynasty \\"were found in the loose scree of the hillside as well as deposits of hunting weapons and the coffins of a horse and an ape.\\" Ramose and Hatnofer's tomb conveys a comparatively simple impression and was initially considered, by Egyptologists, as evidence for the humble personal origins of Ramose in particular. Ramose and Hatnofer's tomb is notable for featuring the earliest known date from Hatshepsut's reign. A collection of grave goods found in the tomb's chamber contained a single pottery jar or amphorae—which was stamped with the date 'Year 7'. Another jar from the same collection—which was discovered in situ by the Metropolitan Museum of Art expedition—was stamped with the seal of the 'God's Wife Hatshepsut' while two jars bore the seal of The Good Goddess Maatkare. The dating of the amphorae, which had been \\"sealed into the [tomb's] burial chamber by the debris from Senenmut's own tomb,\\" is certain and establishes that Hatshepsut was recognised by her subjects as the king of Egypt by Year 7 of her reign. ==Differing interpretations for the background of Senenmut's parents== Hatnofer's gold gilded funerary mask (Metropolitan Museum of Art) Ramose only held the title and non-specific epithet of zab ('the worthy') in his tomb.Tyldesley, p.180 The excavators of the tomb assumed, therefore, that Ramose was once only a simple farmer since \\"The Worthy\\" was \\"a polite but somewhat meaningless apellation invariably used for the respected dead.\\" However, it is often noted in the archaeological evidence, that many high state officials including some viziers carried the title zab even if it was only a post-mortem reference to them. This title, therefore, states almost nothing about the social origins of Ramose. Since Senenmut was able to join the roughly 10% of Egypt's society who were educated and later won favour as Hatshepsut's chief architect, it seems highly unlikely that Ramose was a mere farmer; Ramose must have instead held a higher position in Egyptian society to enable his son to be literate. More remarkable, however, is the comparison of the funerals of Ramose with that of his wife Hatnofer. Hatnofer had a rich gilded funerary mask, heart scarab, canopic jars, papyri and \\"a selection of traditional grave goods suitable for a woman\\" donated for her interment.Tyldesley, p.182 In contrast, Ramose's burial only featured his coffin. It is assumed that Hatnofer died when her son had already achieved his high state position under Hatshepsut; hence, the rich funerary goods must have been provided for by her influential son, Senenmut. In contrast, since Ramose was equipped with inferior funerary equipment, Senenmut's position in the Egyptian state was still comparatively minor when his father died. When Hatnofer died of old age between Year 6 or Year 7 of Hatshepsut, Senenmut was now wealthy enough to arrange to have his father Ramose resurrected from \\"his more lowly resting-place, hastily re-bandaged, placed in a painted anthropoid coffin and re-united with his wife\\" Hatnofer who had been more expensively mummified in their hillside tomb. The coffin of Ramose was fitted with gold which thereby implied some social status for him. The absence of an expected rock cut chapel in Ramose and Hatnofer's tomb is not surprising since few New Kingdom tombs featured such a chapel prior to the reign of Hatshepsut. By performing a more careful and critical examinination of the sources, it would appear that Ramose was perhaps already a minor official of the early 18th dynasty during his career. The ascent of his son to the highest public offices rests perfectly within the bounds of possibility of Ancient Egyptian society. However, Tyldesley stresses that: : The Ancient Egyptians did not suffer from any sense of false modesty. They felt that their official titles were an important part of the personality, and it was customary for all ranks and decorations, no matter how trivial, to be recorded for posterity. An Egyptian would only have considered omitting a lowly or unimportant title from his parent's tomb if it had been superseded by more prestigious accolade. We must, therefore, assume that Ramose and Hatnofer, with their rather modest epithets and undistinguished tomb, did not play a prominent role in public life. Another option is that the tomb of Ramose was robbed shortly after his burial and that Ramose was reburied with his wife when she died.M. Eaton-Krauss, Journal of Egyptian Archaeology 94 (2008), p.290 Again, this makes it hard to pinpoint any social background for Ramose and Senenmut, as it would be impossible to make any statements about the quality of his original burial equipment. Senenmut's mother Hatnofer—the daughter of a lady named Sitdjehuty—was herself simply identified as 'Mistress of the House', which was a very general title awarded to married women. When Hatnofer died, she was a short, at just over five feet tall, but somewhat stout lady of about 60 years old. Hatnofer was interred with several mirrors which were made of highly polished bronze or silver set into wood or metal handles as well as a bronze razor, which was found along with other cosmetic devices inside a basket in her tomb. ==References== Category:People of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt Category:Ancient Egyptian mummies ","title":"Ramose and Hatnofer"},{"id":"20346796","text":"The 1995 All-Pro Team is composed of the National Football League players that were named to the Associated Press, Pro Football Writers Association, and The Sporting News All-Pro Teams in 1995.

In 2006, Young led all minor leaguers in stolen bases with 87. He then won the Arizona Fall League batting title, finishing with a .430 average. Young appeared in the 2009 Futures Game, hitting a three-run home run. The world team won 7 to 5. ===Colorado Rockies=== Young made his major league debut on August 25, 2009, for the Colorado Rockies playing center field. He had his first career hit in this game during the 5th inning and ended the game 1-4. Eric Young Sr. was in attendance for his son's debut. On September 8, 2009, Young Jr. hit his first career home run in the bottom of the 6th inning against the Cincinnati Reds. During spring training for the 2010 season, Young was optioned to the team's Triple-A affiliate, the Colorado Springs Sky Sox. On April 25, 2010, Young was recalled to the Rockies from Colorado Springs. On May 15, 2010, he suffered a stress fracture and was placed on the DL. He would return from the DL to Coors Field on August 14, 2010. On May 27, 2011, he was called back up to the Rockies with an above .300 batting average with the Sky Sox. ===New York Mets=== Young was designated for assignment on June 12, 2013, and traded to the New York Mets on June 18, 2013, in exchange for Collin McHugh. On July 24, 2013, Young was involved in a season-ending accident with Tim Hudson. Hudson was covering the first base bag, and Young attempted to beat the groundout. When Young stepped late on the bag, his cleat dug hard into Hudson's ankle full stride, unnaturally rolling it. This incident broke Hudson's ankle and ultimately ended Hudson's last season with the Braves. Young expressed extreme concern for Hudson after the play ended.Braves' Hudson breaks ankle in win against Mets On August 2, 2013, Young hit the first walk-off hit of his career, a two-run home run, in the 11th inning against the Kansas City Royals.

He was one of nine players competing to be the Brewers center fielder for the 2016 season. Center field was one of the last positions the Brewers decided, but Young did not make the Opening Day roster. ===New York Yankees=== On August 31, 2016, the Brewers traded Young to the New York Yankees for cash considerations. The Yankees assigned him to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders. ===Los Angeles Angels=== On January 24, 2017, the Angels signed Young Jr. to a minor league deal, later calling him up to replace the injured Mike Trout. On May 31, Young hit a game-winning solo home run in the eighth inning to give the Angels a 2-1 lead against the Atlanta Braves. This was his first home run since 2014. The Angels went on to win by that score. He was outrighted on July 13. He was called back up during the end of the season.

It was written by Adams and collaborator Jim Vallance. The song was first released in 1979, by Ian Lloyd (formerly of The Stories), on his solo album Goose Bumps. Vallance played the drums on this recording. In 1983 Adams himself recorded the song for his third album, Cuts Like a Knife, as a straightforward rock song with electric guitar and synthesizer. Adams co-produced his version with Bob Clearmountain, who also mixed it. The song became a hit for Adams in 1998, after its inclusion on his 1997 album Unplugged. Patrick Leonard was producing these sessions, and selected \\"I'm Ready\\" to be included in the show. For this concert, the song was re-arranged as an acoustic ballad with string orchestrations added by Michael Kamen, who had previously worked on some of Adams' biggest hits, and played by students of the Juilliard School. It also features a low whistle played by Davy Spillane. In 1998 the song was released as the second single from Unplugged, after \\"Back to You\\". This version is also included on the two best-of-compilations The Best of Me and Anthology. ==Italian release== In 2001, \\"I'm Ready\\" was re-released in Italy with new lyrics, now entitled \\"Io Vivo (In Te)\\". The new Italian lyrics were written by Zucchero Fornaciari. Zucchero also produced the new version, basically using the Unplugged recording, and recording new vocals on top of it (notice the audience and some of Bryan's original vocals still audible on the track). Also featured is additional percussion, added by Martyn Philips using Pro Tools.

Its faces meet only in right angles, even though they cannot all be made parallel to the coordinate planes. It is named for Børge Jessen who investigated it in 1967. ==Construction== The vertices of Jessen's icosahedron may be chosen to have as their coordinates the 12 points given by the cyclic permutations of the coordinates (\\\\pm 2, \\\\pm 1, 0). With this coordinate representation, the short edges of the icosahedron (the ones with convex angles) have length \\\\sqrt{6}, and the long (reflex) edges have length 4. The faces of the icosahedron are equilateral triangles with the short side length, and isosceles triangles with one long edge and two short edges. Regular icosahedron and its non-convex variant, which differs from Jessen's icosahedron in having obtuse dihedral angles instead of right angles A similar shape can be formed by keeping the vertices of a regular icosahedron in their original positions and replacing certain pairs of equilateral-triangle faces by pairs of isosceles triangles, and this shape has also sometimes incorrectly been called Jessen's icosahedron.Wells, D. The Penguin Dictionary of Curious and Interesting Geometry, London: Penguin, (1991). p. 161. However, the resulting polyhedron does not have right-angled dihedrals. The vertices of Jessen's icosahedron are perturbed from these positions in order to give all the dihedrals right angles. ==Properties== Jessen's icosahedron is vertex-transitive (or isogonal), meaning that it has symmetries taking any vertex to any other vertex. Its dihedral angles are all right angles. One can use it as the basis for the construction of a large family of polyhedra with right dihedral angles, formed by gluing copies of Jessen's icosahedron together on their equilateral-triangle faces. net for Jessen's icosahedron, suitable for making a (shaky) physical model Although it is not a flexible polyhedron, Jessen's icosahedron is also not infinitesimally rigid; that is, it is a \\"shaky polyhedron\\". Because very small changes in its edge lengths can cause much bigger changes in its angles, physical models of the polyhedron appear to be flexible. As with the simpler Schönhardt polyhedron, the interior of Jessen's icosahedron cannot be triangulated into tetrahedra without adding new vertices. However, because it has Dehn invariant equal to zero, it is scissors-congruent to a cube, meaning that it can be sliced into smaller polyhedral pieces that can be rearranged to form a solid cube. == Jitterbug transformation == Continuous transformation pausing at the vertex position of Jessen's icosahedron Jessen's icosahedron is one of a continuous series of icosahedra with 8 regular faces and 12 isosceles faces, described by H. S. M. Coxeter in 1948. The shapes in this family range from cuboctahedron to regular octahedron (as limit cases), which can be inscribed in a regular octahedron. The twisting, expansive-contractive transformations between members of this family were named Jitterbug transformations by Buckminster Fuller. == References  External links == * Jessen's icosahedron, Maurice Stark Category:Nonconvex polyhedra ","title":"Jessen's icosahedron"},{"id":"20347143","text":"Daniel \\"Danny\\" McDaid (; born 4 August 1941) is a 2-time Irish Olympic athlete and four times national marathon champion from Letterkenny, County Donegal, Ireland.

It is one of several missiles with the NATO reporting name Scud. ==History== North Korea obtained its first R-17 missiles from Egypt in 1979 or 1980, in return for assistance during the Yom Kippur War. As relations with the Soviet Union were rather strained at the time, and Chinese assistance had proven unreliable, the North Koreans set about reverse engineering the Egyptian missiles. This process was accompanied by the construction of a missile-building infrastructure, of which the main elements were the 125 factory at Pyongyang, a research and development institute at Sanum-dong and the Musudan-ri Launch Facility. The first missile prototypes were completed in 1984. Designated Hwasong-5, and known in the West as the \\"Scud Mod. A\\", they were identical to the R-17Es obtained from Egypt. The first test flights occurred in April 1984, but the first version saw only limited production, and no operational deployment, as its purpose was only to validate the production process. Production of the definitive version of the Hwasong-5 (\\"Scud Mod. B\\" or \\"Scud-B\\") began at a slow rate in 1985. The type incorporated several minor improvements over the original Soviet design. The range with a 1000 kilogram warhead was increased from 300 to 340 kilometres, and the Isayev engine was slightly modified. An array of payloads was developed, including high explosive (HE), cluster, chemical, and possibly biological warheads.http://www.astronautix.com/h/hwasong5.html Throughout the production cycle, until it was phased out in favour of the Hwasong-6 in 1989, North Korean manufacturers are thought to have carried out small enhancements, in particular to the guidance system, but the exact details are unknown.

Although the missile's maneuverability would make it more accurate, few tests were conducted and it wasn't seen after August 2017, suggesting little progress was made and North Korea may have moved on to wholly new missile designs like the KN-23.North Korea’s New Short- Range Missiles: A Technical Evaluation. 38 North. 9 October 2019.KN-21.

He studied at the Churchill & Maury School and Columbia College, graduating in 1881. Two of his elder brothers went into medicine after the father, and thus Reginald initially thought to become a lawyer. However, his brother Lewis persuaded him to follow the family tradition and enter the Bellevue Hospital Medical College in 1881. After graduation in 1884, he worked as an assistant to Hermann Biggs and then joined the practice of his brother Lewis. Later he began helping his father with teaching at a college. Sayre started his research from early age and published most of his paper at young age. Just seven months after completing internship he presented before the New York Academy of Medicine a report on \\"The Immediate Restoration of Parts to the Normal Position after Tenotomy\\" where he boldly questioned well- accepted procedures.

In 1917, he served as Division Surgeon, with rank of Lieutenant Colonel, and during World War I was in charge of orthopedic instruction to medical officers at the New York University. Sayre died suddenly, from myocardial degeneration. He was survived by a sister, Mary Jane. His two older brothers died in 1880 and 1890. ==Memberships and recognition== Sayre in medical outfit with a shooting rifle, c. 1900 Sayre was a member of the New York Academy of Medicine for 42 years and held various administrative posts there: *Assistant secretary (1892–1894) *Recording secretary (1895–1897) *Chairman (1899) *Treasurer (1900–1917) *Vice-president (1919–?)

Sayre co- founded The Society of Alumni of Bellevue Hospital and served as its president between 1902 and 1910. He was also a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons, the American Medical and the American Orthopedic Associations, becoming president in 1904. ==Sports== Sayre had passion for sports, and while studying at Columbia College took part in athletics.

Traditional Russian treatment of melody, harmony and structure actually worked against sonata form's modus operandi of movement, growth and development. Russian music--the Russian creative mentality as a whole, in fact--functioned on the principle of stasis. Russian novels, plays and operas were written as collections of self-contained tableaux, with the plots proceeding from one set-piece to the next. Russian folk music operated along the same lines, with songs comprised as a series of self-contained melodic units repeated continually. Compared to this mindset, the precepts of sonata form probably seemed as alien as if they had arrived from the moon. Sonata form also was not designed to accommodate the emotionally charged statements that Tchaikovsky wanted to make. In this, he was far from alone--it was a major preoccupation of the Romantic age, to the point that the validity of the symphony was questioned seriously and alternatives to it were actually devised. These alternatives, which included program music in general and the symphonic poem in particular, did not offer a complete solution. Instead, they left Tchaikovsky facing a paradox. He reportedly did not care for program music, to the point of reproaching himself for writing the fantasy-overture Romeo and Juliet. Yet the notion of writing symphonies as purely intellectual patterns of chords, rhythms and modulations was at least equally abhorrent. Nevertheless, Tchaikovsky attempted to adhere more closely at least to the manner of sonata form in his first three symphonies. They remain chronicles of his attempts to reconcile his training from the Saint Petersburg Conservatory with the music he had heard all his life and his own innate penchant for melody. Both those factors worked against sonata form, not with it. With the Fourth Symphony, Tchaikovsky hit upon a solution he would refine in his remaining two numbered symphonies and his program symphony Manfred--one that would enable to reconcile the more personal, more dramatic and heightened emotional statements he wished to make with the classical structure of the symphony, showing, as musicologist Martin Cooper phrased it, that \\"his inspiration was stronger than scruple.\\" Scrutability over Tchaikovsky's work, however, has remained intense at times, especially among critics. The fact that Tchaikovsky did not follow sonata form strictly and instead amended it creatively has been seen at times as a weakness rather than a sign of originality. Even with what music critic Harold C. Schonberg termed \\"a professional reevaluation\\" of Tchaikovsky's work, the practice of faulting Tchaikovsky for not following in the steps of the Viennese masters has not gone away entirely. More often than in the past, however, his approach is being viewed as innovative rather than evasive and an effective fusion of two dissimilar musical philosophies. ==Russian versus Western== Ideally, Tchaikovsky's training at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory would have thoroughly equipped him to work with European principles and forms of organizing musical material,Brown, Final, 426. just as immersion in those things might have helped him gain a sense of belonging to world culture.Volkov, 111. However, Tchaikovsky was still \\"Russian to the marrow,\\" as he told his patroness, Nadezhda von Meck, \\"saturating myself from earliest childhood with the inexplicable beauty of the characteristic traits of Russian folk song, so that I passionately love every manifestation of the Russian spirit.\\"As quoted in Cooper, 35. Native instincts that strong could drive him toward Russian musical principles, which in several ways worked in opposition to Western ones, and make his Russianness work as much against him as it did for him. The result was a continual struggle with Western sonata form, especially in dealing with the symphony. A major block for Tchaikovsky in this department, according to musicologist David Brown, may have been > a cardinal flaw in the Russian character: inertia.... In literature it > produces the novel that proceeds as a succession of self-contained sections, > even set-piece scenes....Indeed, such tableau organization is fundamental to > the most Russian of operatic scenarios.... [T]he most characteristic Russian > scenario is like a strip cartoon, each scene presenting a crucial incident > or stage in the plot, leaving the spectator to supply in his imagination > what has happened in the gaps between these incidents.Brown, Final, 421-2. Brown lists several factors in Russian folk music which contribute to this pattern of inertia. Melodies in Russian folk songs are self-contained, with no interaction between themes in contrasting musical keys or any clear transition from one theme to another.Brown, Final, 424. Instead, melodies are repeated, \\"using similar intervals and phrases with an almost ritual insistence,\\" according to musicologist John Warrack.Warrack, Symphonies, 9. Also see Brown, Final, 422-3. This makes many folk songs essentially a series of variations on one basic shape or pattern of a few notes.Brown, Final, 422-3. The problem with repetition is that, even with a surface level of rhythmic activity added, the melody remains static over a period of time. Beneath that surface, nothing really moves or goes anywhere; the effect of the rhythm is decorative, not organic, because no true progress has taken place.Brown, Final, 423-4; Warrack, Symphonies, 9. Mikhail Glinka Mikhail Glinka's Kamarinskaya, which became famous as the first orchestral work based entirely on Russian folk song, is a case in point of the limits Russian composers faced and how they attempted to work around them.Maes, 27. Kamarinskaya is based on two themes, a slow bridal song, \\"Izza gor\\" (From beyond the mountains), and the title song, a naigrïsh. This second song is actually an instrumental dance played to an ostinato melody. This melody is repeated for as long as the dancers can move to it.Maes, 28. Glinka begins with \\"Izza gor,\\" then introduces Kamarinskaya as a contrasting theme. He uses a transition to return to the bridal song and show the contrast between the two themes. Another transition, this time using motifs from the bridal song, leads to the dance theme and the piece ends with the Kamarinskaya dance. In a Western piece, after the first theme is introduced and harmony propels the music forward, it modulates to introduce a second theme in a contrasting musical key. The two themes then interact and the composition grows as an organic creation. Tension continues building as this thematic dialogue becomes increasingly complex. This dialogue or interchange eventually propels the piece to a climactic point of resolution. Kamarinskaya does not follow this pattern. Nor can it. The ostinato melody of the second song will not allow any motivic development without distorting the character of the piece. Glinka therefore uses the principle of repetition from folk song to allowing the musical structure to unfold.Brown, Final, 423-4. He repeats the theme 75 times, all the while varying the accompaniment--the instrumental timbres, harmonization and counterpoint--in a technique that Brown, Francis Maes and other musicologists call \\"changing backgrounds.\\"Brown, Early, 190; Maes, 28. By following this approach, Glinka preserves the original character of the dance and complements it with creative variations to sustain listener interest.Brown, Final, 423-4; Maes, 28. However, because there is no thematic growth, the music remains static. It does not move forward as a Western piece of music would. Modest Mussorgsky Simply adopting Germanic principles of formal musical organization was not going to solve the problem. Not only did Russian music refuse to cooperate with them but neither did the Russian creative mind. As Modest Mussorgsky phrased it, \\"The German, when he thinks, will first examine and explore, then make his conclusion: our [Russian] brother will first make his conclusion, then amuse himself with examination and exploration.\\"As quoted in Brown, Final, 426-7. Tchaikovsky's exposure to and love of Russian folk-song, according to Cooper, \\"formed the background for all his other music experience, a subconscious musical atmosphere in which all other musical experiences were saturated,\\"Cooper, 35. and Brown notes that Tchaikovsky's \\"natural ability to think in terms of organic symphonic procedures\\"--in other words, in the ability to \\"examine and explore, then make his conclusion\\"--\\"was certainly limited.\\"Brown, Early, 108. The situation was not merely one of preoccupation with cause over effect, Brown writes, but also of an inability to connect cause with effect. \\"For just as it seems difficult for the Russian musical theorist to apply his active, controlled intelligence to the scrutiny of an imaginitive concept,\\" he adds, \\"so it seems difficult for the Russian composer to harness his active, controlled intelligence to the unfolding of that imaginitive concept--as Bach had done so pre-eminently in the fugue, or the classical masters in the symphony.\\" ==Melody versus formRussian melody=== As large a challenge for Tchaikovsky as his Russian creative mentality was also his greatest compositional gift--namely, his own sense of melody. For him, however, the problem was two-fold. The first part stemmed, again, from his ethnic heritage. Brown points out that Tchaikovsky, like the majority of 19th-century Russian composers, was highly gifted melodically. However, even when those melodies were conceived with broad, multi-phrase structures, they tended to be even more self-contained than those in Russian folk songs, \\"thus requiring the composer to climb, as it were, a perimeter fence if he wanted to move on, perhaps to explore a new melodic field.\\"Brown, Final, 424. This, Brown says, is again typical of Russian creativity, with a mindset of stasis rather than ongoing development. Circle of fifths in Western harmony, showing where major and minor keys were to modulate \\"This problem of transition\\", Brown writes--of moving smoothly from one theme to another--\\"was one of the most vexed the Russian composer faced, greater in many ways than that of development.\\"Brown, Final, 425. In European music, this is where modulation comes into play; you simply change from the musical key of your first theme to the contrasting but related key of your second theme. Modulation was a driving principle in both Western harmony and sonata form. It maintained harmonic interest over an extended time-scale, provided a clear contrast between musical themes and showed how those themes were related to each other.Roberts, New Grove (1980), 12:454. Western harmony was a study in motion; it propelled the music and, on a larger scale, gave it shape.Brown, Final, 422, 434. Remember that Russian creativity centered around inertia, not motion. This mindset, according to Brown, made harmony a potential trap for Tchaikovsky, as it was for many other Russian composers. He had to get his melodies to go somewhere, to have the ability to connect together instead of standing apart and separate.Brown, Final, 432-4. Tchaikovsky had already shown \\"a flair for harmony\\" that \\"astonished\\" Rudolph Kündinger, his music tutor during his time at the School of Jurisprudence,As quoted in Polyansky, Eyes, 18. and a thorough knowledge should have been part of his studies at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory.Brown, Final, 434. However, Tchaikovsky would run into problems with modulation as soon as the opening theme of his First Symphony.It was Tchaikovsky's challenges with modulation, despite his prowess in Western harmony, that sent him to study with Nikolai Zaremba at the Russian Musical Society and from there to the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. According to the composer's friend Nikolay Kashkin, Tchaikovsky had a music-loving cousin in the Horse Grenadiers who had attended Zaremba's class. One day this cousin boasted that he could make the transition from one key to another in three chords or less and dared Tchaikovsky to do the same. Tchaikovsky improvised at the piano several times but could not manage the transition. Being proud at considering himself the superior musician, Tchaikovsky asked his cousin where he had learned to do so. His cousin then told him about Zaremba's class (Holden, 36). In the exposition portion of sonata form, where both musical themes are introduced, the first theme generally begins on the tonic, the key in which the composition is to be written, then ends in preparation to modulate toward the next relative key to connect with the second theme. This \\"fundamental move,\\" as Brown phrases it, could prove the greatest degree of difficulty for a composer. In the best-handled examples from the Classical era, this move \\"is not just a modulation but a process of controlled tonal dynamism.\\"Brown, Early, 109. Instead of being a preparation of this event, the opening theme of the First Symphony simply ends on the tonic, exactly where it began, and becomes a self-enclosed melody as per Russian practice.Brown, Early, 112-13. He reduces the transition to the second theme to a half-dozen bars in the dominant.Brown, Early, 113. ===Romantic-age dilemma=== In the second of his two challenges with melody and sonata form, Tchaikovsky was very far from alone. Romantic composers on the whole were more focused on self- expression and the illustration of extra-musical content in their pieces than their Classical-age predecessors. Out of this concern came a widened palette of tone color, a greatly widened field of harmony and a similarly expanded development of orchestration. Most importantly, melody took on a new and very different significance than it had occupied with Haydn, Mozart or Beethoven. The themes the Romantics wrote, original in their own right, were now often seen as the reason for the compositions' existence.Webster, New Grove (2001), 23:695. However, they were not the regular, symmetrical melodic shapes that worked well with sonata form.Cooper, 26. This was why, musicologist Martin Cooper asserts, Romantic-age composers on the whole \\"were never natural symphonists.\\"Cooper, 24. Even the efforts by Robert Schumann, Felix Mendelssohn and Johannes Brahms to return to the linear, architectural music of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven were attempts to fuse Classical and Romantic musical values. This worked most successfully in Brahms, Cooper explains, \\"because in him the violence and directness of emotional expression was somehow veiled and muted and therefore least apt to disturb the balance and proportion of the form.\\"Cooper, 25. The problem, Cooper emphasizes, was melody. Many of the themes that Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven used in their symphonies may not seem distinctive. Distinctiveness, however, was not the point. The point was what could be done with those themes--what pieces of musical architecture could be erected by using them. They were the compositional equivalent of cement blocks or bricks. Blocks and bricks, while not necessarily attractive, can work handily in constructing a house, a shop building or a cathedral. Just as those blocks fit together, the themes used by the Viennese masters, written in contrasting keys but related in harmony, contrasted, merged and grew into a musical structure larger and more intricate than any of those themes by themselves.Cooper, 29. Using the same analogy, imagine trying to build a wall or a building with polished marble statues. This is basically what the Romantic were producing, music-wise, with the themes they wrote. Statues do not work well as building blocks. They will not fit together. They stand apart and command attention instead of blending into the general scheme of things. Therefore, you will not get a well-built structure by using them.Cooper, 29-30. Because more composers were trying to erect structures with statues instead of cement blocks, they started doubting whether the symphony was still a viable form. In other words, they were thinking in reverse to the rationale of the classical composers who had codified sonata form. They could not get the form to function with their themes as they wanted it to do, rather than refashioning their themes as Beethoven did, for example, to work within the form. According to musicologist Mark Evans Bonds, > Even symphonies by [such] well-known composers of the early 19th century as > Méhul, Rossini, Cherubini, Hérold, Czerny, Clementi, Weber and Moscheles > were perceived in their own time as standing in the symphonic shadow of > Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, or some combination of the three.... [T]here was a > growing sense that these works were aesthetically far inferior to > Beethoven's.... The real question was not so much whether symphonies could > still be written, but whether the genre could continue to flourish and grow > as it had over the previous half-century in the hands of Haydn, Mozart and > Beethoven. On this count, there were varying degrees of skepticism but > virtually no real optimism.... Hector Berlioz was the only composer \\"able to > grapple successfully with Beethoven's legacy.\\"Bonds, New Grove (2001), > 24:836-7. Some Romantic composers worked around this problem by changing what they built. Instead of the musical equivalent of buildings, they constructed statue gardens--places which could showcase items depicting beauty and drama. These musical statue gardens, known as concert overtures worked as vehicles \\"within which to blend musical, narrative and pictoral ideas.\\"Bonds, New Grove (2001), 24:838. Examples included Mendelssohn's overtures A Midsummer Night's Dream (1826) and The Hebrides (1830). Eventually, composers built bigger gardens, otherwise known as symphonic poems. In these new, looser and more flexible musical forms, large-scale orchestral writing could be combined with strong emotions and brilliant timbres to fulfill a wide range of extra-musical demands.Cooper, 24-25. ===Theme or form first=== Tchaikovsky's opening entry for his diary of 1872 reads as follows: > Yesterday, on the road from Vorozhba to Kiev, music came singing and echoing > through my head after a long interval of silence. A theme in embryo, in > B-flat major, took possession of my mind and almost led me on to attempt a > symphony. Suddenly the thought came over me to cast aside Stasov's not too > successful Tempest and devote the summer to composing a symphony which > should throw all my previous works in the shade.As quoted in Warrack, > Tchaikovsky, 71-2. This entry confirms that Tchaikovsky's priority in composition was a notable, complete melody, what musicologist John Warrack calls the \\"lyrical idea.\\"Warrack, Tchaikovsky, 72. With that melody might come the inspiration to use it in a symphony, concerto or other work. This was in reverse order to how Beethoven, Mozart and Haydn composed. For them, the process of building a symphony came before devising a suitable theme to use in it. This was the natural approach for composers for whom the mechanics of sonata form had become second nature. For Mozart, working out a movement or complete piece in this manner was an act in itself; notating that music became simply mechanical and he appreciated diversion while doing so. Beethoven, in contrast, wrestled mightily with his themes, adjusting them to fit the musical form he was going to use. For both men, form came first.Warrack, Tchaikovsky, 133. For Tchaikovsky, the symphony was a ready-made form into which he could place whatever theme he composed. The form itself came a distant second to the melody used in it. Composing in this manner would be akin to constructing a skyscraper without a firm blueprint. Doing so may have been one reason Tchaikovsky had such difficulty with sonata form. Another reason may have been that he was using complete, independent melodies, which by their very completeness could not be developed easily in the process of sonata form. As his friend and former pupil Sergei Taneyev points out, a composer like Tchaikovsky could modify such themes to generate tension, maintain interest and generally satisfy listeners, but all the composer was really doing was repeating them. He was not disassembling or combining or using them as structural elements.Warrack, Symphonies, 8-9. Tchaikovsky may have realized this dilemma for himself when he wrote, as an experienced composer of 48, > All my life I have been much troubled by my inability to grasp and > manipulate form in music. I fought hard against this defect and can say with > pride that I achieved some progress, but I shall end my days without ever > having written anything that is perfect in form. What I write has always a > mountain of padding: An experienced eye can detect the thread in my seams, > and I can do nothing about it.As quoted in Wood, 74. Note: Tchaikovsky talks about manipulating the form, not the theme. ==Early attempts== Analyzing the symphonies of the Viennese masters was likely a given part of Tchaikovsky's curriculum at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. Through it he apparently realized, as musicologist Ralph W. Wood points out, \\"that design is a crucial factor in music.\\" He may have also \\"grasped that form and thematic material must be interdependent, every piece of material carrying the implication of its own self-dictated form.\\" However, perhaps because of Tchaikovsky's own assumptions about emotion and music, he may have felt that he never solved or even confronted squarely the problem of form versus material. He idolized Mozart as a master of form, was aware of how his idol's symphonies functioned compared to his own and found his own lacking.Wood, 75. Having clarity or security in how to solve those perceived challenges was another matter.Cooper, 25-6; Wood, 74-5. While Tchaikovsky's earlier symphonies are considered optimistic and nationalistic (in other words, different from the music he would eventually write), they are also chronicles of his attempts to reconcile his conservatory training and study of the masters with the native musical traditions and innate lyricism that worked against what he had learned.Brown, Final, 422-4; Cooper, 29. ===Symphony No. 1 \\"Winter Daydreams\\"=== Tchaikovsky confessed to his patroness, Nadezhda von Meck, that while his First Symphony \\"is in many ways very immature, yet fundamentally it has more substance and is better than many of my other more mature works.\\"As quoted in Brown, Early, 102. This, Brown says, is extremely true.Brown, Early, 102. Its rich lyricism and Mendelssohnian charm and grace belie the fact that it drove its composer to a nervous breakdown while working on it.Brown, Early, 109; Keller, 343; Warrack, Tchaikovsky, 48-9. Tchaikovsky realized while composing it that, for him to grow as an artist, he needed to work \\"around the rules\\" of sonata form to accommodate the music he was hoping to write. In doing so, Brown states, the composer would often show tremendous resourcefulness, even in this piece. \\"The opening stretch of the first movement,\\" he writes, \\"is enough to scotch the hoary old legend that Tchaikovsky was devoid of any real symphonic aptitude.\\"Brown, Early, 108 ===Symphony No. 2 \\"Little Russian\\"=== Here Tchaikovsky harnessed the harmonic, melodic and rhythmic quirks of Russian folk music to produce an opening movement massive in scale, intricate in structure and complex in texture--what Brown calls \\"one of the most solid structures Tchaikovsky ever fashioned\\"Brown, Early, 260.--and a finale that, with the folk song \\"The Crane\\" offered in an ever-dizzying series of backdrops, showcased how well he could mine the same vein as Glinka and the nationalist set of composers known collectively as The Five.Brown, Early, 264-9. Even so, Tchaikovsky was not satisfied. When he revised the work eight years after its premiere, he made a large cut in the finale and wrote a clearer, simpler first movement along Western lines.Brown, Early, 259-60; 262-4. This is the version performed today. However, Tchaikovsky's friend and former student Sergei Taneyev considered the earlier one superior. His reputation as one of the finest craftsmen among Russian composers lends his opinion considerable weight.Brown, Early, 260; Warrack, Tchaikovsky, 70-1. ===Symphony No. 3 \\"Polish\\"=== The Third Symphony is unique among Tchaikovsky's symphonies in musical key (the only one written in the major) and number of movements (five).Keller, 344. Patterned after Schumann's Rhenish Symphony and possibly conceived with the notion of what that composer might write if he were Russian,Brown, Crisis, 44; Maes, 78. the Third shows Tchaikovsky at what musicologist Hans Keller calls \\"his freest and most fluent so far.\\"Tchaikovsky was not the only Russian composer to use Schumann as a model. Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's First Symphony, which he wrote as a naval cadet, is closely patterned after Schumann's Fourth. Academic movements rub shoulders with fanciful, dance-like ones not far removed from the composer's ballets (his first, Swan Lake, was not far off the horizon) in the manner of the orchestral suites the composer would write between his Fourth and Fifth Symphonies.Keller, 344--5; Warrack; Tchaikovsky, 81. Some musicologists, Brown among them, brand the Third uneven in quality and inspiration.Brown, Crisis, 50. Others, including Dutch musicologist Francis Maes, consider it underrated.Maes, 78. Maes points out its \\"high degree of motivic and polyphonic intricacies\\" and its \\"magic of sound ... combined with capricious rhythms and fanciful manipulation of musical forms.\\" ==Symphonic poem: alternative and catalyst== Portrait of Liszt (1856) by Wilhelm von Kaulbach. While Tchaikovsky struggled with his first three symphonies, developments in Europe led to an alternative to this genre that, in a reverse twist, offered to change the scope of the symphony. Hungarian composer Franz Liszt desired a form of orchestral music that would offer greater flexibility in developing musical themes than the symphony then allowed but also preserve the overall unity of a musical composition.Searle, New Grove (1980), 11:41, Works, 61. His objective was to expand single- movement works beyond the concert overture format. By doing so, he hoped to combine the dramatic, emotive and evocative qualities of concert overtures with the scale and musical complexity normally reserved for the opening movements of symphonies.Spencer, P., 1233. The fruit of Liszt's labors was what he eventually termed symphonic poems. In them, he used two alternatives to sonata form. Beethoven had used the first of these, cyclic form, to link separate movements thematically with one another. Liszt took this process one step further by combining themes into a single-movement cyclic structure.Searle, Orchestral Works, 281; Walker, Weimar, 357. The second alternative, thematic transformation, originated with Haydn and Mozart.Macdonald, New Grove (1980), 19:117. This process worked in a similar manner as variation but instead of a theme being changed into a related or subsidiary version of the main one, it becomes transformed into a related but separate, independent theme.Searle, Orchestral Works, 281. Beethoven used it in the finale of his Ninth Symphony when he transformed the theme of the \\"Ode to Joy\\" into a Turkish march.Walker, Weimar, 310. Weber and Berlioz had also transformed themes. Schubert used thematic transformation to bind together the movements of his Wanderer Fantasy, a work that had a tremendous influence on Liszt.Searle, Music, 60-61; Walker, Weimar, 310. However, Liszt learned to create longer formal structures solely through thematic transformation.Searle, Orchestral Works, 61; Walker, Weimar, 310. Liszt's approach to musical form in his symphonic poems was also unorthodox. Instead of following a strict presentation and development of musical themes as in sonata form, he placed his themes into a loose, episodic pattern. There, recurring melodies called motifs were thematically transformed as musical and programmatic needs dictated. (Richard Wagner would make good use of this practice in his operas and music dramas.)MacDonald, New Grove (1980), 18:429; Walker, Weimar, 308. Recapitulations, where themes are normally restated after they are combined and contrasted in development, were foreshortened. Codas, where pieces of music generally wind to a close, were greatly enlarged to a size and scope that can affect the listener's concept of the themes.Walker, Weimar, 309. Themes shuffled into new and unexpected patterns of order and three- or four- movement structures were rolled into one in a continual process of creative experimentation.Walker, Weimar, 304, 309. A number of composers, especially Bohemian and Russian, followed in Liszt's footsteps to develop the symphonic poem further.Macdonald, New Grove (1980), 18:429. Added to this was the Russian love of story-telling, for which the genre seemed expressly tailored.Macdonald, New Grove (1980), 18:430. Tchaikovsky wrote a symphonic poem, Fatum, after he had finished his First Symphony and first opera, The Voyevoda. There, he dabbled with the free form the new genre offered. However, the work did not come out well and he destroyed it after two performances.Brown, Early, 165-9. For his next programmatic work, the fantasy- overture Romeo and Juliet, Tchaikovsky reverted to sonata form, structuring it in a similar fashion to Beethoven's concert overtures.Maes, 64, 73. However, in a case of musical cross-pollination, the symphonic poem offered the potential to change the nature of the symphony in its merging of a wide emotional range with symphonic resources.Cooper, 27. This potential played to the conception Tchaikovsky would form of the symphony as a vehicle for personal expressionWarrack, Symphonies, 7. and one whose details could, as he phrased it to his patroness, Nadezhda von Meck, \\"be manipulated as freely as one chooses.\\"As quoted in Warrack, Symphonies, 7. ==Program music, lyrical form== Tchaikovsky's view of program music was ambivalent. He disliked the genre personally but generally needed some sort of subject upon which to write. Whether that catalyst was a literary source, an overt program or a more subjective one based on an abstract theme such as love or fate did not necessarily matter. He needed something to fire his imagination and get his creative juices flowing.Warrack, Tchaikovsky, 58. One indisputable fact was that Tchaikovsky had a flair for the genre. When he was caught up in the drama or the emotional states of the characters, as in Romeo and Juliet, the results could be spectacular. When the work became difficult, as it would when he worked on the Manfred symphony, he became discouraged and complained that writing to a program was unpleasant and it was easier to do so without one.Brown, Wandering, 303. In a letter to von Meck dated December 5, 1878, Tchaikovsky outlined two kinds of inspiration for a symphonic composer, a subjective and an objective one: > In the first instance, [the composer] uses his music to express his own > feelings, joys, sufferings; in short, like a lyric poet he pours out, so to > speak, his own soul. In this instance, a program is not only not necessary > but even impossible. But it is another matter when a musician, reading a > poetic work or struck by a scene in nature, wishes to express in musical > form that subject that has kindled his inspiration. Here a program is > essential.... Program music can and must exist, just as it is impossible to > demand that literature make do without the epic element and limit itself to > lyricism alone. Writing to a program, then, was apparently a matter of course for Tchaikovsky. Technically, for him, every piece of music could contain a program. The difference for him lay in the explicitness or implicitness of the program itself. A symphony generally followed the lines of an implicit program, while a symphonic poem followed an explicit one. This also meant that, technically, any alternatives or amendments to sonata form used to underline either specific events or the general tone of a literary program in a symphonic poem could also be used to illustrate the \\"feelings, joys, sufferings\\" conveyed in a symphony; the only difference was in the type of program being illustrated. In fact, Brown claims, there is a considerable amount of Tchaikovsky's symphonic manner contained in the symphonic poem Francesca da Rimini, which the composer wrote not long before the Fourth Symphony.Brown, Crisis, 111. The Allegro vivo section where the composer evokes the storm and whirlwind in the underworld is much like the first subject section of a Tchaikovsky symphony, while Francesca's theme in A major takes the place of a second subject.Brown, Crisis, 111–12. Also, Tchaikovsky was apparently expanding his conception of the symphony from one where Germanic models were to be followed slavishly to a looser, more flexible alternative more in keeping with the symphonic poem. Sonata form, according to Wood, was never intended to be a musical straitjacket but, rather, to leave the composer \\"innumerable choices for building up a coherent movement\\" that would offer variety and, \\"by the relationships of its successive thematic elements and the management of its transitions ... have the appearance of organic growth.\\"Wood, 74. The problem for Tchaikovsky, however, was whether \\"organic growth\\" was even an option in building a large-scale piece of music. He wrote to von Meck, after he had written the Fourth Symphony, > You ask if I keep to established forms. Yes and no. There are certain kinds > of compositions which imply the use of familiar forms, for example symphony. > Here I keep in general outline to the usual traditional forms, but only in > general outline, i.e. the sequence of the work's movements. The details can > be treated very freely, if this is demanded by the development of the ideas. > For instance, in our symphony the first movement is written with very marked > digressions. The second subject, which should be in the relative major, is > minor and remote. In the recapitulation of the main part of the movement the > second subject does not appear at all, etc. The finale, too, is made up of a > whole row of derivations from individual forms....As quoted in Warrack, > Tchaikovsky, 132. Cooper suggests that for Tchaikovsky the symphony had become \\"a form, a convenience, no longer the natural, instinctive channel for his musical imagination\\" that it could or should have been had he followed strict Germanic practices. Even if this could have been the case with Tchaikovsky, the path would have been difficult. Cooper explains \\"that lyrical emotion should find its natural expression in sonata form is perhaps not unthinkable, but only if that form is so natural to a composer, both by instinct and habit, that it has come to be really an acquired instinct, a 'second nature,' as we say; and this was certainly never true of Tchaikovsky.\\"Cooper, 28. Brown writes that while Tchaikovsky \\"was not without a certain measure of the true symphonist's gift for organic thematic growth,\\" he concurs that for him \\"to create the sort of complex organic experience\\" that would allow him to meld lyric expression with sonata form \\"lay beyond his abilities.\\" Nor, again, was this solely Tchaikovsky's dilemma. \\"The Romantics were never natural symphonists,\\" Cooper writes, for basically the same reason as Tchaikovsky—\\"because music was to them primarily evocative and biographical—generally autobiographical—and the dramatic phrase, the highly [colored] melody and the 'atmospheric' harmony which they loved are in direct opposition to the nature of the symphony, which is primarily an architectural form.\\"Cooper, 24–5. ==Juxtaposition== dramatic pyramid showing the three main sections--exposition, development and recapitulation. Two breakthroughs which, according to Brown, Austrian musicologist Hans Keller, Dutch musicologist Francis Maes and Soviet musicologist Daniel Zhitomirsky, came to Tchaikovsky while composing his Fourth Symphony, worked hand-in-hand in giving him a workable solution to building large-scale forms. The first answer was essentially to sidestep thematic interaction and keep sonata form only as an \\"outline,\\" as Zhitomirsky phrases it, containing two contrasting themes.Zhitomirsky, 102. Within this outline, the focus now centered on periodic alternation and juxtaposition. Instead of offering what Brown calls \\"a rich and well-ordered argument,\\" Tchaikovsky integrates what Keller calls \\"new and violent contrasts\\" between musical themes, keys and harmonies by placing blocks of dissimilar tonal and thematic material alongside one another.Brown, Final, 426; Keller, 347. These blocks, Zhitomirsky explains, are demarcated by their distinct contrast in musical material and \\"by the fact that each theme [used in them] usually constitutes an independent and structurally complete episode.\\"Zhitomirsky, 98. The block containing the main theme, Zhitomirsky writes, alternates with the one containing the second theme. The former, he continues, is \\"steadily enlivened in reiteration\\" by what Warrack calls \\"ostinato figures, dramatic pedal-points, sequences that screw anticipation to a fever pitch with each new step, all expressed in frenzied rhythmic activity.\\"Warrack, Symphonies, 11; Zhitomirsky, 102. The result of this enlivening, Zhitomirsky says, is \\"that the very contrast of the two blocks is consistently sharpened.\\" An important part of this process, Keller states, is that \\"thematic and harmonic contrasts\\" are \\"not allowed to coincide.\\"Keller, 347. Mozart, he writes, evidently preceded Tchaikovsky in this tactic of modulatory delay and may have helped give Tchaikovsky the impetus in attempting it himself, although Tchaikovsky develops this form of contrast \\"on an unprecedented scale.\\"Keller, 348. Keller offers the second theme in the first movement of the Fourth Symphony as an example of how this process works. In sonata form, he writes, the first subject enters in the tonic and the second subject follows in a contrasting but related key harmonically. Tension occurs when the music (and the listener with it) is pulled away from the tonic. Tchaikovsky \\"not only increases the contrasts between the themes on the one hand and the keys on the other,\\" but ups the ante by introducing his second theme in a key unrelated to the first theme and delaying the transition to the expected key. In the first movement of the Fourth Symphony, Tchaikovsky introduces the second theme in A-flat minor. Since the symphony is written in the key of F minor, the second theme should go either to the relative major (A-flat major) or the dominant (C minor). By the time Tchaikovsky establishes the relative major, this theme has finished playing. Thus, Keller says, \\"the thematic second subject precedes the harmonic second subject\\" (italics Keller). This process, according to Brown and Keller, builds momentumBrown, Final, 426. and adds intense drama.Keller, 346-7. While the result, Warrack charges, is still \\"an ingenious episodic treatment of two tunes rather than a symphonic development of them\\" in the Germanic sense,Warrack, Symphonies, 11. Brown counters that it took the listener of the period \\"through a succession of often highly charged sections which added up to a radically new kind of symphonic experience\\" (italics Brown), one that functioned not on the basis of summation, as Austro-German symphonies did, but on one of accumulation. Sequence ascending by step . Note that there are only four segments, continuously higher, and that the segments continue by the same distance (seconds: C-D, D-E, etc.). Within this overall concept of juxtaposition, Tchaikovsky employed his second solution. While Maes calls this answer a \\"structure\\" and Zhitomirsky an \\"independent and structurally complete episode,\\" it could actually be described as a system in which melody, harmony, rhythm and tone color become interrelated elements functioning together like the working parts of a clock, each part moving independently but also as part of an overall action serving one purpose. With a clock, that purpose is indicating the time. With a symphony of the kind Tchaikovsky strove to craft, that purpose is two-fold: to resolve the overall tonal and emotional conflict introduced at the beginning of the work and to relieve the tensions produced as a by-product of that conflict, which keep the listener's attention as that conflict progresses.Maes, 161; Zhitomirsky, 98. This systematic grouping of normally independent elements may have been a natural outgrowth of Tchaikovsky's creative process, as he mentioned to von Meck: > I write my sketches on the first piece of paper that comes to hand, > sometimes a scrap of writing paper, and I write in very abbreviated form. > The melody never appears in my head without its attendant harmony. In > general, these two musical elements, together with the rhythm, cannot be > conceived separately: every melodic idea carries its own inevitable harmony > and rhythm. If the harmonies are very complicated, one must indicate the > part-writing on the sketch.... Concerning instrumentation, if one is > composing for orchestra, the musical idea carries with it the proper > instrumentation for its expression.As quoted in Cooper, 28. By making subtle but noticeable changes in the rhythm or phrasing of a tune, modulating to another key, changing the melody itself or varying the instruments playing it, Tchaikovsky could keep a listener's interest from flagging. By extending the number of repetitions, he could increase the musical and dramatic tension of a passage, building \\"into an emotional experience of almost unbearable intensity,\\" as Brown phrases it, controlling when the peak and release of that tension would take place.Brown, New Grove (1980), 18:628. Also see Bostrick, 105. Cooper calls this practice a subtle form of unifying a piece of music and adds that Tchaikovsky brought it to a high point of refinement.Cooper, 32. Vertical hemiola. As did Keller, Maes uses the first movement of the Fourth Symphony as an example of how this union of elements provides dramatic impact. This movement is \\"dominated by a powerful and highly rhythmic motto in the brass\\" which Tchaikovsky uses to demarcate various points in the overall structure. Tchaikovsky makes the actual first theme, already rhythmically complex, seem even more unstable by the notes he writes to accompany it. When he recapitulates this theme, he adds further rhythmic movement in the form of chromatic lines in the woodwinds. The second theme follows a more regular rhythm, which is enhanced by exchanges between violins and woodwinds. The music goes from rhythmic complexity to stasis, \\"in which a single chord is maintained for twenty-two measures in a regular rhythmic pattern.\\" This respite, however, is also preparation for \\"a rhythmically confused episode\\" where various instrumental groups \\"converse by complex hemiola structures,\\" where multiple rhythms play against one another. \\"That passage wipes out the sense of meter, rendering the reappearance of the motto all the more dramatic. In the development, the complexities of the exposition are further increased.\\"Maes, 161-2. The crux of the drama in this movement, Maes continues, comes musically from the rhythmic conflict between the opening motif and the first theme. At the same time, a dramatic conflict is played out between the dramatic nature of these two themes. \\"The motto uses the rhythm of the polonaise ... in its provocative and aggressive aspect. The first theme is marked, \\"in movimento di valse\\": a waltz expressing sentiment and vulnerability.\\" Tchaikovsky initially allows these two elements to peacefully contrast against each other. In the development section, where Western composers in the past had combined their themes by variation and transformation before restating them, Tchaikovsky throws his themes together essentially unchanged to clash \\"remorselessly.\\" In the movement's coda, he changes the note values of the waltz \\"so that the structure of the polonaise and the first two thematic elements become fused.\\"Maes, 162. ==Later effortsSymphony No. 4=== Brown calls the Fourth Symphony a breakthrough work in terms of emotional depth and complexity, particularly in its very large opening movement. Although the composer himself complained about the formal \\"contrivances\\" and \\"artificiality\\" present there,Brown, Crisis, 163. Warrack maintains that in this symphony, Tchaikovsky found \\"the symphonic method that matched his temperament to his talents.\\"Warrack, Symphonies, 24. The composer wrote to von Meck explaining that the symphony was patterned after Beethoven's Fifth in its use of an opening motif.Brown, Crisis, 162-3; Warrack, Symphonies, 24. The sheer violence with which this theme intrudes into various sections of the opening movement makes the fact it symbolizes Fate, to Brown, \\"wholly credible.\\"Brown, Crisis, 167. At the same time, its use as a \\"structural marker\\" to hold this movement together, as noticed by Keller and music critic Michael Steinberg, shows it to have a musical as well as a dramatic function.Steinberg, Symphony, 628. ===Manfred Symphony=== Manfred, written between the Fourth and Fifth Symphonies, is also a major piece, as well as a demanding one. The music is often very tough, according to Brown.Brown, Man and Music, 293. The first movement, which Zhitomirsky calls \\"profound in emotional and psychological import\\" and \\"closest of all to Tchaikovsky's creative temperament,\\" is \\"completely original in form,\\" according to Brown; here the composer all but abandons sonata form completely.Brown, Man and Music, 293; Zhitomirsky, 120. The various musical challenges poses for the other movements, Zhitomirsky says, are \\"brilliantly coped with.\\"Zhitomirsky, 121. Brown points out the second movement as a highlight, diaphanous and seemingly unsubstantial but absolutely right for the program it illustrates. Maes calls Manfred Tchaikovsky's \\"most romantic work. No other work is close to Berlioz, Liszt and--in sonority--Wagner.\\" He also cites the work's \\"high quality\\" and \\"epic scope ... developed with the help of striking sound pictures.\\"Maes, 165. Warrack suggests that, of all Tchaikovsky's major neglected works, Manfred may be the one which least deserves this fate.Warrack, Tchaikovsky, 191. ===Symphony No. 5=== \\"Both in idea and exposition,\\" Zhitomirsky writes, the Fifth Symphony is \\"a variation on the concept of the Fourth\\" but \\"is embodied with even greater unity and scope\\" than its predecessor,Zhitomirsky, 109. more even in its \\"expressive balance,\\" according to Brown, more symmetrical in form and orthodox in its tonal progressions.Brown, Final, 150. Warrack calls Tchaikovsky's use of what he calls the \\"Providence\\" theme \\"both characteristic and ingenious\\" and \\"of a very different order from the battering brass motive [sic] associated with Fate in the Fourth Symphony.\\"Warrack, Symphonies, 30. Maes adds that, through the use of this theme in all four movements, Tchaikovsky achieved \\"greater thematic cohesion\\" than in the Fourth.Maes, 158. Only the finale remains, in Warrack's words, \\"unconvincing\\" and \\"too easy.\\"Warrack, Symphonies, 32-3. Maes agrees on the finale's \\"hollow rhetoric\\" and quotes musicologist Edward Garden as saying the same. Brown says it \\"fatally mars a splendid symphony which earlier demonstrated how convincingly Tchaikovsky could now create a large- scale symphonic work of complete technical assurance and structural equilibrium, yet wholly his own in expression.\\"Brown, Final, 155-6. ===Symphony No. 6 \\"Pathétique\\"=== The Pathétique, which John Warrack calls \\"a symphony of defeat\\" and the composer's attempt \\"to exorcise and drive out the sombre demons that had so long plagued him,\\"Warrack, Symphonies, 34-5. is a work of prodigious originality and power; to Brown, this symphony is perhaps one of Tchaikovsky's most consistent and perfectly composed works.Brown, Man and Music, 417. Maes claims this work \\"demonstrates most clearly\\" that Tchaikovsky treated the symphony as a general form not to be strictly followed. This holds most true, he says, with the slow finale, marked Adagio lamentoso, ending on a note of complete resignation in the basses--the first time a composer had dared to do so--while the opening movement \\"is more emotionally balanced than the reputation of the symphony would lead one to suppose.\\"Maes, 164. ==Conclusions== Cooper maintains that if Tchaikovsky's symphonies were to be judged on strictly academic terms--in other words, on the same level as their Austro-German contemporaries and predecessors--they might \\"be considered fine music but poor symphonies.\\"Cooper, 30. This line of thought, he maintains, is like architecture critics who believe that, \\"because no more beautiful and satisfactory churches than the Gothic cathedrals of the Middle Ages have been built since, therefore all churches should be built in the Gothic Style.\\" However, Cooper suggests, if they were to be \\"judged as a hybrid species\\" of symphony and symphonic poem, with inner workings more flexible and varied than sonata form might allow inhabiting the general four- movement structure to accommodate the musical and extra-musical demands sought not just by Tchaikovsky but also a number of other Romantic-age composers, they could be considered \\"completely successful.\\" This, again in architectural terms, would be like when Gothic style was combined with the ideals of the Renaissance and the Counter-Reformation and a genuinely new style, the Baroque, resulted, \\"an organic development from the Gothic but as different in individuality as a child from its father.\\"Cooper, 26-7. Soviet musicologist Boris Asafyev, in fact, calls the Tchaikovsky symphonies \\"dramatic\\" as opposed to the \\"non-dramatic\\" symphonies of Franz Schubert and Alexander Glazunov, as though he is discussing, if not two entirely different genres, then two separate variations on a common form.Asafyev, 11-12. Brown delineates the issue along cultural as well as formal lines. Russian symphonies are not German symphonies, he maintains, and the fact they may function along different parameters than their German counterparts does not make them any less valid on a musical or experiential level.Brown, Final, page no. to come. Critics and musicologists agree universally that Tchaikovsky was not able to manipulate sonata form along the lines of a Mozart or Beethoven.Cooper, 29-30; Warrack, Symphonies, 8-11. This was a fact the composer himself bemoaned on more than one occasion.Cooper, 26; Warrack, Symphonies, 8. Though he received a Western European-style musical education, he still faced a native set of musical rules and traditions that did not conform at all to Western ones. Rather than ignore his native music and look Westward as his teacher Anton Rubinstein had done or forgo the West as much as possible as The Five did, he chose to face the problem from both sides head-on. The truth is, Wood writes, despite the composer's occasional self-indictments, Tchaikovsky did master \\"form\\" as he actually understood and could manage it from a compositional level.Wood, 84. Warrack calls Tchaikovsky's solution to large-scale composition \\"a compromise with sonata form.\\" Wood maintains that what the composer called his \\"mountains of padding\\" were simply inseparable from his initial conceptions—from his process of starting with an extra-musical program and from there deducing musical motives of widely divergent moods and character to be somehow worked into one movement. The alternative method was allowing his second theme to arise after and at the same time from the first, may have never occurred to him. However, it may have been equally likely that Tchaikovsky's compositional method never occurred to Mozart. While Tchaikovsky may have been incapable of writing absolute music, his real challenge was that while he was conscious of his formal shortcomings and continued striving for an unreached perfection, his actual ideal never really changed. Because the ideal never changed, the problems to which Tchaikovsky addressed himself never really changed, either. In this sense, it could be argued that he never really grew or matured.Wood, 85. Nevertheless, Tchaikovsky discovered a method by which to circumvent what he perceived as formal shortcomings and put his emotional life to work in large-scale abstract structures. ==List of symphonies== * No. 1 in G minor, Op. 13, Winter Daydreams (1866) * No. 2 in C minor, Op. 17, Little Russian (1872) * No. 3 in D major, Op. 29, Polish (1875) * No. 4 in F minor, Op. 36 (1877-1878) * Manfred Symphony, B minor, Op. 58; inspired by Lord Byron's poem Manfred (1885) * No. 5 in E minor, Op. 64 (1888) * No. 6 in B minor, Op. 74, Pathétique (1893) * Symphony in E-flat (sketched 1892 but not finished; reconstructed during the 1950s and subsequently published as Symphony No. 7)Because this work was discarded by Tchaikovsky and he rewrote parts of it as his Third Piano Concerto (which he completed on 3/15 October 1893, just three weeks before his death, making it his last completed work), it has generally not been included in the composer's canon. ==Notes and referencesNotes=References=Bibliography=== * Bonds, Mark Evan, \\"Symphony: II. 19th century.\\" In The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Second Edition (London: Macmillan, 2001), 29 vols., ed.

The sculpture, which turned out to be one of the most important Roman finds in Scotland for decades, was discovered by ferryman Robert Graham. It depicts a bound male prisoner being killed by a lioness. The upper torso and head of the prisoner are shown, with the giant lioness behind him, sinking her teeth into his skull. The work is interpreted as a Roman sculpture imported to Scotland to serve as part of the tomb of a Roman military commander or dignitary, and connected to the nearby Cramond Roman Fort. The location of such a tomb, and how the sculpture reached its location in the river are unknown. The sculpture is housed at the Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh. In 2003, plans were unveiled for the lioness to be housed in a new archaeological centre at the Roman Fort in Cramond, although this proposal was still at the initial planning stage in 2008. ==References *Cramond Lioness, National Museum of Scotland *Cramond Roman Fort, AOC Archaeology *Images of the front (showing prisoner clearly), and right side of the sculpture, DK Images Category:1997 in Scotland Category:Collections of the National Museums of Scotland Category:History of Edinburgh Category:Archaeological sites in Edinburgh Category:Scotland in the Roman era Category:Outdoor sculptures in Scotland Category:Roman Empire sculptures Category:Sculptures of lions Category:Stone sculptures in the United Kingdom ","title":"Cramond Lioness"},{"id":"20347247","text":"West side of the station is a railway station in Toyonaka, Osaka Prefecture, Japan, on the Hankyu Takarazuka Line operated by the Hankyu Railway. ==Lines== *Hankyu Takarazuka Line == Adjacent stations See also== *List of railway stations in Japan ==External links== *Okamachi (Hankyu Railway) Category:Railway stations in Osaka Prefecture Category:Hankyu Railway Takarazuka Line Category:Stations of Hankyu Railway Category:Railway stations in Japan opened in 1910 ","title":"Okamachi Station"},{"id":"20347257","text":"Matthau Mikojan in Stuttgart (October 16, 2008) Matthau Mikojan (born Matti Mikkonen, March 26, 1982) is a Finnish rock musician, singer, guitarist and songwriter in a band named after him. ==Life== Matthau Mikojan was born on March 26, 1982 in Tampere, Finland. His father Tapani \\"Arwo\\" Mikkonen was a founding member/guitarist/song writer in a famous Finnish band Popeda. He died prematurely and unexpected during soundcheck in 1986. He was only 31. About his mother Sirpa there is hardly any information to be found. Mikojan' s older brother Jukka Mikkonen, a.k.a. Sir Christus, was the lead guitarist of Negative. He also died prematurely and unexpected in 2017. He was 39. ==Musical developmentEarly beginnings=== Mikojan befriended Paavo Pekkonen in the summer of 1994. They started a band called RIP followed by Turmio, SBT-666 and Shit Kickers until finally in 1999 they settled with Bloodpit. Mikojan's first gig was not, however, with Bloodpit but with a group called \\"Ripuli\\" together with his brother and three other members as early as in 1995. ===Bloodpit=== Bloodpit plays its first gig on November 26, 1999. The band goes through several line-up changes, releases several self-produced EPs and participates in band competitions of which, alone in 2001, they win three in a row. The triumphant line-up, including Mikojan's brother whom they dub Kristus, plays festivals and builds a steady following. Bloodpit signs a recording contract in 2004 followed by the release of the debut Mental Circus (2005) and Off The Hook (2007). Within approximately two years Bloodpit releases several singles and an EP, is featured on the EA Game NHL-07 for PlayStation and the FC Venus movie soundtrack, tours and plays shows/festivals in Finland, Italy, Russia, Germany, Netherlands and The United States of America. Prolonged tensions between the membres of Bloodpit result in Mikojan's departure. In 2007 Mikojan embarks on a solo career. ===Matthau Mikojan=== Matthau Mikojan starts recording his solo album swiftly after parting ways with Bloodpit. The first single Stiletto Heels sees the daylight on February 6, followed by the self-titled debut on March 12, 2008. Matthau Mikojan, a three piece band, hits the road touring Finland, Germany and Swizerland. At the end of 2008 the red-hot band enters studio for the follow- up album Mania For Life (2009). At the beginning of 2010 Matthau Mikojan tours Germany with a renewed line-up. The third album \\"Hell Or High Water\\" comes out in 2011. In 2012 Matthau Mikojan plays only two shows, one in Helsinki and the other in Halden, Norway. In 2013 Mikojan starts recording his fourth album in solitude. The self-produced album \\"Her Foreign Language\\" comes out in 2015 followed by a handful of live performances. Mikojan's big brother Jukka Mikkonen's sudden death in 2017 forces Mikojan to write a song called \\"Epitaph\\" which is released on Jukka's birthday April 10, 2019. Mikojan is currently working on new material.

Of all the fourteenth- century opponents of Gregory Palamas, he was the most systematic theologian, and perhaps the ablest. Most of his works remain in original manuscripts, unedited; none has ever appeared in translation in a modern language. Although editions of some of his works have been made since the 1950s, most of them, published in small printings in Greece, are nearly as difficult to come by in the West as the original manuscripts themselves. ==Life== Few facts about Kyparissiotes’ life are known. The Kyparissiotes family name appears in Byzantine records occasionally from the tenth century onwards. It points to a family origin in Kyparissia, a town on the southwest coast of the Peloponnesus; whether John Kyparissiotes was born there, however, or at Constantinople, or at some other location, remains uncertain. The level of sophistication of his writings suggests that, wherever he was born, he was educated in the Byzantine capital. By 1342 at the latest he had sided with the opponents of Palamas in the religious controversy over Hesychasm that was then dividing Byzantine society and exacerbating a civil war. He may have belonged to the circle of scholars who frequented the house of Nikephoros Gregoras; he speaks of him with great respect, and is our sole source for the information that, after Gregoras’s death, the Palamites dragged his dead body through the streets.See Kyparissiotes, Palamitarum transgressionum (On the Crimes of the Palamites), IV.10 (PG 152, 733D-736A). Other acquaintances included Demetrios Kydones, the prime minister to John VI Kantakouzenos and John V Palaiologos and translator of Aquinas. In the renewed persecution of Antipalamites that followed the condemnation of Demetrios Kydones’ brother, the monk Prochoros, in 1368, Kyparissiotes found it necessary to flee the country. In 1371 he was living in Cyprus, as is testified by a letter from Demetrios Kydones (ep. 35). From there, he headed further west; records indicate that he travelled with the court of Pope Gregory XI during the latter’s journey from Avignon to Rome (9 November 1376 - 12 December 1377), and received from him a monthly pension.See Angelo Mercati, \\"Giovanni Ciparissiota alla corte di Gregorio XI,\\" Byzantinische Zeitschrift 30 (1929/30), 496-501. By then, he must have become a Roman Catholic. It is possible, though not certain, that Kyparissiotes is the “good John” of whom Kydones, in another letter (ep. 130), speaks as having returned to Constantinople (1378/79). If so, that would be the last piece of information we have about him. ==Writings== We possess from Kyparissiotes’ pen two major writings, and a number of minor ones. His two most important works are the Decades, on the one hand, and Against the Heresy of the Palamites, on the other. The latter work is a gigantic polemical treatise in five parts, most of which still remains unedited. Of its first part, titled On the Crimes of the Palamites, books 1 and 4 have been published (Migne, PG 152, 664-737, which reprints the 1672 edition of Combefis). Part five of the larger work is a detailed refutation of the Concise Treatise of Nilos Kabasilas,Text edited by Manuel Candal, “La «Regla teológica» de Nilo Cabásilas,” Orientalia Christiana Periodica 23 (1957), 240-256. and consists of five books. Kyparissiotes' point in this work, as elsewhere, is to defend divine simplicity; he argues that there is no middle term between the uncreated and the created, and that whatever is uncreated must be really identical with the one divine nature. The text of this work was edited by Dr. Stavros Maragoudaki and published in Athens in 1985.Stavros Th. Maragoudaki, (Editio princeps) [John Kyparissiotes’ Five antirrhetic treatises against Nilos Kabasilas, now first appearing in print (Editio princeps)]. Second edition (Athens, 1985). As for the Decades — or, to give it its proper title, the Elementary Exposition of Theological Texts () — it is a less overtly polemical work, although it too is ultimately concerned with refuting the Palamite theology. It is organized into ten parts, each part being further divided into ten chapters (hence the alternative title). Albert Ehrhard characterized this work as “the first [Byzantine] attempt at a systematic Dogmatics in the manner of Western scholasticism.”A. Ehrhard, “Theologie,” in Karl Krumbacher, Geschichte der byzantinischen Litteratur, 2nd ed. (Munich 1897), p. 107. He goes on to speak of it in the following way: > “Like the Scholastics, John begins with a setting forth of axioms, > definitions, and classifications of theology (in the sense of the Doctrine > of God). He distinguishes between a mystical and a demonstrative theology; > demonstrative theology is further divided into affirmative and negative. > Affirmative theology deals with the divine emanations and names, negative > theology with God’s infinity, both in creatures and in himself, and, > finally, with divine simplicity. By means of further subdivisions, John > obtains ten Decades, each of them containing further chapters. The imitation > of the Scholastics is, nevertheless, limited to these resemblances; in terms > of its content, this Byzantine Summa de Deo consists purely of passages from > the fathers, organized under the specific points under consideration. The > chief authority is Dionysius the Pseudo-Areopagite; after him, Athanasius, > the three Cappadocians, Chrysostom, Cyril of Alexandria, and John of > Damascus reappear most frequently.” Migne reprints the Latin translation of this work, made by Francisco Torres in the late sixteenth century (PG 152, 741-992). More recently, an edition of the Greek text is reported to have appeared, although so far it is not to be found in most Western libraries.Vasileios L. Dentakes, ed., (Editio princeps).

Herzlich missed the entire 2009 season due to Ewing's Sarcoma, a rare form of bone cancer, which he overcame and earned numerous honors for his courage and outreach, including the Disney Spirit Award, Nils V. \\"Swede\\" Nelson Award, an honorary Lott Trophy, and the ACC Commissioner’s Cup. In 2010, Herzlich returned to the football field and won the Rudy Award and the ACC's Brian Piccolo Award after starting all 13 games and finishing third on the team with 65 tackles and 50 solo stops. He tied for first on the team with two forced fumbles, second on the team with four interceptions and four pass break ups and also had 3.5 tackles for a loss. ==Cancer diagnosis== On May 14, 2009, Herzlich announced that he had been diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma, a rare form of bone cancer, stating in a press release: On September 29, 2009, Mark Herzlich announced that he was cancer free. This was confirmed by the team doctors. He publicly announced this during the ESPN and Home Depot College Gameday Special at Boston College on October 3, 2009.Boston College Eagles' Mark Herzlich says cancer recovery nearly done - ESPN Boston He sat out the remainder of the 2009 season and returned in 2010, registering five tackles (three solo) in the season-opening 38-20 win against FCS school Weber State. Despite not playing college football in 2009, he received the Disney's Wide World of Sports Spirit Award for overcoming cancer, as well as the Nils V. \\"Swede\\" Nelson Award for sportsmanship. In January 2011, he received the \\"Most Courageous Athlete\\" award from the Philadelphia Sports Writers Association. Herzlich in 2016 ==Professional career== Herzlich was not selected in the 2011 NFL Draft even though he was invited to attend the event. After going undrafted, Herzlich was selected with the 51st pick of the 10th round by the Omaha Nighthawks of the UFL. Despite this, Herzlich stated that he would wait for an NFL contract rather than join the UFL. On July 26, 2011, the New York Giants signed Herzlich to a three-year, $1.41 million contract as an undrafted free agent at the recommendation of owner John Mara. Herzlich made the New York Giants final 53 man roster. On November 20, 2011, Herzlich made his first NFL start against the Philadelphia Eagles. Set to become a free agent in 2014, he re-signed with the Giants on March 7, 2014. On March 20, 2017, Herzlich re-signed with the Giants. On September 2, 2017, he was placed on injured reserve after suffering a stinger in training camp. On March 12, 2018, Herzlich re-signed with the Giants. On September 1, 2018, Herzlich was released by the Giants. ==References *Profile at BCEagles.com * Category:1987 births Category:American football linebackers Category:American people of Austrian-Jewish descent Category:Boston College Eagles football players Category:Cancer survivors Category:Living people Category:New York Giants players Category:People from Kirkwood, Missouri Category:Players of American football from Pennsylvania Category:Sportspeople from Chester County, Pennsylvania Category:Sportspeople from St. Louis County, Missouri Category:Super Bowl champions ","title":"Mark Herzlich"},{"id":"20347327","text":"The Ohaaki Power Station is a geothermal power station owned and operated by Contact Energy. A distinctive feature of this power station is the 105 m high natural draft cooling tower, the only one of its kind in New Zealand. Although initially constructed to generate 104 MW, decline in the steamfield has meant maximum net capacity is about 65 MW with an annual output of around 400 GWh pa.Contact Energy Prospectus, 1999 There are currently three turbines in operation. One smaller turbine runs off high pressure steam which then backfeeds into the main intermediate pressure system that feeds the two main units. Condensers on the back end of the main turbines are fed cooled water from the cooling tower to condense the steam back into water. Additional condensate gained in this process is reinjected back into the ground. Electricity Generation at Ohaaki, New Zealand.

It is located on Poihipi Road near Taupo in New Zealand. The plant produces around 350 GWh pa, utilising geothermal steam from the Wairakei field, and is operated as part of the Wairakei geothermal system. Electricity Generation at Poihipi, New Zealand. ==Development== The station has had an extraordinarily contentious history. In the beginning, Alistair McLachlan and his wife Ava Marie ran a sheep farm for their Waituruturu trust, but also a greenhouse to grow roses and orchids in \\"artificial monsoon\\" conditions enabled by geothermal heat: approximately two square kilometres of their land overlay the Wairakei geothermal field. Their Waituruturu trust joined with Mercury Network (wholly owned subsidiary of Mercury Energy) to form a joint venture, Mercury Geotherm Limited, (33% owned by the McLauchlans, or 49% according to the N.Z. Herald, 11 January 2005) and Poihipi Land Limited, wholly owned by MGL. Some land was for the power station, the rest remained as farmland. The original design involved two 23 MW refurbished Elliot turbine- generators but late in the design these were abandoned in favour of a newer Fuji Electric 55 MW system completed for the Geysers geothermal field in the U.S.A by the state of California, but never run. Despite the cost of conversion from the U.S.A standard of 60 cycles/sec. to the N.Z. standard of 50 cycles/sec. the resulting project was much cheaper than using new equipment. (Utilisation of Second-Hand Plant to Reduce Capital Investment and Project Lead Times, Minoru Frederiksens et al., 2000) Steam supply constraints limited full power to about fourteen hours a day, with only about 3 MW at night. All other geothermal stations are typically run at constant full power. This unusual operating pattern attracted analysis, as in Optimised Numerical Modelling of Production from the Poihipi Dry Steam Zone: Wairakei Geothermal System by Sadiq J. Zarrouk et al., 2006. Initial maximum power levels soon fell from ~43 MW to 30 MW due to a shortage of steam. In 2001 Contact applied for fresh consents (for Wairakei, and Poihipi which it had bought in 2000) which were granted in 2004 but appealed against by the Taupo Council (concerned over land subsidence) and others. In 2007, approval was gained, so with access to more steam (from the whole field, not just that under the McLachlan's land) generation attained 50 MW, full-time; the plot shows that such operation precedes 2007. ===Litigation=== Litigation started in 1989 between the Electricity Corporation of New Zealand and Geotherm Energy Limited (owned by the Waituruturu Trust), challenging ECNZ's entitlement to draw geothermal fluid from the Wairakei field and in 1990 GEL applied to take 44,000 tonnes/day for their new power station, to be named Poihipi, but was granted only 10,000 tonnes/day. ECNZ objected because of their need for the Wairakei power station. A report describing this need was not made available to GEL, despite applications and in frustration, GEL applied to declare the ECNZ \\"anti-competitive\\" and using their dominant market position to deter advisors, service providers, customers, financiers and investors from dealing with GEL, as well as making baseless statutory applications to hinder GEL's planning applications, and that the ECNZ intended to prevent GEL from supplying power to Electrical Supply Authorities. By 1996 the power station was built. MGL attempted to apply for additional consents allowing the discharge of contaminants to the air, but the Ngati Rauhoto hapu appealed due to inadequate consultation. An application to commence usage was rejected because it was MGL's error in deciding to complete the station before securing all necessary consents, but a priority hearing was allowed. Ngati Rauhoto sought to relitigate the power station consent, but were estopped as having already accepted the use of geothermal fluid. Costs of $700,000 were awarded against Ngati Rauhoto. Immediately after consents were granted, it became clear that the deep liquid steam wells did not provide sufficient fluid. As well, changes to the electricity pricing scheme made it less profitable for Mercury Network to buy power from the station. MGL wrote the value of the plant down to $50,000,000 and could not cover the debenture of $80,000,000, thus the call for the appointing of receivers for MGL and PLL, but the McLauchlans obtained an interim injunction against this. Meanwhile, the Electricity Corporation had been dissolved and the Wairakei power plant was now owned by Contact Energy Limited, who had applied for consent to reinject used fluid as part of their new low-temperature plant to be added to the main Wairaki stations, thus reducing their dumping into the Waikato river. MGL objected because this reinjection of low-temperature fluid (much cooler than that already being re-injected) would be detrimental to their Poihipi plant. But in December 1998 Judge Whiting held that Contact's existing (inherited) consents allowed for reinjection at any temperature and consequently, receivers were appointed for MGL and PLL, who decided to sell the Poihipi power plant and the leased land to Contact. The McLachlans responded with litigation on two fronts: suing Mercury Energy (by then split, into retail activity still called Mercury Energy but taken over by Mighty River Power, while the line network business became Vector) for faults that led to the failure of the joint venture (claiming $400,000,000), and, denying that the land had been properly sold to Contact as the McLaughlans (the pre-MGL owners) had arranged for the right of first refusal should that land be sold. Multiple entanglements, reaching to the Privy Council ensued. In a deed of settlement in 2006, the McLauchlans abandoned damages proceedings and further arguments over the lease. This however triggered more reverberations in the workings (or not) of the lease but the High Court held that arguments based on an implied term, rectification, mistake, estoppel, and relief against forfeiture were rejected, and that the lease was void for having an uncertain term of application. Thus, the \\"right of first refusal\\" did not in fact protect the McLauchlans, and, Contact retains a competitive advantage. Details in Climate Change Law, Simon Schofield, 2014.

It is set in the autumn of 1995 during the reign in Nigeria of the despot General Abacha, who is waging a campaign of suppression against journalists. A Nigerian girl and her younger brother must leave suddenly after their mother is killed in a failed assassination of their outspoken father. They are put in to London but abandoned and they must cope with the police, social services and school bullies. Naidoo won the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject. ==Plot summary== Although this novel is written in the third person, it presents the perspective of a 12-year-old girl, Sade Solaja. Her father, Folarin Solaja, is a journalist, one of the most critical of the corrupt regime. The book opens with her memory of hearing the two shots which ended her mother's life, a memory which recurs throughout the novel in her thoughts and dreams. Her memories of Nigeria are often set in contrast to her experiences of an alien England, while her mother's remembered words of wisdom give her comfort and strength. The concentration on Sade's point of view makes many events seem secure and confusing, just as she experiences them. After the shooting, Sade's Uncle Tunde urges her father to send her and her 10-year-old brother Femi to safety in England. They are forced to pack and leave suddenly and secretly. They fly to London posing as the children of a stranger, Mrs Bankole, so they can travel on her passport. When their Uncle Dele fails to collect them at the airport, Mrs Bankole abandons them at a coffee shop near Victoria Station. Money less and friendless, they wander the streets looking for the art college where their uncle works. They find refuge in a video store, but the owner calls the police, believing them to be vandals. Thus they come to the attention of the authorities. Worried to tell the truth in case it endangers their father, Sade takes refuge in silence and later in half-truths. The children are fostered first by Mrs Graham and her rude and mean son Kevin and later by the Kings, a Jamaican couple whose children have grown up and left. They are sent to different schools. Sade is sent to Avon High School where she meets a girl from Somalia, called Mariam whose story is similar to Sade's. Marcia and Donna the Bullies from school treat Sade very badly, putting pressure on her to steal a turquoise lighter from Mariam's uncle's store. Femi goes to Greenslades Primary School. They become reticent with each other. It later emerges that her worried father has entered England illegally to look for them but has been arrested. There is a chance that he will be deported to face certain death in Nigeria, especially as the Nigerian police claim he is wanted for his wife's murder. Although Iyawo Jenny and Mr Nathan try their hardest to help Sade's father but things are not working out. Sade braves the freezing night to speak to \\"Mr. Seven O'Clock\\", the newscaster whom she has seen on television, to bring her father's story to the attention of the British public. The story ends with her father's release for Christmas, though asylum has yet to be granted. They hope one day they can return safely to Nigeria. Sade misses her grandmother and her former life. ==Foreword== The foreword is written by Jon Snow, a real-life \\"Mr Seven O'Clock\\", who describes the book as \\"a fast and vivid account of a family's escape from threat and murder.... Not only a marvellous read, but one that refuels the desire for justice and freedom within and beyond our shores\\". Then say by quoting that a line has been taken out of one of Donne's poems that is \\"on a huge hill, cragged and steep, truth stands, and he that will reach her, about must, and about must go\\" ==Sequel== A sequel, \\"Web of Lies,\\" was published by Amistad Press in 2006. This story deals with the problems faced by Femi while the family is waiting to hear if asylum is to be granted. It was nominated for an Angus Book Award. ==Themes== The book consists of several themes. The most important and recognisable are: * Refugees * Clash of cultures (adaptation and tolerance) * Freedom of speech vs. censorship * Democracy vs. dictatorship * Discrimination and prejudice * Human rights * The truth * Coming of age * Asylum * Loss and displacement ==Awards== The Other Side of Truth won a UK Arts Council Award for work in progress.The Other Side of Truth. Author. Beverley Naidoo. Retrieved 28 March 2013. After publication it won the British librarians (CILIP) Carnegie Medal as the year's best children's book. A retrospective citation by CILIP says that it \\"skilfully blends fact and fiction to leave a lasting impression of real issues at work\\" and describes it as: \\"An important book which challenges the notion of 'truth' itself.\\" It further describes the writing as \\"gripping, powerful and evocative\\". The Other Side of Truth was silver runner up for the 2000 Nestlé Smarties Book Prize, was named an International Board on Books for Young People Honour Book in 2002, and won the 2002 Jane Addams Children's Book Award. ==Allusions to historical events== The novel refers to the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and other journalists, which caused an international outcry in 1995. It is set in the immediate aftermath of those executions. Although in the early twenty- first century the military regime no longer controls the country, media rights body Reporters Without Borders says Nigeria is still a violent place for the press, with journalists often suffering beatings, unfair arrests and police raids.\\"Daily Abuses suffered by Nigeria's journalists\\", Reporters without Borders, 7 May 2012 Also referred to in the novel is the civil war in Somalia, which Sade's school friend Mariam experienced as a young child. ==See also== This Side of the Truth, a poem by Dylan Thomas. ==References== Nestle Smarties Silver Award Winner ==External links== * —immediately, first US edition * Dossier – The Other Side of Truth (Beverley Naidoo) —Resources at La Clé des langues * Author's comments at British Council * Teaching resource sheets * Category:2000 British novels Category:2000 children's books Category:British children's novels Category:Carnegie Medal in Literature winning works Category:Novels set in London Category:Novels set in Nigeria Category:Fiction set in 1995 Category:HarperCollins books Category:Refugees and displaced people in fiction ","title":"The Other Side of Truth"},{"id":"20347467","text":"Fredrik Stjernvall.

Among the many archaeological finds, one of the most famous is a sculpture known as the Cramond Lioness. ==History== The fort at Cramond was located on the River Almond at the point where it flows into the Forth. In Roman times, there was probably a natural harbour here.T. Christopher Smout, (1992), Scotland and the sea, page 15. Rowman & Littlefield One suggested interpretation is that Cramond formed a chain of Lothian forts along with Carriden and Inveresk.

The Rock Island Public Library traces its beginnings to 1872, making it one the oldest public libraries in Illinois. However, fee-based public libraries started in 1855 in Rock Island and have contributed to the history of Illinois' original library system. ==Association Library 1855-1857== On June 23, 1855 Joseph B. Danforth, the editor of the Rock Island Republican printed an editorial explaining four reasons why Rock Island needed to start a public library.Diane Oestreich, \\"Rock Island Public Library 19th Street and 4th Avenue,\\" Rock Island Argus Newspaper, December 30, 2001, C1. The following week, on June 27, 1855, an anonymous letter was published in the Rock Island Argus, formerly the Republican, offering to give $100 to build a book collection if nine other men would promise to give $100 and if the city promised to give the ten men lifelong membership and a building to store the books.Roland Tweet, Miss Gale's Books: The Beginnings of the Rock Island Public Library, (Rock Island, IL: Rock Island Public Library, 1997), 5. Because nine other men did not step forward to provide the funds needed to reach the $1,000 required to build a collection, Rock Island's citizens decided to have a meeting on September 15, 1855, to decide how a library could be created in Rock Island. The meeting created the Rock Island Library and Reading Room Association, a board of officers and a committee to draft a constitution.Roland Tweet, 4. Since Illinois law did not include a provision that allowed the city to tax the residents to fund a library, the board of officers decided the library would be open to the \\"public\\" as long the man was a Rock Island resident and could pay the yearly membership fee. By the end of the September 15 meeting, the men had raised $500 from their own personal funds, set up another committee designed to raise money for the library and a fee schedule. The library fees ranged from $3.00 for a yearly membership to $100 for a family lifetime membership as long as the children were under 21 years old.Roland Tweet, 5. For unexplained reasons, the Association Library closed by the end of 1857, forcing library members to store the books in their own homes for safekeeping until another library would open in 1865.Diane Oestreich, C1. ==Young Men's Literary Association 1865-1871== On January 12, 1865, a notice printed in the Rock Island Argus informed the public that there would be a meeting on the 16th for the purpose of creating a new library.Roland Tweet, 7. An informal constitution and library board was created before the meeting in the hope that a new library would be created. The first meeting of the Young Men’s Literary Association was on January 23, 1865, and that night the constitution was adopted and officers were elected.Roland Tweet, 9. The yearly membership fee was set at $3.00 per year. After setting the business of the library, the next step was to retrieve all of the books that were left at former members' homes when the Library Association closed in 1859, leaving about 1,500 books available for checkout.Roland Tweet, 11. Almost 1,000 books were never recovered and were lost forever in former members' homes.Roland Tweet, 9. In April 1866, the library opened six days a week, closing on Sunday. In 1868, the library hired Miss Ellen Gale as the new librarian. In 1872, the Young Men's Literary Association helped start the free Rock Island Public Library by giving the new public library their entire book collection. ==Rock Island Public Library 1872-1901== In 1872, the Illinois State Legislature created a law giving city councils the power to tax citizens for public library funding, effectively creating the public library system in Illinois.Roland Tweet, 15. The Rock Island City Council was quick to implement the new tax, and the Rock Island Public Library opened its doors on November 25, 1872 with Miss Gale as the head librarian.Roland Tweet, 15. Miss Gale worked for the Rock Island Public Library for 64 years, the longest tenure of any librarian in the history of Illinois. The public library was able to open its doors so quickly due to the gift of supplies and books from the Young Men’s Literary Association, the community's fee-based library from 1865-1871.Roland Tweet, 18. The new public library also took over the association's library's rooms on the second floor of the Mitchell & Lynde Building on Eagle Street. (The location now holds a bank building.) The Rock Island City Library and Reading Room Association occupied these rooms from 1855-1859.Roland Tweet, 9 & 18. The library board decided that for all citizens to be able to use the library it had to be open seven days a week, since many people only had Sundays off. By the end of the first two weeks the library had checked out more than 1,000 books. To increase space for both books and patrons, the library board decided to rent another room.Roland Tweet, 23. Over the next ten years the library would continue to have budget and space problems. By 1891, Miss Gale had organized the books by subject (history, travel, poetry and fiction) and by alphabetical order within their subject. To raise money for more books at the library, Miss Gale sold copies of the book catalog for $.15 a piece.Roland Tweet, 25. In 1899, the library had 14,866 books in their collection, 1,070 of them children's books.Roland Tweet, 31. The Rock Island Public Library had outgrown their three rooms at the Mitchell & Lynde Building and the library board started to look for land and financing to build a new library to support the library's collection of books and the growing population of Rock Island readers. On April 3, 1900, the library board purchased a lot for the new library and on January 10, 1901, the board chose design plans for an Ionic building finished in Italian Renaissance Architecture.Roland Tweet, 34 - 35. ==Rock Island Public Library 1902-present== On August 23, 1902, a cornerstone was laid at the northwest corner of the future public library.Roland Tweet, 36 In September 1902 the decorative frieze was placed around the top of the building. The twelve authors carved into the sandstone are the last names of Homer, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Virgil, Victor Hugo, William Shakespeare, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Robert Burns, Esaias Tegner, Alighieri Dante, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and George Bancroft.Roland Tweet, 37. The total cost of the library when it was completed was $90,448.20, $30,000 over the proposed library budget.Roland Tweet, 36. The Main Library building opened on December 15, 1903, in downtown Rock Island for browsing. When the library first opened newspapers called it the \\"Rock Island’s Temple of Literature\\" and was hailed by the Argus as one of the most \\"handsomely appointed in the State outside of Chicago.\\"Roland Tweet, 38. The main, or first floor, was divided between an Adult Reading Room, Children's Department, Reference Department, and enough stacks to hold 16,000 books.Roland Tweet, 38. The second floor had two unfinished meeting rooms, the Director's Office, and a room to hold local artwork.Roland Tweet, 38. The only artwork in the local art showroom was a model of the battleship Illinois, made by David Thompson.Roland Tweet, 38. The basement housed the heating plant, an unpacking room, and a storage room for back issues of the Argus and local historical documents.Roland Tweet, 38. On May 3, 1937, Miss Gale resigned as the librarian of the Rock Island Public Library.Roland Tweet, 38. The library continued to grow over the next 100 years by adding branch libraries, additions and renovations to the downtown library, an expanding collection, and the purchase of a new outreach bookmobile. ==Main (Downtown) Library== Main Rock Island Library The Main Library building opened on December 15, 1903 in downtown Rock Island. When the library first opened it was called the Rock Island’s Temple of Literature, but the name has been changed to the Main Library since the introduction of the branches. The current layout of the library has changed many times from its original opening in 1903. The handicapped accessible Ground Floor houses the large Children's Department, including children's study area and children's computer lab. The Ground Floor also holds staff offices, bathrooms, a small meeting room, book resale shelf, and two display cases. From 1985 to 2015, one of the larger cases held a display of dolls known as Story Mountain, from a collection originally donated to the library in the 1950s. The dolls of Story Mountain have moved to a case by the Children's Room, with new dolls rotated into the case every few months. The central case holds rotating exhibits. Story Mountain has since been removed. The main floor or first floor houses the reference and circulations departments, computer lab, and a small local history collection of Rock Island history. The first floor houses new books, fiction, large print, music, movies, newspapers & magazines, teen (young adult) section, book kits, and reference collections. Specialized collections available for checkout include cake pans and cookie cutters. The second floor houses the business office of the Rock Island Public Library, a community room for library programs and public meetings, and an area for local art exhibits. Since 1986, a Mezzanine level between the first and second floors has held the Main Library's non- fiction collection. All floors have wireless internet. A major 1986 addition added a great deal of space to the Main Library. In 2006, the Main Library closed for a month for new paint, carpeting, desk changes, and other space remodeling.Libraries, City of Rock Island, http://www.rigov.org/citydepartments/ripl/library.html (accessed November 21, 2008). This location is now referred to as the Downtown Library, to more accurately place its location within Rock Island. The phone number is 309-732-READ, which was designed so patrons would be unable to forget the number. The Rock Island Public Library is a member of PrairieCat library network, and of RAILS (Reaching Across Illinois Library System.) ==30/31 Branch Library== 30/31 Branch Library The 30/31 Branch library is located at the intersection of 31st Avenue and 30th Street, which is why it is called the 30/31 Library. The branch was built in 1957 as a combination library and fire station, which was closed when Rock Island's fire stations consolidated in the 1970s. Soon after the fire station closed the city council decided to expand the library and add the additional square footage to the branch library to serve the information needs of Rock Island's citizens that could not travel to the downtown library. The branch has wireless internet access, a computer lab, children's and adult reading areas and a self-checkout machine. The branch features a drive-up book pickup and book drop. The branch is open six days a week and closed on Sundays. The branch also holds a book sale and program room. The south side of the branch has an Illinois native wildflower garden and table set for patrons wanting to enjoy nature while reading. This branch was closed December 14, 2019, in preparation for a later sale of the building. The Rock Island Public Library board of trustees formally accepted a bid from the American Doll and Toy Museum. The sale closed August 7, 2020, officially transferring ownership from the Library to the American Doll and Toy Museum. == New Outreach Vehicle == In September 2019, the library purchased a 2014 Ford F59 Walk-in Van bookmobile from LDV Custom Specialty Vehicles. Significant funding for this purchase came from a gift from the Rock Island Public Library Foundation. Named Library2Go, the mobile library began its first routes on January 6, 2020, providing material checkouts, returns, and mobile WiFi access. ==Southwest Branch Library == Southwest Branch Library The Southwest Rock Island branch is located in Southwest Rock Island, an area that is south of the original city of Rock Island and adjoins the Rock River (Mississippi River) and the village of Milan. The Southwest branch was created to conveniently serve the information needs of Southwest Rock Island citizens. The Southwest Branch Library is attached to the Rock Island Fire Station #2. In 1974, a small library was added onto the side of the fire station, and it opened soon after to the public. In 2001, the branch was renovated adding bathrooms, a community room, children's room, and computer lab and study area.

A right-handed middle-order batsman sometimes used as an opener and an occasional leg-break bowler, Coope played for Yorkshire's second eleven in Minor Counties cricket before the war. He was also prominent in Bradford League cricket, and he followed another leading Bradford League cricketer, Johnny Lawrence, to Somerset after the war, arriving for the 1947 season. Coope made 20 and 58 in his first match, the Whitsun 1947 County Championship game against Gloucestershire. After this, he played regularly for the rest of the season and less than two months after making his debut, he scored 113, his first century and the highest score of his career, as Somerset beat the 1947 season's County Champions, Middlesex for the second time in the season – Middlesex were, however, lacking the prolific Denis Compton, Bill Edrich and Jack Robertson, all of whom were playing in the Gentlemen v Players match. The century brought Coope his county cap. By the end of his first season in first-class cricket, Coope had scored 791 runs at an average of 20.81. In the 1948 season, Coope played in every single match played by Somerset and topped 1,000 runs for the county, finishing with 1172 runs for the season at the average of 22.11 runs per innings. He did not make a century, his highest being 89 against Sussex at Eastbourne, when he put on 209 for the fifth wicket with Harold Gimblett, who made the then highest-ever score for Somerset, 310. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noted that Coope \\"gave some attractive displays but inclined to inconsistency\\". In 1949, Coope began the season well and in the match against Lancashire at Old Trafford in mid May he hit an unbeaten 102, his second century of his career, out of a Somerset total of 190. But his batting fell away and when Somerset's usual band of August amateurs became available, he lost his place and did not regain it. At the end of the season, he was not re-engaged and returned to League cricket in Yorkshire. In just three seasons of first-class cricket, Coope had made 2789 runs at an average of 21.12. But the reputation for inconsistency, first aired in Wisden, remains. David Foot, the historian of Somerset cricket, wrote of Coope: \\"As a batsman his range of shots was ambitious and he had one of the most delicate late cuts ever paraded in the West. There were two centuries from him but he was also a luxury, never quite consistent or disciplined enough with his repertoire to make a successful county cricketer.\\" ==References== Category:1916 births Category:1974 deaths Category:English cricketers Category:Somerset cricketers Category:North v South cricketers ","title":"Miles Coope"},{"id":"20348178","text":"Francis Charles Kilner (1851 – 19 March 1921) was an Anglican Suffragan Bishop in the early part of the 20th century.

The youngest of four sons, Welch, was sent to a boarding school at the age of 11, after his mother died from wasting kidney disease. After a brief time at prep school in London, Welch was sent to Repton, where he was a contemporary of the writer Roald Dahl and actor Geoffrey Lumsden.David Atkins, Welch's contemporary at Repton (albeit in a different house) suggested in The Author Magazine (of Spring 1992) that Welch was bullied by Dahl, but there is no reference to this in Maiden Voyage. Nor is it in Dahl's own account of his Repton years, Boy. Dahl did mention Welch (\\"a fine writer\\") in his first draft, specifically his running away from Repton, but not in the published book (see Sturrock (2010) Storyteller: The Life of Roald Dahl, London: HarperPress). By his and others' accounts, his time there was miserable, and he ran away prior to his last term. After leaving Repton, he studied art at Goldsmiths' in London with the intention of becoming a painter. Welch spent part of his pre-school childhood in China, and returned for a longer spell after he left Repton. He recorded this episode in his fictionalised autobiography, Maiden Voyage (1943). With the help and patronage of Edith Sitwell and John Lehmann this became a small but lasting success and made for him a distinct and individual reputation. It was followed by the novel In Youth is Pleasure (1944), a study of adolescence published in a limited edition by Herbert Read at the publishers Faber and Faber and then more widely by Routledge. Read said he was happy to publish the book, and enjoyed it himself, but he warned Welch that many people would find its hero perverse and unpleasant.James King, Herbert Read: The Last Modern (London, Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1990) p. 220. A collection of short stories, entitled Brave and Cruel followed (1948). The bulk of Welch's output was to see posthumous publication: an unfinished autobiographical novel A Voice Through a Cloud in 1950; a further short story collection, A Last Sheaf, in 1951; The Denton Welch Journals in 1952; an unfinished travelogue, I Left My Grandfather's House in 1958; and a poetry collection, Dumb Instrument, in 1976. ==Accident and literary work== At the age of 20, Welch was hit by a car while cycling in Surrey and suffered a fractured spine. He was temporarily paralysed, and suffered severe pain and bladder complications, including pyelonephritis and spinal tuberculosis that ultimately led to his early death. After the accident, Welch spent time at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery and then was relocated to Southcourt Nursing Home in Broadstairs, Kent. In July 1936, Welch rented an apartment with his friend and housekeeper Evelyn Sinclair in Tonbridge so that he could be close to his doctor, John Easton. Sinclair travelled with him to various residences until May 1946, when he settled in one of the Noël and Bernard Adeney residences in Middle Orchard, Borough Green with his partner, Eric Oliver. Two years later, Sinclair moved in as well, and remained with him until his death on 30 December 1948. Despite his injuries, he continued to paint, and perhaps because of them, he started to write. In 1940, he began to write poems, the first one appearing in print in 1941. In August 1942, he wrote an essay on the painter Walter Sickert which, published originally in Horizon, brought him to the notice of Edith Sitwell, in no small part down to his own cultivation of her attentions. Scores of short stories followed, around a dozen being published in various magazines. Many more were left unfinished at the time of his death. Welch's literary work, intense and introverted, has been described as Proustianhttps://www.enotes.com/topics/journals-denton-welch/critical- essays/critical-context in its attention to the minutiae of life, in particular that of the English countryside during World War II. A close attention to aesthetics, be it in human behaviour, physical appearance, clothing, art, architecture, jewellery, or antiques, is also a recurring concern in his writings. The extent to which Welch's work is autobiography or fiction has been much discussed, apart from his frequent use of the first person (and in some cases is identified in the narrative as \\"Denton\\"). Fictional content aside, the point of origin of virtually all of his stories is biographical: they are often set in places he knew or had visited, and feature thinly-disguised, often deeply unflattering, depictions of friends, family and acquaintances (to the extent that over thirty years after Welch's death, his art school friend, the artist Gerald Leet, refused to contribute to Michael De-la-Noy's biography, where he is identified only as 'Gerald' in the index.De-la-Noy, Michael (25 June 1998), Obituary: Gerald Leet, \\"The Independent\\"James Methuen-Campbell stated that before his death in 1998, Gerald Leet (who sometimes used his middle name —Mackenzie—as a surname) was more co-operative for his own biography of Welch, published in 2002.). Welch chose to depict himself a few times in fictionalised form, most notably as \\"Orvil Pym\\" in In Youth is Pleasure, and as \\"Mary\\" in \\"The Fire in the Wood\\". \\"Robert\\" was also one of his favourite personas. The philosopher Maurice Cranston, who had known him since his teens (and who featured in at least one story) observed that Welch was as unforgiving in depictions of himself as he was of others.Cranston, Maurice (1951) \\"Denton Welch\\" in The Spectator, 1 June 1951, reprinted in Spectator Harvest (1952), ed. Wilson Harris, London: Hamish Hamilton, p.74 ==Art== The Coffin House by Denton Welch (1946, Private Collection) From an early age Welch's aptitude for art was evident, and in his journals he recalls his first still life (holly and beech leaves), completed when he was nine.Methuen-Campbell, James (2002) Denton Welch: Writer and Artist, Carlton- in-Coverdale: Tartarus Press, , p. 24 However his enrolment at Goldsmith's came initially out of his family's desire that he do something with his life after his return from China, any sort of activity associated with business evidently being ruled out of the question. It was through a fellow student that Welch sold his first artwork: a view of Hadlow Castle to Shell for a series of lorry posters featuring landmarks.Methuen-Campbell (2002) p. 83 It is now on display at the National Motor Museum at Beaulieu, Hampshire. He later failed to sell a painting of Lord Berners to its subject, but the experience generated a short story.Entitled \\"A Morning with the Versatile Peer, Lord Berners, in the ‘Ancient Seat of Learning’\\", it first appeared in Time and Tide magazine, 5th July 1952 Common themes in his art include objets d'art, cats, still lifes (often incongrously juxtaposed) and assorted gothic motifs, often in a fantastical landscape, although not in one of his most famous works, The Coffin House (1946) depicting a locally-renowned dwelling, north of Hadlow, Kent. Welch exhibited his artwork at the Leicester Galleries. Other exhibitions followed, in The Redfern Gallery and the Leger Gallery. In May 1945, Welch restored an 18th-century Georgian doll's house from 1783, which was given to him by his friend, Mildred Bosanquet. The doll's house is on display at the V&A; Museum of Childhood, department of the Victoria and Albert Museum. Opinions on Welch's artworks have varied widely: amongst his biographers, Michael De-la-Noy and James Methuen-Campbell consider him to be underrated; in Robert Phillips' view his paintings are \\"lightweight\\" and his drawings \\"fussy and shallow\\".Phillips, Robert (1974) Denton Welch, New York: Twayne, p. 28 For Jocelyn Brooke, had he been a painter merely, and not also a writer, \\"it is doubtful... whether he would be remembered at all.\\"Brooke, Jocelyn (1964) \\"The Dual Role: A Study of Denton Welch as Painter and Writer\\", The Texas Quarterly, Autumn 1964, University of Texas at Austin, p. 120 In a perceptive review of the reproductions in A Last Sheaf, the un-named Times art critic remarked on the \\"whimsically sinister\\" qualities of Welch's depictions. The writer noted that Welch's specific skill — that of the detached but perceptive observer — which is so evident in his writings, is lost in his art, where he inadvertently (and falsely) appears to present \\"himself [as] clever to like what most people would think preposterous.\\"\\"A Born Writer's Pictures\\", The Times, Thursday September 10, 1953 A painting such as Now I have only my dog, > ... is easy to remember and evidently the work of a man of unusual and > definite character, but for all that it is painfully smart, and leaves > precisely the impression of frivolity that the writings always manage to > avoid. Following the reissue of the Journals, writer Alan Hollinghurst found in Welch's self-portraiture (of which there are several examples; one is in the National Portrait Gallery) a tendency to \\"amplify the over-riding concern of his writing to fix his youth forever while he accelerates towards death.\\"Hollinghurst, Alan (1984) \\"Diminished Pictures\\", Times Literary Supplement, December 21 1984, p. 1479 ==Legacy== The playwright and diarist Alan Bennett stated that he shared many similar preoccupations when he first encountered Welch's work.Bennett, Alan (7 February 2004) \\"Austerity in Colour\\", The Guardian William S. Burroughs cited Welch as the writer who most influenced his own workBurroughs, W. S. (2002), The Cat Inside, Penguin Books, p. 67. and dedicated his 1983 novel The Place of Dead Roads to him. In 1951 the English composer Howard Ferguson set five of Welch's poems (included in A Last Sheaf) as a song-cycle for voice and piano, entitled Discovery.https://www.boosey.com/cr/music/Howard-Ferguson-Discovery/2459 Others who have named Welch as an influence have included the film-maker John Waters,https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/znqbe8/john-waterss-role-models- part-two the artist Barbara Hanrahan,Stewart, Annabelle (2010) Barbara Hanrahan: A Biography, Adelaide: Wakefield Press, , p. 92 and the writers Beryl Bainbridgehttps://thoughtcatalog.com/the-thoughtful- reader/2010/07/beryl-bainbridge/ and Barbara Pym.Tsagaris, Ellen M.

Burroughs' The Place of Dead Roads.In his introduction to the 1985 edition of In Youth is Pleasure, Burroughs says \\"My Kim Carson [sic]... is Denton Welch.\\" Many commentators who wrote about Denton Welch after his death had their views clouded by largely non-aesthetic concerns: by their perception of his sexuality,Phillips (1974) p. 147 or of his treatment of them personally in his writing, or of the \\"hateful winsomeness\\"Bailey, Paul (1984) \\"Sensitive Plant\\", The Guardian, 1984 of his personality. The appropriateness of Welch's alleged solipsism, at a time when the world was in turmoil, appears as a factorO'Brien, Kate (1945) The Spectator Book Review, 2nd March, p. 206 in some reviews; the poet Randall Swingler went so far as to remark on the comparatively commonplace fact of Welch's early death, being, as it was, only one of many at the time.Swingler, Randall (1963) \\"Smooth Diamond\\", in The Times Literary Supplement, No. 3197, June 7, 1963 However, Welch's friends observed that close focus on his sexuality was to miss the point of his writing. Fellow student at Goldsmith's, Helen Roeder, called him 'Ariel'Or rather more completely, \\"Ariel in the Tree Trunk\\", the title of Roeder's introduction to the first edition of I Left My Grandfather's House, published in 1958., and Maurice Cranston highlighted the complexity of Welch's character, at least in part influenced by his health. Simply labelling him > ...'a homosexual' is to use a bright, pat word which will make foolish > people think they have learned the secret of something they have not begun > to understand.Cranston, Maurice (1963) \\"The Courage of Naiveté\\" in The > Listener, May 30, 1963 Cranston also offered what might be considered a more balanced assessmentMethuen-Campbell (2002) p. 85 of Welch's shortcomings and gifts: > He had no trust.

(25 November 1852 – 4 December 1925) was an Australian politician. O'Loghlin was a member of the South Australian Legislative Council from 1888 to 1902, representing the Northern District, and was Chief Secretary under Charles Kingston from 1896 to 1899. He lost his Legislative Council seat in 1902; though he had been a liberal in state politics, he made unsuccessful campaigns for the Australian Senate as an Australian Labor Party candidate at the 1901 federal election and 1906 federal election. He was briefly appointed as a Labor Senator to a casual vacancy in 1907, but it was invalidated following an electoral dispute. He returned to state politics in 1910–1912, winning the South Australian House of Assembly seat of Flinders for Labor, but losing after one term. He was elected to the Senate at his third attempt as a Labor candidate at the 1913 federal election, served overseas in World War I while in office, and remained with the Labor Party during the 1916 Labor split. He left office in 1920 after being defeated at the 1919 federal election, but was re-elected at the 1922 election, resuming his seat from 1923 until his death in 1925. ==Early history== O'Loghlin was born in Gumeracha, South Australia, a son of Susan (ca.1813 – 14 December 1883) and James O'Loghlin (ca.1811 – 5 September 1876), a pioneer farmer, who arrived in South Australia from Ireland in 1840. After being educated at Mr. Besley's Roman Catholic School at Kapunda and the Classical and Commercial Academy (under Mr. J. H. Potter) in the same town, he started farming with his father at Kapunda, Pinkerton, and Blyth, and afterwards at Pekina. He was next employed on the Hill River and Pinkerton stations, and later worked for the South Australian Carrying Company, which had a contract with the railways. He was next put in charge of the Farrell's Flat railway station, at that time a major junction. He was promoted to manager for the company at Gawler, where he remained until the contract system was abolished and the Government took over the whole of the railway goods traffic. O'Loghlin next became a wheat-buyer for the millers W. Duffield and Co. of Gawler; and when that firm was amalgamated with the Adelaide Milling and Mercantile Company he was appointed their agent at Terowie. While there, he and a Mr. Dawson, who had previously been editor of the Burra Record, founded the Terowie Enterprise and North-Eastern Advertiser, and subsequently became sole proprietor. He remained in the newspaper business for three years, and when in 1887 the Adelaide Milling Company moved him to Gladstone, he sold it. ==Politics== Shortly after his move to Gladstone, O'Loghlin was elected to its Town Council. In 1888, he was one of ten who sat for the two Northern District seats of the South Australian Legislative Council. John Darling headed the poll, and he won second seat. He moved to Adelaide and took up the post of editor and manager of The Southern Cross, a South Australian Catholic newspaper. He was a strong supporter of the Irish National League, and their South Australian delegate to the Irish-Australian Convention in Melbourne in November, 1883. He was also a prominent member of the Australian Natives' Association. O'Loghlin's retained a great popularity in the Northern District, and at the end of his term and he stood for re- election in 1892 he was returned at the head of the poll. In March 1896 Kingston appointed him Chief Secretary and Minister of Defence, retaining those posts until 1 December 1899 when their government was defeated. During that period he was the sole Government member in the Legislative Council. He lost his seat at the 1902 elections, after fourteen years of continuous service. In State Parliament O'Loghlin was a member of the Barossa Water Commission, and was also a member of the Royal Commission which enquired into railway communication with the Queensland border. As leader of the Legislative Council he was dignified and tactful, and won the friendship of members, as well as their respect. He was Minister for Defence in the Kingston Government, and in 1899 organised the first two South Australian contingents for service in South Africa in 1899. ===Federal Parliament=== Though a liberal in his first stint in state politics, O'Loghlin unsuccessfully contested the 1901 federal election for the Australian Labor Party. Whilst O'Loghlin was not a candidate at the 1906 federal election, when Anti-Socialist Senator Joseph Vardon's election was declared void, O'Loghlin was appointed by the Parliament of South Australia to the vacancy in the Australian Senate on 11 July 1907. However, on 20 December of the same year, O'Loghlin's appointment was declared void, and he and Vardon contested a special election on 15 February 1908, which was won by Vardon. In between his two stints in federal politics, O'Loghlin had a brief return to state politics, holding Flinders, in the South Australian House of Assembly for one term from 1910 until his defeat in 1912. In 1913 he was again a Labor candidate for the Senate, and was returned at the head of the poll, with John Newland and William Senior, and held his seat for six years. He was defeated in 1919, having been the only one of South Australia's five Labor senators not to defect to the Nationalist Party after the 1916 split over conscription. In 1922 O'Loghlin was elected with McHugh and Hoare, but died in 1925; the South Australian Nationalist Government successfully installed Nationalist Henry Barwell to his vacant seat. Soon after the war broke out in 1914, though well past the fighting age, he had volunteered for overseas service, and in 1915 was sent as an officer commanding reinforcements for the First AIF to Egypt, Gallipoli, and France. On his return to Australia he was appointed a member of the Federal Parliamentary Recruiting Committee. He died at his residence, \\"Glenvolo\\", Hawthorn, of tuberculosis,Peter Travers, 'O'Loghlin, James Vincent (1852–1925)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published in hardcopy 1988, accessed online 4 October 2014 after a long period of ill-health. He left a widow, three sons, who were attending Christian Brothers' College, and one daughter, who was a pupil at the Convent of Mercy school in Angas Street, Adelaide. ==Family== He married Blanche Besley ( – 23 April 1929), daughter of John Besley (ca.1832 – 3 July 1916) of Mount Gambier, his erstwhile schoolmaster, on 23 January 1907. Their children were: *son born 28 March 1908 *daughter born 12 December 1909 *son born 7 May 1912 *son born 19 October 1918 ==A tribute== :\\" He did good work for the State and the party he represented. ... He was not an orator in the ordinary acceptation of the term, but he had the gift of clear and lucid expression, and his utterances were always sincere, well thought out, and effective. As a Minister of the Crown in the Kingston Government he was a very active, loyal, and kindly colleague, and could always be relied upon for a just, if careful, decision As Chief Secretary he was alert and capable, and his record as a democratic legislator was of a high order. Senator O'Loghlin was also a capable journalist, and founded and edited with success the \\"Southern Cross\\". He had a racy pen, a fund of knowledge, and an excellent memory, all of which stood him in good stead in his writings.\\" ==Notes References == Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Australian Senate for South Australia Category:Members of the Australian Senate Category:Members of the South Australian Legislative Council Category:Members of the South Australian House of Assembly Category:Australian journalists Category:Australian newspaper proprietors Category:1852 births Category:1925 deaths Category:People from Gumeracha, South Australia Category:20th-century Australian politicians ","title":"James O'Loghlin (politician)"},{"id":"20348279","text":"Podaxis is a genus of secotioid fungi in the family Agaricaceae. Species, which have the appearance of a \\"stalked-puffball\\", have a worldwide distribution, and tend to be found growing solitary or scattered on sandy soils, especially in arid regions. Although close to 50 species have been described, it has been argued that many of them may represent extremes in the natural range of variations found in Podaxis pistillaris. ==Description== Fruiting bodies have the appearance of an unopened Coprinus comatus, with a stipe and a loose, brown to blackish powdery gleba at maturity. Basidiospores are obovate, thick-walled with a large apical pore, and typically 10-17 x 9-12 µm in size. Clamp connections are present. Podaxis is a common inhabitant of soil and termite mounds throughout the drier regions of the tropics and subtropics of the world.http://cms.jcu.edu.au/discovernature/fungi/JCUDEV_017269 P. pistillaris is a ground-inhabiting species, but most Podaxis species in the rest of the world are associated with termite mounds. This includes the Australian species P. beringamensis. ==Taxonomy== The genus was originally named Podaxis and circumscribed by Nicaise Auguste Desvaux in 1809, while Elias Magnus Fries later (1829) called the taxon Podaxon. Although a number of articles have used the latter name, Podaxis is the preferred name as it has nomenclatorial priority due to its earlier publication. Early suggestions that Podaxis was related to the genus Coprinus were later confirmed using phylogenetic analysis based on sequence data of rDNA genes. This research showed that Podaxis is in a clade with the species Montagnea arenaria and Agaricus pocillator, and the genus Leucocoprinus. For this reason, Podaxis was transferred to the family Agaricaceae (order Agaricales) from the now obsolete family name Podaxaceae (order Podaxales). A section of Podaxis, named Parvispora, was circumscribed to accommodate three species (P. argentinus, P. longii and P. microsporus) with small spores. ==Species== , Index Fungorum accepts 28 species in Podaxis: *Podaxis africana De Villiers, Eicker & Van der Westh. 1989 – Africa *Podaxis algericus Pat. 1904 *Podaxis anomalus Lloyd 1920 *Podaxis argentinus Speg. 1898 *Podaxis axatus (Bosc) Massee 1890 *Podaxis beringamensis Priest & M.Lenz 1999 – Australia *Podaxis carcinomalis (L.f.)

(established 1805) was a London-based wine and spirits company. They specialised in distillation of gin, and their most famous product was Seagers Gin. ==19th century== The company was founded in 1805 as a partnership between James Lys Seager and William Evans. Both were young men, in their twenties, when the company was formed. Their first distillery was Millbank Distillery sited near the banks of the Thames in London, where it remained for over a century. On 28 February 1832 Seager and Evans were elected as members of the Rectifier's Club. Other contemporary members of the club included well known names in the gin industry such as Booth, Gordon, Tanqueray, Nicholson and Burnett. The original partnership ended with death of William Evans in 1856. Sir Frederick Seager Hunt, grandson of James Lys Seager, began to take an active role in the business, and eventually became sole proprietor on the death of his grandfather in 1873. Sir Frederick continued as head of the company on until 1898 when the business was sold to a public company formed for that purpose. From then on the company was Seager Evans and Company Limited. ==20th century== In 1922 the distillery was moved to Deptford, and there followed thereafter a period of expansion for Seager Evans. They branched out into whisky, establishing Strathclyde Grain distillery in 1927, and founding a subsidiary, Long John International Ltd, in the same year to operate their new whisky business. They also expanded into international markets, opening a gin distillery in Chile in 1929, and another in Brazil in 1934. The company was acquired by Schenley Industries of New York in 1956, and under new ownership the company's efforts were focused more strongly on the whisky market, with a number of investments in that sector, including the purchasing of Laphroaig in 1962. The end of the name Seager Evans and Co. came in 1970 when the company was renamed Long John International Ltd. ==References== * Mr. Seager & Mr. Evans, the story of a great partnership (London, 1963, ASIN: B0017XFA68) * An Economic History of London, 1800-1914, By Michael Ball, David Sunderland, Published by Routledge, 2001 (, ) * National Archives Records for Seager Evans and Co.

In 1896, he was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly for Yorke Peninsula, transferring to Wallaroo in 1902. He left the Assembly in 1905. In 1912, he was appointed to the Australian Senate as a Liberal Senator for South Australia, filling the casual vacancy caused by the death of Labor Senator William Russell. This was the first time a state government had successfully replaced a Senator with a Senator of a different party, after Labor's failed attempt in 1907 to appoint James O'Loghlin to succeed Joseph Vardon. Defeated in 1913, he was elected in 1914 with over 95% of the vote due to the death of Labor Senator Gregor McGregor, which left the Labor Party with only five nominees.

The term \\"bid\\" can be used loosely in electricity markets to refer to an offer to buy or to sell. And the term \\"virtual\\" is used to refer to the fact that, while these trades occur in a physical market, virtual trades never entail taking a physical position—because every sell (or buy) Day Ahead will be closed by a buy (or sell) in Real Time. The ISO maintains a trade execution system that ensures all virtual positions will be closed before delivery time. A virtual bidding platform gives financial entities a way to participate in these physical markets, with no physical assets or presence on the grid. They can attempt to capitalize on regular divergences between these markets of different time period for the same underlying (perhaps using time, absolute price levels, or other external variables as conditioning factors). If this strategy of trading one time period against another without the intent (or perhaps even the ability) to deliver or receive physical power is implemented outside of a transaction system that identifies virtual bids and ensures they will be closed, it may be referred to as \\"implicit\\" virtual bidding. Virtual positions are included in the same simultaneous feasibility tests and price determination processes as real positions. Thus they can serve to reduce inefficiencies in the market. Virtual bidding is a form of speculation not dissimilar to futures trading in the other commodity markets. Virtual bidding is the buying and selling of electricity without ever physically producing or consuming it. Instead all trades are offset in a subsequent market thus preventing physical delivery. There are a number of differences between virtual bidding and traditional commodity markets. Prominent amongst these are that virtual bidding occurs in electricity markets that are discrete, whereas most commodity markets allow for continuous trading. In addition virtual bidding usually occurs for very short time horizons, usually between the day-ahead market and the real-time market. There is no reason why it should not occur in different electricity markets. For example, buying and selling monthly contracts for a common delivery point such as the California-Oregon Border (COB) without ever taking physical delivery is extremely similar to virtual trading, although in this latter case the product is not explicitly identified as a virtual product. Identifying virtual trades explicitly occurs in all the organized Independent System Operator-type markets and confers the benefit of not co-mingling truly physical bids with financial bids. This clear delineation prevents the financial act of speculation from unduly affecting the reliability of the electric system. Virtual bidding is implemented for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the fact that in its absence there is a tendency for implicit virtual bidding to occur, and the presence of this practice tends to create difficulties for grid operators. There are many benefits of virtual bidding besides the fact that its presence creates an appropriate avenue for arbitrage and in essence assists reliability. The most commonly identified benefits are as follows: ==Market power mitigation== Often generators reside in load pockets where physical competition is constrained due to insufficient transmission. Virtual bidding allows virtual traders to compete to supply power within the constrained area. For this benefit to exist the type of virtual bidding must allow bid submission at the nodal level or at the constrained area level. ==Mitigation of the monopsony power of load== Load is often large enough to influence the market outcome by varying the quantity they bid into the DA market. Virtual bidding mitigates this power by allowing other market participants to simply bid in the load that was under-scheduled. ==Mitigation of supplier market power== The mitigation of supplier (generators) market power is commonly accepted but less well documented. For suppliers to exercise market power they would need to withhold generation in the Day-Ahead market (DAM). This is more difficult in the presence of virtual bidding as virtual traders can submit virtual supply to compete away this withholding practice. ==Market efficiency improvements== The improvements to market efficiency emerge as the prices in the DA and RT markets tend to converge. This makes pricing less volatile and this decrease, albeit small, is the benefit. Prices will not converge completely as there will still be stochastic differences that were not foreseen between DA and RT, but the narrowing of the price spread leads to greater predictability. ==Risks of virtual bidding== The purported benefits of virtual bidding have resulted in it spreading to new ISOs over time. There remain some risks though. The principal risk is that virtual trades will be used to leverage positions in other markets, such as the Financial Transmission Rights market. To prevent this some markets have implemented specific rules to prevent this sort of gaming.See ISO New England PII M-28 Market Rule 1 Accounting (Revision ASM Phase II) 06-02-06, (June 5, 2006) at 6.3.2 Adjustments to FTR Target Allocations Available at http://www.iso- ne.com/rules_proceds/isone_mnls/index.html ==Mechanics of virtual bidding== The ability to insert virtual bids is usually controlled by the host market, and requires specific registration due to the differing characteristics between virtual bids and physical bids. The submission method is generally similar across Independent System Operators.

The facility was original built in 1963 as a juvenile facility housing both boys and girls. In 1978 it was remodeled to become a medium security (Custody Level 3) facility for adult male inmates. The original juvenile cottages formed the basis of a \\"campus style\\" prison with more than a dozen one or two-story buildings now stretched out across the property, fenced in by a high security double fence topped with razor wire. Buildings range from three of the five original cottages to a new state of the art \\"K\\" shaped building that can house 400 offenders. Also on campus is a school and library for offenders working toward a GED or in the adult basic education program. Health Services, a gymnasium, administration, physical plant, chow hall/kitchen, and other housing/treatment units make up the remainder of the buildings. The prison has no prison industry. Many of the approximately 1,300 inmates are in one of three main types of treatment programs. Sex offender, chemical dependency, and the faith based InnerChange Freedom Initiative are the three main programs. In addition, Lino Lakes is the intake facility for most of the state's release violators returning to prison after violating the conditions of their original release. Many will serve for an additional 30–365 days as a consequence for violating. There is also a small unit that houses and provides therapy for \\"special needs\\" offenders who are cognitively disabled and/or significantly mentally ill. There are also some offenders who are not release violators or involved in treatment/therapy. These offenders mostly work full-time in support jobs such as cooks, janitors (swampers), maintenance, grounds crew, etc. The Sex Offender Treatment Program (SOTP) treats and houses 200 of the state's most serious sex offenders. The program takes 2 or more years to complete and includes a yearlong chemical dependency treatment program for sex offenders with chemical dependency issues. The Triad unit houses and provides chemical dependency treatment to 293 offenders. Triad offers a \\"therapeutic community\\" approach to treatment. Triad is also home to the \\"Special Needs\\" program. The InnerChange Freedom Initiative (IFI) is run and staffed by Prison Fellowship, an organization started by former Nixon chief counsel Chuck Colson. While ostensibly open to members of all faiths, it is a Christ centric approach to reentry/rehabilitation for felony offenders. ==References *Minnesota Correctional Facility – Lino Lakes Lino Lakes Category:Buildings and structures in Anoka County, Minnesota Category:1963 establishments in Minnesota ","title":"Minnesota Correctional Facility – Lino Lakes"},{"id":"20348507","text":"Hans-Hubert Schönzeler (22 June 192530 April 1997) was a German-born Australian-naturalised English-resident composer, conductor and musicologist who became an authority on Anton Bruckner and Antonín Dvořák. He was born in Leipzig, an only child, and studied the violin from the age of five. Although his family was not Jewish, he was sent to Brussels so as to avoid contact with the Hitler Youth. In 1939 his family emigrated to Australia where, on the outbreak of the Second World War, his father was interned as an enemy alien. Hans-Hubert went to Sydney Boys High School, but in 1941 he and his mother were also interned for the duration of the war. During these years he continued to study music. He also studied conducting with a former director of the Vienna Boys' Choir. He was released in 1946 and was naturalised as an Australian in 1947. He attended the New South Wales State Conservatorium, where he studied with Eugene Goossens. With assistance from Rafael Kubelík, Schönzeler settled in London in 1950, and went to work for Eulenburg Editions. He was later a director of the company. He conducted the 20th-Century Ensemble in London from 1951 to 1962. He studied at the Paris Conservatoire and the Accademia Musicale Chigiana in Siena, and worked as a freelance conductor in many countries as well as the UK. He conducted the concert at the Royal Albert Hall in 1964 marking the 10th anniversary of the death of Wilhelm Furtwängler, whose biography he later wrote. In 1967 he commenced a long association with the West Australian Symphony Orchestra. Schönzeler became a noted expert on Bruckner: in 1970 he wrote a book on the composer; in 1973 he conducted the world premiere of the first version of the Eighth Symphony; at the 1978 Adelaide Festival he conducted the world premiere of the authentic first version of the Third Symphony. He was honoured by the International Bruckner Society, Vienna, the Bruckner Society of America and he also won the Bruckner Medal of Honor. He was also a keen performer of the works of Dvořák; as well as writing a biography, he appeared at the Prague Spring Festival in 1974 and was made an honorary member of the Antonín Dvořák Society in 1975.

The fall of the Hatry group in September 1929 is cited as a contributing factor to the Wall Street Crash of 1929.John Stepak, \\"Did one man trigger the Great Depression?\\", Money Week, 17 November 2017. Retrieved 21 May 2019. Economist John Kenneth Galbraith described Hatry as \\"one of those curiously un-English figures with whom the English periodically find themselves unable to cope.\\"Galbraith, J.K. (2009) The Great Crash of 1929 p.91. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. . Retrieved August 2011 ==Rise in business== Hatry began his professional career as an insurance clerk in London's West End. Shrewd fellow-promoters remember that \\"Clarence\\" made his first killing in silk. He then recouped the ensuing bankruptcy in insurance, through City Equitable, a modest reinsurance business. It was bought from German and Austrian owners in 1914 for £60,000; Hatry reorganised it in six months and sold a controlling interest for £250,000 to Gerard Lee Bevan and an associate called Peter Haig Thomas. Hatry found the First World War a chance to profiteer, and by 1921, he was the respected director of 15 corporations. He had already come to the attention of the American public for a different reason: transporting Eastern European immigrants to the United States and Canada. In 1924, his Commercial Corporation of London failed for $3.75 million. In some manner, three successive bankruptcies had left him successively richer. He built a new business empire, with investments in photographic supplies, cameras, vending machines and loan offices. In early 1929 investors flocked to the Hatry group: General Securities Ltd. (of which Henry Paulet, 16th Marquess of Winchester, was chairman); Austin Friars Trust, Ltd., Dundee Trust, Oak Investment Corp., Associated Automatic Machines Corp., Retail Trade Corp., Photomaton Parent Corp. and Far Eastern Photomaton Corp. Photomaton Parent Corporation Limited was set up by Clarence Hatry in 1928 to operate photograph machines in hundreds of public places such as railway stations and amusement parks. By 1929, he had returned to the top table of corporate finance, and had worked out his greatest project, a merger of steel and iron concerns into the $40 million United Steel Companies. Just as this deal was to be consummated, the Stock Exchange Committee caught him borrowing $1 million on worthless paper. On 20 September 1929, the fraud became known, and the Hatry empire collapsed. ==Personal life== Hatry was not shy in displaying his wealth: his office suite had ornate bathrooms, he had swimming pools in his Mayfair homes, a yacht and a racing stable. Hatry owned the Westward, once the largest yacht in British waters, between 1919 and 1924. He was known to dive from her bowsprit. He was a keen swimmer and remarked that \\"swimming is the only sport that I, personally, enjoy.\\" Between 1922 and 1926 Hatry lived at 56 Upper Brook Street, previously occupied by David Ricardo, economist, between 1812 and 1823. Number 56 was built on what was originally an independent plot some forty-one feet in frontage and thirty-three in depth, with a narrow passage at the back from Blackburne's Mews. It was well known as the only house with a rooftop swimming pool in London, where he held bathing- suit parties. Between 1924 and 1929 Hatry lived at 5 Great Stanhope Street in Mayfair, near the mansion of the daughter of King George V; Mary, the Princess Royal. During his four years there, Hatry spent £70,000 on the house. His improvements were of questionable but indisputably exuberant, taste, as a contemporary newspaper report recorded: \\"He installed – among other luxurious things – a swimming bath on the principal bedroom floor, and a stone-floored Tudor-style cocktail bar in the sub-basement.\\" He called the bar \\"Ye Old Stanhope Arms-Free House\\". Until his imprisonment, Hatry swam in the pool every morning, throughout the year. Despite this, he was described as a \\"sallow, baldish, unhealthy-looking little man.\\" ==Crash== Hatry asserted that in late August 1929 he had made a secret visit to the Bank of England to appeal to Montagu Norman for financing to allow him to complete a merger with United Steel Companies, a UK firm. Norman had adamantly refused Hatry's bid for a bridge loan. By 17 September, when Hatry stock began to fall on the London exchange, Hatry had liabilities of £19 million and assets of £4 million. On 19 September, after Hatry had approached Lloyds Bank in a last desperate bid for financing, he asked Sir Gilbert Garnsey, a chartered accountant, to intervene on his behalf. However, Hatry did not tell Garnsey that he had been issuing stocks to try to cover the deal, and some of the stocks were fraudulent: the same certificates had been printed twice and given as security to different leading banks. Hatry had obtained a $1 million loan on forged bearer scrip certificates of City of Wakefield 4½% stock, and an alert clerk had spotted the discrepancy. Garnsey made a second approach to Norman for emergency financing, and was again rebuffed. By this point Norman had informed the chairman of the London Stock Exchange that the Hatry group was bankrupt. In the conversation, it was agreed that trading in Hatry shares would be suspended on 20 September. On 20 September 1929 the London Stock Exchange committee immediately suspended all shares of the Hatry group, which had been worth about £24 million. On that day, Hatry and his leading associates confessed to fraud and forgery in the office of Sir Archibald Bodkin, the Director of Public Prosecutions and, after lunching at the Charing Cross Hotel, were jailed. The Wall Street Crash began late the following month. ==Trial and conviction== In late December 1929, Hatry, along with Albert Edward Tabor, Edmund Daniels and Charles Graham Dixon, were tried at the Old Bailey, charged with forgery and fraud. Hatry's friends subscribed $95,000 to pay for his defence. Hatry, his voice shaking with emotion, said in his defence: Hatry was sentenced to 14 years in prison (two of them at hard labour) and sent to Brixton Prison. The first two weeks of his sentence he had to sleep on bare boards, and for 28 days, he had to crush rocks on the stonepile. Then, he was given the slightly less difficult task of making mail bags. He also served a stint as prison librarian. Hatry was released after serving nine years of his sentence thanks to the support of his lawyer Norman Birkett, K. C. Birkett's role in the Hatry trial is related in H. Montgomery Hyde's book, Norman Birkett (London, 1964). ==Comeback== After Hatry's release from prison in 1939, he bought Hatchards bookshop for £6,000 and \\"proceeded to turn around the ailing business\\". In 1946 he acquired the T. Werner Laurie Ltd. publishing firm where he appointed George Greenfield as the manager.George Greenfield, A Smattering of Monsters: A Kind of Memoir, Camden House, 1995.Chris Swinson, Share Trading, Fraud and the Crash of 1929: A Biography of Clarence Hatry, Routledge, 2019.

It grows to 15 cm high and has a hard, woody stem. The large cap, which protects the blackish spore-bearing tissue, splits, and usually falls away at maturity, allowing the spores to be dispersed by wind. Large numbers may appear after soaking rains. It thrives in deserts and semi-deserts of Australia and other countries, often found on termite mounds in South Africa. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240509762_The_Genus_Podaxis_Gasteromycetes_in_Australia_with_a_Description_of_a_New_Species_from_Termite_Mounds In the Hawaiian Islands, it is frequently encountered along roadsides and in disturbed areas on the dry sides of the islands, especially in the Kona area of Hawaii and the Kihei area of Maui. Older synonyms for this species include Lycoperdon pistillare L. (1771) and Scleroderma pistillare (L.) Pers. (1801). ==Spores== The spores are usually 10–14 (–16) by (8–) 9–12 µm broadly oval to sub-globose, smooth yellow to deep reddish-brown with a double wall, truncate base, and apical pore. Older spore measurements have varied considerably. Species from Australian collections appear to be more subglobose than those seen from the United States, raising the possibility that the latter are not the same species. ==Organisation== It is an agaric, though it has lost hymenophoral organization and the ability to forcibly discharge its basidiospores and become \\"secotioid\\". Although considered by many to be a \\"stalked puffball\\", Podaxis pistillaris is more closely allied with the shaggy mane (Coprinus comatus) than with puffballs.Hopple JS, Vilgalys R. (1994). Phylogenetic relationships among coprinoid taxa and allies based on data from restriction site mapping of nuclear rDNA. Mycologia 86(1): 96-107. ==Uses== In Australia, it was used by many desert tribes to darken the white hair in old men's whiskers and for body painting. The fungus was presumably used by many desert Aborigines due to its distribution around drier areas of Australia. There are reports of its also being used as a fly repellent. Apart from the more common, ground-inhabiting Podaxis pistillaris, there is one other Podaxis species in Australia - Podaxis beringamensis, found on termite mounds and presumably both species were used.Arpad Kalotas in Fungi of Australia, Volume 1B. http://www.anbg.gov.au/fungi/aboriginal.html Podaxis pistillaris is also used as food in Middle East and Mexico. ==References== Category:Agaricaceae Category:Secotioid fungi Category:Fungi of Australia Category:Fungi of Oceania ","title":"Podaxis pistillaris"},{"id":"20348564","text":"Halina Szwarc de domo Kłąb (1923–2002) - was a member of the Polish resistance during the Second World War, working undercover first under the pseudonym Ryszard, then Jacek II. Postwar, she became a professor of medicine in gerontology, and in 1970/1971, the prorector of the Józef Piłsudski University of Physical Education in Warsaw. After the outbreak of war, at the age of 16, she joined the Związek Walki Zbronej (ZWZ), the resistance organization that eventually became the Polish Home Army. Under order, she signed the Volksliste, basing her claim to Volksdeutsche status on a German grandmother. She was allowed to finish her schooling in a German language school and in 1940, travelled west into the heart of the Third Reich, ostensibly to further her education. She would, in fact, be spying for the ZWZ. She conducted operations in Vienna, Berlin, Munich, and other major German cities. Szwarc’s greatest contribution to the war effect was her surveying of military installations in Hamburg, making possible their destruction by Allied bombers. Later, she took a job in the Berlin Archive of Army Medicine, where she was able to collect invaluable information concerning German troop positions on the Eastern Front. In 1944, following her return to her home town of Łodź, she was arrested by the Gestapo. She was tortured and condemned to death by firing squad, but the sentence was not carried out. After the war, she finished her medical studies and began to work in the clinic of the Poznan University of Medical Sciences. Like other members of the Home Army, Szwarc was viewed as a possible traitor by the new Communist regime. Despite continual persecution by the security service and other forms of repression in Stalinist Poland, she managed to advance her academic career. In 2000, she was honored with the Order of Polonia Restituta for her achievements in the medical field. ==Publications== *Rekreacja i turystyka ludzi w starszym wieku - Halina Szwarc, Teresa Wolańska, Tadeusz Łobożewicz, Instytut Wydawniczy Związków Zawodowych, Warszawa 1988, *Rekreacja ruchowa osób starszych : praca zbiorowa / pod red.

Born in Cawdor, Nairnshire, Newlands was the son of Andrew Newlands, agricultural labourer, and his wife Ann, née Stunar. Newlands was educated in Croy, Scotland before migrating to New South Wales, Australia in 1883. He married Theresa Glassey on 27 February 1884 in Adelaide, and that year began to use Newland as his surname. He became a railway worker, also in 1884, initially as a lamp cleaner and porter. While a conductor on the Broken Hill express, he and a fellow-conductor developed a gambling system that so impressed a group of mining magnates that they bankrolled a trip for the two to Monte Carlo. Fortune eluded them however, and they returned to Adelaide with a new respect for mathematics. He was elected chairman of the District Council of Terowie, when after 13 years he was obliged to resign from the railways. He helped found in 1908 the Railway Officers' Association, a trade union of which he was appointed general secretary, a position he held until his resignation in 1913. In November 1906 Newland was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly as the Labor member for Burra Burra. In February 1912 he lost his marginal seat in the 1912 state election, but was elected to the Australian Senate in the 1913 federal election as a Labor Senator for South Australia. He left the Labor Party in the 1916 split over conscription, joining the Nationalist Party. He served as Chairman of Committees from 1923 to 1926. On 1 July 1926, he was appointed President of the Senate, succeeding Thomas Givens. He held the presidency until 13 August 1929, when he was succeeded by Walter Kingsmill. He was knighted in 1927, and reverted his name to Newlands. He had several periods of convalescence due to ill health and died in 1932 in Glenelg, Adelaide, South Australia, while his term was still unexpired.

The New York location is run by online retailer Fanatics, who also runs the League's online store at NBAStore.com. The NBA Store sells over 35,000 pieces of NBA merchandise and features several attractions; it is often visited by players, celebrities, and political leaders. It also serves as a headquarters for the NBA where the association hosts charity events. Since opening its first store in 1998, the NBA has seen increasing business opportunities in foreign markets mainly due to the influx of new international players. The biggest growth has been in China, where players Yao Ming and Yi Jianlian, combined with the interest generated by the 2008 Summer Olympics, created enough demand to open two new stores. The NBA has also expanded into games like Second Life where it created a virtual NBA Store in 2007. The original Fifth Avenue store closed on February 13, 2011. The league temporarily relocated the store in a smaller space at 590 Fifth Avenue until August 2015.

On January 14, 2008, the NBA announced the formation of NBA China (\\"a joint venture of the NBA, broadcaster ESPN and Chinese companies\\"), \\"that will conduct all of the league's businesses in Greater China\\", the new entity will be led by Tim Chen (former CEO of Microsoft Greater China). In preparation for the 2008 Summer Olympics in China, the NBA opened a flagship store in Beijing; the JuneYao Group was chosen to lead marketing operations for the retail chain- store. The NBA currently has two stores in China (both in Beijing) and according to CEO Chen plans to expand \\"up to 1,000 in the next five years.\\" The first store was opened on July 15, 2008; it has \\"300 square meters of retail space\\" and sells about 400 different items; about 1,000 people showed up for the opening. According to the International Herald Tribune, merchandise sales in China were expected to increase by 60 percent in 2008. About one third of the traffic received at nba.com comes from their Chinese area (china.nba.com) written in Mandarin built by the Plus Factory, a New York City firm with offices in Beijing. Reports on NBA jersey sales over the last three years (2006-2009) reveal that Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers is the most sold jersey in China; however, Yao Ming fell from 6th to 10th and then back to 6th while his Houston Rockets teammate Tracy McGrady remained ranked third for two straight seasons then fell to fourth in 2009. {  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" width=\\"95%\\" - +Jersey sales in China (2006–2009) - !

The MMORPG Second Life, an Internet-based virtual game world, offers its members the option of playing or shopping at a digital replica of the NBA Store. The 3-D virtual replica was launched on May 1, 2007, during the NBA Finals between the San Antonio Spurs and the Cleveland Cavaliers as a way of reaching the global audience and expanding the NBA's business in the virtual world. The virtual NBA Store is part of the NBA's virtual headquarters; other facilities include a T-Mobile arena where player's avatars can take pictures or watch Finals footage on a JumboTron. At the time of its launch, the NBA was the \\"first professional sports league to unveil a comprehensive headquarters in a virtual world.\\" The virtual store's entrance is modeled after the New York City location, featuring the same double revolving doors and gold NBA lettering. In 2004, the NBA Live series for home video game consoles introduced an EA NBA Store feature, where players can purchase digital shoes and jerseys with points earned through the completion of in-game tasks. ==References * NBA.com/NYCstore, – Official Site at NBA.com, offers a virtual tour of the New York Store. * China.NBA.com/nbastore – Site of the NBA's Chinese Store (in Mandarin) Category:National Basketball Association Category:Retailing in New York City Category:American companies established in 1998 Category:Retail companies established in 1998 Category:Sporting goods retailers of the Philippines ","title":"NBA Store"},{"id":"20348706","text":"North Forest Ninth Grade Center North Forest High School (NFHS) is a secondary school located in Houston, Texas, United States.

He was then a member of the Australian Senate from 1913 to 1922; he was first elected as a Labor Senator but left the party in the 1916 Labor split over conscription and thereafter represented the Nationalist Party. Senior was born in Holmfirth in Yorkshire, England. His family migrated to South Australia when he was five years old, settling in Willunga before relocating to Mount Gambier in 1858. He was a storekeeper's assistant before entering the Primitive Methodist ministry and serving as minister from 1873 until 1883, with circuits at Moonta Mines, Two Wells, Woodside, Kapunda and Naracoorte. In 1883 he left the ministry and worked as a storekeeper at Mount Gambier, although he remained a lay Methodist preacher for the rest of his life. He was described as a Past Grand of the Independent Order of Oddfellows and was a founder of their Orroroo lodge in 1880. Later, at Mount Gambier, he was involved in local debating societies in Mount Gambier and was president of the Democratic Society there. In 1902, he moved to Coonawarra, where he became a fruitgrower. He won a 1904 by-election for the South Australian House of Assembly seat of Victoria and Albert following the death of Andrew Dods Handyside. He held the seat until his defeat at the 1912 state election. In 1913, he was elected to the Australian Senate as an Australian Labor Party Senator for South Australia.

A field goal, also called a flying kick or speculator, was a way of scoring in the game of rugby football. It consisted of a player kicking the ball from the ground (not on a kicking tee) without using their hands in open play over the crossbar. This method of scoring was abolished in rugby union in 1905 and in rugby league in 1950. == Rugby union == During the development of rugby football, the field goal was considered a legitimate way of scoring. In 1845, place kicks were the only way to score a goal. In 1871, it was clarified under Law 6 that kicking the ball through the posts from the ground in open play was a valid method of scoring a goal. A rejected proposal in 1882 by the Rugby Football Union suggested that field goals, referred to as a \\"flying kick\\", would be worth 4 points, the same value as a try. It was eventually formalised in 1891 by the International Rugby Football Board that field goals (classed as any other goals) would be worth 4 points. However, in 1905 both the IRFB and Rugby Football Union (RFU) abolished the field goal as a valid method of scoring. == Rugby league == When the Northern Rugby Football Union broke away from the RFU, both codes' governing bodies retained the field goal. While the RFU abolished the field goal in rugby union in 1905, rugby league retained it. However, there was criticism about it on the 190809 Australia rugby league tour of Britain, whereby the Australia national rugby league team player Dally Messenger continuously and recklessly attempted field goals during a match against the England national rugby league team. A writer for the Daily Chronicle stated: \\"I do not believe in the speculator at any time, it is bad rugby football\\", and expressed concern that Dally would either injure himself or others. As predicted, during a later match against St. Helens, he damaged the cartilage in his knee due to repeated attempts at the scoring move. In 1922, the New South Wales Rugby Football League abolished the field goal along with the goal from mark. However the Northern Rugby Football League, considered the guardian of the rules of rugby league at the time, kept the method in the rulebook, not officially abolishing it until 1950. In Australia, the term field goal is used as a synonym for drop goal. ==See also References == Category:History of rugby union Category:History of rugby league Category:Rugby union terminology Category:Rugby league terminology ","title":"Field goal (rugby)"},{"id":"20348803","text":"Emergency aircraft evacuation refers to emergency evacuation from an aircraft which may take place on the ground, in water, or mid-flight.

It was written in 1834, late in the writer's life. ==Synopsis== Helen tells the story of a young orphan, Helen Stanley, whose guardian, Dean Stanley, has squandered his fortune and left Helen without means of support. She is forced to take up residence with the local vicar, whose wife is astonished that none of the Stanleys' aristocratic friends have offered a refuge to her. Eventually, however, the Davenant family returns from abroad and invite Helen to their daughter's new home, Clarendon Park. (Cecilia Davenant has just married General Clarendon.) Helen journeys to join her dear friend Cecilia (a charming socialite), and the first half of the novel describes Helen's experiences among the most fortunate of Britain's elite under the tutelage of Lady Davenant, who in some ways favors Helen over her own daughter Cecilia. In the second and more dramatic half of the novel, Lady Davenant departs with her husband, who has been named ambassador at the Court of St. Petersburg, Russia. Helen is left to the care of General Clarendon and Cecilia. By this time she is engaged to Granville Beauclerc, a young and handsome man who is another of Lady Davenant's favorites. All does not run smoothly for Helen, however. Before her marriage, Cecilia has carried on an amorous correspondence with Colonel d'Aubigny, a worthless roué who has since died. These letters reappear in a packet addressed to Cecilia's husband. Cecilia implores Helen to act as if the letters were addressed to her rather than to Cecilia. Helen, from misguided devotion to her friend and gratitude for Cecilia's kind hospitality, agrees to the deception. This first step leads to more and more serious consequences, until finally Helen's reputation is in tatters. Beauclerc is forced to fight a duel in defense of his fiancée, after which he must flee from England. Cecilia still refuses to recognize the letters as hers, out of fear of losing her own husband if she admits to the correspondence. The General is convinced that Helen is faithless. She refuses to stay where she is not respected and chooses exile in Wales with the General's sister, where she becomes dangerously ill. Even the birth of Cecilia's first child, a son, does not encourage her to confess to her husband, and Helen gives up all hope of exoneration. The dénouement comes when Lady Davenant, also dangerously ill, returns to London at the same time as the General finally discovers his wife's deception and vows to separate from Cecilia for life. Helen's character is redeemed, Beauclerc returns to England when his adversary recovers from his wounds, and the novel ends happily for all the protagonists with Lady Davenant saying that she is \\"now, and not till now, happy--perfectly happy in Love and Truth!\\" ==Criticism== Here is what one biographer of Maria Edgeworth has to say about Helen.Maria Edgeworth by the Hon. Emily Lawless (1845-1913).

The term also refers to issues related to the treatment of affected family members by the governments involved in these conflicts. Following the Paris Peace Accords of 1973, 591 U.S. prisoners of war (POWs) were returned during Operation Homecoming. The U.S. listed about 2,500 Americans as prisoners of war or missing in action but only 1,200 Americans were reported to have been killed in action with no body recovered. Many of these were airmen who were shot down over North Vietnam or Laos. Investigations of these incidents have involved determining whether the men involved survived being shot down. If they did not survive, then the U.S. government considered efforts to recover their remains. POW/MIA activists played a role in pushing the U.S. government to improve its efforts in resolving the fates of these missing service members. Progress in doing so was slow until the mid-1980s when relations between the U.S. and Vietnam began to improve and more cooperative efforts were undertaken. Normalization of the U.S. relations with Vietnam in the mid-1990s was a culmination of this process. Considerable speculation and investigation have been devoted to a hypothesis that a significant number of missing U.S. service members from the Vietnam War were captured as prisoners of war by Communist forces and kept as live prisoners after U.S. involvement in the war concluded in 1973. A vocal group of POW/MIA activists maintains that there has been a concerted conspiracy by the Vietnamese and U.S. governments since then to hide the existence of these prisoners. The U.S. government has steadfastly denied that prisoners were left behind or that any effort has been made to cover up their existence. Popular culture has reflected the \\"live prisoners\\" theory, most notably in the 1985 film Rambo: First Blood Part II. Several congressional investigations have looked into the issue, culminating with the largest and most thorough, the United States Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs of 1991–1993 led by Senators John Kerry, Bob Smith, and John McCain. It found \\"no compelling evidence that proves that any American remains alive in captivity in Southeast Asia.\\" The fate of those missing in action has always been one of the most troubling and unsettling consequences of any war. In this case, the issue has been a highly emotional one to those involved, and is often considered the last depressing, divisive aftereffect of the Vietnam War for the United States. ==Origins== The origins of the POW/MIA issue date back to during the war itself. Suffering from a lack of accurate intelligence sources inside North Vietnam, the U.S. never had solid knowledge for how many U.S. prisoners of war were held. pp. 32–33. Indeed, the U.S. often relied upon possibly inaccurate North Vietnamese newspapers and radio broadcasts to find out who had been captured, as well as memorized lists of names brought out by the few U.S. POWs given early release. As the Department of Defense built up lists of those in the categories of killed in action, killed in action/body not recovered, prisoner of war, and missing in action, its tentative numbers fluctuated, but most of the time, the number of expected returnees upon war's end was around 600.McConnell and Schweitzer, Inside Hanoi's Secret Archives, p. 31. However, the Nixon administration had made return of the POWs one of its central arguments to the American public for prolonging the war and bringing North Vietnam to terms. In doing so, the administration exaggerated the number of POWs at issue, at one point stating that there were \\"fifteen hundred American servicemen\\" held throughout Southeast Asia. These higher numbers would be the focus of much of the controversy in the issue to come. Following the Paris Peace Accords of January 1973, U.S. prisoners of war were returned during Operation Homecoming during February through April 1973. During this, 591 POWs were released to U.S. authorities; this included a few captured in Laos and released in North Vietnam. U.S. President Richard Nixon announced that all U.S. servicemen taken prisoner had been accounted for. At that time, the U.S. listed 2,646 Americans as unaccounted for, including about 1,350 prisoners of war or missing in action and roughly 1,200 reported killed in action and body not recovered. The low numbers of returnees from Laos caused some immediate concern, as previous Pentagon estimates were as high as 41 for prisoners held there, although only a few had been known to be captured for certain.McConnell and Schweitzer, Inside Hanoi's Secret Archives, p. 42. By late 1973, the remains of over 700 Americans killed in Southeast Asia had been returned and identified.Personnel Recovery and Accounting: POW/MIA Accounting. Defense POW/Missing Personnel Office, 2004. Accessed November 2019 Investigation of the fate of all the missing service personnel would end up residing with the Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office. The Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command also played a major role in subsequent investigations. In 1973, the Defense Department established the Central Identification Laboratory–Thailand to coordinate POW/MIA recovery efforts in Southeast Asia. The U.S. conducted some limited operations in South Vietnam in 1974 to find the remains of those missing, and pursuant to the Paris Accords, the North Vietnamese returned some remains too. These efforts halted following the collapse of the Accords and the fall of South Vietnam in 1975, and over the next ten years, little progress was made in recovering remains. During the late 1970s and 1980s, the friends and relatives of unaccounted-for U.S. personnel became politically active, requesting the United States government reveal what steps were taken to follow up on intelligence regarding last- known-alive MIAs and POWs. When initial inquiries revealed important information had not been pursued, many families and their supporters asked for the public release of POW/MIA records and called for an investigation. U.S. Private First Class Robert R. Garwood is often cited as the last U.S. POW from the Vietnam War. In 1979, Garwood reemerged, claiming he and other POWs had remained imprisoned after the war. In a court-martial shortly after his return, he was found not guilty of desertion, solicitation of U.S. troops in the field to refuse to fight and to defect, and maltreatment. However, he was convicted on February 5, 1981, of communicating with the enemy and of the assault on a U.S. prisoner of war interned in a POW camp. Later independent investigations found no substantial evidence to support Garwood's claims, and a Department of Defense investigation published in 1993 concluded Garwood was a collaborator with the enemy. A subsequent 1993 investigation conducted directly by senator Bob Smith claimed to have found the building where Garwood was imprisoned, but the building's connection to Garwood is disputed. ==POW/MIA activist organizations== The National League of Families' POW/MIA flag; it was created in 1971 when the war was still in progress. The National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia was created by Sybil Stockdale, Evelyn Grubb and Mary Crowe as an originally small group of POW/MIA wives in Coronado, California and Hampton Roads, Virginia in 1967. Sybil Stockdale's husband, Navy Commander James Stockdale, was shot down in 1965 and she was determined to make the American people aware of the mistreatment of U.S. POWs. This publicity resulted in better treatment of U.S. POWs from fall 1969 on. After the war, the National League of Families became the leading group requesting information about those still listed as missing in action. It was led by Ann Mills Griffiths. Its stated mission was and is \\"to obtain the release of all prisoners, the fullest possible accounting for the missing and repatriation of all recoverable remains of those who died serving our nation during the Vietnam War in Southeast Asia.\\" The League's most prominent symbol is its POW/MIA flag. Newt Heisley designed this flag to represent America's missing men. This group was more established, less radical, and more connected to the government.McConnell and Schweitzer, Inside Hanoi's Secret Archives, p. 390. The National Alliance of Families For the Return of America's Missing Servicemen was founded in 1990. Its goal was and is to resolve the fates of any unreturned U.S. prisoners of war or missing in action from World War II on forward, not just Southeast Asia, and to gain the return of any live prisoners. It is a 1980s-origined splinter from the National League of Families, p. 52. created by members who were dissatisfied with Ann Mills Griffiths' leadership. Compared to the older group, the National Alliance took a more activist, radical stance, especially towards belief in the existence of live prisoners in Southeast Asia. The chair and co- founder of the group is Dolores Apodaca Alfond, whose brother Major Victor Joe Apodaca Jr. was shot down in 1967 during the Vietnam War. The group was visible during the Kerry Committee hearings of the early 1990s, but disagreed with the committee's findings that there was no compelling evidence of any live prisoners in Southeast Asia. Businessman and POW/MIA advocate Ross Perot, who had done much to help POW families during the war, p. 97. was also very active on this issue. ==Recovery and \\"rescue\\"== A number of individuals were not satisfied with or did not trust U.S. government actions in this area and took their own initiative. Retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Jack Bailey created Operation Rescue, which featured a former smuggling boat named Akuna III and solicited funds from POW/MIA groups.McConnell and Schweitzer, Inside Hanoi's Secret Archives, pp. 170–172. Bailey never produced any prisoners and the boat spent years never leaving its dock in Songkhla in Thailand, but the effort proved adept at bringing in money through the Virginia-based Eberle Associates direct mail marketing firm. p. 123. It was later revealed that Bailey had greatly exaggerated his military record. During the 1980s, former United States Army Special Forces member Bo Gritz undertook a series of private trips into Southeast Asia, purportedly to locate U.S. POWs whom some believed were still being held by Laos and Vietnam, for example at location Nhommarath. These missions were heavily publicized, controversial and widely decried as haphazard—for instance, as some commentators stated, few successful secret missions involve bringing to the border towns women openly marketing commemorative POW-rescue T-shirts.Keating, Prisoners of Hope, One such mission in 1982 was to free POWs reported to be in Laos; Gritz led 15 Laotians and 3 Americans, but they were ambushed shortly after crossing the border from Vietnam to Laos and the mission failed. Command Sergeant Major Eric L. Haney, a former Delta Force operator and a holder of the \\"live prisoners\\" belief, later wrote that beginning in 1981 his unit was twice told to prepare for a mission involving the rescue of U.S. POWs from Vietnam, but both times the missions were scrubbed, according to Haney, when Gritz suddenly appeared in the spotlight, drawing too much attention to the issue and making the missions too difficult to accomplish. Lieutenant General William G. \\"Jerry\\" Boykin, a former commander of Delta Force, describes training for a Laos search mission for U.S. MIAs in the 1980s in his 2008 memoir Never Surrender: A Soldier's Journey to the Crossroads of Faith and Freedom (page 203). The U.S. National Security Council would eventually say of him: \\"Throughout his years of involvement, Mr. Gritz contributed nothing of value to the POW/MIA issue. In fact, his activities have been counter-productive.\\"McConnell and Schweitzer, Inside Hanoi's Secret Archives, p. 178. Another figure of the 1980s was Scott Barnes, who claimed he had both been in a secret operation in Cambodia and had seen an American POW. pp. 422–424. His actions caused significant dissension among POW/MIA activists, especially once he claimed that he had seen more American POWs in Laos but had been ordered by the Central Intelligence Agency to assassinate them. He published the 1987 book BOHICA that related this story. The National League of Families ended up accusing him of exploiting the MIA issue for personal gain, as one wife had mortgaged her house to fund him. Barnes, who had concocted much of his purported military background, would subsequently become a controversial figure within Ross Perot's 1992 presidential campaign. A former American POW, Eugene \\"Red\\" McDaniel, also became convinced that American prisoners had been left behind, and became active in the issue during the 1980s and early 1990s. ==Effect on popular culture== In the words of one analysis, \\"The notion that the United States may have left men behind was hard to fathom, and Americans chose to partly solve this complex problem through fictional characters.\\" This was especially true in Hollywood films. The first was Chuck Norris's 1978 Good Guys Wear Black, which postulated a cynical U.S. government writing off MIAs with a bogus mission. 1983's Uncommon Valor, starring Gene Hackman, followed suit, as did Norris again in 1984 with Missing in Action. The most visible film in this theme was Sylvester Stallone's Rambo: First Blood Part II in 1985, which did the most to popularize the idea that U.S. POWs had been left behind after the war and that the government had no real interest in their rescue. The Rambo character, who in this film may have been partly modeled after Bo Gritz,McConnell and Schweitzer, Inside Hanoi's Secret Archives, p. 174. was a Vietnam veteran commando still haunted by the multiple failures of the war. The pivotal moment of the film occurs when Rambo, realizing he was betrayed by the U.S. government and under torture from the Vietnamese and their Soviet allies, is put into radio communication with the officer who ordered the mission and tells him, \\"Murdock. I'm coming to get you!\\" O'Brien's discussion includes a still from the film of that scene. Rambo and the Norris films were commercially successful in both the United States and in Thailand and other parts of Southeast Asia, and did much to perpetuate the stock image of American prisoners held in bamboo cages.McConnell and Schweitzer, Inside Hanoi's Secret Archives, pp. 165, 170. Rambo was followed by Norris's 1985 prequel Missing in Action 2: The Beginning, as well as other films such as P.O.W. The Escape (1986) and Dog Tags (1990) that shared similar conceits. The Vietnam war POW/MIA issue was also explored in some U.S. television series. The long-running series Magnum, P.I. included multiple episodes in the mid- late-1980s whose central theme was the possibility of U.S. POWs remaining in Vietnam.Magnum Mania! \\"Unfinished Business Episode Recap\\" , Note 2. Retrieved on 1 September 2014. The 1997 The X-Files episode \\"Unrequited\\" also dealt with this notion. The POW/MIA issue was also part of a key story-line in the series JAG in the late 1990s where the father of central character Harmon Rabb had been an MIA in Vietnam. During the second, third and fourth seasons, evidence gradually mounted that Harm Sr. had been relocated to the Soviet Union where he had later escaped and been killed by Soviet soldiers in Siberia. Many Vietnam War songs released in the United States dealt with the POW/MIA issue, but most were quite obscure and never achieved an audience. In the early-to- mid-1970s they largely looked at welcoming the prisoners home, and the impact of the war on veterans and their families. The only one to become a hit was Merle Haggard's 1972 number one country single \\"I Wonder If They Ever Think of Me\\". In the 1980s, some POW/MIA songs took a similar approach to American Vietnam War films, which suggested that many hundreds of U.S. prisoners remained in Vietnam and that the U.S. government had abandoned them. ==The \\"live prisoners\\" debate== Several committee investigations within the U.S. Congress took place over the years. Some members of Congress were quite active on the issue. For Vietnam veteran Bob Smith, Representative and later Senator from New Hampshire, the fate of possible missing or captured Americans in Vietnam had been Smith's major issue since his arrival in Congress in 1985. His interest was partly motivated by his own experience growing up without knowing how his own father died in World War II. North Carolina Congressman Bill Hendon, who served two terms in the early-mid-1980s, was also quite active on the issue. He and Smith met with President Ronald Reagan in January 1986 to discuss their belief that Vietnam was still holding U.S. prisoners, and that U.S. intelligence agencies knew this but that the bureaucracy within the agencies was covering it up from even the Secretary of Defense. Reagan termed Hendon \\"way out yonder\\" on the issue, and after Vice President George H. W. Bush reported that even Smith would not agree with Hendon on some of these claims, Reagan concluded that \\"Bill is off his rocker\\". New York Congressman John LeBoutillier, who served one term in the early 1980s, became interested in politics due to POW matters. After leaving Congress, he continued to be active in POW/MIA affairs. He founded the Sky Hook II Project, dedicated to recovering living U.S. POWs in Southeast Asia. He has made frequent trips to Laos and Vietnam and also met with Laotian and Vietnamese leaders in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Jakarta, Vientiane, and western cities. Another political figure active in the POW/MIA issue was Tom Walsh, who became mayor of Casper, Wyoming, and a three-term member of the Wyoming House of Representatives. Walsh made fourteen trips, at his own expense, to search for information on POWs and MIAs. The POW/MIA issue heated up in the early 1990s. Serious charges were leveled at the Bush administration (1989 to 1993) regarding the POW/MIA issue. The United States Department of Defense, headed by Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, was accused of covering up information and failing to properly pursue intelligence about U.S. POW/MIAs. Ranking minority member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, became interested in the matter. In October 1990 his chief staff aide, James P. Lucier, prepared a report stating that it was probable there were live POWs still being held and that the Bush administration was complicit in hiding the facts. The report also alleged that the Soviet Union had held U.S. prisoners after the end of World War II and more may have been transferred there during the Korean War and the Vietnam War. Helms stated that the \\"deeper story\\" was a possible \\"deliberate effort by certain people in the government to disregard all information or reports about living MIA-POWs.\\" This allegation was followed in May 1991 by Helms' release of a minority report of the Foreign Relations Committee, entitled An Examination of US Policy Toward POW/MIAs, which made similar claims and concluded that \\"any evidence that suggested an MIA might be alive was uniformly and arbitrarily rejected....\\" The issuance of the report angered other Republicans on the committee, and after charges were made that the report contained errors, innuendo, and unsubstantiated rumors, Helms distanced himself from the POW/MIA issue. (This and other personnel matters led to Helms firing Lucier in January 1992.Link, Righteous Warrior, pp. 400–401.) A July 1991 Newsweek cover photograph purported to show three U.S. POWs still being held against their will, which increased general public interest in the issue. However, the photograph turned out to be a hoax. Polls showed that a majority of Americans believed live POWs were indeed still being held captive; a July 1991 Wall Street Journal poll showed 70 percent of Americans believing this, and that three-fourths of them believed the U.S. government was not doing what needed to be done to gain their release.Keating, Prisoners of Hope, p. 224. Interest in the matter intensified in June 1992 when President of the Russian Federation Boris Yeltsin told NBC News in an interview that some Americans captured during the Vietnam War may have been transferred from Hanoi to the Soviet Union: \\"Our archives have shown that it is true, some of them were transferred to the territory of the former U.S.S.R. and were kept in labor camps. We don't have complete data and can only surmise that some of them may still be alive.\\" Ross Perot stated that he believed that hundreds of U.S. servicemen were left behind in Southeast Asia at the end of the U.S. involvement in the war, and that government officials were covering up POW/MIA investigations in order to not reveal a drug smuggling operation used to finance a secret war in Laos. Retired United States Army general, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and current head of the U.S. POW/MIA delegation in Hanoi, John Vessey,McCain, Worth the Fighting For, pp. 245–247. defended administrations' and the military's role in trying to get the Vietnamese to improve their efforts in ascertaining the fate of missing U.S. personnel. Vessey had succeeded in 1988 in convincing the Vietnamese to permit U.S. search teams to operate throughout the country. Vessey categorically rejected the notion of a government conspiracy, saying that he had never seen evidence of one at any time in his military career, and adding that, \\"American soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines are not conspirators.\\"Keating, Prisoners of Hope, pp. 93–95. United States Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney said that Vietnamese cooperation was improved but still needed much more improvement. For critics and skeptics, the allegations fail to convincingly answer the question as to what reason the Vietnamese (and other neighboring countries) would have to hang on to living prisoners. They could have been returned post- war, or being inconvenient witnesses to abuse more easily simply murdered. Proponents of the theory often claimed that the prisoners were initially held back as part of a scheme to gain war reparations from the U.S., as cheap labor, or both,Television program In Search Of, MIAs. Alan Landsberg Productions and then were continued to be held so that the Vietnamese would not have to admit to what they had done. ==Kerry committee== Senator Bob Smith introduced a 1991 resolution to create a Senate Select POW/MIA Committee. pp. 242–243. Senator and fellow Vietnam War veteran John Kerry was the chair of the committee, and its third key member was Senator and former Vietnam War POW John McCain. Compared to earlier congressional investigations into the POW/MIA issue, this one had a mandate to be more skeptical and ask harder questions of government officials than before. The committee's work included more visits to Vietnam and getting the Department of Defense to declassify over a million pages of relevant documents.Alexander, Man of the People, pp. 152–154. Kerry and McCain said that they had gotten the Vietnamese to give them full access to their records, and that they had spent thousands of hours trying to find real, not fabricated, evidence of surviving Americans. Some of the most publicized testimony before the committee came in September 1992, when former Nixon Defense Secretaries Melvin Laird and James Schlesinger said that the U.S. government had believed in 1973 that some U.S. servicemen had not been returned from Laos, despite Nixon's public statements to the contrary. Schlesinger said, \\"As of now, I can come to no other conclusion. [But] that does not mean there are any alive today.\\" Laird said in retrospect of Nixon's assurances that all POWs were coming home, \\"I think it was unfortunate to be that positive. You can't be that positive when we had the kind of intelligence we had.\\" In reaction to the testimony, Kerry said, \\"I think it's quite extraordinary when two former secretaries of defense both give evidence documenting that they had information, or they believed personally, that people were alive and not accounted for in Operation Homecoming.\\" The committee issued its unanimous findings on January 13, 1993. In response to the central question of whether any U.S. POWs were still in captivity, it stated: With specific regard to the \\"some evidence\\", the committee said this: \\"But neither live-sighting reports nor other sources of intelligence have provided grounds for encouragement,[12] particularly over the past decade. The live-sighting reports that have been resolved have not checked out; alleged pictures of POWs have proven false; purported leads have come up empty; and photographic intelligence has been inconclusive, at best.\\" Two senators, Smith and Grassley, dissented at note 12, with the report saying \\"they believe that live-sighting reports and other sources of intelligence are evidence that POWs may have survived to the present.\\" With regard to the possibility that American POWs survived in Southeast Asia after Operation Homecoming, the committee said this: \\"We acknowledge that there is no proof that U.S. POWs survived, but neither is there proof that all of those who did not return had died. There is evidence, moreover, that indicates the possibility of survival, at least for a small number, after Operation Homecoming.\\" Committee vice- chairman Smith seemed to back away from the committee's findings within months of their being issued, appearing in April 1993 on Larry King Live with POW/MIA activist Bill Hendon, stressing his partial dissent from the majority report and touting new evidence of North Vietnam having held back prisoners in 1973, and then in the Senate in September 1993, saying he had \\"very compelling\\" new evidence of live prisoners. He also asked the Justice Department to investigate ten federal officials for perjury and other crimes in conjunction with a cover-up of POW/MIA investigations, In what he dubbed \\"Operation Clean Sweep\\", Smith said the targeted officials had a \\"mind-set to debunk\\".Keating, Prisoners of Hope, p. 240. Kerry and McCain both denounced Smith's actions, with McCain saying \\"In my dealings with these people, it is clear that mistakes may have been made in a very complex set of issues. But at no time was there any indication that they were giving anything but their most dedicated efforts. I frankly don't feel it's appropriate to publicly make these charges without public substantiation.\\" Defense Secretary Les Aspin said the charges were unwarranted. In 1994, journalist Sydney Schanberg, who had won a Pulitzer Prize in the 1970s for his New York Times reporting in Cambodia, wrote a long article for Penthouse magazine in which he said the committee had been dominated by a faction led by Kerry that \\"wanted to appear to be probing the prisoner issue energetically, but in fact, they never rocked official Washington's boat, nor did they lay open the 20 years of secrecy and untruths.\\" Schanberg stated that key committee staff had had too close a relationship with the Department of Defense, and that while other committee investigators were able to get evidence of men left behind into the full body of the report, the report's conclusions \\"were watered down and muddied to the point of meaninglessness.\\" Kerry denied that the committee had engaged in any cover-up. The Kerry committee did little to soften the attitudes of those directly involved in the issue. To skeptics, \\"live prisoners\\" remained a conspiracy theory unsupported by motivation or evidence, and the foundation for a cottage industry of charlatans who preyed upon the hopes of the families of the missing. As two skeptics wrote in 1995, \\"The conspiracy myth surrounding the Americans who remained missing after Operation Homecoming in 1973 had evolved to baroque intricacy. By 1992, there were thousands of zealots—who believed with cultlike fervor that hundreds of American POWs had been deliberately and callously abandoned in Indochina after the war, that there was a vast conspiracy within the armed forces and the executive branch—spanning five administrations—to cover up all evidence of this betrayal, and that the governments of Communist Vietnam and Laos continued to hold an unspecified number of living American POWs, despite their adamant denials of this charge.\\"McConnell and Schweitzer, Inside Hanoi's Secret Archives, p. 13. Believers continued to strongly reject such notions; as one wrote in 1994, \\"It is not conspiracy theory, not paranoid myth, not Rambo fantasy. It is only hard evidence of a national disgrace: American prisoners were left behind at the end of the Vietnam War. They were abandoned because six presidents and official Washington could not admit their guilty secret. They were forgotten because the press and most Americans turned away from all things that reminded them of Vietnam.\\" ==Normalization with Vietnam== The actions of the committee were designed to allow for improved ties between the U.S. and Vietnam, for which the unresolved fate of U.S. MIAs had long been a sticking point. pp. 149–150. The belief by Americans from a few years earlier that live prisoners still existed had mostly passed; in the words of Time magazine, \\"most people seemed resigned to the idea that the fortunes of war are bound to leave a few mysteries.\\" In 1994 the Senate passed a resolution, sponsored by Kerry and McCain, that called for an end to the existing trade embargo against Vietnam; it was intended to pave the way for normalization. When President Bill Clinton lifted the trade embargo on February 3, 1994, he stated: In response, columnist Dan Rather wrote the following: In 1995, President Bill Clinton normalized diplomatic relations with the country of Vietnam, with McCain's and Kerry's visible support during the announcement giving Clinton, who came of age during Vietnam but did not serve in the military, some political cover. During his time on the committee and afterward, McCain was vilified as a fraud,Alexander, Man of the People, p. 170. traitor, or \\"Manchurian Candidate\\" by many of the POW/MIA activists who believed in live prisoners. McCain's high-profile on the Vietnam issue also cost him the friendship of some fellow former POWs; pp. 187–189. In return, McCain continued to attack those he saw as profiteers exploiting the families of those missing in action. In the 1990s, the Joint Task Force–Full Accounting in conjunction with the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command was established to focus on achieving the fullest possible accounting of Americans missing from the Vietnam War. It has interviewed thousands of witnesses regarding the fate of missing Americans, and conducts ten missions per year in Southeast Asia to search for remains of those still listed as missing. ==Diminished in impact but not gone== By the late 2000s, the Vietnam POW/MIA issue had largely faded from view, but the U.S. public still saw the POW/MIA Flag flying at many public facilities. During the twenty-first century, the Vietnam POW/MIA issue became less in the public eye, but did not disappear. As one National Public Radio report said, \\"The POW/MIA movement isn't the cultural and political force that it once was, but it's still hard to ignore. The iconic black-and- white POW/MIA flag is seemingly everywhere ...\\" In a 2002 interview, the Cambodia politician Pen Sovan reported hearing about U.S. POWs from his guards, during his imprisonment in Vietnam, and believed that some had been taken by the Soviet Union. He said he had spoken to U.S. MIA officials about this. Schanberg returned to the POW/MIA subject during John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign in a series of articles for The Village Voice; he claimed that Kerry had shredded documents, suppressed testimony, and sanitized findings during his time as chairman of the committee. Kerry denied these allegations and responded overall by saying, \\"In the end, I think what we can take pride in is that we put together the most significant, most thorough, most exhaustive accounting for missing and former POWs in the history of human warfare.\\" In 2007, the former Congressman Bill Hendon published his book An Enormous Crime, which chronicled his view of the history of U.S. service members abandoned in Southeast Asia following the war and the circumstances that left them there. A companion website allowed readers to examine actual intelligence reports and decide if the Defense Intelligence Agency acted properly in dismissing each case. The book ranked to #34 on the New York Times Best Seller list. A year later, Schanberg again published articles, this time for The Nation and The Nation Institute, during John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign, in which he recapped his previous arguments and additionally claimed that McCain had helped cover up the long suppression of evidence concerning live prisoners. Former Congressman LeBoutillier was also vocal in his opposition to McCain, in part due to McCain's failure to acknowledge what he saw as evidence of live U.S. POWs left behind. However, while the group of activists on the topic still felt very strongly about it, the matter had largely faded from the U.S. public, and McCain's actions with regard to the POW/MIA issue never were never mentioned as a serious factor in his eventually losing campaign.See for example ; ; The controversy continued to pop up on occasion in the 2010s. The Canadian documentary Unclaimed told in 2013 the story of an elderly man in Vietnam claiming to be a U.S. soldier thought killed in action in 1968. However, Defense Department officials said the man was an imposter with a history of impersonating U.S. POWs. The case of Baron 52, the call sign of a U.S. Air Force EC-47 carrying eight crew members that was shot down over Laos in 1973, was reopened for examination by the Air Force and the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency in 2016, after decades of pressure from family members who believe that four of the crewmen might have escaped the crash. ==Continued accounting== Efforts continue to recover Americans; the U.S. Department of Defense spends over $110 million per year in the effort, and the number unaccounted for gradually decreases. For instance, according to the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, the number of U.S. military and civilian personnel still unaccounted for from the Vietnam War was given as 1,621 as of March 23, 2016. Then as of December 21, 2018, the number of U.S. military and civilian personnel still unaccounted for is 1,592. Visited again 2020-02-08. By February 7, 2020, this number had been reduced a little further, to 1,587. Working jointly, U.S. and Vietnamese experts focus on \\"Last Known Alive\\" cases, which involve missing Americans whom the U.S. believed might have survived their initial loss incident. Outcomes of these investigations helps resolve the live prisoners question. The U.S. has identified 296 individuals as Last Known Alive cases in all of Southeast Asia, and following full investigations, the Defense Department had confirmed the wartime death of 245 of these individuals by March 2012. One important result of the movement was that greater pressure was put by family members on the U.S. government towards recovering and identifying the missing from other past conflicts, some of which had seen far greater numbers of missing in action. Indeed, the majority of the some 150 new identifications made each year are from the Korean War or World War II. As historian Michael Allen has said, \\"This [pressure] result[ed] in renewed efforts to recover the missing from earlier conflicts, and that effort has over time become institutionalized, so that it's ongoing. It's just part of the military bureaucracy.\\" ==See also== * List of United States servicemembers and civilians missing in action during the Vietnam War (1961–65) * List of United States servicemembers and civilians missing in action during the Vietnam War (1966–67) * List of United States servicemembers and civilians missing in action during the Vietnam War (1968–69) * List of United States servicemembers and civilians missing in action during the Vietnam War (1970–71) * List of United States servicemembers and civilians missing in action during the Vietnam War (1972–75) ==Further reading== * ==References * Records of U.S. Military Casualties, Missing in Action, and Prisoners of War from the Era of the Vietnam War at The National Archives ** A Finding Aid to Records Relating to American Prisoners of War and Missing in Action from the Vietnam War Era, 1960–1994 (all congressional committees and hearings) ** A Finding Aid to Records Relating to American Prisoners of War and Missing in Action from the Vietnam War Era, 1960–1994 (Kerry committee) * The Vietnam-Era Prisoner-of- War/Missing-in-Action Database at Library of Congress * Report of the Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs at Library of Congress (98Mb PDF) ** Report of the Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs – Executive Summary only at Federation of American Scientists (HTML) * Blog covers Widow’s travels to Vietnam in search of her MIA husband’s jet crash site in Que Son Mtns * MIA Facts Site – Joe Schlatter, Colonel, U.S. Army, Retired * Bill Hendon An Enormous Crime companion website * Video of C-SPAN special segment, Author Carol Jose speaks about book on the National League of Families * CBS News, \\"Woman Wears POW/MIA Bracelet for 40 years\\" News spot about a woman's dedication to a missing Vietnam War soldier and his family. * Vietnam War: P.O.W. / M.I.A.

Among the best known settings (derived from the Scottish strathspey \\"Cutting Ferns\\") is that of Clannad, who recorded it for their 1976 album Dúlamán. A slower melody was recorded by Altan on their 1993 album Island Angel. A contemporary musical setting of the song for the choir was also made by composer Michael McGlynn, which is featured in Endless Ocean: Blue World (Adventures of the Deep in Europe).

A gonzo-style reporter, Amy was physically (and possibly sexually) abused by her father as a child, which led her to stab him to death. After viewing a videotape her boss Charles received in the mail which depicts a member of a cult known as the Deaders committing suicide and subsequently being resurrected by Deaders leader Winter, Amy travels from London to Bucharest to look into the Deaders. Finding another tape and the Lament Configuration puzzle box in the apartment of a heavily decayed-looking Deader named Marla, who subsequently appears to her several times, Amy tinkers with the box, causing her to have a brief encounter with the Cenobite Pinhead. Tracking down Winter and the Deader's home, Amy is forced into experiencing something of a vision quest by Winter, who wishes to use her to solve the Lament Configuration, something neither he nor his followers can do. Eventually snapping out of her trance-like state, Amy is almost goaded into killing herself (so she can be resurrected later) with a knife by Winter, but relents and inadvertently solves the Lament Configuration by hurling it at a wall. Summoning Pinhead and the Cenobites, Amy witnesses them rip Winter (revealed to be a descendant of box creator Phillip Lemarchand) apart with hooked chains and subsequently kill the Deaders once and for all. When the Cenobites turn their attention on her, Amy, to rob them of collecting her soul, commits suicide by stabbing herself, causing the Lament Configuration to make the Cenobites vanish and cause the Deader's lair to collapse. == B  Butterball = C  The Cenobites = Chatterer = Chelsea Murdock === Chelsea Murdock is a character in the film Hellraiser: Hellworld where she is played by Katheryn Winnick. A teenaged girl, Chelsea is a fan of the MMORPG computer game Hellworld, a game based upon the Hellraiser mythology. After her friend Adam immolates himself with gasoline due to his obsession with Hellworld, Chelsea abandons the game, but two years after Adam's funeral is pressured by her friends into attending a Hellworld centered party at Leviathan House. While at the party, Chelsea is plagued by several bizarre incidents seemingly caused by the host of the party and, after escaping Leviathan House, witnesses Pinhead murder a police officer she had found patrolling the woods. Returning to the now abandoned Leviathan House after receiving a fake cell phone call from her friend Jake, Chelsea is chased to the attic of the mansion by the Cenobites and undead versions of her friends Mike and Allison. While in the attic, Chelsea is called by Jake, who realizes that everything they are experienced is some sort of mass hallucination. After rejoining Jake, Chelsea is confronted by the party host, who she had discovered was Adam's father. After the host causes Jake to become trapped in a coffin, he begins burying Chelsea alive, revealing he had drugged her and her friends and buried them, using cell phones to send messages to them and cause them to hallucinate everything, all in an attempt to avenge the death of Adam. Before the host can finish burying her, Chelsea returns to consciousness and is dug up by the police along with Jake. The police reveal to Chelsea that she and Jake have been buried for days and that they were only found due to anonymous call from Leviathan House, which Chelsea believes was made by Adam's spirit, which she briefly spots gazing out a window of Leviathan House. After the events of the Hellworld party, Chelsea and Jake, having become a couple, decide to go on vacation together, only to be visited by the apparent spirit of the host, who had earlier been killed by the real Cenobites (summoned by a puzzle box Adam had created shortly before killing himself). The host causes Chelsea's car to spin out of control before disappearing, leaving both Chelsea and Jake unharmed but severely shaken. == D  Doctor Paul Merchant === Doctor Paul Merchant is a character in the film Hellraiser: Bloodline where he is portrayed by Bruce Ramsay. A future descendant of Phillip LeMerchand, the creator of the gateway to Hell known as the Lament Configuration, Paul, being the last of his bloodline, is the only one who can permanently close the gateway to Hell his ancestor opened centuries ago. Hijacking a space station known as the Minos, which he designed, Paul uses a remote-controlled robot to open the Lament Configuration, summoning the Cenobite Pinhead and his minions. After releasing Pinhead, Paul is captured by a group of soldiers, who contain him while they investigate what he has been doing on the station. Left alone with a female soldier named Rimmer, Paul tells her of his family's history, telling her he must complete his work or else everyone on the station is doomed. When it becomes apparent that something really is stalking through the space station, Paul is released by the soldiers, who are killed one by one by the Cenobites. Managing to finish his work and narrowly escape Pinhead through the use of a hologram, Paul flies away from the Minos in a space shuttle with Rimmer while the Minos changes into a giant puzzle box, originally designed by Phillip LeMerchand, which completely destroys Pinhead. === Derelict, The Puzzle Guardian === Derelict, The Puzzle Guardian is a character in the film Hellraiser portrayed by Frank Baker. A filthy-looking vagrant, the Puzzle Guardian acts as the protector of the Lament Configuration puzzle box, passing it from hand to hand and saving it from danger. The Puzzle Guardian first appears in Morocco, where it sells Frank Cotton the Lament Configuration. Later, the Puzzle Guardian, having traveled to England, begins stalking Kirsty Cotton, at one point going into the pet shop where the young woman works and eating a large amount of crickets before being shooed away. When Kirsty and her boyfriend Steve attempt to burn the Lament Configuration, the Puzzle Guardian appears and saves the box before transforming into a skeletal dragon and flying away. The Puzzle Guardian is last seen back in India with the Lament Configuration, asking a prospective customer \\"What's your pleasure, sir?\\" At the end of Hellbound: Hellraiser II, Little John plays the cricket- covered face of the Puzzle Guardian, which appears on the Pillar of Souls, asking a shocked moving man, \\"What is your pleasure, sir?\\" In Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth, Lawrence Mortorff plays the Puzzle Guardian, who sells nightclub owner J.P. Monroe the Pillar of Souls in the Pyramid Gallery. A week later, when Joey Summerskill and Terri investigate the Pyramid Gallery, they learn the shop has been closed for over a month, the owner having gone on vacation to Hawaii. Doug Bradley portrays the Puzzle Guardian in Hellraiser: Hellseeker, where the Puzzle Guardian owns a sweatshop in a warehouse. The Puzzle Guardian, when Trevor Gooden appears in the warehouse after receiving a business card with \\"All Problems Solved\\" inscribed on it, sells Trevor the Lament Configuration, stating that the price of the box is far larger than he can imagine, which Trevor will learn eventually. Later, when Trevor returns to the Puzzle Guardian's warehouse, he finds it abandoned. The Hellraiser comics by Epic explain the origin of the Puzzle Guardian, revealing there is one for every puzzle to Hell. The story \\"Mazes of the Mind\\" in the fifth issue of Clive Barker's Hellraiser states that Puzzle Guardians are created by the Cenobite Orno, who tampers with the mind of a denizen of Hell (referred to as \\"Raw Material\\") and imbues them with some of his own seed before sending them to Earth to have sex with a woman; after impregnating a woman, who will die during child birth, the Raw Material will commit suicide. When the child of the Raw Material reaches the age of sixteen, Orno reveals their destiny to them, giving them the puzzle they will guard. == E  Emma Craven === Emma Craven is a character in the film Hellraiser: Revelations where she is portrayed by Tracey Fairaway. === Engineer === The Engineer is a character first appearing at the end of the Hellbound Heart as the unseen leader of Pinhead's Gash who appears only as flashes of light, (some minute and others blinding) using living and dead people alike as conduits to its will. Whether these people the Engineer possesses are illusions or actually exist remains unknown; its first conduit was the then dead Julia, whose severed head was able to speak, which the book draws special attention to describing as impossible: \\"Bereft of lungs, how could it speak? It spoke nevertheless--\\" In the film Hellraiser, the Engineer is a demon which prowls the corridors of Hell, the Engineer resembles an amalgamation of various animals. The Engineer first appears to chase Kirsty Cotton out of Hell when she solves the Lament Configuration puzzle box in her hospital room. Later, after Kirsty banishes the Cenobites back to Hell and attempts to escape her rapidly decaying house, the Engineer appears again. Grappling with Kirsty and her boyfriend Steve as they attempt to reclaim the Lament Configuration, the Engineer is banished back to Hell when Kirsty manages to grab the puzzle box and solves it. The Engineer was to appear in Hellbound: Hellraiser II, but was removed completely. However, the character can still be briefly seen through an editing error at the end of Hellbound, as Kirsty and Tiffany flee the Labyrinth racing for the closing gate as souls flee all around them. Only the Engineer, and the souls fleeing, are visible in the orphaned shot (interlaced with shots of Kirsty and Tiffany fleeing), which takes place just as Leviathan begins to transform into a puzzle box. The orphaned shot remains in the stand- alone DVD released in Region 1. In Hellraiser: Inferno, another being called the Engineer appears, a faceless and near-mythic criminal played by Ray Miceli. When a detective named Joseph Thorne begins hunting for it and the child it has presumably kidnapped, the Engineer continually taunts the detective, systematically killing the man's friends and loved ones while leaving a child's finger at all the crime scenes. When it is revealed to Joseph by Pinhead that the detective has been in Hell ever since he solved the Lament Configuration, Pinhead also reveals that the Engineer is Joseph's \\"flesh\\", the embodiment of his carnal desires which have doomed his soul to repeat the same sequence of events for all eternity. The Engineer is referenced to in Hellraiser: Hellworld as an enemy in the online computer game Hellworld; later in the film, when the characters begin to question whether they are actually in Hell, one of them sarcastically asks \\"Where are the Engineers?\\" The version of the Engineer from the first Hellraiser film made only one appearance in the Epic comic series, in the seventh issue of the Clive Barker's Hellraiser anthology series. In the story \\"Under the Knife\\", the Engineer, along with several Cenobites, is summoned via the puzzle known as The Heart of Damnation and, shortly after being summoned, is returned to Hell when the puzzle is damaged. == F  Frank Cotton === Frank Cotton appears in the film Hellraiser where he is portrayed by Sean Chapman as a man and Oliver Smith as an undead being. The criminal brother of Larry Cotton, Frank, believing he has experienced everything the world has to offer, buys the Lament Configuration puzzle box from a merchant in North Africa and brings it back to his dead mother's home in England. Solving the puzzle box, Frank opens a portal and summons the Cenobites, who take him to their realm for use as a \\"subject\\" in their sadomasochistic experiments. Frank manages to escape when his brother Larry cuts his hand and bleeds onto the spot where Frank was taken by the Cenobites. He convinces his sister-in-law, Julia, to murder men for him so that he can consume their blood and internal organs, which progressively regenerates his body and allows them to resume an affair they began on her wedding day. After Frank kills Larry to harvest his skin, Larry's daughter, Kirsty, turns him over to the Cenobites, who tear his body to pieces before taking him back to their realm. In Hellbound: Hellraiser II, Frank appears before the now institutionalized Kirsty in her room, pretending to be her father and leaving her a message written in his own blood asking for help. When Kirsty enters the Cenobite realm, she finds herself in Frank's personal Hell, a chamber filled with writhing female forms where Frank can never sate his lust. Attempting to rape Kirsty, Frank reverts to his skinless appearance when Kirsty causes him to catch on fire. Frank is finally defeated when Julia appears and tears his heart out. Frank is mentioned in Hellraiser: Hellseeker, which states that he and Larry had both stockpiled large fortunes, of which Kirsty is the sole beneficiary. === The Female = J  Jake === Jake is a character in the film Hellraiser: Hellworld where he is portrayed by Christopher Jacot. === John Merchant === John Merchant is a character in the film Hellraiser: Bloodline where he is portrayed by Bruce Ramsay. An architect and descendant of Phillip LeMerchand, John lives with his wife Bobbi and young son Jack in New York City. Due to a curse placed upon his family, John has recurring dreams of the demon Angelique, who was summoned when his ancestor Phillip created the Lament Configuration, a puzzle box which can open a gateway to Hell. Shortly after Angelique appears at a ceremony celebrating the completion of a new building (which resembles the Lament Configuration) designed by him, John's family is kidnapped by the demon and the recently summoned Cenobite Pinhead. Forced into working on a larger portal to Hell by his family's captors, John sabotages the portal and is promptly killed afterward by Pinhead, who decapitates him with a scissor-like chain. Shortly after John's death, Bobbi and Jack manage to banish both Pinhead and Angelique back to Hell with the Lament Configuration. === Joseph Thorne === Joseph Thorne is a character in the film Hellraiser: Inferno where he is portrayed by Craig Sheffer as an adult and J.B. Gaynor as a child. A largely corrupt detective with a penchant for sleight of hand and puzzles, Joseph believes himself to be above the law and regularly engages in illegal behavior all the while neglecting his family. While investigating the murder of an old acquaintance of his, who was seemingly torn apart by hooked chains, Joseph is given the Lament Configuration puzzle box by a fellow detective who discovered the box at the scene of the crime. Solving the box in the bathroom of a motel after having sex with a prostitute, Joseph subsequently has a dream where he is attacked by the Cenobites before awakening. After solving the box, bizarre events begin to plague Joseph as he searches for a child abducted by a being simply referred to as the Engineer. As those close to him begin to die, Joseph is directed to his childhood home by Pinhead, where Joseph, after facing the reanimated corpses of his dead friends and family members, finds himself in a dark void, where Pinhead reveals to Joseph he is in Hell, his sinful lifestyle and disregard for everyone but himself having doomed him to relive the events of the past few days over and over again. After being torn apart by Pinhead's hooked chains, Joseph awakens back in the motel room where he solved the box and believes he has been given a second chance, only to discover upon going to work that he is still in Hell. Shooting himself in the mouth with his own gun, Joseph awakens once more in the motel room and, upon exiting it, finds himself in his childhood bedroom. Fully realizing he is doomed, Joseph breaks down completely and is left screaming hysterically. === Joey Summerskill === Joanne \\"Joey\\" Summerskill is a character in the film Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth where she is portrayed by Terry Farrell. A news reporter for Channel 8, Joey, after witnessing a teenaged boy be torn apart by hooked chains in a hospital room, begins investigating The Boiler Room, the nightclub where the boy was found by a girl named Terri, who Joey befriends. As she investigates the club and the Lament Configuration puzzle box which was found in a pillar bought by club owner J.P. Monroe, Joey is continually contacted by Captain Elliot Spencer, the human side of the Cenobite Pinhead. Meeting with Elliot in Purgatory, Joey learns from the captain that his evil side, Pinhead, has been released from his imprisonment in the Pillar of Souls and that it is up to her to stop the Cenobite. After being told that she must trick Pinhead into fusing back together with Elliot, Joey heads to The Boiler Room, where she finds all the club patrons and her friend and cameraman Doc Fisher slaughtered by Pinhead, who confronts Joey and demands she give him the Lament Configuration. Fleeing from Pinhead, Joey manages to send his newly created Cenobite minions to Hell before Pinhead, appearing as Joey's dead father in a Heaven-like setting, tricks Joey into giving him the Lament Configuration. As Pinhead prepares to change Joey into a Cenobite, he is confronted by Captain Spencer, who forcibly fuses with his evil side. Free from Pinhead's machinery, Joey sends the now whole Cenobite back to Hell by stabbing him in the chest with the Lament Configuration when the puzzle box changes into a diamond shape. With Pinhead banished, Joey disposes of the Lament Configuration in some newly laid cement. === Julia Cotton === Julia Cotton is a character in the film Hellraiser where she is portrayed by Clare Higgins. The second wife of Larry Cotton and stepmother of Kirsty Cotton, Julia and her family, after living in Boston, move to England and into the house of Larry's deceased mother. While in the house, Julia discovers the zombified version of Larry's brother Frank, with whom Julia had had an affair. At first horrified of Frank, Julia begins to do his bidding in attempt to resurrect him, seducing men and bringing them to the house so Frank can feed off them. Eventually, after an encounter with Kirsty and when Frank is almost fully human looking, Julia leads Larry to Frank, who kills him and steals his skin; afterward, Julia and Frank have sex. When Kirsty returns home in search of Frank, Julia and Frank attempt to trick and kill her, an attack which results in Julia's death at Frank's hands, when, as Julia restrains Kirsty, Frank accidentally stabs her with his switchblade. As Kirsty flees, Julia slumps to the ground and is prematurely aged when Frank uses his powers of absorption against her. Kirsty later finds Julia's corpse chained to a bed by the Cenobites. In Hellbound: Hellraiser II, Julia is released from Hell when Doctor Phillip Channard has one of the mentally ill patients in his care mutilate himself on the mattress Julia died on. A skinless being (played by Deborah Joel), Julia seduces Channard and has him bring her victims which she can feed on to restore her human form, which she succeeds in doing. After Channard has a girl named Tiffany solve the Lament Configuration puzzle box, Julia and Channard enter Hell, where Julia betrays Channard and knocks him into a Cenobite Transformation Chamber, revealing that the god of Hell, Leviathan, had allowed her to return to Earth to collect souls. Afterward, in the personal Hell of Frank, Julia, after turning against Frank, attacks Tiffany and Kirsty, only to be sucked out of her skin and be sent tumbling down a wind tunnel. Hellraiser creator Clive Barker had originally intended to have Julia become the main villain of the Hellraiser series and be one of the few female slasher villains, but these plans fell through when Clare Higgins declined playing Julia again and the popularity of Cenobite leader Pinhead rose dramatically. == K  Kirsty Cotton = Kyle Macrae === Kyle Macrae is a character in Hellbound: Hellraiser II portrayed by William Hope. Kyle was Channard's student. Both Kyle and Channard were intrigued by Kirsty's tale of what happened to her family. Kyle stumbled upon multiple Lament Configuration boxes in Channard's house, and witnessed him using a mental patient to summon Julia. Kyle watched as Julia killed the patient. He alerted Kirsty, and they went to the house to bring back Larry. Kyle searched the house after telling Kirsty to stay put, and is killed by Julia, who drains his life force. == L  Larry Cotton === Larry Cotton is the father of Kirsty Cotton who appears only in Hellraiser and is portrayed by Andrew Robinson. Larry was originally the husband of Kirsty's mother, who had died, and married to Julia. He was most caring about his daughter Kirsty. He had a tough life and all he was trying to do is keep his family together. Larry hates watching himself bleed and when he cut his hand by a nail on the wall by trying to push a mattress up the stairs, he thought he was going to faint or throw up. His blood revived his deceased brother, Frank Cotton, whom Julia had an affair with and secretly began luring men to the house while Larry was at work to get Frank more blood to help him regenerate. Larry is later murdered by Julia and Frank, the latter using his brother's skin as a disguise. Although unseen, Larry is mentioned in Hellbound: Hellraiser II when Frank, pretending to be Larry once more, appears as a vision to Kirsty saying that he is trapped in hell. Later, Pinhead informs Kirsty, who had come to hell to save her father, that Larry is \\"in his own personal hell and quite unreachable\\". Larry is again mentioned during an extended scene in Hellraiser: Inferno where Kirsty confronts Pinhead who says that Frank, Julia, and Larry are all waiting for her in Hell. Larry is never mentioned again after this. Andrew Robinson was going to reprise his role as Larry Cotton in Hellbound: Hellraiser II, but according to the Hellraiser 20th Anniversary Edition he stated \\"They didn't want to pay me as they did for Hellraiser, so I said forget it. And that was that\\". In The Hellbound Heart, Larry's name was Rory and he is simply a friend of Kirsty rather than her father. === Leviathan === Leviathan is an entity introduced in Hellbound: Hellraiser II. A giant silver diamond which emits a constant beam of black light which can cause those caught in it to experience past memories, Leviathan is introduced as the god of Hell, lord of its labyrinth, and creator of the Cenobites. After Doctor Phillip Channard is taken to Hell by Julia Cotton, she reveals that Leviathan had allowed her to return to Earth to bring it more souls before knocking Channard into a Cenobite Transformation Chamber. After a girl named Tiffany solves the Lament Configuration, which had been changed into a miniature replica of Leviathan by the Cenobite Pinhead, Leviathan itself changes into a giant puzzle box. As Leviathan changes forms, it quickly loses its captive souls; the souls escape to Earth before the gateways to the realm close. A reference to Leviathan is made in the film Hellraiser: Hellworld, the main setting of which is an old mansion known as Leviathan House. In the Hellraiser comics by Epic, Leviathan is described as a being obsessed with law and order and views the human realm as chaotic and wrong; Leviathan uses the Cenobites as its foot soldiers against chaos and flesh. == N  Nico Bradley === Nico Bradley is a character in the film Hellraiser: Revelations where he is portrayed by Jay Gillespie. == P  Philip Channard, Doctor === Dr. Philip Channard is a character in the film Hellbound: Hellraiser II where he is portrayed by Kenneth Cranham. Dr. Channard was a psychiatrist who ran the Channard institute, where patient Kirsty Cotton tells him about the Cenobites. At home, it is revealed that Channard has the mattress that Kirsty's stepmother, Julia, died on. Channard's assistant, Kyle, sneaks in to his house to find that Channard was obsessed with the Lament Configuration box and the portal to Hell. Kyle watches as Channard brings back a patient from the ward as a sacrifice for Julia's resurrection. Channard brings Julia back more corpses for her to feed on so she can regain her skin. Eventually, using his other patient Tiffany to solve the Lament Configuration, Channard reached the labyrinth and was turned into Cenobite. === Phillip Lemarchand === Phillip Lemarchand is a character in the film Hellraiser: Bloodline where he is portrayed by Bruce Ramsay. A toymaker in 18th century France, Phillip is commissioned by the wealthy aristocrat Duc de L'Isle to create an intricate puzzle box. Creating the box, the Lament Configuration, Phillip brings it to de L'Isle and afterward witnesses de L'Isle use the box to summon the demon Angelique. Realizing what he has unleashed, Phillip designs a counter to the Lament Configuration, which he attempts to steal back. As Phillip tries to steal back the Lament Configuration, discovering that de L'Isle has been betrayed by his servant Jacques, he is found by Jacques and Angelique, who mortally wound him. Dying, Phillip, upon being found by his wife, tells her to flee and save their unborn child. A portrait of Phillip appears in Hellraiser: Hellworld in Leviathan House, which the host of a party being held there claims was built by Lemarchand, though the authenticity of this story is questionable. Before his appearance in Hellraiser: Bloodline, Phillip appeared in the Hellraiser comics by Epic, which depict him as a sociopath who was driven to create the Lament Configuration by the Cenobite known as the Baron. After the creation of his first puzzle box, Phillip traveled the world and created innumerable other puzzles before growing weary of life. === Pinhead = R  Rimmer === Rimmer is a character in the film Hellraiser: Bloodline where she is played by Christine Harnos. A soldier in the far future, Rimmer and several others, after Doctor Paul Merchant hijacks his own space station the Minos, boards the station and take Paul prisoner. Left in a cell with Paul, Rimmer is told by him his family history, about how his ancestor Phillip Lemarchand created a puzzle box known as the Lament Configuration, which can summon entities known as the Cenobites, which Paul had earlier brought onto the Minos with the intent of destroying them and the box. At first disbelieving of Paul, Rimmer, when it becomes apparent that something really is aboard the Minos, decides to aid Paul in his plans. Managing to kill Cenobite Pet the Chatter Beast by causing the monster to explode via tampering with pressure valves in the hallway the beast is in, Rimmer eventually regroups with Paul (her fellow soldiers having been slain by the Cenobites) and together the two escape the Minos on a space shuttle. While flying through space, Paul and Rimmer appear on a monitor to Cenobite leader Pinhead, watching as he is completely eradicated by the Minos, which changes into the Elysium Configuration, which permanently destroys the gateway to Hell the Lament Configuration had created. === Ross Craven === Ross Craven is a character in the film Hellraiser: Revelations where he is portrayed by Steven Brand. == S  Sarah Craven === Sarah Craven is a character in the film Hellraiser: Revelations where she is portrayed by Devon Sorvari. === Steven Craven === Steven Craven is a character in the film Hellraiser: Revelations where he is portrayed by Nick Eversman. Fred Tatasciore portrayed \\"Faceless\\" Steven in a nightmare sequence; as he (really Nico) gets his face cut off by Female Chatterer and Pinhead. === Steve O'Donnell === Steven \\"Steve\\" O'Donnell was the former boyfriend of Kirsty Cotton who only appears in Hellraiser and is portrayed by actor Robert Hines. He first appears during the Cottons dining party and again when he and Kirsty were about to go home and sleep together. He is not seen until after he searches for Kirsty when she left the hospital to warn her father. After giving the Cenobites to Frank, Steve manages to find her only to encounter the Engineer. After banishing the Cenobites, he watches Kirsty burn the Lament Configuration until the Puzzle Guardian grabs the box and flies away. Though he doesn't appear in Hellbound: Hellraiser II, he is mentioned by Detective Bronson. == T  Tiffany === Tiffany is a character in the film Hellbound: Hellraiser II where she is portrayed by Imogen Boorman. A mute young girl with an affinity for puzzles, Tiffany, whose real name is never stated, is a patient in the Channard Institute, a hospital for the mentally ill. After aiding Julia Cotton, an escapee from Hell, restore her human appearance, Doctor Phillip Channard has Tiffany solve the Lament Configuration, a puzzle box which can open a gateway to Hell. Solving the puzzle, Tiffany is spared by the summoned Cenobites, who realize that Tiffany had not intentionally summoned them. When the Cenobites leave, Tiffany wanders into her own personal Hell, a demented carnival where she relives a memory of her mother being killed by Channard shortly after she had been brought to the Channard Institute. Escaping her Hell, Tiffany meets Kirsty Cotton and escapes back to Earth with her after an encounter with Julia. Finding herself in the Channard Institute, Tiffany, when Channard, now a Cenobite, appears, utters her first line (\\"Oh shit.\\") before fleeing back to Hell with Kirsty. Saved from Channard by the other Cenobites, who are reminded of their humanity by Kirsty, Tiffany manages to close the gateway to Hell she opened by re-solving the Lament Configuration, which Pinhead had changed into a diamond shape. As Leviathan, the god of Hell, changes into a giant puzzle box, unintentionally killing the Channard Cenobite, Tiffany and Kirsty narrowly manage to escape back to Earth through the closing Hell gateway. Tiffany is last seen walking away from the Channard Institute alongside Kirsty. === Trevor Gooden === Trevor Gooden is a character in the film Hellraiser: Hellseeker where he is portrayed by Dean Winters.

After his three mistresses and best friend, who had mentioned a plot to kill Kirsty and take her inheritance, wind up dead, Trevor is arrested when he is found with one of the bodies. Taken to the morgue in the bowels of the police department, Trevor is confronted by Pinhead, who restores Trevor's memories; Trevor had bought the Lament Configuration and planned to use it to kill Kirsty, though his plan backfired when Kirsty made a deal with Pinhead, offering five souls in exchange for her own. Trevor's mistresses and friend were the first four souls, with Trevor himself being the fifth, Kirsty having shot him in the head and sent him to his own personal Hell. == V  Vagrant === Vagrant is a character in the film Hellraiser: Revelations. == See also == * Cenobite == References == Category:Hellraiser characters Hellraiser ","title":"List of Hellraiser characters"},{"id":"20349016","text":"Johann Heinrich Gelzer (October 17, 1813 – August 15, 1889) was a Swiss historian and diplomat who was a native of Schaffhausen.

He has held the WBA interim middleweight title from 2012 to 2014, the British and Commonwealth middleweight titles between 2010 and 2012, and challenged four times for a world title. ==Professional careerEarly career=== Murray's professional debut came in September 2007 with a victory over Jamie Ambler at the Robin Park Arena in Wigan. He fought once more that year to finish 2007 with a record of 2-0. A busy 2008 saw Murray fight seven more times scoring seven victories over a series of journeyman opponents. On 22 November 2008, he stepped into the limelight by taking part in the fourth series of the Prizefighter tournament shown live on sky. He scored wins over Joe Rea and Danny Butler before beating former English title challenger Cello Renda in the final to claim the £25,000 first prize. Following the tournament victory Murray marked time with wins over fellow prospect Kevin Concepcion in April 2009 and former Commonwealth title challenger Thomas Awinbono in July of the same year. ===Ricky Hatton Promotions=== Murray left VIP Promotions after the Awinbono fight to sign with Hatton Promotions. His first fight was on the undercard of Matthew Macklin's European Title win at the Manchester Velodrome. Murray faced George Aduashvili of Georgia on 25 September 2009 and scored a first-round knockout victory. Following the win Murray said that former British champion Wayne Elcock was on his radar as a man he'd like to beat in order to push himself into future title contention. Murray's next fight on 27 November 2009 instead saw the man from St Helens outpoint Belarus boxer Sergey Khomitsky with a points victory over 8 rounds (Khomitsky was the first opponent, who managed to knock Murray down to the canvas for the first time in his pro career). In his first fight of 2010 Murray continued his winning run against international opposition with a victory over the Georgian middleweight champion Shalva Jomardashvili. A shot at the Commonwealth title against Tanzanian boxer Francis Cheka should then have subsequently followed. However, Cheka was refused a work permit and on 24 May 2010 in Sheffield, Murray instead defeated late replacement Lee Noble in another non-title fight en route to recording his 19th straight victory. Two years later, Murray gave Nick Blackwell the first loss of his career and won the vacant British Middleweight title on 18 July 2011. ===Commonwealth champion=== On 16 July 2010 Murray finally fought for a first professional title, the middleweight version of the Commonwealth crown. His opponent at the fight in the Bolton Arena was Australian Peter Mitrevski Jr. Murray went the full 12 round distance for the first time in his career and won on a unanimous points decision. Despite the win Murray claimed that he had felt \\"sluggish\\" throughout the fight adding that \\"I know I can perform much better\\". He followed up the win on 26 November 2010 with a fight for a second title in a row at the Bolton Arena. His opponent, Brazilian Carlos Nascimento, was the co-challenger for the WBA version of the inter-continental title with Murray winning by stoppage in the third round. Murray fought against Felix Sturm on 2 December 2011 at the SAP-Arena in Mannheim, Germany for the WBA Middleweight Title. The fight went 12 rounds and ended up being scored a controversial draw. ===Second world title attempt=== It was confirmed going into his with fight Jorge Navarro at Manchester Arena on 24 November 2012 for the interim WBA World Middleweight Championship, that if Murray were to defeat Navarro, he would be the next in line for a shot at the WBA World Middleweight Championship currently held by Gennady Golovkin. Murray, now 25-0-1, defeated the undefeated Venezuelan by TKO and would fight for the world title against World Middleweight Champion Sergio Gabriel Martínez in Argentina on 27 April 2013. Murray lost a close, controversial decision in a fight where he put Martinez on the canvas twice but with the referee only counting one knockdown. ===Third world title attempt=== Following four solid decision victories in the aftermath of his loss to Sergio Martínez, Murray was given the opportunity to face off against the WBA and IBO middleweight champion Gennady Golovkin. Despite a spirited effort (that of which saw him fight into the 11th round, the second time in Golovkin's career he went ten rounds or more), Murray was ultimately stopped for the first time in his career after referee Luis Pabon witnessed him take several hard unanswered shots from Golovkin. ==Professional boxing record== { style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\\" -

In his role as assistant secretary general at the United Nations, he led the international body's research on genetic engineering. ==Early life== Gunsalus was born June 29, 1912 in Sully County, South Dakota, at the homestead of his family farm. His father was killed in a threshing machine accident before Gunsalus started college. He attended South Dakota State University before transferring to Cornell University, where he studied bacteriology, earning a bachelor's degree in 1933, a master's in 1937 and was awarded a doctoral degree in the field in 1940. ==Academic career== Gunsalus taught bacteriology from 1940 to 1947 at Cornell University. There he studied issues of food safety and disease risk. From 1947 to 1950, he was a professor of bacteriology at Indiana University. Gunsalus was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1949 for his work on intermediary metabolism of microorganisms.Staff. \\"GUGGENHEIM FUND LISTS 144 AWARDS; Fellowships Totaling $395,000 Go to Scholars and Artists in the U.

In 1950, he took a faculty position as professor of microbiology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, shifting his speciality in 1955 to head the biochemistry department until 1966. While there, he co-authored The Bacteria: A Treatise on Structure and Function with Roger Y. Stanier, a five- volume work that served as a basic textbook for scientists entering the field. In the 1950s, while studying Enterococcus, a lactic acid bacteria found in the gastrointestinal tract, Gunsalus discovered various forms of lipoic acid, as well as pyridoxal phosphate, an active form of vitamin B6, and was granted a patent in 1962 on lipoic acid. In further research, he discovered the role that lipoic acid plays in metabolism, allowing for the more effective use of carbohydrates in the diet.Staff. \\"New Vitamin Found; Lipoic Acid Is Essential in Some Digestive Processes\\", The New York Times, March 15, 2953. Accessed November 22, 2008. By the 1970s, other researchers and hospitals had begun to use lipoic acid for the treatment of chronic liver disease. It has since been used experimentally to treat pancreatic cancer and its use as a dietary supplement to prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease has been proposed. During the 1960s and 1970s, Gunsalus studied Cytochrome P450, researching its role in metabolism in the human liver. His studies led to an understanding of how the family of P-450 proteins and their role in metabolizing natural and man-made compounds. He also researched the way that soil microbes exchange plasmids, giving the organisms the ability to adapt to differing nutritional substances available in their environment. Gunsalus was a postdoctoral advisor to Ananda Mohan Chakrabarty, who later used genetic engineering techniques for plasmid transfer to create microbes that could digest petroleum. In February 1967, Gunsalus was one of four scientists who delivered to President Lyndon B. Johnson a petition that had been signed by more than 5,000 scientists demanding an end to the use of biological and chemical weapons in Vietnam. The petition included 17 Nobel Prize-winners and 127 members of the National Academy of Sciences.Schmeck Jr., Harold M. \\"U.S. REVIEW URGED ON CHEMICAL WAR; 5,000 Scientists Petition Against Initiation of Use of Biological Weapons 5,000 Scientists Petition for Review of Chemical Warfare Policy\\", The New York Times, February 15, 1967.

He oversaw the establishment of research centers in Trieste, Italy and in New Delhi, India. He was later chosen to conduct ecological studies of the Gulf of Mexico for the United States Environmental Protection Agency from 1993 to 2003, where he studied methods for microbiological bioremediation of coastal ecosystems. Gunsalus was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Academy of Microbiology. He was also elected to the National Academy of Sciences, where he served as the chairman of the biochemistry section from 1978 to 1981.

He has played in 14 Briers, representing the Northwest Territories/Yukon team and three Briers representing just the Northwest Territories. At the 2012 Brier, he became the first skip from Canada's north to make the playoffs at the Brier since the addition of the playoffs in 1980. He is the younger brother of Alberta curler Kevin Koe and twin brother of Territories champion Kerry Galusha. ==CareerJunior career=== Koe played in five straight Canadian Junior Curling Championships, from 1994 to 1998. In 1994, he played third for his brother, Kevin, representing the Yukon/Northwest Territories team. The rink lost in the final to Alberta. In 1995, Kevin graduated from juniors, leaving Jamie to skip the team. He would skip the Territories to a 2-9 record at the 1995 Canadian Juniors. In 1996, each territory got their own team, and Koe would skip the Northwest Territories team. The rink finished the round robin with a 7-5 record, and would win one and lose one tiebreaker match. In 1997, Koe's Northwest Territories team finished the round robin in 2nd place at 8-4, but lost to Ontario's John Morris in the semifinal. In his final juniors, in 1998, Koe missed the playoffs, skipping the Northwest Territories to a 5-7 record. ===Men's career=== After juniors, Koe moved to Alberta for school, and would team up with his brother again. However, he would soon move back to his native Northwest Territories. Koe won his first Territories men's championship in 2006, sending him to his first Tim Hortons Brier. His 6-5 record at the 2006 Tim Hortons Brier was good enough for 5th place, the best finish for the Territories since 1975. Koe would represent the Territories again in 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. Koe got to play his brother for the first time at a Brier in 2010, when Kevin won the Alberta provincial championship for the first time. It was only the third time in Brier history where two brothers would compete against each other as skips. Koe's best performance at the Brier was at the 2012 Tim Hortons Brier, where he finished 7-4 in the round robin, securing the 4th place spot in the playoffs. However, he lost both his playoff matches, settling for fourth place. He lost to his brother Kevin's Alberta rink in the 3 vs. 4 game, and then lost to Manitoba's Rob Fowler in an extra end in the bronze medal game. Koe returned to the Brier in 2013 where he could not repeat his success, but still posted a decent 5-6 record. Beginning with the 2015 Tim Hortons Brier, each of Canada's three territories received separate entries into the Brier. Koe represented the Northwest Territories in that Brier, finishing in last place. This put the territory into the \\"relegation round\\" at the 2016 Tim Hortons Brier. Koe again represented the NWT at that Brier. He won the relegation round playoff, putting his team in the main event, where they finished with a 3-8 record. Koe would represent the Northwest Territories at the 2017 and 2018 Briers. Koe and his rink of Chris Schille, D. J. Kidby and spare Ryan Fry caused controversy at the 2018 Red Deer Curling Classic for unacceptable behaviour including being clearly intoxicated, using foul language, trashing the locker room and damaging other curler's property and fixtures in the locker room. The team was ejected from the tournament and banned from all future tournaments. Koe apologized for the team's actions despite not being involved in the incident; Curling team ejected for drunken behaviour in statements and witness reports afterwards, Koe revealed he was dealing with issues with alcohol abuse and in a statement said “I will be taking steps to ensure this never happens again.”. Koe had previously decided not to play in the final game: after attempting one practice slide, he determined he was too drunk to play.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/curling-bonspiel-alberta- drunken-1.4913429 Following the incident, Koe formed a brand new team to play in the Northwest Territories championship and 2019 Tim Hortons Brier with David Aho, Matt Ng and Cole Parsons. Representing the Northwest Territories at the Brier, Koe led his team to a 1–6 record.

In the gap between his election and the start of his term he married Doreen Hogan, with whom he had one son. In his maiden speech McHugh spoke of the need to achieve \\"practical Socialism by a sensible method of nationalisation\\". He argued for the re-introduction of first-past-the-post voting, which he regarded as a fairer system for Senate elections, and called for a referendum to reform or abolish the state upper houses. He was also a strong proponent of the development of the Northern Territory, but opposed the planned introduction of a freehold system of land ownership which he believed would primarily benefit wealthy land speculators. McHugh served on the Printing Committee and the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, and was also a member of the Royal Commission on the Navigation Act, which sat from 1923 to 1925 and issued two reports. He was popular within the Labor Party and in July 1926 was elected to the post of party whip. ===Death=== In July 1927, McHugh travelled to Tasmania with the Public Accounts Committee.

The contest was televised on ABC with a radio broadcast on ESPN Radio beginning at 4:30 PM US EST with kickoff at 5:10 PM. Ticket prices for all seats in the Rose Bowl were listed at $145. The Rose Bowl Game was a contractual sell-out, with 64,500 tickets allocated to the participating teams and conferences. The remaining tickets went to the Tournament of Roses members, sponsors, City of Pasadena residents, and the general public. Scoring 24 unanswered points in the second quarter, the Pacific-10 Conference Champion University of Southern California Trojans defeated the Big Ten Conference co-champion, the Pennsylvania State University Nittany Lions, 38-24, for their third consecutive Rose Bowl victory (in their fourth consecutive appearance, having lost the 2006 BCS title game to the Texas Longhorns). The victory gave the Trojans their 24th Rose Bowl championship, the most by any team in the country. Quarterback Mark Sanchez scored five touchdowns, one rushing and four passing. Prior to the game, the Pac-10 conference had a 4-0 record in bowl games this season with wins by Arizona, Cal, Oregon, and Oregon State.

In the 2005 Rose Bowl, Big Ten champion Michigan met Texas, as USC played Oklahoma in the designated BCS Championship Game that year, the Orange Bowl. The following year, USC met Texas in the game, which was designated as that year's BCS National Championship contest; Big Ten champion Penn State played in the Orange Bowl against Florida State. For the 2007 and 2008 games, the runners-up of the Big Ten were sent to this game, since the champion, Ohio State, participated in the newly established separate BCS Championship Game: the Wolverines played in 2007 and Illinois would do so the following year; both teams played (and lost to) the Trojans. Each team lost just one game during the 2008 regular season. Penn State was defeated by Iowa (24-23) and Southern California lost to Oregon State (27-21). USC and Penn State had faced two common opponents in the regular season. Both teams defeated Ohio State and Penn State beat Oregon State prior to the Beavers' defeat of the Trojans. Penn State had appeared in the Rose Bowl twice before, losing to the Trojans 14-3 in in their only previous meeting in \\"The Granddaddy Of Them All\\", and winning in over 1994 Pac-10 champion Oregon 38-20, the latter game capped an unbeaten season in which Penn State finished #2 in both major polls. The Trojans have played in the Rose Bowl more times than any other team and made its fourth consecutive appearance in 2009. The two teams have faced each other eight times, with each team winning four games. The Kickoff Classic XVIII on August 27, 2000, in Giants Stadium at East Rutherford, New Jersey, was the last time they met: the Trojans defeated the Nittany Lions, 29-5. ==Scoring summary== The Rose Bowl, several days before the 95th edition of the \\"Granddaddy of Them All\\". ===First quarter=== * USC — Williams, D. 27-yard pass from Sanchez, Mark (Buehler, David kick), PSU 0 - USC 7 * PSU — Clark, Daryll 9-yard run (Kelly, Kevin kick), PSU 7 - USC 7 ===Second quarter=== * USC — Sanchez, Mark 6-yard run (Buehler, David kick), PSU 7 - USC 14 * USC — Buehler, David 30-yard field goal, PSU 7 - USC 17 * USC — Johnson, Ronald 19-yard pass from Sanchez, Mark (Buehler, David kick), PSU 7 - USC 24 * USC — Gable, C.J. 20-yard pass from Sanchez, Mark (Buehler, David kick), PSU 7 - USC 31 ===Third quarter=== * No scoring ===Fourth quarter=== * PSU — Williams, D. 2-yard pass from Clark, Daryll (Kelly, Kevin kick), PSU 14 - USC 31 * USC — Johnson, Ronald 45-yard pass from Sanchez, Mark (Buehler, David kick), PSU 14 - USC 38 * PSU — Kelly, Kevin 25-yard field goal, PSU 17 - USC 38 * PSU — Norwood, Jordan 9-yard pass from Clark, Daryll (Kelly, Kevin kick), PSU 24 - USC 38 ==Game notes== * Mark Sanchez became the third quarterback to pass for more than 400 yards in a Rose Bowl Game, with 413 yards.

The ice has become like a monolithic tomb whose edges jut into the sky. The stern of the wreck is just visible on the right. As an inscription on it confirms, this is HMS Griper, one of two ships that took part in William Edward Parry's 1819–1820 and 1824 expeditions to the North Pole. ==Title== The two titles originally referred to the present work and another older work by Friedrich, now missing. The lost painting was shown in 1822 at the Dresden Academy exhibition under the title A Wrecked Ship off the Coast of Greenland in the Moonlight. Own Invention.\\"Ein gescheitertes Schiff auf Grönlands Küste im Wonne-Mond. Eigene Erfindung\\" The present painting was first shown in 1824 at the Prague Academy exhibition under the title An Idealized Scene of an Arctic Sea, with a Wrecked Ship on the Heaped Masses of Ice.\\"Ideale Szene eines arktischen Meeres, ein gescheitertes Schiff auf den aufgetürmten Eismassen\\" In Friedrich's estate this work was described as Ice Picture. The Disaster-stricken North Pole Expedition.\\"Eisbild. Die verunglückte Nordpolexpedition \\" ==History== The collector Johann Gottlob von Quandt commissioned two pictures that were to symbolize the south and the north. Johann Martin von Rohden received the commission to paint Southern Nature in her Abundant and Majestic Splendor,\\"Die südliche Natur in ihrer üppigen und majestätischen Pracht\\" while the commission for Northern Nature in the whole of her Terrifying Beauty\\"Natur des Nordens in der ganzen Schönheit ihrer Schrecken\\" fell to Friedrich. However, as Schukowski in a letter dated 1821 reported, Friedrich – Accounts of expeditions to the North Pole were occasionally published during those years which is likely how Friedrich became familiar with William Edward Parry's 1819–1820 expedition to find the Northwest Passage. In the winter of 1820–21, Friedrich made extensive oil studies of ice floes on the river Elbe, near Dresden. These were probably incorporated into The Sea of Ice. The image created a lasting impression on the French sculptor David d'Angers during his visit to Dresden in 1834, which he described as follows: Overall, however, the work was seen as too radical in composition, and went unsold until after Friedrich's death in 1840. ==Influence== From the twentieth century the work has proved influential upon the arctic landscapes of Lawren Harris,Larisey, Peter: \\"Light for a Cold Land: Lawren Harris's Life and Work\\". Dundurn, 1993. 14. and it directly influenced Paul Nash's painting Totes Meer.Causey, Andrew. Paul Nash. New York : Oxford University Press, 1980 The painting has been hailed by critic Russell Potter as a key instance of the \\"Arctic Sublime\\", and an influence on later nineteenth-century polar paintings.Potter, Russell A. Arctic Spectacles: The Frozen North in Visual Culture, 1818–1875 (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2007), pp. 57–59 Architect Thom Mayne references The Sea of Ice as a primary influence as to how he approaches the dynamic relationship between architecture, landscape, and nature. It possibly served as an inspiration for the Sydney Opera House.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-31/larsen-sydney-opera-house/5060118 She Lies with the Oslo Opera House in background in 2010. The outdoor, free- floating sculpture \\"She Lies\\" by Monica Bonvicini is a three-dimensional interpretation of the original Friedrich's painting installed in the Oslo fjord next to the Oslo Opera House. The sculpture opened in May 2010 and has become one of the tourist attractions in downtown Oslo. ==NotesReferences== *Schmied, Wieland (1992). Caspar David Friedrich. Cologne: DuMont.

Lustig has been honored by the American Institute of Graphic Arts and the Art Directors Club Hall of Fame for his significant contributions to American design. ==Biography== He was born on February 8, 1915 to Harry Lustig and Jeanette Schamus in Denver, Colorado. Lustig studied design at Los Angeles City College, Art Center College of Design, and independently with architect Frank Lloyd Wright at his Taliesin studio and French painter Jean Charlot. He began his career designing book jackets in 1937 in Los Angeles, California. In 1944 he became Director of Visual Research for Look Magazine. He also designed for Fortune, and Girl Scouts of the United States. In addition to his many contributions to graphic design, Lustig was an accomplished interior and architectural designer. In 1949, he designed what has become known as the \\"Lustig Chair\\" for Paramount Furniture in Beverly Hills, CA. His original design continues to inspire modern interiors and replications of the chair are still in production. Lustig's interior design work also influenced younger designers like Paul Tuttle. Josef Albers invited him to teach at Black Mountain College in 1945, and at Yale in 1951. ===New Directions=== Lustig maintained a successful professional relationship with New Directions Publishing for almost a decade, producing some of his most iconic and innovative work for the independent publishing company. He designed more than seventy dust jackets for the New Classics literary series from 1945 until his death in 1955. His abstract designs incorporated a modern design sensibility with a groundbreaking approach to typeface design and the unconventional dust jacket became a hallmark of New Directions publications. His artwork was featured on the covers of classic works of modernist literature, including the works of James Joyce, Gertrude Stein, William Carlos Williams, and Ezra Pound. Several Tennessee Williams plays were published by New Directions during this period and Lustig's art was included on the first edition covers of these works, including A Streetcar Named Desire and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. ===Death=== Lustig developed diabetes as a teenager. As a result of diabetes by 1954 he was virtually blind. He developed Kimmelstiel-Wilson syndrome, an incurable kidney disease connected to diabetes. Lustig died at the age of 40 of diabetes-related complications on December 4, 1955. Elaine Lustig Cohen, Lustig's wife and fellow graphic designer, took over his New York City design firm after his death on December 5, 1955. She was awarded an AIGA Medal in 2011 for her contributions to American graphic design. ==Legacy== Lustig was inducted into the Art Directors Club Hall of Fame in 1986. In 1993, the American Institute of Graphic Arts awarded Lustig a posthumous AIGA Medal. AIGA awards designers whose work has had \\"significant impact on the practice of graphic design in the United States.\\" In 2013, New Directions announced that they will be reissuing a selection of their classic titles with the original Lustig cover designs. In May 2013, New Directions will begin selling a series of postcards and other stationery featuring the artwork of Alvin Lustig. The collective works of Alvin Lustig and Elaine Lustig Cohen were showcased in a special exhibit at the AIGA National Design Center in New York City from December 2010 to February 2013. The exhibit, titled The Lustigs: A Cover Story, was the first to show the work of Alvin and Elaine Lustig together in the same collection. ==References * The Alvin Lustig Archive * The Alvin Lustig Collection, Rochester Institute of Technology * AIGA  Alvin Lustig * The Architecture and Interiors of Alvin Lustig Category:AIGA medalists Category:American graphic designers Category:Book designers Category:Blind people from the United States Category:People from Denver Category:Artists from New York City Category:1915 births Category:1955 deaths ","title":"Alvin Lustig"},{"id":"20349681","text":"Brad Drake (born February 7, 1975) is a Republican politician who currently serves as a member of the Florida House of Representatives, representing the 5th District, which includes Holmes County, Jackson County, Walton County, Washington County, and northern Bay County, since 2014. He previously represented the 5th District from 2008 to 2012. ==History== Drake was born in Fort Walton Beach into a political family, which included his grandfather, J. Troy Peacock, who served as a State Representative; his father, David Earl Drake, who served as Superintendent of Walton County Public Schools; and his cousin, Pat Thomas, who served as the President of the Florida Senate. He attended the University of Florida, graduating with a degree in economics, and after graduation, worked for State Representative Don Brown as a legislative aide. ==Florida House of Representatives== In 2008, following the inability of Brown to seek re-election due to term limits, Drake ran to succeed him in the 5th District, which was based in Holmes County, northern Jackson County, Okaloosa County, Walton County, and Washington County. He faced Okaloosa County Commissioner Sherry Campbell in the Republican primary, whom he was able to handily defeat, winning 70% of the vote to Campbell's 30%. Advancing to the general election, Drake faced John McDaniel, the Democratic nominee and the Sheriff of Jackson County for nearly thirty years. Despite the district's strong conservative lean, McDaniel was heralded by the Florida Democratic Party as a top-tier candidate in the area. However, the district stayed true to its lean, and Drake won his first term in the legislature in a landslide, receiving 60% of the vote to McDaniel's 40%. Running for re-election in 2010, Drake faced neither opposition in the primary election nor in the general election, and won his second term entirely uncontested. During his second term in the legislature, Drake introduced legislation that would reform capital punishment in the state by replacing lethal injection with the electric chair or firing squad. He argued, \\"We still have Old Sparky. And if that doesn't suit the criminal, then we will provide them with a .45 caliber lead cocktail instead.\\" He also observed that, in his view, whether the execution is considered to be \\"humane\\" should not be considered, noting, \\"I am sick and tired of this sensitivity movement for criminals. Every time there is a warranted execution that is about to take place, some man or woman is standing on a corner holding a sign, yelling and screaming for humane treatment. I am so tired of being humane to inhumane people.\\" When the state's legislative districts were redrawn in 2012, Drake was moved into the same district as fellow State Representative Marti Coley, who was running for her final term in the legislature. Rather than challenge Coley in the primary, Drake opted to not seek re-election, and decided to run to succeed Coley in the revamped 5th District, which includes northern Bay County, Jackson County, Holmes County, Walton County, and Washington County, in 2014. He faced realtor Jan Hooks in the Republican primary, whom he defeated handily, winning 73% of the vote. In the general election, Drake faced Karen Schoen, the Libertarian nominee, and won election to the legislature once again with 76% of the vote. ==References *Florida House of Representatives - Brad Drake Category:Florida Republicans Category:Members of the Florida House of Representatives Category:1975 births Category:University of Florida alumni Category:Living people Category:Northwest Florida State College alumni Category:People from Fort Walton Beach, Florida Category:21st-century American politicians ","title":"Brad Drake"},{"id":"20349697","text":"Kiara Kabukuru (born Alice Kabukuru, July 31, 1975) is a Ugandan-born American fashion model.

Williams (1782-1864) married Caroline Barney, daughter of Joshua Barney, who in turn expanded an existing mill site on the property to create the Savage Mill. It has three sections: the original -story brick house built by Charles Greenberry Ridgley Sr. about 1760, a 2-story frame addition built in 1941, and a one-story frame addition to the west, built in 1946. The interior of the house was altered during the 1940s when it was used as a boys' school, and about 1960 when it was converted into apartments. Its significance is tied to Commodore Joshua Barney, who was a hero of the American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, and who lived in the house until his death in 1818. The house is situated near the Ridgley family cemetery. It was operated as a bed and breakfast inn starting in 2000, until being placed on the market for $1.2 million in 2012. The house never sold, and had been vacant and neglected until 2017. The house is currently an occupied private residence.

She is a former member of the Florida House of Representatives, in which she represented the 9th District, which includes most of Leon County, from 2008 to 2016. In addition to her legislative career, Rehwinkel Vasilinda is an attorney and has been a professor of Legal Studies and Applied Ethics at Tallahassee Community College since 1989. ==Early life, education, and personal life== Rehwinkel Vasilinda was born in Rochester, New York and moved to Florida in 1977 to attend New College, where she studied from 1977 to 1982, before graduating from the University of South Florida in 1982 with a degree in social and behavioral studies. Following this, she attended the University of Florida College of Law, graduating with her Juris Doctor in 1985, and has been a member of the Florida Bar since 1986. As a member of The Florida Bar, she was appointed to the Vision 2016 Commission. She is the mother of two adult daughters and three adult stepsons and is married to Mike Vasilinda. ==Other activities== From 1986 to 1989 she was an assistant general counsel at the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation.LinkedIn Profile From 1998 to 2008 she was a consultant to Mike Vasilinda Productions. ==Political campaigns== In 2008, Rehwinkel Vasilinda was elected to represent the 9th District, which included parts of Gadsden County, Jefferson County, and Leon County. She won the Democratic primary unopposed, and faced Peter Boulware, the Republican nominee and a former football player for the Florida State Seminoles and the Baltimore Ravens. Despite the district's Democratic lean, Boulware was competitive with Rehwinkel Vasilinda, and managed to significantly outraise her. In the end, she emerged narrowly victorious, winning by 430 votes and with 49% of the vote. She was challenged in the Democratic primary in 2010 by Rick Minor, the former Chairman of the Leon County Democratic Party. Minor attacked her for voting in favor of offshore oil drilling, a vote that she contended was part of \\"a much larger energy package,\\" declaring that she \\"never promoted, supported or defended offshore drilling.\\" She was also attacked for being \\"a liability,\\" as in 2008, she \\"barely won in a district that Barack Obama took by 24 points.\\" Despite these spirited attacks, however, Rehwinkel Vasilinda easily defeated Minor, winning 69% of the vote. In the general election, she faced Kirk Headley-Purdue, who did not present much of a challenge to her, and she comfortably won with 59% of the vote. When districts were redrawn in 2012, Rehwinkel Vasilinda remained in the 9th District, which became solely located in Leon County. She faced Bradley L. Maxwell, the Republican nominee who had previously run against former State Representative Curtis Richardson in 2000, as her general election opponent. The Tallahassee Democrat endorsed her for re-election, citing her efforts to protect government jobs in the district, specifically praising her for fighting \\"to save the jobs of workers at the Jefferson Correctional Institution, which was slated for closure.\\" In the end, she was re-elected overwhelmingly, winning 62% of the vote. In 2014, when Rehwinkel Vasilinda ran for her fourth and final term in the legislature, she was opposed by Arnitta Grice-Walker in the Democratic primary. Due to the fact that no other candidates filed, the primary was opened to all voters. During the campaign, Grice-Walker declined to criticize Rehwinkel Vasilinda's service in the legislature, instead running on her plans to reform the state's public employee pension plan and to raise the minimum wage. Rehwinkel Vasilinda campaigned on her support for alternative energy and her opposition to the death penalty, noting, \\"We're not doing what we should be doing in regard to renewable energy. We are at a point where it shouldn't be alternative, it should be pro forma.\\" In the end, Rehwinkel Vasilinda defeated Grice-Walker in a landslide, winning 82% of the vote. In September 2016, with less than two months until the end of her final House term, Rehwinkel Vasilinda changed her party registration from Democratic to No Party Affiliation. The change made her the only Florida legislator not registered with either major party. In February 2017, she officially registered with the Republican Party.

After initial study of literature at a religious private school in Florence, he began his artistic training under Carlo Markò the Elder. He met Vito D'Ancona during the mid-1840s, and joined him in painting landscapes en plein air. In 1848 he fought as a Tuscan volunteer for Garibaldi in the Risorgimento. In 1855 his paintings, exhibited at the Florentine Promotrice exhibition, brought him to the attention of the artists who frequented the Caffè Michelangiolo in Florence (including those who would later become known as the Macchiaioli). In that same year he traveled to Paris, where he was greatly impressed by the paintings of the Barbizon school. He saw in their realism and powerful chiaroscuro a means of renewing art in the modern age. Upon his return to Florence he conveyed this new enthusiasm to his friends, who quickly adopted his ideas. In recognition of the influence he had on his fellow Florentine artists, Telemaco Signorini called him \\"the father of the macchia\\".Steingräber, E., & Matteucci, G. 1984, p. 112. De Tivoli made additional visits to Paris, and in 1863 he exhibited in the Salon des Refusés. In 1873 he moved to Paris, where he met such artists as Tissot and Pissarro, and became a friend of Degas. He returned to Florence in 1890, where he lived in relative isolation until his death in 1892. ==NotesReferences== *Broude, Norma (1987). The Macchiaioli: Italian Painters of the Nineteenth Century.

It was organised separately from the unarmed Civic Guard police force. The unit was formed shortly after the truce with the British (11 July 1921) and disbanded in October 1923. ==Formation== The CID was created by Michael Collins and many of its personnel were former Irish Republican Army fighters whom he had commanded during the Irish War of Independence. In particular, a number came from the Squad, a Dublin-based IRA assassination unit under Collins' command. The unit had close links with the Army Intelligence and with a smaller \\"Protective Corps\\" which was based in the same building, Oriel House on Westland Row, Dublin. Initially, they were put under the command of Liam Tobin. On 31 July 1922, it was taken out of the control of military intelligence and put under the brief of TD Joseph McGrath. Its commanding officer was Captain Pat Moynihan. Moynihan was given temporary transfer from his post as Head of Military Intelligence and with the rank of Captain took over Oriel House for this new force. On 22 August 1922 (the same day as Collins' death in an ambush) the Criminal Investigation Department was officially formed to \\"be distinct from existing police forces with separate headquarters under direct control of the Minister for Home Affairs.\\" It was formed from members of the National Army and the Irish Republican Police and was based at Oriel House. It consisted of over 100 heavily armed men and three women detectives who were \\"cloaked\\" as typists and \\"engaged in special duties connected with the detection of women engaged in hostilities against the Government.\\" The unit later reached a peak strength of 350 in February 1923. Moynihan selected Peter Ennis as \\"Chief Superintendent\\". Ennis had been the commanding officer of the Irish Republican Police in Dublin during the 1919–1921 war, and was a brother of General Tom Ennis of the Free State's National Army. Ennis brought with him about fifteen of his old Republican Police to Oriel House and they formed the nucleus of the new \\"CID\\". Initially it was to have been a military structure, but the \\"privates\\" of 1922 ended up as \\"detective officers\\" by its disbandment in 1923. Broy, Nelligan and MacNamara, of the DMP \\"G\\" Branch were there in the beginning, but all got high ranks in the National Army Intelligence Department and went instead to Wellington Barracks where their HQ was locatedAn t-Oglach, Free State Army Gazette, August 1922 == During the Civil War == During the conflict of 1922–1923, the CID was responsible for the arrest of over 500 Anti-Treaty IRA fighters as well as the seizure of much weaponry and documentation. It had files on over 2,500 republican suspects. It was also accused of using brutal interrogation techniques and of the assassination of republican suspects and prisoners. Among a large number of incidents in which the CID was implicated was the killing of five republicans in two separate incidents on 26 and 29 August 1922 and the dumping of the bodies in Drumcondra and Clondalkin suburbs. By 9 September, British Intelligence had reported that CID was believed to have, \\"killed a number of prominent republicans\\" in Dublin. There were many other such killings of Anti-Treaty activists by plain-clothed men in the Dublin area during the war, such as Bobby Bondfield in March 1923 and Noel Lemass in July of that year. Senior republican Thomas Derrig also had an eye shot out while in CID custody. It is possible, however that some of these killings were carried out by other agencies such as elements of the National Army, or by soldiers and CID men, but popularly attributed to \\"Oriel House\\". In his book \\"Salute to the men of '22\\", Brian O'Higgins documented at least twenty-five murders of Republicans in the Dublin area alone. In the conflict as whole, as many as 153 republican prisoners were summarily executed in the field.Todd Andrews, Dublin Made Me, p. 269 (See also: executions during the Irish Civil War.) A study of the period concluded, \\"Oriel House succeeded in its task of suppressing small scale republican activities in the Dublin area, not by the sophistication and efficiency of its intelligence work ... but by the more direct method of striking terror into its opponents.\\"Eunan O'Halpin, Defending Ireland: The Irish State and its Enemies, The State and Civil War, p. 11 A total of four CID personnel were killed in the war. A number of attempts were also made to blow up Oriel House itself. ==Disbandment== On 29 October 1923 the Oriel House CID was disbanded and 30 of its members were transferred to the Dublin Metropolitan Police as detectives. They later formed the basis of the Garda Special Branch. The CID as a whole was considered unsuitable for a police force in peacetime. In April 1925 the DMP was amalgamated with the Garda Síochána. ==See also== * Garda Special Detective Unit (SDU) ==References * Issues affecting Irish policing, 1922–1932 Category:Defunct law enforcement agencies of Ireland Category:Irish Civil War Category:Non-military counter-insurgency organizations ","title":"Criminal Investigation Department (Ireland)"},{"id":"20350024","text":"Brian Hall (16 September 1929 - 27 February 1989) was an English first-class cricketer, who played a single first-class match for Yorkshire, against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's, in the early part of the 1952 season.

It is found in the Mediterranean Sea and the eastern Atlantic Ocean from the Bay of Biscay to Angola, and is a benthic fish typically encountered over soft substrates in fairly shallow, coastal waters. Growing to long, this species has a nearly circular pectoral fin disc and a short, thick tail with two dorsal fins of nearly equal size and a large caudal fin. It can be identified by the prominent blue spots on its back, which usually number five but may vary from zero to nine, as well as by the small knobs on the rims of its spiracles. For attack and defense, the common torpedo can deliver a strong electric shock of up to 200 volts. It is a solitary, nocturnal ambush predator that feeds mainly on bony fishes and crustaceans. This species is aplacental viviparous, with the developing embryos nourished by yolk and histotroph (\\"uterine milk\\") produced by the mother. Females produce litters of up to 28 young every year in late summer or autumn, after a gestation period of 4–8 months; the specifics vary between geographical regions. The common torpedo's shock is painful but otherwise of little danger to humans. Its electrogenic properties led it to be used in medicine by the ancient Greeks and Romans. In modern times, it has no economic value and is mostly discarded when caught as bycatch in fisheries. The impact of fishing on its population is uncertain, and pending more data the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Data Deficient. ==Taxonomy== The common torpedo and other electric rays were familiar to the peoples of classical antiquity. Torpedo was the Roman name for electric rays, derived from Latin torpere meaning \\"to be numb\\". Carl Linnaeus, known as the \\"father of taxonomy\\", scientifically described the common torpedo as Raja torpedo in the 1758 tenth edition of his Systema Naturae. However, the common torpedo also appeared in at least 52 pre-Linnaean sources under various names such as Torpedo, Raja tota lævis, Torpedo maculosa, and Torpedo Sinûs Persici. These early accounts, including Linnaeus's, confounded the common torpedo with other electric ray species. As Linnaeus did not indicate any type specimens, the designation of a lectotype or neotype is warranted in the interest of taxonomic stability. This measure has yet to be taken. André Marie Constant Duméril was the first author to refer to Torpedo as a genus, in his 1806 Zoologie analytique, ou méthode naturelle de classification des animaux. Duméril did not name any Torpedo species; the first author to do so was probably Charles Lucien Bonaparte, who assigned Linnaeus's Raja torpedo to the genus Torpedo in 1838. Since at the time T. torpedo was the only member of the genus, it became the type species. Within the genus Torpedo, the common torpedo is placed within the subgenus Torpedo, which differs from the other subgenus Tetronarce in having spiracles with papillate rims and ornate dorsal coloration. This species may also be referred colloquially to as crampfish, cramp ray, or torpedo ray. ==Distribution and habitat== Native to the eastern Atlantic Ocean, the common torpedo occurs from the Bay of Biscay to Angola, including all around the Mediterranean Sea. A single record from Belgian waters was most likely erroneous. In European waters, it is encountered less frequently than other electric ray species. This species prefers warmer temperatures. It is rare north of the Mediterranean, and within the Mediterranean it is more common off North Africa than off southern Europe. The common torpedo is a bottom-dweller usually found close to shore at depths of , though it has occasionally been reported from as deep as . It inhabits soft-bottomed habitats such as sandy flats and seagrass beds. ==Description== The common torpedo usually has five blue spots on its back, which distinguishes it from other electric rays. The pectoral fin disc of the common torpedo is almost circular in shape and about 1.3–1.4 times wider than long. The front margin of the disc is nearly straight. The two large, kidney-shaped electric organs are visible beneath the skin on either side of the head. The eyes are small and followed by spiracles of comparable size. The lateral and posterior rims of the spiracles bear small, low knobs, which diminish in size with age and may be indiscernible in larger individuals. On the \\"nape\\" behind the spiracles, there is a pair of prominent mucous pores. There is a wide, quadrangular flap of skin between the nostrils that almost reaches the mouth. The teeth are small and arranged in a dense quincunx pattern; each tooth has a single sharp cusp. There are around 22–24 and 20–22 tooth rows in the upper and lower jaws respectively. The five pairs of gill slits are placed on the underside of the disc. The pelvic fins are distinct from the disc and have rounded outer margins. The short and thick tail bears skin folds along either side and two dorsal fins on top. The first dorsal fin is slightly larger than the second. The well-developed caudal fin is triangular with blunt corners, and is approximately as long as the space between it and first dorsal fin. The skin is smooth and soft, entirely lacking dermal denticles. The dorsal coloration of the common torpedo is light to dark brown, with distinctive large spots (\\"ocellae\\") on the disc; each ocellus is blue and encircled by darker and lighter rings. Typically there are five ocellae arranged symmetrically in a row of three and another of two; rays with 0–4 ocellae are less common, and those with more than five are rarer still. An unusual male with eight ocellae was caught off Tunisia, and another with nine off southern France. When present, the sixth ocellus is similarly sized to the first five and positioned at their center; any additional ocellae tend to be smaller than the first six and placed asymmetrically towards the snout. The underside is cream-colored, with dark disc margins. An adult albino female was captured off Tunisia. Males and females typically measure long respectively; the largest individual on record was long. Rays from off West Africa grow larger than those from the Mediterranean. ==Biology and ecology== The common torpedo is an ambush predator that lies in wait for prey on the sea bottom. Drawing collected by Felix Platter, anonymous, 1546–1558 As with other members of its family, the common torpedo can subdue prey and deter threats with strong electric shocks generated from a pair of large electric organs. Derived from muscle tissue, each organ is made up of 400–500 columns, each column constituting a stack of around 400 jelly-filled disks (\\"electroplaques\\"). The columns together essentially act as batteries connected in parallel. The discharge of the electric organs can reach 200 volts, and may occur singly or in bursts (\\"trains\\"). Experiments in vitro have found that the nerves innervating the electric organ essentially stop functioning at temperatures below . Winter water temperatures regularly drop below this threshold in the wild, suggesting the ray may not use its electric organs for part of the year, or has a yet-unknown physiological mechanism to adapt electric organ function to colder conditions. Solitary and nocturnal, the common torpedo spends much time resting on the sea floor, often buried in sediment. It is an ambush predator that pounces onto prey and stuns them with electricity, the process taking only a fraction of a second. Once the prey is immobilized, it is manipulated to the mouth with motions of the disc, and swallowed whole. Adults feed almost entirely on small benthic bony fishes, including soles, herring, mullet, gobies, goatfishes, porgies, dragonets, and jack mackerels. Large decapod crustaceans are a minor secondary food source, while very rarely skates may be consumed. Juveniles are less exclusively piscivorous than the adults and feed on a variety of invertebrates as well. The most significant prey species differ between seasons and geographic regions. For example, in the Tyrrhenian Sea, juvenile common sole (Solea solea) are by far the most important prey item in autumn and winter, but in spring and summer they become less available and other fishes figure more prominently in the ray's diet. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworm Phyllobothrium lactuca, and the monogeneans Amphibdella paronaperugiae and Amphibdelloides benhassinae. ===Life history=== The common torpedo is aplacental viviparous, in which the embryos are sustained by yolk, supplemented by histotroph (\\"uterine milk\\") secreted by the mother. However, the organic content of the histotroph in this species is only 1.2%, much lower than in stingrays, and the embryo loses mass over the course of development as its initial yolk supply is expended for metabolic processes. Adult females have two functional ovaries and two functional uteruses, though the reproductive tract on the right side is more developed and consequently tends to carry more embryos. It has an annual reproductive cycle with well-defined seasonality, though the details differ between geographic regions. In the Mediterranean, mating occurs from December to February and birthing from late August to early September after a gestation period of 4–6 months; litter sizes range up to 19 and the newborns measure long. By contrast, off West Africa the gestation period lasts 6–8 months and birthing occurs from September to October; litter sizes range up to 28 and the newborns measure long. The litter size increases with female size. Sexual segregation occurs during the breeding season as pregnant females move into shallow coastal waters. The common torpedo is unusual among sharks and rays in that birthing has been documented both at higher and at lower salinities than seawater, in estuaries and lagoons. Immediately after birth, this species is capable of producing electric shocks of up to four volts. Newborns grow rapidly, with a commensurate increase in electrogenic capacity: after four months, they almost double in weight and can generate 26 volts. Males and females mature sexually at similar lengths: respectively in the Tyrrhenian Sea, respectively off Egypt, for both off Tunisia, and respectively off Senegal. ==Human interactions== The electric shock of the common torpedo can be severe, but is not life-threatening. In classical antiquity, the electrogenic properties of this species led it (and other strongly electric fishes) to be used in medicine for the treatment of pain and diseases such as gout. For example, the Roman physician Scribonius Largus, in his Compositiones medicae (c. 50 AD), recommended that chronic headaches be treated by the application of a live torpedo to the affected area. The common torpedo is edible, but is little-valued by commercial or artisanal fisheries and is mostly discarded when caught. Because of its shallow-water habits, it may survive being captured and discarded relatively well. It is susceptible to several types of demersal fishing gear, including bottom trawls and trammel nets; fishing activity is heavy within its range but no specific data regarding this species are available. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Data Deficient. The common torpedo has been kept in aquariums, but requires live fish for food. ==References *Torpedo torpedo, Common torpedo at FishBase *Torpedo torpedo (Ocellate Torpedo, Common Torpedo) at IUCN Red List common torpedo Category:Fish of the East Atlantic Category:Fish of the Mediterranean Sea Category:Strongly electric fish common torpedo Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Common torpedo"},{"id":"20350066","text":"The World of Comedy Film Festival is an annual film festival held in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

He was an influential designer, educator, and theorist in Germany and the United States. He arrived in the United States in 1939 after fleeing Nazism in Germany. In the U.S., he worked for Fortune Magazine and as an educator at Pratt Institute and the Parsons School of Design. He designed many exhibits for companies, such as Eastman Kodak, IBM, the Smithsonian, Mead Paper, Union Carbide, Herman Miller Furniture, and United States Information Agency. He received many awards and recognition for his work including a gold medal from AIGA. Many of his exhibits were reviewed in major consumer magazines, such as Newsweek and Life Magazine. He was inducted into the Art Directors Club Hall of Fame in 1974. Will Burtin died on January 18, 1972, in Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. Burtin's cause of death was mesothelioma, cancer caused by exposure to asbestos. ==Early life in Germany== Will Burtin was born in Cologne, Germany, to August and Gertrud Bürtin on January 27, 1908. Burtin's education was interrupted early during World War I when German armies took over his elementary school for cavalry barracks. Burtin also never graduated high school; instead, Burtin started studying topography at Handwerkskammer Köln. After graduation, Burtin studied graphic and industrial design at the Kölner Werkschulen (Cologne Academy of Fine and Applied Arts) in 1926. During his time studying topography and art, Burtin interned at the typesetting studio of Dr. Philippe Knöll. He worked for Knöll on exhibitions at GeSoLei in Düsseldorf. In 1927, Burtin opened his own design studio in Cologne, in which he created booklets, posters, type books, exhibitions, displays, advertising, and movies for German, French, and other clients. He had this studio from 1927 to 1938. In 1930, Burtin started teaching in Berlin, where he met art student Hilde Munk. Burtin and Munk were married in 1932 and Munk became partner in her husband's design studio, Entwurfe Bürtin, (Designs by Burtin). During the war, the Nazi Party was determined to win over the public opinion, which brought Will Burtin name to the party's attention, hoping that he would accept the position of Art Director and supervise creation of propaganda designs. Nazi officials began asking Burtin to work for their cause, while also trying to persuade him to divorce his Jewish wife. Burtin was able to decline early Nazi attempts to hire him. Burtin always claimed that his work schedule was already too hectic to take on another responsibility. However, in 1937, Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels made an official request for Burtin to become the Ministry's Director of Design. Burtin cited his backlog of private clients in order to buy time. Burtin's wife Hilde took advantage of this to write an urgent letter to her cousin, Max Munk, in Maryland. She asked him to sponsor the couple's immigration into the United States. Munk responded to Hilde's request by sending an affidavit. The affidavit, dated November 15, 1937, allowed Will and Hilde Burtin to get a U.S. visa. Meanwhile, back in Germany, Burtin was called to Berlin again, this time to meet Adolf Hitler in person. Burtin tried disqualifying himself from working in the Nazi Party by mentioning that his wife Hilde was Jewish. Unfortunately for Burtin, Hitler replied that his wife was not an issue and his first assignment would be to create an exhibit foretelling the impacts of Nazi culture. Again trying to buy time, Burtin asked for a short vacation to think it over. He was honoured, he replied, to be considered for this high-ranking post but he needed this vacation to be well rested prior to taking up his duties for the Nazi Party. Will and Hilde Burtin had already decided under no circumstances would they work for the Nazi Party. They were able to book passage on the Rotterdam and flee to New York City, leaving behind their personal belongings, taking only overnight bags to deceive border guards, and a sample sheet of the typeface Firmin Didot. ==Career in the United States== After arriving in the United States from Germany, the Burtins settled in New York City. Will Burtin was hired for his first job with Munk Aeronautical Laboratory, which was Hilde's cousin's Max Munk's laboratory. After working with Munk Aeronautical Laboratory, Burtin received a contract with the United States Federal Works Agency, in which he had to create one major exhibit that represented the achievements of five departments in the Federal Works Agency. The FWA required the exhibit to travel, meaning for it to be more than one-dimensional. The FWA taught Burtin how to create these types of designs in order for him to properly have this concept depicted in the exhibit. This is where Burtin first learned how to create three-dimensional designs; this technique helped him created many of his designs to come. In 1939, Burtin began teaching communication and advanced design at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, NY and later was named chairman of the Department of Visual Communication in 1959. In 1943, Will Burtin was drafted into the United States Army and assigned to the Office of Strategic Services. Burtin was assigned to create gun manuals for the U.S. Air Force and Army Air Force. The manual was called Gunner's Information File: Flexible Gunnery. These gun manuals were being designed for the young soldiers in training. These manual were considered extremely important because they displayed vital information for trainees on how to handle their new firearm. Burtin, very concerned with the safety of the gunman, took this project very seriously. According to RIT's biography on Burtin, Will stated a gunman \\"was engaged in serious business in which his life might depend on the swift functioning of his knowledge and equipment\\". Because many of these soldiers drafted were uneducated and some illiterate, this manual had to be clear, precise, and easy to understand. As World War II was ending, Burtin was recruited by the publisher of Fortune Magazine, straight from the Army. According to the publisher, it was in the \\"nation's interest\\" to let Burtin leave the army early to work for the magazine. He was recruited for the position of the Art Director, in which he remained from 1945 to 1949. Fortune did allow Burtin to do freelance work on the side which led to his partnership with the Upjohn Company and many others, such as Eastman Kodak, IBM, the Smithsonian, Mead Paper, Union Carbide, Herman Miller Furniture, and United States Information Agency. He was the designer and consultant on many of these clients' projects. Burtin conducted his freelance work through his design studio he opened up with Hilda in New York City, named Will Burtin, Inc., in 1949. Burtin also taught advertising art briefly as a visiting instructor at Black Mountain College in 1946, part of staff roster that also included Josef and Anni Albers, Jacob and Gwendolyn Knight Lawrence, Leo Lionni, Leo Amino, Jean Varda, and others. In 1950, Burtin also started working at the Parsons School of Design, leading AIGA to name him a director with in the Institute. === United States Information Agency, 1958 === Through his contacts with the OSS, Burtin was able to obtain USIA as a regular client. The most successful exhibits made for USIA was \\"Kalamazoo…and how it grew!\\" Kalamazoo was selected by USIA to represent everyday life in an average American city, to be displayed to Europe. Burtin used personal thoughts and perspectives of the average citizen from Kalamazoo in this exhibit. This exhibit was so successful many different versions were created to be displayed in different European countries, such as England and Germany. === Eastman Kodak, 1960–1962 === In 1962, Burtin was able to gain Eastman Kodak as another major client. Burtin's work with Eastman Kodak included new construction techniques and a unique roof design. The goal was to create the illusion that Kodak's roof was a sea of clouds adults and children could walk on. These new techniques and designs brought considerable attention to Burtin's Eastman Kodak Pavilion at the 1964–1965 World's Fair. According to The Will Burtin Papers, the pavilion included an \\"eighty foot high photo tower and moon deck\\". Due to constant dispute with Kodak, Burtin's agreement with the company was ceased before the pavilion was officially built; the Concrete Industry Board gave Burtin a special award in 1964 for its design. === Union Carbide, 1962 === Union Carbide was developing uranium to make nuclear fuel; therefore the company launched a huge campaign surrounding this and requested Burtin to design \\"The Atom in Action\\". His exhibit was showcased at Union Carbide's headquarters in New York City and represented the physics of nuclear energy. The depiction of the density of atomic energy was also presented. This exhibit also became a huge successful and remained popular for many years. \\"The Atom in Action\\" was exhibited at Union Carbide headquarters for several years. === Upjohn Company, 1949–1971 === Burtin took the position as art director of Upjohn Company's publication Scope, while still art directing for Fortune, but did leave Fortune the same year. Scope was a magazine dedicated to conveying medical, scientific and pharmaceutical information. In 1959, Upjohn conducted a survey to see how many doctors or medical workers viewed their publication and the results were not as they would have liked. These results led Burtin to suggest one of the most notable projects he would design for Upjohn, creating a model of a human cell. \\"The Cell\\" exhibit was the first exhibit Burtin would design that demonstrated a human function as a gigantic three-dimensional visual. As explained in the book Design and Science: the Life and Work of Will Burtin, \\"The Cell demonstrated the inter relatedness of cellular function, linkage among organelles, and a vision – Burtin's vision – of a cell's physical structure.\\" Being biology had not yet found out all the functions of a human cell, the exhibit was described as a \\"generalized\\" human cell. \\"The Cell\\" was an instant success, reaching several U.S. cities, including San Francisco, Kalamazoo, New York City, and Chicago. The exhibit also reached England. The exhibit was reviewed in Newsweek and Life Magazine and reached about 40 million people. Due to the huge success with \\"The Cell\\", Burtin went on to create many other exhibits representing biology principles for Upjohn Company, including \\"The Brain\\" and \\"The Chromosome\\", both were very successful. Burtin received many awards for his designs. He received the Art Directors Club medal in 1939, 1941, 1955 and 1958. He received the AMA award in 1958 for his exhibit of The Cell. In 1971, Burtin was awarded a gold medal from AIGA for all his successful contributions to the field of design. He was inducted into the Art Directors Club Hall of Fame in 1974. ==Style== Mr. Burtin's own practice had transcended the \\"commercial art\\" model prevalent in the 1950s and 60s. He went on to merge design theory with education and technology. Will Burtin focused on the relationship between spatial forms and their functions. With a designer's vision, he saw how molecules of a certain shape could be expressed through visual art. Examples of Burtin's work include \\"The Cell\\", \\"The Genes in Action\\", and other processes or microstructures that required a unique understanding of both art and science. His work was publicized in world press and a variety of scientific journals. ==Personal life== In 1930, Burtin started teaching in Berlin, where he met art student Hilde Munk. Burtin and Munk were married in 1932. Will and Hilda Burtin spent most of their lives dedicated to design and typography. Both worked in Burtin's design studio. The couple had one child named Carol, born on October 10, 1942. Will and Hilda were married from 1932 to 1960, when Hilda lost her battle to cancer. Hilda Burtin died on October 10, 1960. She was fifty years old at the time her death; Will and a friend stood by her side as she passed. October 10, 1960, was the same day as the Burtins' daughter, Carol, had her eighteenth birthday. Will was determined to hide the sad news from his daughter Carol; he had a friend call the next day, October 11, to break the news of her mother's passing. Will kept this a secret until he passed and it wasn't until seeing a copy of her mother's death certificate did Carol realize her father's effort to shield the sad news from her. In January 1961, Burtin remarried the graphic designer Cipe Pineles, a long time family friend. Burtin and his daughter Carol moved in with Pineles because their house had too many sad memories of Hilda Burtin. Pineles later adopted Carol in 1973, after the passing of Will Burtin. Will Burtin died on January 18, 1972, in Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. Burtin's cause of death was mesothelioma, which is cancer caused by exposure to asbestos. George Klauber, a long time friend, was by Burtin's side at the time of his death. Burtin's doctor determined it was possible Hilda Burtin died of the same cancer, which was unnamed at the time of her death. ==Dedication== After Burtin's death in 1972, The Cleveland Health Museum and Education Center took The Cell, Defense of Life, The Brain, and The Chromosome as permanent exhibits. A biography of Will Burtin, \\"Design and Science: The Life and Work of Will Burtin\\" was published in 2007 by Lund Humphries, in London; jointly with Ashgate Publishing, in New York. Authors: R. Roger Remington and Robert S. P.

The company's predecessors were the Wolcottville Brass Company and the Ansonia Brass and Battery Company.\\"Copper and Brass Industry,\\" The Encyclopedia Americana: A Library of Universal Knowledge, 1918. It was the first large brass manufacturing firm in the United States, and for much of its existence was the largest brass manufacturer in the country.Pape, History of Waterbury and the Naugatuck Valley, Connecticut, 1918.Anderson, This Fine Piece of Water: An Environmental History of Long Island Sound, 2004.Waszkis, Mining in the Americas: Stories and History, 1993. It was purchased by the Anaconda Copper Company in 1922,Federal Writers' Project, Connecticut, 1938. and merged into Anaconda's other brass manufacturing concerns (losing its identity and name in the process) in 1960. ==Early history== American Brass Company plant in Ansonia, Connecticut, in 1921. In 1834, Israel Coe, a Connecticut farmer; John Hungerford, a Connecticut businessman; and Anson Greene Phelps, co-founder of the Phelps Dodge mining company, founded a brass mill in Wolcottville, Connecticut (now known as Torrington, Connecticut).Depew, 1795-1895: One Hundred Years of American Commerce, 1895. The brass mill manufactured kettles and a limited number of brass buttons. The manufacturing works and most of the skilled workers had to be imported from Great Britain. This was not without significant physical danger, as British companies did not wish to lose their competitive edge and market share. Some skilled workers left England hidden in wooden casks. In 1841, the company went public: $51,000 in stock was issued to Coe, Hungerford and Phelps, and the company name changed to the Wolcottville Brass Company. The company now began to produce mostly rolled and sheet brass. Ansonia Brass & Copper Co office in Manhattan, Ca 1890 Anson Phelps purchased a large parcel of land at what is now Ansonia, Connecticut, in 1844. He founded the town of Ansonia, and built a dam across the Naugatuck River. He also built a canal and water reservoirs, and established a copper rolling mill. Phelps named the new company the Ansonia Brass and Battery Company (\\"battery\\" being the term then in use for hammering sheets of metal into kettles). Phelps later added a brass mill and a brass wire mill, and in 1869 added the manufacture of clocks to the company's business. On January 1, 1878, the clock business was spun off as the Ansonia Clock Company. In 1863, Lyman W. Coe, brother of Israel Coe, founded the Coe Brass Manufacturing Company in Torrington. In 1892, Ansonia Brass sued inventor Alfred A. Cowles for patent infringement. The case went to the U.S. Supreme Court. In a major ruling in patent law, the Court held that merely applying an old process to a new and analogous purpose was not a patentable process, and voided Cowles' patent. ==Formation== Letter awarding the Army-Navy ‘E’ Award for excellence in production to Mr. Clark S. Judd, President, American Brass Company, from Frank Knox, Secretary of the Navy. The American Brass Company was formed on June 7, 1893, as a holding company for six brass manufacturing companies: Plume & Atwood Manufacturing Company; Benedict & Burnham Manufacturing Company; Waterbury Brass Company; Scoville Manufacturing Company; Holmes, Booth and Haydens; and Coe Brass Manufacturing Company. Disagreements over which companies would manufacture which goods delayed formal incorporation until March 1, 1899. All the firms except for the Waterbury Brass Company and the Coe Brass Manufacturing Company withdrew from the new corporation. But the Ansonia Brass and Battery Company joined the new firm in their place. American Brass began operation on December 14, 1899. There were about 10,000 brass workers in the United States in 1900, and half of them worked for American Brass. Benedict & Burnham and Holmes, Booth and Haydens became part of American Brass in 1901. By 1909, American Brass manufactured two-thirds of all the brass in the United States, consumed one-third of all copper produced in the country, and was the largest fabricator of nonferrous metals in the world. But the company failed to eliminate duplication in its manufacturing plants, and its administration remained decentralized.Chandler and Hikino, Scale and Scope: The Dynamics of Industrial Capitalism, 1994. Until 1922, American Brass was one of the few companies whose structure consisted of autonomous businesses. Scovill Manufacturing, Inc., the next largest brass manufacturer, was able to expand its market share significantly as American Brass lagged. Despite its managerial challengers, American Brass was still a highly innovative company. It developed and patented a process for constructing hollow and ventilated busses from rectangular copper bars. The company also developed numerous new and unique metallurgical processes and alloys. On January 1, 1912, the companies held by American Brass were dissolved and all of the firm's divisions began operating under the name of the American Brass Company.\\"American Brass Ends Subsidiaries,\\" New York Times, December 29, 1911. The company also expanded, taking over the Chicago Brass Company of Kenosha, Wisconsin; Waterbury Brass Goods Corporation; and the Ansonian Land and Water Power Company. In June 1917, American Brass bought the Buffalo Copper and Brass Rolling Mills, the largest independent brass rolling mill in the country (one which employed 5,000 people). The company had 70 mills in 1917. During World War I, American Brass employed 16,000 workers and produced 1 billion tons of material. In 1921, the company was the victim of a major embezzlement scandal, after a cashier in the headquarters office absconded with $100,000 in cash and fled to Italy to avoid prosecution.\\"Cashier and $100,000 Are Reported Missing,\\" New York Times, October 11, 1921. ==Purchase and dissolution by Anaconda Copper Co.== In 1922, the Anaconda Copper Mining Company (of Montana) acquired American BrassPeloubet, The Story of a Fortunate Man: Reminiscences and Recollections of Fifty-three Years of Professional Accounting, 2000. The merger was one of the largest deals in American business up to that time. That year, Anaconda achieved the largest revenue in corporate history to date ($175,450,384), due primarily to the acquisition of American Brass.\\"Anaconda,\\" Time, May 12, 1923. Anaconda Copper used American Brass' position as the dominant firm in the brass manufacturing industry to engage in price- fixing.Sutherland, Geis and Goff, White Collar Crime: The Uncut Version, 1985; \\"Pounding Brass,\\" Time, September 21, 1962; McNicol, \\"The Two Price Systems in the Copper Industry,\\" The Bell Journal of Economics, Spring 1975. The division also expanded rapidly in Canada. This had significant consequences for the company, and led to a major tax case in Canada. From 1922 to 1937, Anaconda American Brass used the FIFO method of accounting. In 1937, however, the company moved to LIFO accounting. The Canada Customs and Revenue Agency took issue with this accounting change, and in 1947 sued to recover tax revenues under the Excess Profits Tax Act of 1940. In 1956, the Supreme Court of Canada held in Minister of National Revenue vs. Anaconda American Brass Ltd. A.C. 85 (1956) that LIFO was not allowed for tax purposes in Canada.Thom, \\"Clashing Symbols--The Anaconda Brass Case,\\" Canadian Tax Journal, January 2002. As of 2000, the case still provided the legal precedence for LIFO not being allowed for tax purposes in Canada.Archambault and Archambault, \\"A Test of the Firm Characteristics Hypothesis for LIFO Choice of Canadian Firms,\\" Journal of International Accounting, Auditing and Taxation, 1999. The company retained its own identity until 1960 when the name was changed to Anaconda American Brass. ==Post-Anaconda ownership== In 1977, Anaconda American Brass was acquired by the Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO). After years of declining profits, ARCO sold American Brass to the Buffalo Brass Company.; American Brass was acquired in 1990 by the Finnish Outokumpu Oyj Mining Company. In 2005, American Brass was sold by Outokumpu to the Swedish investment firm Nordic Capital for $800 million, and was renamed Luvata Brass. In 2011, the company was acquired for about $370 million by Aurubis AG, a German copper company.; In 2018, Aurubis announced a proposal of sale of its entire flat rolled product division - including the Buffalo, NY location - to the Wieland Werke AG, a privately held German metal producer. ==NotesReferences== *\\"American Brass Ends Subsidiaries.\\" New York Times.

These are the Episageceratinae, Medlicottiinae, Propinacoceratinae, Sicanitinae, and Uddenitinae. The Artioceratinae and Miklukhoceratinae, sometimes included as well, are junior synonyms respectively for the Sicanitinae and Propinacoceratinae. Previously the Medlicottiidae were divided in part L of the Treatise, 1957, into just two subfamilies, the Uddenitinae introduced by Miller and Furnish in 1940 and the Medlicottinae revised from Karpinsky 1889. ===Higher taxa=== The Medlicottiidae are included in the superfamily Medlicottioidea which now also includes the Pronoritidae and Sundaitidae. The Sageceratidae, included in the Treatise, Part L, 1957, have been removed to the ceratitid superfamily Sagecerataceae. ===Alternative taxonomies=== Hyatt and Smith (1905) included Medlicottia in the Pronoritidae, prior to the establishment of the Prolecanitina as a separate order by Mller and Furnish, 1954. The Pronoritidae of Hyatt and Smith were included in their suborder Pinacoceratoidea. The Pinacoceratoidea also includes the family Pinacoceratidae, which included the genus Sageceras, which later became the type genus for the Sageceratidae. The distinction between the Medlicottiidae and Sageceratidae lies mainly in the distinction of their respective sutural development. According to Hyatt and Smith, the Pronoritidae contains Pronorites, Parapronorites, Medlicottia, (with its subgenera Episageceras, Propinacoceras, and Artinskia ), Sicanites, Uddenites, Sundaites, Daraelites, Albanites, and Cordillerites. Lanceolites was added by Smith (1932). All are confined to the Paleozoic except Episageceras which extends into the Triassic and Cordillerites and Lanceolites which are confined to the Triassic. Smith (1932) pointed out that Medlicottia, Uddenites, and Cordillerites all have the peculiar Pronorites stage in their early development. Pronorites is recapitulated in the young of Parapronorites, Medlicottia, and Uddenites; less so in Cordillerites, and even less in the young of Daraelites. Ruzhencev,1949 (in Glesister and Furnish 1961) included in the Medlicottiidae following genera: Akmilleria, Aktubinskia, Arctioceras, Artinskia, Daixites, Eurmedlicottia, Medlicottia, Neogastroceras, Sicanites, Synartinskia, Propinacoceras, Prouddenites, and Uddenites. ==References== * Alpheus Hyatt and J.P.

(The story that he was born on a boat on the Kama River, which he himself promoted and recounts in his memoirs, is untrue.Dictionary of Literary Biography) He lost his parents at the age of five and went to live in Perm with his aunt, whose husband piloted steam tugs on the river; he later wrote \\"My whole childhood took place in a house on the Kama wharf among tugs, barges, rafts, boats, stevedores, sailors, bargees, captains...\\"Рыцарь камского образа, Moskovskii Komsomolets, 29.11.2006. He left school in 1900, and from 1902 to 1906 worked as a railroad clerk. In 1904 he began to contribute to the newspaper Permskii Krai, publishing poems and notices; at the newspaper he met local Marxists and developed his own leftist political orientation. At this time he also took up acting and traveled around Russia with a theatrical troupe. On his return to the Urals, he became an agitator and led the strike committee at Nizhny Tagil, for which he was sentenced to prison. On his release, he traveled to Istanbul and Tehran; the impressions from this Eastern trip would leave a mark on his later work. ===Working in Moscow=== Nikolay Dmitrevsky, \\"The way\\". Wood engraving to a poem by Vasily Kamensky \\"Yemelyan Pugachev\\" In 1906 he arrived in Moscow, where in 1908 he began working as an editor on the journal Vesna (Spring), meeting important Moscow writers such as David Burlyuk, with whom he studied painting, and Velimir Khlebnikov. Two years later the three collaborated with other writers on the anthology Sadok sudei (A cage [or hatchery] for judges) and formed the proto-Futurist group Hylaea ( [Gileya]), soon joined by Aleksey Kruchenykh and Vladimir Mayakovsky.Victor Terras, Handbook of Russian Literature (Yale University Press, 1990), s.v. \\"Hylaea\\", p. 197. In 1910 Kamensky published his first prose work, the short novel Zemlyanka (The mud hut), \\"in which urban life is abandoned for the joy and beauty of nature,\\"Victor Terras, Handbook of Russian Literature (Yale University Press, 1990), s.v. \\"Kamensky, Vasily Vasilievich\\", p. 214. but its lack of success temporarily discouraged him from further literary endeavor. Kamensky left Moscow to travel around the country, and became one of the first Russians to master the new art of aviation, flying a Blériot XI; he brought the Russian word самолет [samolyot] 'airplane' into circulation.Большой Энциклопедический Словарь entry After an airplane crash in 1911, however, he gave up flying. For a couple of years he lived on his estate near Perm, but in 1913 he moved back to Moscow, though he toured Russia with Burlyuk and Mayakovsky, promoting Futurism; \\"from this time Kamensky was an invariable participant in Futurist collections, newspapers, journals, and public appearances.\\" He also returned to literary activity, in 1914 publishing his poetry collection Tango s korovami (Tango with cows) and in 1915 his long poem Stenka Razin, about the 17th-century rebel. ===The October Revolution=== He welcomed the October Revolution of 1917, and was one of the first writers elected to the Moscow Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies.N.A. Trifonov, Russkaya literatura XX veka: Dooktyabrskii period (Moscow: Prosveshchenie, 1971), p. 631. In November he \\"persuaded Filippov, the Moscow baker (his shops had been the center of struggle during the February Days and even earlier during the 1905 revolt in Moscow), to subsidize a small café for poets. It was located in an old laundry on a small pereulok called Nastasyinsky just off the Tverskaya.\\"Harrison E. Salisbury, Black Night, White Snow: Russia's Revolutions 1905-1917 (Doubleday, 1978), p. 542. (Soon anarchists began frequenting the Poets' Café, and after it closed in April 1918 they set up their journal Anarkhiya there.Neil Leach, Architecture and Revolution (Routledge, 1999), p. 28.) For the first anniversary of the October Revolution, he turned Stenka Razin into a play; Robert Leach writes that this \\"most convincing version created a very strong impression when it was presented at the Vvedensky People's House, Moscow\\": > Stenka Razin was played by Nikolai Znamensky from the Moscow Art Theatre, > the play was designed in an attractive childish-primitive style by Pavel > Kuznetsov and directed by Meyerhold's former pupil, Arkady Zonov, and Vasily > Sakhnovsky, formerly Komissarzhevsky's partner at the theatre named after > Vera Komissarzhevskaya. It was, wrote one critic, an 'enormous success', > partly at least because it 'reeked of streets and circus'.... The play > employs an utterly direct and simple style, with plenty of clowning but a > minimum of Futurist mannerisms, and achieves something of the spirit of the > folktale.Robert Leach, Revolutionary Theatre (Routledge, 1994), p. 35. ===Kamensky's waning years=== That was the peak of Kamensky's career. In the 1920s he played a minor role in Mayakovsky's LEF group; in the 1930s he wrote his memoir, Put' entuziasta (The path of an enthusiast, 1931), and two more historical dramas, Emelyan Pugachev (1931) and Ivan Bolotnikov (1934). On April 19, 1948, he suffered a stroke that left him paralyzed until his death in 1961; the house in which he lived in the village of Troitsa in the Perm Krai from 1932 to 1951 is now a museum. The Dictionary of Literary Biography sums up his career in these words: > Kamensky was involved in significant literary events throughout his career > and knew many people who were central to the Russian avant-garde. His > zhelezobetonnye poemy (ferroconcrete poems) were among the boldest and most > distinctive experiments in Russian Futurism, and he freely adapted other > Futurist techniques to his own impressionist style. Although his greatest > contribution to literature was most likely his discovery of Velimir > Khlebnikov, Kamensky was a creative poet in his own right and an active > participant in the artistic life of Russia in the first third of the > twentieth century.Dictionary of Literary Biography ==See also== * Russian Futurism ==FootnotesReferences== \\"Каменский Василий Васильевич\\", Russian biography and bibliography with links to poems ==External links== * English translations of 3 poems, 1914-1916 * English translation of poem \\"In the Rathskeller,\\" 1908 *English translations of 3 poems, October 2013 Category:1884 births Category:1961 deaths Category:Russian avant-garde Category:Russian male poets Category:20th-century poets Category:20th-century Russian male writers ","title":"Vasily Kamensky"},{"id":"20350191","text":"Rebecca Rios (born June 4, 1967) is an American Democratic politician who currently serves in the Arizona State Senate representing District 27 since January 14, 2019.

He was born at Kadina, South Australia in 1876, son of Henry Kneebone of Cornwall and Elizabeth Ann (née Tonkin). In 1899, he began working as a journalist at the Kadina and Wallaroo Times under David Bews, and five years later joined the gold rush to Western Australia, where he began working for the Coolgardie Miner, subsequently becoming its editor. The Coolgardie Miner ceased publication around the end of 1909. He joined the Daily Herald, a Labor Party publication in Adelaide, in 1910 and was made editor in 1911. In 1912 he was appointed press officer to the High Commission in London where he performed useful service. He founded the Anzac Buffet, which supplied more than a million free meals to Australian soldiers in London. In 1916 he returned to Adelaide and editorship of the Daily Herald, which had fallen on hard times. He was unable to reverse its decline and the paper went into voluntary liquidation in 1924. In 1924 he was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly but resigned the following year to contest (unsuccessfully) the House of Representatives seat of Boothby. In 1931 he was appointed to the Australian Senate as a Labor Senator for South Australia, filling the casual vacancy caused by the death of Country Party Senator John Chapman, but lost it in the election of later that year.Blewett, Neal 'Kneebone, Henry (1876–1933)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/kneebone-henry-6982/text12133, accessed 22 July 2013. He returned to journalism, as the editor of The Labor Advocate, a Trades Hall publication. Kneebone died in 1933. His death notice in The Advertiser mentioned his editorship of the Advocate but not his political career. He showed great concern and affection for the Aboriginal peoples and was fascinated by their culture. His Methodist views influenced his social democratic politics.Payton, Philip, Making Moonta: The Invention of Australia's Little Cornwall ==Family== Henry Kneebone (1876–1933) married Henrietta Whitta (1875 – 17 January 1951) on 4 November 1903; they lived in Jellicoe Avenue, Kings Park.

He died in 1892 after falling down a flight of stairs, leaving a third of his estate and a substantial allowance to his family. Mary Pleasant and Teresa Bell oversaw the family finances together, but by 1897 the family was deeply in debt. Fred Bell blamed Pleasant, and he filed a series of lawsuits directed at gaining control of the estate. The litigation perpetuated the image of Pleasant, a light-skinned woman who had once passed for white, as a devious \\"mammy.\\" The first lawsuit, filed against Teresa, claimed that she was wasting the family fortune under Pleasant's influence, and demanded that she be removed as head of the household. Two years later Bell publicly accused Pleasant of murdering his father, and Teresa evicted her from the family home. The litigation continued even after Pleasant's death in 1904. ==Career== Teresa Bell died in 1922, leaving her children $5 each. They successfully fought the will in court.

The buildings are located on a generally flat site surrounded by gently rolling terrain and are set well back from the road along a gravel drive that winds through the center of the farm. The J.P Tarenz log house was a log slave quarters built around 1768 that was moved offsite after the Civil War to accommodate people freed from slavery.

The Misfits were formed in 1977 by singer and songwriter Glenn Danzig. The band experienced many lineup changes during their first six years, with Danzig and bassist Jerry Only being the only constant fixtures. They released their first single, \\"Cough/Cool\\", in 1977 on Danzig's own label Blank Records. Mercury Records offered Danzig thirty hours of free studio time in exchange for the trademark to the Blank Records name, which the band used to record their first album, Static Age, in January 1978. However, they were unable to find a record label willing to release it and instead released four of the songs as the \\"Bullet\\" single on Danzig's new imprint Plan 9 Records. Static Age would not be released in its entirety for another eighteen years. The band released two additional singles in 1979: \\"Horror Business\\" and \\"Night of the Living Dead\\", both on Plan 9. The band's first EP, Beware, was released in January 1980. That August they recorded twelve new songs intended for an album, but it was never released. Only's brother Doyle then became the band's guitarist and would remain so until 2000. Three of the songs from the album sessions were released as 3 Hits from Hell in April 1981, and two more were released as the \\"Halloween\\" single in October. Throughout 1981 the Misfits recorded songs for their first full- length album Walk Among Us, which was released in March 1982 through Ruby Records and Slash Records. A promotional music video was filmed for the song \\"Braineaters\\". That December they released a live EP titled Evilive. The band broke up due to internal tensions on October 29, 1983, just two months before their second album Earth A.D./Wolfs Blood was released through Plan 9. Following the band's breakup a posthumous single for \\"Die, Die My Darling\\" was released in 1984, followed by two compilation albums of out-of-print and previously unreleased material released through Caroline Records: Legacy of Brutality (1985) and Misfits (1986), which later became more commonly referred to as Collection I. Evilive was also re-released in 1987 as a full album. After a series of legal battles ending in 1995, Jerry Only and Doyle re-formed the band with a new lineup including singer Michale Graves and drummer Dr. Chud. Caroline Records released Collection II that year, followed in 1996 by a box set titled simply The Misfits collecting nearly all of the band's early material, including Static Age which was released as a separate album in 1997. Also in 1997 the new Misfits lineup released American Psycho on Geffen Records, supported by music videos for \\"American Psycho\\" and the single \\"Dig Up Her Bones\\". Evillive II was released in 1998, followed by Famous Monsters in 1999 on Roadrunner Records with a single and music video for \\"Scream!\\" Graves, Chud, and Doyle all left the band in 2000, and a compilation of demos and b-sides from this era was released in 2001 as Cuts from the Crypt. Caroline Records attempted that year to release the material from the August 1980 sessions as 12 Hits from Hell, but the album was cancelled at the request of Danzig and Only before it could be released. As the only remaining member of the Misfits, Jerry Only took over vocal duties and recruited Dez Cadena and Marky Ramone to fill out the band. This lineup released Project 1950 in 2003, an album of cover versions of rock and roll songs from the 1950s and 1960s, on their own label Misfits Records. Ramone was replaced by Robo in 2005, and this lineup released the \\"Land of the Dead\\" single in 2009.

He was a United Australia Party member of the Australian Senate from 1934 to 1944, representing South Australia. Uppill was born into a farming family at Nantawarra, South Australia and was educated at Balaklava Public School and then privately. He became a farmer and grazier at nearby Balaklava from 1906. Having long been involved in the state's main conservative party, the Liberal Union, he was elected party president in 1920, and headed the party through its merger with the National Party to form the Liberal Federation, serving as president of the merged body until 1924. He later served on the board of the State Bank of South Australia from 1929, after advocacy from farmers for a board member to represent their interests. Uppill also served as secretary of the Balaklava branch of the Agricultural Bureau and president and secretary of the Balaklava and Dalkey Agricultural Society, and was the inaugural chairman of the Balaklava branch of the Liberal and Country League in 1932. Uppill was elected to the Senate for the United Australia Party at the 1934 federal election. He was opposition whip from 1943 to 1944. He resigned his seat due to ill health in 1944, necessitating the appointment of Ted Mattner to succeed him. He was largely interested in agricultural issues, in particular wheat farming, and upon his resignation his party's Senate leader, George McLeay, said of Uppill's Senate service that his \\"knowledge of the practical problems of the man on the land has been of considerable value in the improvement of agricultural legislation. He died at an St Anthony's Private Hospital in the Adelaide suburb of Joslin in 1946 after a long illness and was buried at North Road Cemetery. He married Gertrude Caroline Murray in 1904. They had two children. ==References== Category:United Australia Party members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Australian Senate for South Australia Category:Members of the Australian Senate Category:1876 births Category:1946 deaths Category:20th-century Australian politicians ","title":"Oliver Uppill"},{"id":"20350510","text":"Daedeoksan is a mountain in the cities of Taebaek and Samcheok, Gangwon-do in South Korea.

The 500 acre estate was called \\"Adam the First\\". In 1874, the property was sold with buildings to Peter A. Harmon. A two-story Gothic Revival frame house built with an addition built by John and Lousia Curtis in 1891. Southeast of the main house is a gable-front frame garage, a one-story shed-roofed chicken house, a hog barn, a frame board-and-batten granary, and a board-and-batten bank barn with an unusually deep forebay. The property also contains Shipley and Brown family cemetery. William Smallwood in acquired the property and in 1883 the property was acquired by James A. Curtis, who willed it to his son Robert Curtis who in turn willed it his sons Robert Jr. and Glenn. In 1958 the existing porch was remodeled and converted into a full kitchen and indoor plumbing was added at that time. In 1992, the property boundaries were redefined by the Maryland State Highway Administration to accommodate the Route 100 construction through the historic farm.

The system was sold in the United States under its original name by Docutel/Olivetti of Dallas. AT&T; and Xerox bought rights to rebadge the system as the AT&T; PC 6300 and the Xerox 6060 series, respectively. (AT&T; owned 25% of Olivetti around this time.) The AT&T; 6300, launched in June 1984, was AT&T;'s first attempt to compete in the PC compatible market. ==Features== Contrary to other PC clones of that era, the M24 was highly compatible with IBM PC. One of its characteristics was the use of the more powerful 8.0 MHz Intel 8086 CPU rather than the 4.77 MHz Intel 8088 used in IBM's own PC XT, configured for \\"maximum mode\\" that allowed direct installation of an 8087 math co-processor (also at 8 MHz) to the motherboard. The CPU clock, along with most others in the machine (other than the serial baud rate generator and an IBM-standard 14.3 MHz crystal used on the expansion board), was divided down from a 24.0 MHz master crystal, with the CPU timing in particular using an Intel 8284 clock generator, as per the IBM PC, to produce the 33% duty cycle squarewave required by the 8086. The system was designed \\"split-level\\", with the motherboard screwed onto the underside of the computer case and connected to the ISA bus backplane in the top section of the case via the video card which, rather than occupying an ISA slot, has two female edge connectors and plugs onto the ends of both the motherboard and the backplane, doubling as a bridge between them. The M24 has seven 8-bit ISA slots, as were standard for its time, but a number of slots (exact figure seeming to vary between one and at least four across extant machines) have proprietary second connectors to accept Olivetti-specific 16-bit cards. The machine had the bad luck of launching just a few months before the IBM PC/AT, which introduced the entirely different 16-bit connector and signalling standard extension to the PC bus now known simply as \\"ISA\\", and so ended up featuring slots incompatible on all three fronts of physical configuration, complement and arrangement of signals, and data transfer rate, significantly restricting the number of compatible 16-bit cards produced for it. The initial release of the AT&T; 6300 had either one or two 360 KB 5.25\\" floppy drives; a hard disk was not offered. In 1986, AT&T; began offering 3.5\\" 720 KB floppies and 20MB hard disks. The Xerox 6060 came standard with a single 360 KB 5.25\\" drive and a 20 MB hard drive. An Iomega Bernoulli 10/10 removable cartridge drive was also offered as a factory option, as well as a \\"small expansion\\" sidecar hosting a hard drive for users who found themselves with no internal space left between floppies and expansion cards. 6300s made in 1986-1987 have BIOS Version 1.43 which added proper support for 3.5\\" floppies and fixed a number of bugs. As with all contemporary systems, a BIOS upgrade required a physical chip replacement, which AT&T; provided for $35. The M24/6300 had an unusual enhanced 32 KB CGA-compatible video card which, in addition to standard 200-line CGA graphics modes (automatically line doubled, transparent to software, with text modes also using 400 scanlines with higher quality 8×16 pixel fonts, or even 16×16 in 40-column mode with an expansion ROM), also supported an additional 640×400 pixel graphics mode, as well as a poorly documented 512×256 mode for compatibility with the earlier M20 model (in conjunction with a Z8000-based emulator card that included a necessary additional clock source). All modes were non-interlaced, albeit running at a then-common 50 Hz Vsync rate, and required the dedicated OEM 26.3 kHz, 12\\" monitor (either colour or multi-level monochrome) because of their comparatively high line frequency, with all but the M20 mode using the 24 MHz system master crystal to drive the pixel clock either directly or (320×200 and 8×16 40-character only) divided in two (in comparison, contemporary IBM displays ran at 15.8 to 21.9 kHz with 14.3 to 16.3 MHz dot clocks). Colour depth remained the standard fixed 4-colour CGA palettes in 320×200, and \\"monochrome\\" in all higher modes (any selectable RGB(I) foreground colour/one of 15 shades, with a fixed black background), but could be expanded to 4 or 8 colours/greyscales in all resolutions, and 16 in all but 512×256, with the addition of a graphics memory expansion board holding between 32 and 96 KB RAM (the resolution:colour relationship being unintuitive due to CRTC bandwidth and addressing limitations - 16 colours in the 640-pixel modes effectively combined the standard and expansion memory spaces into a single 64-bit wide bank); the expansion card also had its own monitor port built in allowing native dual-monitor support. CGA compatibility was necessarily limited to \\"RGB\\" modes, and \\"well behaved\\" software that only used the BIOS-preset modes and didn't attempt too much clever direct reprogramming of the CRTC registers (including setting of pseudo-text hack modes like 160×100 16 colours), as there was no composite video output available and although some basic register settings remained the same, others were necessarily very different because of the line doubling trickery (itself a type of CRTC hack) and altered scan rates, and Olivetti's protective \\"scrambler\\" chip that attempted to convert custom settings to the nearest safe equivalents could only go so far. In its turn, the machine's headline 640×400 graphics mode received a moderate level of support from software developers, mostly for \\"serious\\" applications such as Lotus 1-2-3 and Symphony (Earl Weaver Baseball is however an example of a game that can use it), and was for a time both supported and emulated (as well as extended to e.g. 752x410) by various \\"Super EGA\\"/\\"any mode on any monitor\\" cards such as the ATI EGA Wonder. These, as well as any other replacement video card, could be used in the 6300 so long as they were designed to work either specifically with the machine (for high speed 16-bit cards), or in an IBM PC compatible mode (necessarily 8-bit at 4.77 MHz). However, the original graphics card had to remain in place even if no longer in use, as it formed an essential part of the bridge connecting the expansion board to the motherboard, and although it featured DIP switch jumpers to select between MDA/Hercules, 40 and 80 column CGA, and expanded video options including its own (as per the IBM motherboard settings), there was no \\"disable\\" switch. Instead, the (socketed) Motorola HD6845 CRTC main controller chip had to be removed, and replaced with a simple but remarkably expensive bridging circuit (or a user installed set of jumper wires to the correct half-dozen socket terminals) to bypass the necessary bus signals through the card untouched. Some plasma-screen and early LCD based portables from Compaq and other manufacturers also copied the M24/6300's graphics hardware to make better use of early square-pixel 640×400 panels popular for Japanese and other non-IBM portables (still well suited to the basic CGA/EGA resolutions, but not so much EGA-high or MDA/EGA text, and unable to show MCGA/VGA-high or Hercules graphics without cropping or losing details) in an IBM Compatible hardware ecosystem that otherwise avoided the mode. However, it remained on the whole a poorly supported oddity, much like IBM's own PGC and most Super EGAs outside of their limited library of applications with direct driver support, and PC graphics on the whole did not exceed 640×350 in 16 colours or 720×348 in monochrome until the arrival of both the VGA standard, and Windows 3.0 which provided a simple one-driver-for-all-programs framework for future expansion cards to build on. The keyboard used a proprietary 9-pin D-sub connector built into the system board and had the unusual option of plugging a mouse into the keyboard via another 9-pin D-Sub connector. The mouse could be configured to simulate the usage of the keyboard's arrow keys in DOS applications without mouse support, aided by the choice of a parallel quadrature encoding design (as per the Microsoft Bus Mouse, Amiga and Atari ST mice, all of which can be modified to work with the 6300) instead of the latterly more common 9-pin serial transmission. In Europe, Olivetti also launched a 10.0 MHz version: the Olivetti M24 SP, announced in November 1985, a contender for the title of \\"highest clocked 8086 computer\\" as its processor was the fastest grade of 8086-2, rated for a maximum speed of exactly the same 10.0 MHz. To support this, the motherboard now featured a switchable 24/30 MHz master crystal, still divided by 3 to produce the 33% duty CPU clock, with an additional 4 MHz crystal to maintain that clock signal for peripherals that required it, and the video board receiving its own 24 MHz crystal to maintain the same image size and scan frequencies at both processor speeds. ==Reception== Olivetti M24SP with manuals Olivetti M24SP I/O Board A January 1985 review in InfoWorld declared it \\"a fair performer, better than the 8088-equipped IBM PC and PC XT and about equal to the 8086-based Compaq Deskpro\\", and taking pricing into account concluded that it was \\"a good deal, but by no means perfect.\\" The reviewer wondered how the \\"5 MHz\\" 8086 in the Compaq ran as fast as the same processor at 8 MHz in the AT&T; machine; however, this appears to be a misunderstanding given that the Compaq was switchable between a guaranteed IBM PC-compatible 4.77 MHz and an enhanced-performance 7.16 MHz clock rate (respectively one-third and one-half of the same NTSC colourburst crystal used in the IBM, but not the Olivetti/AT&T;), and defaulted to the latter on boot, as detailed in other publications of the time, and endlessly misreported (including as \\"8 MHz\\", about as frequently as the miscalculated \\"7.14 MHz\\") ever since. The reason behind the M24/6300's failure to perform any better than equal with the 1/9th-slower Deskpro may be traceable, as hinted at in the InfoWorld review, to poorly optimised graphics routines in the BIOS, which would have a particularly noticeable effect in the high resolution 640x400 and extended colour modes. A November 1985 review in PC Magazine of the hard drive-equipped version found it on par with the (6 MHz, 80286 equipped) IBM PC AT as far as processor performance was concerned, but with considerably slower I/O. The initial model of the AT&T; 6300 (no hard disk and only 360K floppy) had slow sales in 1984 with only sold compared to 1.5 million IBM PCs. The sales were not much better in the first three months of 1985, with only sold in that time period. If fact, worldwide sales of the Olivetti M24 were only in the first year, well below the planned production capacity of . As a result, AT&T; introduced the faster models with hard drive and a math co-processor in March. Still, after about one year on the market, AT&T; had only claimed about 1% of the PC market, on par with that of TeleVideo and Columbia Data Products, but well below that of Compaq and Kaypro. By December 1986 however, AT&T;'s PC line (including the 6300 Plus, described below) put it in the fourth place in terms of market share in the US. Olivetti's M24 did much better in Europe, where it became the market leader in 1986. The company produced almost half a million M24 machines that year, about of which went to the United States. As it claimed the crown of most PC machines sold in Europe that year, Olivetti also became the third largest PC manufacturer worldwide. Olivetti would however be unable to repeat the feat in the subsequent years, and so 1986 represents the company's apogee in terms of PC market share. The 6300 was also supported by Unix-based operating systems particularly by Venix/86 Encore, released in September 1984, and by a version of Xenix adapted for the machine by the Santa Cruz Operation, and announced in June 1985. ==6300 Plus and subsequent AT&T; machines== Rogue In October 1985, AT&T; launched the 6300 Plus that used a 6 MHz 286 microprocessor in the same case as the 6300. On the hardware level, this machine was criticized by an InfoWorld reviewer for being incompatible with AT cards. On the other hand, AT&T; sold a package of the 6300 Plus bundled with Simultask, which ran MS-DOS and UNIX System V simultaneously, at a cost—with all software licenses included—on par with the IBM PC AT with MS-DOS alone. A review in PC Magazine declared that AT&T;'s 6300 Plus was \\"flat out the better machine\\" compared to the IBM PC/AT. (The version of Simultask included with this machine was based on Locus Computing Corporation's Merge software. According to AT&T;, their 6300 Plus used non- standard hardware to make such a feat possible given the limitations of the 80286.) The PC 6300 Plus shipped with MS-DOS in 1985 though, because its Unix System V distribution would not be ready until the end of March 1986. The 6300 Plus did not sell as well as the original 6300. Forrester Research estimated in December 1986 that AT&T;'s financial losses in PC market were about $600M for the year. After the 6300 Plus, AT&T; announced that it was turning over both production and development of its PC products to Olivetti. In 1987, AT&T; offered a true AT-based 286, their 6310—a rebadge of Olivetti M28. Equipped with a one-wait state 8 MHz processor, it was a pretty slow machine for its class, even slower than the IBM XT 286. Simultask was also an option for the 6310. The later-released 6312 addressed the speed problem with a 12-MHz CPU. After the announcement of the 6310, in April 1987, AT&T; announced price cuts across its 6300 PC product line, with the 6300 Plus discounted by 27-38%, while the original 6300 was discounted by 17-23% (depending on configuration.) ==Successors in Olivetti's product line== In response to IBM's launch of their PS/2 line, Olivetti revamped their product line in July 1987 to include 3.5\\" floppy drives (in 5.25-to-3.5\\" converted bays though) and also introduced new 386-based products. The M24 (and M24 SP) were succeed by the M240 (8086 at 10 MHz, which AT&T; marketed in the USA as the 6300 WGS) while the M28 (and M28 SP) was succeeded by the M280 (80286 at 12 MHz). Olivetti also introduced an M380 series (both tower and desktop) using the 80386 processor. ==See also== * AT&T; Unix PC (7300) * Olivetti M19 * Polaroid Palette ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Bob Troiano's review of the AT&T; PC 6300, BYTE, December 1985, page 294-302 * The Man who Plots AT&T;'s Computer Strategy, InfoWorld, April 15, 1985, p. 16 * Bancaditalia.it ==External links== * Olivettim24.hadesnet.org * Old-Computers.com - AT&T; PC 6300 * https://web.archive.org/web/20090515115421/http://home.online.no/~kr- lund/olivetti.htm * AT&T; product announcement brochure for the 6300 Plus * M24 SP brochure (in German) * * * Bitsavers.trailing-edge.com * Web.archive.org Category:Olivetti computers Category:IBM PC compatibles ","title":"Olivetti M24"},{"id":"20350562","text":"Sidney Wainman O'Flaherty (2 July 1886 - 18 November 1967) was an Australian politician. He was an Australian Labor Party member of the Australian Senate for South Australia from 1944 to 1962. He had previously served as a Labor member of the South Australian House of Assembly from 1918 to 1921. Born in Silverton, New South Wales, his family soon moved to Adelaide, where he was raised. He attended the Adelaide School of Mines before becoming an architect and accountant, and later secretary of the Miscellaneous Workers' Union. In 1918, he was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly as the Labor member for Murray, serving until 1921. In the 1931 Labor split in the wake of the Great Depression, O'Flaherty became associated with the splinter Lang Labor Party, which supported the ideas of Premier of New South Wales Jack Lang. He unsuccessfully contested the 1931 federal election for Lang Labor, but resigned in April 1932 along with a number of other figures, including sole MP Martin Collaton, who were disgruntled with the South Australian party leadership. They formed the Lang Australian Labor Party with O'Flaherty as party president, but the new party merged into the official Labor Party in September. He contested the 1933 state election, standing for the official Labor Party in the seat of Barossa, but was unsuccessful. He was again unsuccessful as the Labor candidate for Thebarton in 1941. In 1943 he became President of the South Australian Labor Party, but later that year he was elected to the Australian Senate as a Labor Senator for South Australia. He held the seat until his retirement in 1961. O'Flaherty died in 1967. ==References== Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Australian Senate for South Australia Category:Members of the Australian Senate Category:Members of the South Australian House of Assembly Category:1886 births Category:1967 deaths Category:20th-century Australian politicians ","title":"Sid O'Flaherty"},{"id":"20350588","text":"Daemisan is a mountain in the county of Pyeongchang, Gangwon-do in South Korea.

For the next four years (1876-1879) he was part of the Benjamin Bilse Kapelle in Berlin. He was concertmaster of the orchestras at Königsberg (1879), Mannheim (1881) and Weimar (1884–94). He first attracted notice as a soloist with his playing of Bach's Double Concerto with Joseph Joachim at the Bach Festival at Eisenach in 1884.W. L. Hubbard, The American History and Encyclopedia of Music In 1893 Halíř took over as concert master of the Berlin opera orchestra, the Königliche Kapelle, and joined the faculty of the Berlin Königliche Hochschule für Musik. At that time he started his own quartet in Berlin with Carl Markees, Adolf Müller, and Hugo Dechert, which had a subscription series for fifteen years. Later he also founded a Piano Trio group with his Hochschule colleague Georg Schumann on piano and Hugo Dechert on cello. Halíř became the second violinist of the Joachim Quartet in 1897, joining Joachim, Emanuel Wirth on viola, and Robert Hausmann on cello. Halíř maintained his career as a soloist while playing in orchestras and ensembles all his life. He toured the United States in 1896 and 1897, and admired particularly for his playing of the Beethoven's Violin Concerto in D major,New York Times archives which he performed at his debut with the New York Philharmonic on 13 November 1896; his performance was described as \\"one of the most interesting and admirable pieces of violin playing that have been heard in New York.\\" The performance was compared favorably to the previous performance of the work in New York by Eugène Ysaÿe, and the review concluded, \\"To hear Herr Halir play ... is to understand what is meant by classical violin playing\\".New York Times: THE PHILHARMONIC CONCERT.; American Debut of Carl Halir -- A Fine Programme On 4 December 1896 he gave the first performance in Carnegie Hall of Louis Spohr’s Violin Concerto No. 8, with the New York Symphony Orchestra conducted by Walter Damrosch.Violinist.com Joahim Quartet: (from left to right) Robert Hausmann (cello), Joseph Joachim (1st violin), Emanuel Wirth (viola) and Karel Halíř (2nd violin) Although not the soloist at the premiere (that was Adolph Brodsky), Karel Halíř championed Tchaikovsky’s Violin Concerto in D major, which was not popular in its early years. When Tchaikovsky attended a performance of the work by Halíř in Leipzig in 1888, he called it \\"a memorable day.\\"John Warrack, Tchaikovsky, p. 211 On October 19, 1905, Halíř premiered the revised version of Sibelius’s Violin Concerto in D minor in Berlin, with the Berlin Philharmonic under the baton of Richard Strauss. That same program had Halíř playing the premiere of Charles Martin Loeffler’s Divertissement for violin and orchestra, which Fritz Kreisler and Eugène Ysaÿe had declined to play owing to its technical demands. He premiered other works, such as the Violin Concerto by the Danish composer Eduard Lassen, which was dedicated to him, in Frankfurt in 1889. He gave the European premiere of Amy Beach’s Violin Sonata in Berlin on 28 October 1899, with Teresa Carreño.The Violin Sonata of Amy Beach Adrienne Fried Block, Amy Beach, Passionate Victorian He wrote a cadenza for Brahms's Violin Concerto in D major.Cadenza Collection As a member of the Joachim Quartet, Halíř toured extensively. They played a series of concerts every year in London, and were regulars at the bi-annual Beethoven Haus Festival in Bonn. In 1905 they performed the complete Beethoven Quartets in London, Paris, and Rome. The Quartet disbanded after Joachim’s death in August 1907. Halíř died suddenly in Berlin on 21 December 1909, at age fifty- one. Halíř’s successor at the Hochschule was the Joachim student Willy Hess, who also took over Halíř’s Quartet and Trio ensembles. In 1888 Karel Halíř married Therese Zerbst (1859-1910), a noted soprano from Berlin.Theodore Baker, A Biographical Dictionary of Musicians His pupils included David Mannes. ==ReferencesSources== *Grove’s Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed. *Hugo Riemann.

Ein Tagebuch is a novel by Swiss writer Robert Walser, first published in German in 1909. ==Introduction== Jakob von Gunten is a first- person account told by its titular protagonist, a young man of noble background who runs off from home and decides to spend the rest of his life serving others. To this end, he enrols at the Benjamenta Institute, a school for servants. Walser based the novel on his own experiences: upon arriving in Berlin in 1905 he attended a school for servants, and served as a butler the following winter. Walser in Jakob von Gunten uses an \\"ordinary and internalized narrative, turning the novel into what Walser’s translator Christopher Middleton in the novel’s afterword calls, 'an analytic fictional soliloquy'\\". ==Plot summary== Jakob von Gunten comes from a well-off family. His father has a car and horse at his disposal and his mother has her own box at the theatre. His brother Johann is a well-known, established artist, who cultivates a bourgeois lifestyle and moves in elite circles. Jakob runs away from home in order to escape the overbearing shadow of his father, an alderman. He joins a school for servants, situated on one floor at the rear of a house in Berlin. The headmaster of the institute is Herr Benjamenta. Due to a lack of teaching staff, the pupils are taught by the headmaster’s sister, Lisa Benjamenta. There are in fact more teachers, but they are either absent or said to be fast asleep. The pupils are trained as servants with the aim of securing a job. The teaching predominantly consists of learning-by-heart from one of the institute’s brochures with the title \\"What is the aim of Benjamenta’s School for Boys?\\" and from the \\"Rules\\". The pupils willingly let themselves be treated like children, drilled and pushed hard. A principle of the Institute is: \\"Little, but thoroughly\\". They are taught how to deal with people in social situations through theory and role-play. As a new pupil Jakob is tested by the headmaster. At first he rebels, walks into his office and demands his money back, resenting the poor quality of the education. But then he acquiesces and ends his attempts at revolution. Jakob later gets mixed up in a fight and receives a hit to the head from the headmaster who doesn’t ascertain who was initially responsible. Jakob does not feel inferior. On the contrary, he has ample self-confidence and considers himself the brightest among his classmates. Jakob considers himself conceited and arrogant. His pride is slightly injured and Jakob presumes that he is being dumbed down by the institute. He knows in any case that he is being made to look small. The headmaster confesses to Jakob that he has a fondness for him which he can no longer control. He perceives something special in Jakob. The headmaster has no explanation for this. Jakob is also surprised, but knows how to act around superiors. He wisely says nothing in reply – even when the headmaster confesses his love for him. When Jakob is supposed to become the friend and confidant of the headmaster the pupil is hesitant. Jakob does not get a job through the headmaster because the headmaster, already over 40, loves someone for the first time and doesn't want to let him go. But then Jakob becomes afraid; the headmaster wants to choke him. Later, however, the headmaster wants to kiss Jakob. Outraged, the splendid young boy refuses. Frau Benjamenta tells Jakob she is going to die. Herr Benjamenta and Jakob sit in vigil over her dead body before she is taken away. The school has been failing for a long time, with a falling intake of pupils. Jakob agrees to pack up and go travelling with Herr Benjamenta. ==J. M.

He was born Wellington Duncan Rankin on September 16, 1884 in Missoula, Montana, the son of John and Olive (née Pickering) Rankin. He grew up in a political family, with several of his relatives holding public office. He attended Harvard University, earning his bachelor's degree in 1905, and Harvard Law School, graduating in 1909. He was a Rhodes Scholar. An attorney by profession, he served in the United States Army during World War I. He was elected Montana Attorney General in 1920, and unsuccessfully stood for the Republican Senate nomination in 1924. A few days after losing the Senate primary, Rankin was appointed to fill a vacancy as an associate justice of the Montana Supreme Court, a position he held until the end of 1925. He resigned that post to accept an appointment from President Calvin Coolidge as U.S. Attorney for the District of Montana (i.e. the entire state). Rankin was the unsuccessful Republican nominee for Governor in 1928, but continued as U.S. Attorney; he was re-appointed to that post by President Herbert Hoover in 1930 and served until 1934.https://mtmemory.org/digital/collection/p16013coll44/id/55/ He returned to practicing law until 1942, when he ran for the U.S. Senate against liberal incumbent Democrat James Edward Murray. He lost to Murray by a vote of 83,673 to 82,461. Wellington Rankin's older sister, Jeannette Rankin, was the first woman ever elected to the United States Congress. She was elected U.S. Representative in 1916 and again in 1940. A lifelong pacifist, she was one of 50 House members (total of 56 in both chambers) who opposed the war declaration of 1917, and she was the only member of Congress to vote against declaring war on Japan after the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Her vote against the United States entering World War II was highly unpopular, and resulted in her retirement. ==References== Category:Politicians from Missoula, Montana Category:Military personnel from Montana Category:Montana Republicans Category:Montana Attorneys General Category:1884 births Category:1966 deaths Category:20th-century American politicians Category:American Rhodes Scholars Category:Harvard Law School alumni ","title":"Wellington D.

Accessed 16 July 2019. From 1692 to 1840, the office of mayor in Ponce was filled either by local hacendados or by military officers appointed by the governor, depending on whether the political situation on Spain at the time was that of a constitutional or an absolutist government.Guillermo Baralt. Buena Vista: Life and Work in a Puerto Rican Hacienda. Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press. 1999. p. 131. From 1840 to 1870, mayors were oftentimes elected by the municipal council, whose members were called regidores. In 1870, political parties were created for the first time and municipal officials were elected by the people at large, and the mayor, as well as the members of the municipal council, would belong to one of the two parties active, either the Partido Liberal Reformista or the Partido Incondicional Español.Socorro Giron. Ramon Marin y su Tiempo. In, Ramon Marin's Las Fiestas Populares de Ponce. Editorial de la Universidad de Puerto Rico. 1994. p. 16. With the advent of the American political system in Puerto Rico after the American invasion of 1898, the mayor was elected by popular vote, which is the system still (2019) in place. Ponce's first mayor was Don Pedro Sánchez de Mathos, in 1692, appointed by governor Juan Robles de Lorenzana. Ponce elected its first mayor (as well as its first Municipal Assembly) on 20 September 1812.Ponce se prepara para celebrar su día mundial. Darisabel Texidor Guadalupe. Primera Hora. 30 August 2013. Retrieved 30 August 2013. Its first elected mayor was José Ortiz de la Renta, who took office in 1812. Ortiz de la Renta occupied the post of mayor on eight occasions between 1812 and 1846. The current mayor of Ponce is María \\"Mayita\\" Meléndez Altieri, from the New Progressive Party, elected in 2008. She became the first woman elected to the office of mayor by the people of Ponce in its extensive political history. She is also the first mayor of a party other than the Popular Democratic Party in Ponce since 1989, when Rafael \\"Churumba\\" Cordero Santiago won the elections and took the oath of office that same year. Throughout the centuries, the Ponce municipal heads of government listed here as \\"mayors\\", may have held titles different than the modern title of \\"Mayor\\". Some of the other titles held were Teniente a guerra, Corregidor, Alcalde mayor, Alcalde ordinario, Justicia mayor, Alcalde constitucional, Alcalde en propiedad, Alcalde real ordinario, and Comandante militar. Regardless of the titles held, the people listed here were the maximum civil authority at the municipal level. In the lists that follow, \\"Alcalde\\" refers to the Spanish colonial position attained via election by the regidores (council members) of the municipal council, and refers to someone who had both judicial and administrative functions. \\"Mayor\\", on the other hand, refers to a local executive, elected by the people, with administrative functions only. ==18th century== Source: Eduardo Neumann Gandía,\\"Verdadera y Auténtica Historia de la Ciudad de Ponce.\\" 1913.

Born in Callington, South Australia. Jack was the son of a miner, Patrick and his wife Julia (née Burns) and was the eldest of three boys, the other two being Mick and Harry. He was educated at state schools before becoming an apprentice wheelwright at Murray Bridge and then worked for Harrisons in Maitland, from where he enlisted. Jack served in the First AIF and fought and was wounded on the Western Front. When he arrived in France he had asked to see his brothers and was told that Mick had been killed and that Harry was at the front. He was blown up in no-man's land near Hill 60 and when he awoke he found himself in hospital in Salisbury, England. Invalided home he obtained a position in the railways at Peterborough. While at Gumbowie (near Peterborough) he had reported for work at the railways when he heard the morse code message coming over the line informing them that his brother Harry had been killed. Jack asked the Station Master, Mr Snigg, to hold the message until he had time to find the Parish priest Father Ed Ryan and together they took the news to his parents. It was at Peterborough that he met Alice Caroline Cave who was selling raffle tickets at the Catholic Bazaar. Jack was so taken by Alice that he bought the entire book of raffle tickets and donated the prize to the Convent. Jack and Alice married in 1919 and had three daughters, Mary (Molly), Pat and Joyce. Jack had been closely involved with the Labor Party from the early days and had in fact been sacked by a firm in Murray Bridge for forming a union. After the war he became a member of the Peterborough Council, President of the local RSL, and Chairman of the Buffalos Lodge. In 1930, he was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly as the Labor member for Burra Burra, serving until 1933. During this time the Party had been split by the Premiers Plan and he was one of those expelled from the Party for the view that the Premiers Plan was the only honourable course to adopt rather than reneging on the debt as advocated by the Lang group. At about that time Jack served on the Royal Commission inquiring into the licensing of bookmakers. In 1936 Jack was invited to rejoin the party and was sent to Frome to assist Mick O'Halloran. Jack also worked at the Motor Vehicles Dept where he ran into some strife when he insisted the rooms that the young female typists sat in had to be cleaned. The girls were frightened as the rooms were full of spiders and filthy. The Manager at that time took objection to what he saw as interference and insisted that Jack, who was on a contract, sit the public service exam. Jack duly sat and passed the exam and the examiner at that time Marcus (later Sir Marcus) Oliphant commented that Jack's was the most unorthodox paper he had ever seen but was correct. During the Second War he worked as an industrial officer in the Rationing Commission in Currie St Adelaide. In 1946, he was elected to the Australian Senate as a Labor Senator for South Australia. Whilst in the Senate he served as Opposition Whip and was an outspoken champion of soldier's repatriation schemes. Jack was sent to a Commonwealth Conference in Canada and en route stopped in Hollywood where he and the other delegates met Cecil B DeMille and Gloria Swanson on the set of Billy Wilder's film Sunset Boulevard. During the split of the mid 1950s Jack, as a Catholic, was offered a senior position with the breakaway Democratic Labor Party which he declined. He held the seat until his retirement in 1958. Jack Critchley died in 1964 surrounded by his loving family who honour his memory to this day. ==References== Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Australian Senate for South Australia Category:Members of the Australian Senate Category:Members of the South Australian House of Assembly Category:1892 births Category:1964 deaths Category:20th-century Australian politicians ","title":"Jack Critchley"},{"id":"20350988","text":"Dromiacea is a group of crabs, ranked as a section. It contains 240 extant and nearly 300 extinct species. Where they are considered to form a monophyletic group, Dromiacea and two other groups of crabs, namely the Raninoida and Cyclodorippoidea, may be collected together into the Podotremata, each at the rank of subsection; morphological and molecular evidence argue against such a grouping. The larvae of Dromiacea resemble those of the Anomura more closely than those of other crabs. This may simply reflect their basal position in the crab phylogeny. The fossil record of Dromiacea reaches back at least as far as the Jurassic, and, if Imocaris is indeed a member, into the Carboniferous. The superfamily Eocarcinoidea, containing Eocarcinus and Platykotta, was previously considered to be a member of the Dromiacea, but has since been transferred to the Anomura. ==References== Category:Crabs Category:Extant Jurassic first appearances Category:Taxa named by Wilhem de Haan ","title":"Dromiacea"},{"id":"20351033","text":"World's Biggest Liar is an annual competition for telling lies, held in Cumbria, England. Competitors from around the world have five minutes to tell the biggest and most convincing lie they can. Competition rules bar the use of props or scripts. Politicians and lawyers are not allowed to enter the competition, because \\"they are judged to be too skilled at telling porkies\\". ==History== The World's Biggest Liar competition is held every November at the Bridge Inn, Santon Bridge, in memory of Will Ritson (1808–1890), a pub landlordSanton Bridge Inn website from Wasdale, who was well known for his \\"tall tales\\". One of Ritson's most famous fibs was that turnips grew so large in the Lake District that people carved them out to make cow sheds. ==Recent competitions== In 2003, Abrie Krueger of South Africa was named the world's biggest liar after telling a story about how he was crowned King of the Wasdale Valley. This marked the first time that a foreigner had won the competition, which was marked with allegations of Krueger having cheated. A Bishop of CarlisleCumberland and Westmorland Herald; Letters, 19 October 2007 was supposed to have once won the competition with the shortest-ever speech; he simply said, \\"I have never told a lie in my life.\\" Comedian Sue Perkins won the competition in 2006, marking the first time in the event's history that a woman won the competition. Her winning tall tale was about how the ozone layer became damaged, ice caps melted and people had to be taken to work on camels. In 2008, John \\"Johnny Liar\\" Graham won the competition for the seventh time after telling the judges a story of a magical ride to Scotland in a wheelie bin that went under the sea. The previous year Graham's winning lie was that a World War II German submarine had invaded Britain to capture digital television decoders. Paul Burrows from Essex won the competition in 2010. He told a story of how the lakes and mountains of the Cumbrian countryside had been stolen from the county of Essex, leaving it as flat as it is today. The 2011 winner was Glen Boylan.

In 1900, he ran for Vice President of the United States along with Eugene Debs on the ticket of the Socialist Party of America. He later twice ran for mayor of Los Angeles, drawing considerable attention and support. He also founded a socialist utopian community called Llano del Rio in California, later relocated to Louisiana. ==BiographyEarly years=== Job Harriman was born on January 15, 1861 in Clinton County, Indiana. He lived on the family farm until he was 18. Harriman's early life was filled with religious influences by his parents, and after graduating Butler University in 1884 he went on into the ministry. Harriman gradually came to doubt the ability of the church to fundamentally affect the lives of common people and to see organized religion as a trap. He recalled in 1902: > \\"It is in doubt and not in faith that the salvation of the world is to be > found. Faith is a delusion and a snare: a pitfall, a prison. It intimidates > the intellect. With fear of eternal damnation religion crushes intellectual > activity; with hero worship it destroys individuality; with hopes for the > beyond it prevents the growth of ideals for the present. It makes of us a > race of intellectual cowards; it changes but little if any our daily conduct > toward each other. But doubt sets us free.\\"Job Harriman, \\"How I Became a > Socialist,\\" The Comrade, vol. 8, no. 1 (May 1902), pg. 170. As Harriman moved away from a belief in spirituality and towards philosophical materialism, he came into contact with socialist literature, being particularly impressed with the 1886 utopian novel Looking Backwards, by Edward Bellamy.Harriman, \\"How I Became a Socialist,\\" pg. 171. In 1886, he moved to San Francisco and established there a local Nationalist Club, dedicated to attempting to put Bellamy's ideas into practice in America. Later, Harriman came into contact with the writings of Karl Marx, which turned his early Christian socialist inclinations towards Marxism. Job Harriman married the sister of a college roommate, Mary Theodosia Gray. In 1895 the couple had twins, a girl and a boy, with the girl dying as a young child. Harriman left the church and took up the study of law, becoming a lawyer and establishing his own law firm. ===Political career=== the 1900 Social Democratic Party of America ticket for President and Vice President of the United States with Eugene V. Debs and Job Harriman portraites Job Harriman was initially a member of the Democratic Party, but as he became conscious of socialist ideas he quit that organization and joined the Socialist Labor Party (SLP). Harriman was a gubernatorial candidate for California on the SLP ticket in 1898. Harriman broke with the SLP during the acrimonious split of 1899, which was largely linked to the SLP's insistence on establishing competing socialist dual unions with the existing trade unions affiliated with the American Federation of Labor. Harriman thereafter was affiliated with the East Coast-based variant of the Social Democratic Party of America (SDP), a group whose members included Henry Slobodin and Morris Hillquit. In 1900 during unity negotiations between the Eastern and Midwestern SDP organizations, Harriman ran for Vice Presidency of the United States on the Social Democratic Party of America ticket along with presidential candidate Eugene V. Debs. Harriman twice ran for Mayor of Los Angeles on the Socialist ticket during the 1910s. In the 1911 primary, he came in first with 44% of the vote. Harriman was one of the lawyers for the McNamara Brothers, along with Clarence Darrow. He was unaware of their guilt, and thus was taken by surprise by a plea bargain negotiated by Darrow, which, unfortunately for Harriman, was announced after the primary but before the general election. His association with the widely reviled McNamaras proved fatal to his campaign, and George Alexander won the election. He ran again in 1913, earning 26% of the vote in the primary. ===Llano Cooperative Colony=== Following the narrow defeat in his second bid for Mayor of Los Angeles, Job Harriman turned his back on electoral politics. He instead sought to establish a self-sufficient community upon socialist principles. Together with a group of like-minded investors he purchased a parcel of land in California's Antelope Valley, which the group named Llano del Rio. The land included water rights — a critical factor due to the location of the land in an oasis in the Mojave Desert. Advertisements were taken in the socialist press and shares sold to interested families for $500 cash. In addition, each family was asked to contribute a minimum of $2000 in personal property to a \\"common storehouse\\" established for the benefit of the entire community. Beginning with just five families, by 1914 the Llano community had grown to over 1,000 people. Tents were replaced by adobe buildings, and various enterprises, such as a sawmill, kiln, cannery, and bakery, were established. The group issued its own monthly magazine, The Western Comrade (later changing its name to The Llano Colonist, with Harriman acting as editor.'Hollywood Bohemia: The Roots of Progressive Politics in Rob Wagner's Script', by Rob Leicester Wagner, Janaway Publishing, 2016 Unfortunately, local farmers began to complain that the socialist community was consuming more than its fair share of precious water, resulting in a stream of lawsuits over the issue. Worse yet, the community proved incapable of advancing beyond a very basic economic level, causing discontent among its members. A new location was found in Leesville, Louisiana in 1918, but the new environs did not suit Harriman and he soon returned home to Los Angeles. The Llano community survived in difficult conditions into the 1930s. ===Death and legacy=== Job Harriman died on October 26, 1925.Solon DeLeon and Nathan Fine (eds.), The American Labor Year Book, 1926.

A professor of physical oceanography at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, she has served as chief scientist on research ships, where she collected oceanographic hydrography data. She has participated in international steering groups and oversight committees for collection and use of oceanographic data. Talley is a Fellow of the American Meteorological Society, the American Geophysical Union, The Oceanography Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. == Early life and education == Talley was born May 18, 1954 in Schenectady, New York. She attended Marple-Newtown High School, Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, graduating in 1971. She received a B.A. in physics in 1976 from Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio and a Bachelor of Music (B.M.) in piano performance from Oberlin Conservatory of Music. The following year, she studied piano performance with Carl Seeman at the Hochschule für Musik Freiburg in Freiburg, Germany. She continued her studies at the New England Conservatory of Music. After moving to San Diego, she studied music at San Diego State University. In 1982, Talley completed a Ph.D. in physical oceanography from the Joint Program in Oceanography at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. After a postdoctoral research position at Oregon State University, she joined the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 1984. == Career and impact == Talley has worked at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California, San Diego since 1984, where she has been a distinguished professor since 2012. While at Scripps, her research has combined analysis of ocean observations with advanced theoretical work to describe and map large-scale circulation. Talley's research focuses on the general circulation of the ocean and the role of oceanic and atmospheric conditions that affect ocean currents and property distributions, including salinity. Her work involves analysis of data from most of the world's oceans, depicting the movement of heat, salinity, and water masses, and the formation of water masses, particularly in subpolar regions. From 2004 to 2007 she was a lead author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC) Working Group and a lead author of the Fourth Assessment Report Working Group I chapter of the group's final report titled: \\"Observations: Oceanic Climate Change and Sea Level\\", which was released in February 2007. The report earned contributing scientists a share of the Nobel Peace Prize later that year. She was also a lead author on the same topic for the Fifth Assessment Report. In addition to academic publications, she has published a graduate level textbook on descriptive physical oceanography, and two oceanographic atlases. Her research and international/national committee work include a focus on ocean climate variability/change. She has played a leadership role in scientific planning and execution of international programs, including the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) of the 1990s and the CLIVAR/CO2 Repeat Hydrography Program of the 2000s to present. In 2000, Talley and co-principal investigator, Daniel Rudnick, worked with moorings and hydrography on the collaborative Okhotsk Sea dense water formation project. In 2005-2006, Talley spent time in the field using hydrography, CTD, and profiling floats to understand Antarctic Intermediate Water formation in the southeast Pacific. Between 2005 and 2007, Talley also participated as part of the CLIMODE team on the CLIVAR Mode Water Dynamics Experiment (CLIMODE)]. In 2009, Talley spent time on sabbatical at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution as a Visiting Scientist. The following year she took sabbatical at the Universite de Grenoble Joseph Fourier for sciences, health, technologies. Talley has a long history of seagoing experiences. As a graduate student in 1978 she joined the hydrography cruise through the Southwestern South Pacific aboard the R/V Knorr. Between 1993 and 1997, Talley returned to the R/V Knorr serving as chief scientist on three WOCE hydrography cruises in the Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, and Subpolar North Atlantic. She has sampled the Pacific and Atlantic waters as part of the WOCE Field Program aboard research vessels including the R/V T. Washington (1984, co-chief scientist; 1991, chief scientist), R/V T. Thompson (1985, chief scientist), R/V Oceanus (1988, co-chief scientist), and R/V Melville (1989, chief scientist). In 1999, Talley served as chief scientist on the R/V Revelle sampling hydrography in the Sea of Japan and then again as co-chief scientist aboard the Khromov in 1999 and 2000. In 2014, she served as chief scientist for the GO-SHIP hydrography, CTC, float deployment cruise in the southern Pacific aboard the R/V N.B. Palmer. Since 2016, Talley has led the observation team of the SOCCOM project: Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling (SOCCOM), which is deploying biogeochemical profiling Argo floats throughout the southern ocean south of 30S. Her research group is involved directly in float, hydrographic and satellite data analysis, interfacing with the Southern Ocean State Estimate and data-model comparisons. She also continues to act as co-chair to the steering committee of the ongoing U.S. GO-SHIP, which organizes and carries out the U.S. component of the international GO-SHIP program of deep-sea hydrographic cruises throughout the world's oceans. == Honors == * 1976 - Sigma Xi * 1976 - Phi Beta Kappa * 1984 - Mellon Foundation Fellowship (Scripps Institution of Oceanography) * 1987 - Presidential Young Investigator (National Science Foundation) * 2001 - Rosenstiel Award (Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, University of Miami) * 2003 - Fellow, American Academy of Arts and Sciences * 2003 - Huntsman Award (Bedford Institute of Oceanography) * 2006 - Fellow, American Geophysical Union * 2008 - Fellow, American Meteorological Society * 2010 - Fellow, The Oceanography Society * 2017 - Prince Albert I Medal International Association for the Physical Sciences of the Oceans (IAPSO) International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics * 2017 - Fridtjof Nansen Medal (European Geosciences Union) * 2017 - Henry Stommel Research Award (American Meteorological Society) * 2017 - Fellow, American Association for the Advancement of Science == References  External links == * Lynne Talley's web page at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography * Lynne Talley on Google Scholar * Map of Lynne Talley's ocean cruises Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:American oceanographers Category:Scripps Institution of Oceanography faculty Category:Scientists from Schenectady, New York Category:People from San Diego Category:Oberlin Conservatory of Music alumni Category:Oberlin College alumni Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni Category:Fellows of the American Geophysical Union Category:American women scientists Category:Women oceanographers Category:Antarctic scientists Category:Women Antarctic scientists Category:Fellows of the American Meteorological Society ","title":"Lynne Talley"},{"id":"20351457","text":"In statistics, the reduced chi-square statistic is used extensively in goodness of fit testing.

In general when: MSWD = 1 if the age data fit a univariate normal distribution in t (for the arithmetic mean age) or log(t) (for the geometric mean age) space, or if the compositional data fit a bivariate normal distribution in [log(U/He),log(Th/He)]-space (for the central age). MSWD < 1 if the observed scatter is less than that predicted by the analytical uncertainties. In this case, the data are said to be \\"underdispersed\\", indicating that the analytical uncertainties were overestimated. MSWD > 1 if the observed scatter exceeds that predicted by the analytical uncertainties. In this case, the data are said to be \\"overdispersed\\". This situation is the rule rather than the exception in (U-Th)/He geochronology, indicating an incomplete understanding of the isotope system. Several reasons have been proposed to explain the overdispersion of (U-Th)/He data, including unevenly distributed U-Th distributions and radiation damage. Often the geochronologist will determine a series of age measurements on a single sample, with the measured value x_i having a weighting w_i and an associated error \\\\sigma_{x_i} for each age determination. As regards weighting, one can either weight all of the measured ages equally, or weight them by the proportion of the sample that they represent. For example, if two thirds of the sample was used for the first measurement and one third for the second and final measurement, then one might weight the first measurement twice that of the second. The arithmetic mean of the age determinations is :\\\\overline{x} = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^N x_i} N, but this value can be misleading, unless each determination of the age is of equal significance. When each measured value can be assumed to have the same weighting, or significance, the biased and unbiased (or \\"sample\\" and \\"population\\" respectively) estimators of the variance are computed as follows: : \\\\sigma^2 = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\\\overline{x})^2}N \\\\text{ and } s^2 = \\\\frac{N}{N-1} \\\\cdot \\\\sigma^2 = \\\\frac{N}{N^2 - N} \\\\cdot \\\\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\\\overline{x})^2. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. When individual determinations of an age are not of equal significance, it is better to use a weighted mean to obtain an \\"average\\" age, as follows: :\\\\overline{x}^* = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i x_i}{\\\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i}. The biased weighted estimator of variance can be shown to be :\\\\sigma^2 = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i (x_i - \\\\overline{x}^*)^2}{\\\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i}, which can be computed on the fly as :\\\\sigma^2 = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i x_i^2 \\\\cdot \\\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i - \\\\big(\\\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i x_i\\\\big)^2}{\\\\big(\\\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i\\\\big)^2}. The unbiased weighted estimator of the sample variance can be computed as follows: :s^2 = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i}{\\\\big(\\\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i\\\\big)^2 - \\\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i^2} \\\\cdot {\\\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i (x_i - \\\\overline{x}^*)^2}. Again, the corresponding standard deviation is the square root of the variance. The unbiased weighted estimator of the sample variance can also be computed on the fly as follows: :s^2 = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i x_i^2 \\\\cdot \\\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i - \\\\big(\\\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i x_i\\\\big)^2}{\\\\big(\\\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i\\\\big)^2 - \\\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i^2}. The unweighted mean square of the weighted deviations (unweighted MSWD) can then be computed, as follows: : \\\\text{MSWD}_u = \\\\frac{1}{N-1} \\\\cdot \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\frac{(x_i - \\\\overline{x})^2}{\\\\sigma_{x_i}^2}. By analogy, the weighted mean square of the weighted deviations (weighted MSWD) can be computed as follows: : \\\\text{MSWD}_w = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i}{\\\\big(\\\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i\\\\big)^2 - \\\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i^2 } \\\\cdot \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\frac{w_i (x_i - \\\\overline{x}^*)^2}{(\\\\sigma_{x_i})^2}. ===Rasch Analysis=== In data analysis based on the Rasch Model, the Reduced Chi-squared statistic is called the Outfit Mean-square statistic, and the information-weighted Reduced Chi-squared statistic is called the Infit Mean-square statistic. ==References== Category:Geochronological dating methods Category:Statistical deviation and dispersion ","title":"Reduced chi-squared statistic"},{"id":"20351469","text":"Henry Joseph Simpson (1856 - 22 March 1911)Joe Simpson player profile ESPN Scrum.com was an English-born international rugby union forward who played club rugby for Cardiff Rugby Football Club and international rugby for Wales.

She was the only daughter and middle child of Max Cremer and Elsbeth Rosmund. Her father, Max Cremer, was a professor of physiology and the inventor of the glass electrode. She had two brothers, Hubert Cremer, a mathematician, and Lothar Cremer, an acoustician. ==Education and early career== Cremer's father moved to a new position in Berlin and Cremer had trouble adjusting to the new Prussian school system. Cremer graduated high school in Berlin in 1921 and matriculated to the University of Berlin to study chemistry. At the University of Berlin, she attended lectures by Fritz Haber, Walther Nernst, Max Planck, Max von Laue, and Albert Einstein. Cremer received her Ph.D. magna cum laude six years later in 1927 under Max Bodenstein. Her dissertation was on the kinetics of the hydrogen-chlorine reaction. The paper was published under her name only because it concluded that the hydrogen-chlorine reaction was a chain reaction, which was still considered an extremely original concept for that time. Because of this paper and her work on kinetics, the future Nobel Laureate for the study of kinetics, Nikolay Semyonov invited her to Leningrad to work. She refused and remained in Germany to work at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry with Karl Friedrich Bonhoeffer on the quantum theoretical problems of photochemistry. Cremer studied the breakdown of alcohols using oxide catalysts on scholarship at the University of Freiburg with George de Hevesy for a brief time. Cremer returned to Berlin to work with Michael Polanyi at Haber's Institut, where they investigated the conversion of hydrogen and ortho-hydrogen in one spin state to para-hydrogen. She remained there until 1933 when the Nazi party came to power in Germany and the institute was dissolved for its reputation as anti- Nazi. Cremer was unable to find work or continue research for four years. ==Scientific career before and during World War II== Cremer joined Otto Hahn at Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry to study radioactive trace compounds in 1937. She moved labs shortly after to concentrate on isotope separation. In 1938, Cremer received her habilitation from the University of Berlin. In any ordinary case, this qualification would lead to faculty positions; however, the Nazi government of the time had passed the Law on the Legal Position of Female Public Servants. The law banned women from senior positions (e.g. professorship) and required women to quit once married. Many women scientists and scholars were left unemployed or limited in career prospects. After World War II began and male scientists and professors were drafted, Cremer was able to obtain a position as a docent in 1940 at the University of Innsbruck in Austria. However, she was informed that she would leave her job once the war had ended and the men came home. Cremer was pleased with her new position and location because she was able to mountain climb, a hobby of hers. == Gas separation discovery and development == At Innsbruck, Cremer researched the hydrogenation of acetylene and found difficulty separating two gases with similar adsorption heats using the common methods of the day. She was aware of the liquid absorption chromatography research going on at Innsbruck, so she thought of a parallel method to separate gases which used an inert carrier gas as the mobile phase. She developed mathematical relationships and equations and instrumentation for the first gas chromatograph. Separate components were detected by a thermal conductivity detector. She initially submitted a short academic paper in 1944 to Naturwissenschaften, which was accepted and she informed them that future experimental work would follow. The paper however was not published at the time, because the journal's printing press was destroyed during air bombardment. It was finally published thirty years later in 1976 at which point it was considered a historical document. In December 1944, the university's facilities were badly damaged in an air bombardment and after the war, Cremer, as a German citizen, was not allowed to use the limited facilities. Fritz Prior was one of her postwar students and a high school chemistry teacher. He chose her idea of the gas chromatograph for his dissertation. Until facilities at the University of Innsbruck were usable again, he used his high school's laboratory to continue Cremer's research with her. When the university partially reopened, Cremer was still temporarily banned from work due to her German citizenship and would secretly visit the university in a delivery truck to continue research. Cremer was allowed to return to her work in late 1945. Prior completed the research demonstrating a novel method for measurements and qualitative and quantitative analysis in 1947. Another student of Cremer's, Roland Müller wrote his dissertation on the analytical possibilities of the gas chromatograph. Cremer was appointed director of the Physical Chemistry Institute at Innsbruck and was made a professor in 1951. Cremer began presenting Prior and Müller's work in 1947 at various scientific meetings. In 1951, three papers on Cremer's work were published in Zeitschrift für Elektrochemie, a lesser known German scientific journal. The scientific community responded to presentations and papers either negatively or not at all. Many believed that older methods were sufficient. In 1952, the British Anthony Trafford James and Archer Porter Martin and in 1953, the Czech J. Janak published reports claiming the invention of gas chromatography. Martin and his partner Richard Laurence Millington Synge won the Nobel Prize for partition chromatography, which is often credited for introducing the use of gas as a mobile phase, in 1952. All were completely ignorant of Cremer's early work. This has been attributed to the fact that Cremer spoke to the wrong people in the wrong places. Austrian analytical and micro chemists did not focus on gases, so the idea did not gain interest. Also, in the post-war years, communication between English and German scientists was poor. Following the new reports, the method of gas chromatography spread widely and Cremer's work slowly gained more recognition. Cremer and her students continued their work on developing both the methods and theories behind gas chromatography over the next two decades and led to many of contemporary, common use ideas used in gas chromatography. Cremer and her group created the phrase \\"relative retention time\\" and how to calculate the peak area through multiplying the peak's height by the width of the peak at half height. Additionally, they demonstrated the relationship between measurement and column temperature and also invented head space analysis. == Later career and death == Cremer continued research at the University of Innsbruck and retired in 1971. She remained active in gas chromatography until almost the end of life. In 1990, an international symposium celebrating her work and her ninetieth birthday was held in Innsbruck. She died in 1996. In 2009, the University of Innsbruck established a program in her name which awards highly qualified women scientist in pursuit of a habilitation degree. == Awards and honors == * Wilhelm Exner Medal, 1958 * Johann Josef Ritter von Precht Medal of the Technical University of Vienna, 1965 * Erwin Schrödinger Prize of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, 1970 * M.S.

They are only known from Cretaceous fossils. These crabs are tentatively placed in the superfamily Portunoidea and resemble the swimming crabs (Portunidae) in having some paddle-shaped pereiopods. But it is not certain that this placement is correct, as the Carcineretidae also show some similarities to the Matutidae of superfamily Leucosioidea and the Goneplacidae of superfamily Xanthoidea. ==Description== Their carapace is usually wider than long and of square or ovate shape. Its epibranchial region is bulbous, and it bears at least one transverse ridge in the protogastric, hepatic or branchial region. Unlike in the living Portunoidea, the front (the part of the carapace above the head) is narrow; it bears a few blunt spines in some species. The hind part of the carapace is also narrowed, tapering from just behind the eyes. Around the eyes, also atypical for portunoideans, the carapace makes a wide curve and is beset with spines and notches. The chelipeds are quite robust – more so than the second to fifth pereiopods – and in some the manus is keeled on the outside. Each \\"paddle\\" is formed by the flattened propodus and dactyls of the fourth and/or fifth pereiopods. At least in males, the first and second sternite are fused, with no suture visible. The suture between sternites 2 and 3 is conspicuous and deep, the one between sternites 3 and 4 incomplete. The eighth sternite is not visible from below.

In the 1956 pre-season AP Poll, Ohio State remained ranked No. 5. In the spring of 1956, the Big Ten conducted an investigation into allegations that Ohio State coach Woody Hayes had provided financial assistance to players in violation of conference rule. Hayes admitted that he had loaned money to players but refused to provide an accounting of the loans. The investigation also discovered a \\"serious irregularity\\" in Ohio State's off-campus work program. In April 1956, the conference placed Ohio State on probation for one year and declared the football team ineligible to play in the 1957 Rose Bowl. ==Game summaries== On September 29, 1956, Ohio State (ranked No. 8 in the AP Poll) defeated Nebraska, 34–7, before a crowd of 82,153 at Ohio Stadium in Columbus, Ohio.

Both organizations ranked undefeated Oklahoma at the No. 1 spot. The AP ranked Ohio State at No. 15, while the UP did not rank Ohio State in its top 20. Only one Ohio State player, guard Jim Parker, was picked by the Associated Press (AP) and/or the United Press (UP) as a first-team player on the 1956 All-Big Ten Conference football team. Parker received first-team honors from both the AP and UP. Parker was also a consensus first-team pick for the 1956 College Football All-America Team. He also ranked ninth in the 1956 Heisman Trophy voting. Parker was also awarded the Outland Trophy. ==1957 NFL Draft== The following Ohio State players were selected in the 1957 NFL Draft: { width=\\"80%\\" - align=\\"center\\" C0C0C0;\\"  Player  Round  Pick  Position  NFL Club - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\"  Jim Parker  1  8  Tackle  Baltimore Colts - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\"  Bill Michael  2  16  Guard  Pittsburgh Steelers - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\"  Jim Roseboro  11  124  Back  Green Bay Packers - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\"  Bill Cummings  11  125  Tackle  Cleveland Browns - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\"  Hubert Bobo  13  146  Linebacker  Philadelphia Eagles - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\"  Joe Cannavino  16  185  Defensive back  Baltimore Colts - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\"  Dick Guy  18  212  Guard  San Francisco 49ers - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\"  Aurelius Thomas  22  257  Guard  Pittsburgh Steelers - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\"  Andy Okulovich  27  319  Back  Cleveland Browns - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\"  Don Vicic  27  320  Back  San Francisco 49ers - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\"  Lee Williams  30  351  Back  Los Angeles Rams } ==References== ;Win/Loss statistics * Ohio State Historical Scores ;Draft data * Ohio State Drafted Players Ohio State Category:Ohio State Buckeyes football seasons Buckeyes ","title":"1956 Ohio State Buckeyes football team"},{"id":"20351684","text":"Capillaria plica (dog bladder worm) is a parasitic nematode which is most often found in the urinary bladder, and occasionally in the kidneys, of dogs and foxes. It has also been found in the domestic cat, and various wild mammals. Its presence usually produces no clinical symptoms, but in some cases, it leads to hematuria (blood in the urine), cystitis (inflammation of the urinary bladder), or difficulty in urination. ==Taxonomy and Description== This species was originally described in 1819, and named Capillaria plica. In 1982, the suggestion was made that C. plica be transferred to the genus Pearsonema Freitas & Mendonça 1960, as Pearsonema plica. Currently, both names are used in the literature with roughly equal frequency. For example, searches of the PubMed database performed on 22 Nov 2008 yielded the same number of hits dated 2000 or later using either Capillaria plica or Pearsonema plica. ==Hosts and distribution== Capillaria plica is often found in the urine, urinary bladder or kidneys of dogs and cats in North America, Europe, Asia and Africa. It has also been identified in the urinary bladder and kidneys of several wild mammals in North America and Europe: * American badger (Taxidea taxus; North America) * American mink (Mustela vison; in introduced European populations) * Brown bear (Ursus arctos; Russia) * Coyote (Canis latrans; North America) * European badger (Meles meles; Europe) * European mink (Mustela lutreola; Europe) * Fisher (Martes pennanti; North America) * Lynx (Felis lynx; Lithuania) * Marten (Martes americanus; North America) * Masked shrew (Sorex cinereus; North America) * Northern short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda; North America) * Raccoon (Procyon lotor; North America) * Raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides; Europe) * Red fox (Vulpes vulpes; North America and Europe) * Skunk (Mephitis mephitis; North America) * Wolf (Canis lupus; Europe) ==Life cycle== In dogs and cats, eggs of Capillaria plica are released in the urine of the mammalian definitive host. First stage larvae (L1) develop within the eggshell in 30–36 days. When eaten by the intermediate host -- earthworms of the genera Lumbricus or Dendrobaena—the L1 larvae hatch in the earthworm's intestine. The larvae burrow through the intestinal wall and become embedded in connective tissue throughout the worm's body. If the earthworm is eaten by a suitable mammalian host, the larvae molt into second stage larvae (L2), burrow through the intestinal wall, and molt again into third stage larvae (L3). The L3 are carried through the circulatory system to the glomeruli of the kidneys. From there, they travel down the ureter to the urinary bladder. By 33 days post-infection, third (L3) and fourth-stage larvae (L4) are found in the urinary bladder. Here they mature into adults and reproduce sexually, shedding fertilized eggs into the urine of the host within about 60 days of infection.Olsen, O.W. (1974) \\"Capillaria plica (Rudolphi, 1819)\\". In: Animal Parasites: Their Life Cycles and Ecology. Third Edition. Dover: New York. , pp. 506-507. Detailed life cycle studies have not been carried out with wild animal definitive hosts. ==Prevalence== Prevalence rates of up to 50% in wild hosts and 76% in kennel dogs have been reported. ==Clinical symptoms== Most infected animals exhibit no clinical symptoms. In cases of heavy infestation, symptoms may include cystitis (inflammation of the urinary bladder), mild proteinuria (protein in the urine), and hematuria (blood in the urine). Mild inflammation of the ureter has also been reported.(PDF) ==Diagnosis and treatment== Diagnosis in cases of hematuria or cystitis is made by finding eggs in the urine sediment. Successful treatment with levamisole, ivermectin or fenbendazole has been reported. == References  External links == * Capillaria plica infection.

He joined the East India Company as a cadet, travelling to Bombay, and was soon engaged in mercantile pursuits, eventually becoming the earliest British merchant to plant indigo, and becoming extremely wealthy in the process. Prinsep subsequently returned to England, where he became a London alderman and a member of parliament, but he eventually lost both large fortunes he created. He was the progenitor of an Anglo-Indian family of merchants, all of whom were artistically gifted. ==Life== John Prinsep was born on 23 April 1748, the son of Rev. John Prinsep, BA graduate of Balliol College, Oxford and vicar of Bicester, Oxfordshire.History of the Present Deanery of Bicester, Oxfordshire, James Charles Blomfield, Elliot Stock, London, 1882The Rev. John Prinsep was the son of Reginald Prinsep, 'Gent.,' of Tamworth, Staffordshire. The young Prinsep arrived in Bombay in 1771 as a cadet, shortly after the arrival of Warren Hastings as the first Governor-General of Bengal. The vicar's son and former London cloth merchant arrived in Calcutta with almost nothing to his name. \\"I landed with my baggage at the Custom House,\\" Prinsep recalled in an unpublished memoir, \\"and proceeded to the 'Punch House' in the Bazaar with ten guineas that I had borrowed from my friend to bear my expenses till I should have presented myself to the Fort Major.\\"The Search for the Buddha: The Men who Discovered India's Lost Religion, Charles Allen, Published by Carroll & Graf Publishers, 2003 It was an inauspicious beginning, but like so many other English arrivals in India, it was fraught with the frisson of Empire and ambition. In spite of being nearly penniless, Prinsep arrived with a valuable commodity: letters of introduction. Soon, he discovered, Calcutta was not London. \\"I could not help being surprised at the hospitality offered me,\\" Prinsep later wrote, \\"for, once respectably introduced, I found myself at home everywhere. No formality, no stiffness or reserve, everybody happy to receive the stranger.\\" The point of view would be echoed by the English ever since, down to E. M. Forster. Prinsep was apparently distracted by commercial opportunities almost on arrival. He never joined the Army, and resigned his commission in 1772, the year after his arrival in India. A servant of the East India Company, Prinsep became close friends with Warren Hastings, an opportune relationship which served him well.New Arabian Studies, J. R. Smart, G. Rex Smith, B. R. Pridham, Published by Presses Université Laval, 2000 It was his friend Hastings who first secured for Prinsep his lucrative hold on the production of indigo.A Man of the Enlightenment in Eighteenth-century India: The Letters of Claude Martin, 1766-1800, Claude Martin, Rosie Llewellyn-Jones, France Embassade (India), Published by Orient Blackswan, 2003 The young Prinsep lost his father and two of his sisters to an outbreak of fever in 1768. By then Prinsep seems to have taken up employment in the cotton trade of the East India Company, having worked before his arrival in India in several London merchant houses specialising in fabrics.Selections from the Calcutta Review, No. I-VI, Thomas S. Smith, Calcutta, 1881 Within a few years, though, Prinsep discovered indigo. In 1779 Prinsep introduced the cultivation and manufacture of indigo at a factory (plantation) located in Nilgang, near Baraset. Indigo was also being grown in South Carolina for export to England as textile dye, but Prinsep's establishment of the Indian indigo business, simultaneously with the Revolutionary War having slashed American indigo export to England, meant that the Indian producers soon controlled the market.The new Indian indigo producers, led by Prinsep, had an edge over their American counterparts in the South. They had an easier time gaining access to cheap labour, American slavery notwithstanding, as well as an easier time inculcating their workers with the skills needed to harvest indigo, and had invested in large plantations. Their American counterparts had been devastated by the Revolutionary War, as well as an inopportune series of natural disasters such as floods, droughts and pests. The business was apparently profitable from the outset, to the extent that within a year Prinsep opened a copper mint at Pulta in 1780 under authority of the government, after he and Alexander Cunningham discovered the copper mines at Rotasgarh, producing the first copper coinage in India. Prinsep also traded on his background in the textile business, opening a cotton fabric printing plant in Bengal, as well as acting for ten years as the chintz contractor for the East India Company, an enormously successful venture.Thacker's Guide to Calcutta, Walter Kelly Firminger, Thacker, Spink & Co., Calcutta, 1906 (The chintz venture involved adapting British calico-making techniques to making a cloth called chintz.) In a few years, Prinsep's near-monopoly had made the country vicar's son one of the wealthiest men in India. In 1782 he married Sophia Elizabeth Auriol (1760–1850), sister of James Peter Auriol, secretary to government during Warren Hastings' administration. She was a descendant of an old French Huguenot family from Chartres.Essays on Indian Antiquities, Historic, Numismatic, and Palæographic, of the Late James Prinsep, Vol. I, Edward Thomas, John Murray, London, 1858 By 1773, Prinsep's connections had paid off: he was named an Alderman of the Mayor's Court. For some years afterwards Prinsep's legendary business acumen, first proved to the East India Company when he was still in the fabric business in England and gave advice on improving the Company's fabric business, resulted in his being named Assistant Superintendent of Investments for the Company. By this time Prinsep had set himself up in regal digs in the village of Monirampur close to the Phulta waterworks which supplied Calcutta with drinking water. As soon as Prinsep began generating returns on his early investments, he did what other successful English merchants had done: he bought the ships with which he traded. No longer would he be at the mercy of the shipping fleet.A Register of Ships, Employed in the Service of the Honourable United East India Company, from the Year 1760 to 1810: With an Appendix, Containing a Variety of Particulars, and Useful Information Interesting to Those Concerned with East India Commerce, Charles Hardy, Horatio Charles Hardy, Published by Black, Parry, and Kingsbury, 1811 By 1788 Prinsep left India and decamped for home, arriving in London with an enormous £40,000 fortune - primarily derived from his indigo ventures - which he used to set himself up in business as an East India agent and Italian silk merchant, a step made easier by his role as an East India Company shareholder.The Holland Park Circle: Artists and Victorian Society, Caroline Dakers, Yale University Press, 1999 Back in England, Prinsep proved to be a vocal, if not particularly subtle, advocate for the unencumbered rights of English merchants. One tract he authored in 1793, for instance, was entitled: \\"The right in the West India merchants to a Double Monopoly of the Sugar Market and the Expedience of all Monopolies Examined.\\"Catalogue of the Books in the Manchester Free Library, Manchester Public Libraries, Vol. 3, C. Sever, printed by H. Blacklock & Co., Manchester, 1881 Prinsep simultaneously urged a government policy of opening up the India market to the free competition of British merchants, a policy eventually adopted, but one which he was not able to participate in due to financial reversals resulting from the market crisis occasioned at the end of the American War of Independence. In 1780 Prinsep wrote to Lord North while still in Calcutta \\"outlining his intention of introducing indigo, sugar and tobacco into Britain from South Asia\\", wrote historian H. V. Bowen in his The Business of Empire. \\"He did so with the belief that a 'richer tribute may by such means be drawn from Bengal than is furnished by the present almost worn out system of investing it in manufactures which are every day falling in estimation at home since European industry has adopted such variety of imitation and improvement on the fabricks of the East.\\"The Business of Empire: The East India Company and Imperial Britain, 1756-1833, H. V. Bowen, Cambridge University Press, 2006 Prinsep continued to write, sometimes under pseudonyms, to put across his political views. In modern parlance, he would probably be called a 'spinner,' so anxious was he to advance his economic and social agenda.Romantic Readers: The Evidence of Marginalia, H. J. Jackson, Yale University Press, 2005, , John Prinsep subsequently launched himself on an auspicious political career, as well as purchasing an enormous frescoed mansion at 147 Leadenhall Street, London, which would later become part of the East India Company's offices, as well as Thoby Priory in Essex. Back in London, Prinsep became one of the founders of the Westminster Life Assurance Society. He served as MP for , Kent, from 1802-06, as a London alderman from 1804-09, and, following financial reverses, as High Bailiff for Southwark from 1817-24. Prinsep also served as Master of the Worshipful Company of Skinners of London.Some Account of the Worshipful Company of Skinners of London, James Foster Wadmore, Published by Blades, East & Blades, London, 1902 Prinsep died in London on 30 November 1830.Dictionary of Indian Biography, Charles Edward Buckland, Swan Sonnenschein & Co., London, 1906 He was survived by seven sons, most of whom became Anglo-Indian merchants and English businessmen, artists and gentlemen farmers. All seven attained official positions of authority while still in India, including Henry Thoby Prinsep who served as a director of the East India Company.Annual Register: 1878, Edmund Burke, Rivingtons, London, 1879 Henry's son Val Prinsep, and John's youngest son Augustus Prinsep were notable artists. Prinsep and his wife had one daughter. Prinsep Ghat in today's Kolkata is named for the Anglo-Indian family and its long legacy to the subcontinent, from the scholarship and artistry of some family members to the naked imperialism of others. ==See also== * Croxall Hall, Prinsep ==References== Category:1748 births Category:1830 deaths Category:People from Bicester Category:Alumni of Balliol College, Oxford Category:UK MPs 1802–1806 Category:Europeans in India Category:British East India Company people Category:Merchants from London Category:People from Essex Category:19th- century English people Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for English constituencies ","title":"John Prinsep"},{"id":"20351726","text":"Ryan J.

Nurses represent a majority of rural public health workers. New York relies on a county-based system for delivery of public health services. NYSDOH promotes the prevention and disease control, environmental health, healthy lifestyles, and emergency preparedness and response; supervises local health boards; oversees reporting and vital records; conducts surveillance of hospitals; does research at the Wadsworth Center; and administers several other health insurance programs and institutions. 58 local health departments offer core services including assessing community health, disease control and prevention, family health, and health education; 37 localities provide environmental health services, while the other 21 rely on NYSDOH. At the local level, public health workers are found not only in local health agencies but also in private and nonprofit organizations concerned with the public's health. The most common professional disciplines are physicians, nurses, environmental specialists, laboratorians, health educators, disease investigators, outreach workers, and managers, but also includes allied health professions: dentists, social workers, nutritionists, anthropologists, psychologists, economists, political scientists, engineers, information technology specialists, public health informaticians, epidemiologists, biostatisticians, and lawyers. Nurses represented 22% of the localities' workforce (and 42% of full-time equivalent workers in rural localities), scientific/investigative staff represented 22%–27% of the workforce, support staff represented 28%, education/outreach staff represented 10%, and physicians represented 1%. In 2018 the NYSDOH had over 3300 personnel in its central office, three regional offices, three field offices and nine district health offices, and an additional 1400 personnel in its five healthcare institutions. ==History== The 1858 Staten Island Quarantine War was a series of attacks on the New York Marine Hospital in Staten Island The earliest New York state laws regarding public health were quarantine laws for the port of New York, first passed by the New York General Assembly in 1758. The 1793 Philadelphia yellow fever epidemic precipitated the 1799–1800 creation of the New York Marine Hospital, and in 1801 its resident physician and the health officers of the port were constituted as the New York City board of health. The 1826–1837 cholera pandemic precipitated further legislation. In 1847 a law mandated civil registration of vital events (births, marriages, and deaths). In 1866, the state legislature passed the Metropolitan Health Law and established the NYC Metropolitan Board of Health, and in 1870 the legislature replaced it with the NYC Department of Health.Chapter 74 of the Laws of 1866, volume 1, pages 114–144, enacted 26 February 1866, at § 5.Chapter 137, Laws of 1870, enacted 5 April 1870, page 373, at § 30; and also page 388, at § 90 et seq. The State Board of Health was created 18 May 1880 by the 103rd Legislature.Chapter 322 of the Laws of 1880, pages 465–468, enacted 18 May 1880, at § 13. The 1881–1896 cholera pandemic further caused an expansion of its powers to compel reporting and to perform the duties of local boards of health. The State Department of Health and its commissioner were created by an act of 19 February 1901 of the 124th Legislature, superseding the board.Chapter 29 of the Laws of 1901, pages 31–37, enacted 19 February 1901, at § 4. ==List of commissioners== {  !

He has participated in many of Australia's most significant art exhibitions including the first Biennale of Sydney (1973), the 1973, 1975 and 1978 Mildura Sculpture Triennials, the 1981 Australian Perspecta, the 2nd Australian Sculpture Biennale, and the 1990 Sculpture Triennial. Jenyns was a finalist in the 2006 Helen Lempriere National Sculpture Award, and in 2007 won the award with his work Pont de l'archeveche. He is represented in many of the country's largest collections, including the National Gallery of Australia, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the Queensland Art Gallery, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Brisbane, and the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery. Jenyns has also received multiple grants from the Australia Council's Visual Arts Board, has curated exhibitions and has taught at the Tasmanian School of Art as head of the sculpture department (1982–2005). Bob Jenyns is married to ceramic artist Lorraine Jenyns. Both live and work in Tasmania, Australia. == Style == Jenyns' work is distinctive in style, which has remained relatively consistent throughout his lengthy artistic career. His art is identifiable by his persistent use of figuration, his use of a naive or Outsider Aesthetic, distinct sense of humour, a handcrafted aesthetic, the tableaux or narrative as artistic strategies, the celebration of the everyday and the frequent reference to political, cultural and social events as well as personal experience. == A Naive Aesthetic == Of the few critics that have written on Jenyns, most refer to the 'naive' or Outsider Aesthetic evident in his work. James Gleeson in 1973, for instance, labelled Jenyns as 'pop-naive';Gleeson cited in Scarlett, Ken. Australian Sculptors, Melbourne: Nelson, 1980, p.288 and Bernice Murphy believes that Jenyns' approach to form 'is allied to tribal art or direct vernacular forms in popular culture, rather than to the formal tradition of Western sculpture.'Murphy, Bernice. Australian Perspecta 1981, [catalogue] Sydney: Art Gallery of New South Wales, 1981, p. 99 Graeme Sturgeon believes that this aesthetic 'suggests that Jenyns is a naive artist viewing everything with an apparently wide-eyed innocence.'Sturgeon, Graeme. Australian Sculpture Now: Second Australian Sculpture Triennial, [catalogue essay] Melbourne: National Gallery of Victoria, 1984, p. 38 However, all agree that this exterior is deceptive, with Sturgeon adding that 'one suspects, that behind the apparently ingenuous exterior… there lies another, more profound reality, which will be well worth discovering.'Sturgeon, Graeme. Australian Sculpture Now: Second Australian Sculpture Triennial, [catalogue essay] Melbourne: National Gallery of Victoria, 1984, p. 38 Under Jenyns' profile in Australian Sculptors, Ken Scarlett acknowledges that > His work certainly has the appearance of naivety, but it also contains a > sophisticated wit … Is the sculptor really naive? Is he pulling the > spectator's leg? Is he making fun of art and the whole gallery > scene?Scarlett, Ken. Australian Sculptors, Melbourne: Nelson, 1980, p. 288 Jenyns' enthusiastic embrace of the Outsider Aesthetic appears to stem from a number of different experiences and sources. Firstly, his childhood experience of making toys out of salvaged materials has subsequently affected his treatment of materials and form later in his professional artistic career. Secondly, Jenyns has long held an interest in Folk, Naive and outsider art, which has also clearly influenced his style. Lastly, his use of the Outsider Aesthetic serves as a strategy in order to express his disapproval of certain aspects of the art establishment. For Jenyns, the Outsider Aesthetic is symbolic of individual expression, and is a way of challenging dictated notions of taste and high art.Pers. comm. Jenyns. 21 May 2007 == Humour == In Jenyns' art, humour exists in a number of different forms. His titles often include puns (such as Putting Money Where Your Mouse Is (1967)), and his subjects are parodied (for example Humble Hero (c. 1984)), although generally in a good-humoured manner. His clever observations of social, political and cultural structures, and celebration of everyday objects and events, are humorously captured in his work, and the many works which celebrate these easily forgotten moments of life are amusing simply due to their banality (Dog (1993)). Satire is mostly used by Jenyns in a subtle manner, emerging in quietly subversive works that hide behind a naive exterior; however, occasionally Jenyns produces blatantly critical works which use ironic humour to air political or cultural disapproval (Meanwhile... Down South In Tasmania (2005)). Additionally, his novel use of materials and techniques to produce works of art regularly undermine traditional notions of high and low art. == Representation == Bob Jenyns is represented by Watters Gallery in Sydney.
