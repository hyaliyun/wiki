The school has approximately 1,516 pupils and around 185 teaching staff. The school specialises in Modern Languages and Humanities. It has been awarded International school status by the British Council. The most recent inspection from Ofsted achieved an overall effectiveness rating of 'Good'.https://files.api.ofsted.gov.uk/v1/file/2747443 The Piggott School has a long established exchange programme with the Ville-Gymnasium Schoolhttps://ville-gymnasium.de/ der Erftstadt, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, and other programmes with I.E.S.

It is a partner school of the EU organised Comenius project. The Piggott School is also the only church of England secondary school in the Reading, Twyford area. The Piggott School is one of the best performing secondary schools in the Wokingham District. ==History== The Piggott School was founded by Robert Piggott, a philanthropist, to cater for 20 poor boys and 20 poor girls in separate schools. The foundation stone was laid on 12 October 1939 it was officially opened on 17 September 1940.http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/education/s/2058367_piggott_school_to_celebrate_70_years The school was originally built for 320 children. When was opened in 1940, it was already too small because war had broken out and a massive evacuation programme was underway (two million children were moved from London to the countryside within three days). This caused a doubling of the local population of children and far more pupils had to be accommodated by the school. Morning school was therefore organised for 'home' children. Afternoon school was for the 'visitors'. ==Recent and future changes== Since becoming an academy, there have been several changes to the new site. In 2011, a new sixth form block was opened to replace the old sixth form block (now used as a drama studio and extra classroom). A purpose built gym run by Nuffield Health was constructed on the site of the old Maths and Business Studies terrapins, which is open to the public on evenings and weekends. ( Nuffield no longer run the gym) ==Houses== Piggott School sweatshirt. Note: Pupil is in Thames house hence the colour. The four houses are: St Patricks Thames Kennet Loddon Loddon house is named after the River Loddon in Berkshire and Hampshire. The emblem is a Lion. Thames house is named after the River Thames which runs through several cities and towns, the emblem is a dragon. Kennet house is named after the River Kennet which runs through Reading, the emblem is a green dragon. St Patrick's house is named after St Patrick's Stream, a backwater of the Thames that flows into the Loddon, the emblem is a harp. The current school sweatshirt (since 2011) comes with the school house; the logo can either be red for Thames, blue for St Patricks, green for Kennet, and yellow for Loddon. The old school sweatshirt consisted of only a gold writing and no house badge underneath. There are many competitions between these four houses, including, rugby, football, netball, hockey, sports day, the governors cup and many more. ==Church Status== The Piggott School is a school with a Church Foundation. ==Ofsted== The school is very high achieving in the terms of results, OfSTED and SIAMS inspections. In its latest Ofsted inspection, carried out 29-30 November 2017, the school achieved the following ratings: {  -  Overall effectiveness Good -  Effectiveness of leadership and management Outstanding -  Quality of teaching, learning and assessment Good -  Personal development, behaviour and welfare Outstanding -  Outcomes for pupils Good -  Early years provision Good -  16 to 19 study programmes Outstanding } ==Facilities== The Piggott School has a soldering works area, clay area, modelling areas such as making D.I.Y, a Arts Studio and a very large sports field which runs alongside the railway tracks towards Wargrave railway station. In 2011 there was a brand new sixth form block opened. Students are shown how to use a range of tools and equipment safely across a range of projects that are designed to enhance and build upon the skills they learn. They are encouraged to work in a methodical and organised way, assessing their work as it progresses. Projects are designed to provide experience of processes and skills from graphics and layout; to cutting and assembling wood to build freestanding structures; the selection and preparation of ingredients in food technology and the use of components in simple electronic circuits, this is supported by Wokingham Secondary Federation. A new block, similar to that if the sixth form building, was constructed in mid 2013. This contains a mixture of Maths and science facilities but also a gym that is operated by Nufield Health. This block was built on the south of the site. ==Leadership team== *Mr Derren Gray, Head Teacher *Mrs Rebecca Alexander, Deputy Head Teacher (Music) *Mr Alex Macleod, Acting Deputy Head Teacher (Geography) *Mr David Thatcher, Assistant Head Teacher (PE) *Mrs Viki Hunt, Assistant Head Teacher (English) *Mrs Karen Thornton, Assistant Head Teacher (Art) *Mrs Michelle Bird, Assistant Head Teacher (History) {  style=\\"float: right; font-size:70%; margin-left: 1em;\\" - !

It connects the Lair Hill neighborhood with the South Waterfront area. It is a steel box girder bridge, a change from the original plans for an extradosed bridge, made to reduce the project's cost. The bridge crosses I-5 and SW Macadam Avenue, and connects SW Kelly Avenue on the west side to SW Moody Avenue on the east side. At the Moody Avenue end there is a stop on the Portland Streetcar's NS Line, and the Portland Aerial Tram's lower terminus is located across the street. Construction began in January 2011 and was completed in June 2012.Home page, Gibbs Street Pedestrian Bridge Project Retrieved June 23, 2012. ==Background== The elevator tower and stairway at the bridge's east end, at Moody Avenue The east terminus under construction summer 2011 The project dates back to 2005 with approval of the federal Transportation Equity Act of 2005 which dedicated $5 million to the project. The preliminary design was approved by the Portland City Council on December 3, 2008. It was originally to be an extradosed-type bridge. In the first round of bidding, the project exceeded the allotted budget, and consequently needed to be rescaled. This in turn delayed the timeline and led to a simpler design. After undergoing technical engineering design and detailed neighborhood impact assessment, the refined project was opened to bidding in autumn 2010, and the city council awarded a $6.7 million construction contract to Wildish Standard Paving Company of Eugene. The overall budget, originally anticipated to be between $7 million and $11.3 million, is expected to be met mostly by federal funds, with ten percent local funding. Early public opinion was mixed, but turned favorable as the plan progressed, particularly by those living nearby. One of the provisions of the 2002‚Äì2006 tram construction was to bury existing powerlines in the underlying neighborhoods, but those plans were dropped when the highly controversial tram project encountered significant budget overruns. The pedestrian bridge was another mitigating concession promised. The $11.3 million congressional allotment may have been to also pay for a study to improve access to the Ross Island Bridge. Eastbound traffic for the bridge frequently clogs the Lair Hill neighborhood while waiting to merge. Mayor Sam Adams has said that whatever funds are left over from the Gibbs Bridge project can be used for studying the Ross Island auto-access problem. The bridge was dedicated on July 14, 2012, and given the formal name US Congresswoman Darlene Hooley Pedestrian Bridge at Gibbs Street in honor of retired representative Darlene Hooley. ==Description, usage== The west terminus, at Gibbs Street and Kelly Avenue, looking east To compensate for the 70-foot elevation difference at the ends of the bridge, an elevator and a bicycle stairway was built at the South Waterfront end to serve the five-story height. It includes a 132-step stairway with rest areas. Estimates of existing demand indicate that if the bridge opened in 2009, summertime usage would total 466 crossings per day, composed half of bicycle use and half pedestrian use. With school in session, fall usage is expected to increase to 730 crossings per day: 310 by bicycle and 420 pedestrians. By 2035, usage is estimated at 3,000 to 4,000 crossings per day.Tresidder, p. 24 The Portland Bureau of Transportation took counts at the bridge in September 2014.

This process typically involves removing the drain(An important step that improves coating life-span but is not always possible) and repairing any damaged areas, including checking to see if the bathtub holds water after draining. Chips or cracks are repaired using Bondo or another type of polyester putty. After repairs are made the surface is prepped with an acid etching. Etching and wet sanding provide mechanical adhesion and clean the surface. Porcelain, enamel, and fiberglass tubs are non-porous and do not provide a good substrate for the new coating to attach to. Etching the surface provides a porous surface that will allow proper adhesion. Another possible method is to apply an adhesion-promoting bonding agent like silane to the surface before applying the coating. The two methods can be used in unison or independently. The greatest adhesion is generally achieved by using both methods together however, some newer refinishing processes claim they do not require the use of etching, by relying on silane alone. After preparing the surface, Prior to spraying any chemical coatings, most refinishers will protect themselves and their clients by completely masking the areas that can be affected by overspray and setting up a professional exhaust system rated to work with the type of coating system being applied. This is important for many reasons, the greatest being a possible fire or explosion hazard. Then the refinisher will use a NIOSH-rated fresh-air supplied breathing apparatus to and spray suite and gloves to protect themselves from the chemicals being used in the process. They also provide assistance with the quality of the spraying. By using at least a 1200-cfm exhaust unit, the refinisher can see better and may limit the overspray and settling on the surface. primer (if used), is then applied, followed by a topcoat. Generally, a catalyzed two-component cross-link synthetic white coating is applied, but the coating does not have the durability or abrasive tolerance of the original glass-enamel coating of a factory-new bathtub. The coating should be in most cases between 5-8 mils in thickness when cured to provide the best, longterm results. This is typically achieved by spraying 2-coats of primer, and 3-coats of top-coat. A very experienced refinisher may be able to accomplish this with fewer coats depending on conditions. After spraying is complete, the refinisher will pick up the equipment and remove the masking and garbage from the home. A new caulk line can be installed and the drain replaced. Coatings used to create a new bathtub finish can be epoxies, urethanes, hybrid polyester-polyurethane, or polymers. These coatings may be rolled, brushed, or sprayed on. Bathtub refinishing is possible using DIY kits from hardware stores, but some may choose a professional service company offering refinishing services. DIY kits generally do not offer the same level of bonding and thus, deteriorate more quickly, relying primarily on epoxy adhesion. Without professional spray equipment, the final aesthetic look may show brush or roller marks. Slipping resistance can be added to the bathtub coating to provide a slip-resistant area to the bottom of the tub during the refinishing process as well. In general, when professionally refinished using professional products, the surface with act as a new tub surface and be very slippery when wet. There are also semi-permanent mats available on the market that stick to the surface. They may be more difficult to clean and do not have the life expectancy of many coating systems. Rubber mats are almost always discouraged by the manufactures and they tend to void the warranty in various ways. Suction-cup mats cause water to be trapped. Water is also commonly trapped under bottles and toys. Sometimes, Bathtubs have manufacture defects or even settle in unexpected ways causing water to not drain from the surface. All of these issues will generally cause the coating to delaminate(peel) over time. anything that can keep the surface wet and not allow for dry time after use will be a problem. In most cases, the refinisher will be able to tell why a surface is peeling and will not repair the surface under warranty these instances. ==Hazards== Findings from the Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation (FACE) program have identified at least 14 worker deaths since 2000 related to the usage of methylene chloride for bathtub refinishing. Products containing high percentages of methylene chloride are used as stripping agents in the process, to remove the old coating on the bathtubs. In an unventilated setting, overexposure to methylene chloride vapors can affect brain function and result in death in the short term, with possible carcinogenic effects in the long term. Measures to prevent overexposure to methylene chloride include the use of stripping agents relying on other chemicals instead, the implementation of adequate local exhaust ventilation, and the provision of appropriate personal protective equipment (i.e. respirators). Using long- handled tools can also decrease workers' proximity from the product, with beneficial effects. Professional refinishers will often provide the end-user with after-care instructions and warranty or guaranty information. Pay attention to the cleaning and care recommendations to avoid warranty issues. Cleaning in most cases can be best accomplished using a mild dish-soap degreaser like Dawn(Be sure to avoid cleaners with acids or other chemicals the manufacture recommends avoiding). Plugging the tub to hold some water to cover the bottom, mix some cleaner in and agitate, then rub the surface with the sponge. For best results or to clean especially dirty tubs, let the cleaner sit on the surface for up to 20-minutes. This allows the cleaner to break down the dirt and oils to be more easily removed. Waxing the surface around the drain, and in other areas that are not stood or sat on can also assist in keeping the surface like new and improve coating life. Special to note in the cleaning is the caulk line. Take care not to rub on the caulk to the point that it becomes no longer adhered to the tub or wall surface. This will allow water to become trapped and cause peeling. Damaged caulk should always be replaced immediately. ==See also== * Bathroom * Bathtub * Home improvement * Home repair * Hot tub * Jacuzzi * Shower ==References *OSHA/NIOSH Hazard Alert: Methylene Chloride Hazards for Bathtub Refinishers Category:Home improvement Category:Maintenance Category:Reuse ","title":"Bathtub refinishing"},{"id":"20558648","text":"\\"Dirty Dancing\\" is the third overall single from New Kids on the Block's 2008 album, The Block.

Destroyed again during World War II, the church was re-constructed in its modern form. This is the fourth building dedicated to Mary Magdalene built in the city since the 13th century. The church is classified as a historic monument by a decree of 6 December 1898. Eglise Sainte-Madeleine ==History and architecture== The first convent dedicated to Mary Magdalene was built in 1225 on the outskirts of the city of Strasbourg, on the site of the current place de la R√©publique. The institution, which welcomed repentant prostitutes, was evacuated and then destroyed around 1470, since the city feared imminent invasion by the armies of the Duke of Burgundy.Historical details on Sainte- Madeleine Church A new convent was rebuilt in the Krutenau district. The Gothic church of the convent of the sisters of the order of St. Mary Magdalene (Ordo Sanctae Mariae of magdalenae poenitentia), completed in 1478, was destroyed by fire in 1904. All that remains of this church, the last Gothic structure built in Strasbourg, is the choir housing fragments of some frescoes. It now serves as a chapel, dedicated to the Blessed Sacrament.

Although a few compositions for this ensemble were produced over the following years, including the Op. 34 clarinet quintet by Carl Maria von Weber, a composer famous for his solo clarinet compositions, it was not until Johannes Brahms composed his Clarinet Quintet in B minor, Op. 115 for Richard M√ºhlfeld that the clarinet quintet began to receive considerable attention from composers. ==Works for clarinet quintet== * Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart ‚Äì Clarinet Quintet in A major, K. 581 (1789) * Carl Maria von Weber ‚Äì Clarinet Quintet in B major, Op. 34 (1811‚Äì1815) * Giacomo Meyerbeer ‚Äì Clarinet Quintet in E major (1813) * Anton Reicha ‚Äì Clarinet Quintet in B major, Op. 89 (1820) and Quintet in F major for clarinet or oboe and string quartet, Op. 107 (1829) * Heinrich Baermann ‚Äì three clarinet quintets * Thomas T√§glichsbeck ‚Äì Clarinet Quintet in B major, Op. 44 (1863) * Ferruccio Busoni ‚Äì Suite in G minor, BV 176 (1880) * Alexander Glazunov ‚Äì R√™verie orientale, Op. 14 (1886) * Johannes Brahms ‚Äì Clarinet Quintet in B minor, Op. 115 (1891) * Samuel Coleridge-Taylor ‚Äì Clarinet Quintet in F minor, Op. 10 (1895) * Henri Marteau ‚Äì Clarinet Quintet in C minor, Op. 13 (1908) * Joseph Holbrooke ‚Äì Cavatina and Variations, Clarinet Quintet No. 1 in D minor, Op. 15b (1910) and Clarinet Quintet No. 2 Ligeia in G major, Op. 27 (1910, revised 1939 and c.1956; original title Fate) * Robert Fuchs ‚Äì Clarinet Quintet in E major, Op. 102 (1914) * Alexander Krein ‚Äì Three Sketches on Hebrew Themes for Clarinet Quintet, Op. 12 (1914) and Two Sketches on Hebrew Themes for Clarinet Quintet, Op. 13 (1914) * Max Reger ‚Äì Clarinet Quintet in A major, Op. 146 (1915‚Äì1916) * Herbert Howells ‚Äì Rhapsodic Quintet, Op. 31 (1917) * Arthur Somervell ‚Äì Clarinet Quintet in G major (1919) * Paul Hindemith ‚Äì Clarinet Quintet, Op. 30 (1923, revised 1954) * G√ºnter Raphael ‚Äì Clarinet Quintet in F major, Op. 4 (1924) * Quincy Porter ‚Äì Clarinet Quintet (1929) * Arthur Bliss ‚Äì Clarinet Quintet, F. 20 (1932) * Gordon Jacob ‚Äì Clarinet Quintet in G minor (1939) * Morton Feldman ‚Äì Two Pieces for Clarinet & String Quartet (1961); Clarinet & String Quartet (1983) * Kurt George Roger ‚Äì Clarinet Quintet, Op. 116 (1966) * Bernard Herrmann ‚Äì Souvenirs de voyage (1967) * Jean Fran√ßaix ‚Äì Clarinet Quintet (1977) * Isang Yun ‚Äì Clarinet Quintet No. 1 (1984) and Clarinet Quintet No. 2 (1994) * Edison Denisov ‚Äì Clarinet Quintet (1987) * Dan Welcher ‚Äì Quintet for Clarinet and String Quartet * Ellen Taaffe Zwilich ‚Äì Quintet for Clarinet and String Quartet (1990) * Sean Osborn ‚Äì Clarinet Quintet (1995) and Quintet for Clarinet and Strings, \\"The Beatles\\" (2004) * Milton Babbitt ‚Äì Clarinet Quintet (1996) * Jennifer Higdon ‚Äì Soliloquy * Howard J.

Granada Bridge carries four lanes of State Road 40 and Granada Blvd.Florida Dept. of Transportation, Florida Bridge Information The Casements, along with City Hall Plaza, Fortunato Park, and Riverbridge Park reside at the four corners of Ormond Beach's Granada Bridge, which give their collective name to the annual \\"Four Corners Festival\\" in Ormond Beach. In September 1999, the bridge was crossed by about 24,000 cars every day. By January 2007, that number increased to approximately 35,500 vehicles per day. ==History== 1905 Postcard of The Ormond Hotel; the first Ormond bridge can be seen to the right. Aerial view of Granada Bridge in Ormond Beach The Town of Ormond was incorporated March 22, 1880. There were few residents on the beach peninsula until 1886, when the St. Johns and Halifax Railroad reached the area. The railroad brought new visitors, which inspired John Anderson and Joseph Price to build the Ormond Hotel on the beachside. They also planned to build a bridge across the Halifax River so railroad passengers could walk to their new hotel.Centennial History of Volusia County, Florida (1854-1954) Volusia County Historical Commission ===First bridge=== In 1887, Florida Congressman Charles Dougherty sponsored three bills, authorizing the building of bridges in Volusia County, across the Halifax River, St. Johns River, and Indian Lagoon. In that same year, La Vega, which itself was called New England Avenue in 1875, was renamed to Granada Boulevard. The towns of Ormond and Daytona competed to build the first bridge across the Halifax River. In 1887, Anderson and Price managed to finish their bridge in Ormond first. It was a simple wooden bridge, with a drawbridge device for boats to pass. ===Second bridge=== Florida East Coast Railway owner Henry M. Flagler bought out the St. Johns and Halifax Railroad, and bought into the Ormond Hotel. By 1890, Flagler bought out his partners' interest in the hotel and expanded it to 300 rooms. In 1905, Flagler built a second bridge near the first as a railroad spur so his trains could carry passengers directly to the resort. Later, Flagler had the railroad bridge redesigned so wealthy visitors could drive automobiles over it to the hotel. The first wooden bridge was demolished soon afterward.History of Volusia County, Florida (1927); by Pleasant Daniel Gold ===Third bridge=== The converted railroad bridge stood for many years until it became too old to be serviced. A newer, two-lane concrete bascule bridge (drawbridge) was constructed to carry Granada Boulevard. It was opened on March 2, 1954, and named the Rockefeller Memorial Bridge for Standard Oil billionaire John D. Rockefeller, who had made The Casements in Ormond his winter and retirement home until he died in 1937.Florida Dept. of Transportation, Designated Roads of Florida ===Fourth bridge=== When funded in 1987, the 1990 built Port Orange Causeway bridge (bottom photo) passing over the Halifax River was planned to be similar to the 1983 Granada Bridge (top photo) passing over that same river. The widening of State Road 40 in the 1980s created the need for a new bridge. During the construction of Granada Bridge, a platform collapsed and caused three workers to fall more than 60 feet onto a barge, with one falling to his death. The Florida State Department of Transportation was in charge of the bridge construction, and built the present four-lane high clearance concrete and steel bridge in 1983. In May 1987, the U.S. federal government agreed to provide $8.16 million of the estimated $12 million cost of building a Port Orange, Florida bridge planned to be similar to the Granada Bridge. The resulting bridge across the Halifax River, the Port Orange Causeway across the Halifax River, was completed in 1990. In July 1997, a kitten named Lucky fell from a truck on the Granada Bridge and, after scrambling to safety from other moving cars, fell from the bridge. Lucky suffered a broken leg and acute kidney failure in the fall, and was rescued from a barnacle-covered piling by the U.S. Department of Transportation. His owners considered putting him down after learning of his bad shape and the expense of a kidney transplant. When Lucky's story was released to the public, donations poured in to help pay for the transplant. The survival of Lucky, whose name was changed to Timmy following the accident, was called \\"miraculous\\" by his attending veterinarian. Bicycle lanes are marked in the shoulder of the span and two pedestrian walkways at the far ends.

Specifically the body of water was located at 208th Street and Bainbridge Avenue. It was shaped like a saucer and was normally deep. Its water level dropped approximately in mid-August 1901. On April 3, 1934 Commissioner of Water Supply, Gas and Electricity, Maurice P. Davidson, proposed that it be offered to Robert Moses to be used as a park site. The reservoir had ceased to be used after 1919. ==History of reservoir site== A site for the Montefiore Home, first organized in 1884, was acquired in the West Bronx, between Columbia Oval and the Williamsbridge Reservoir, in January 1910. On the plot a hospital for treating various diseases replaced the previous site of the Montefiore Home, a building at Broadway (Manhattan) between 137th Street and 138th Street. In June 1928 a four-year-old boy, Frederic Fleishaus, of 3315 Rochambeau Avenue, the Bronx, drowned in Williamsbridge Reservoir. He gained access to the water through a small opening in an eight-foot fence which had been erected for protection. The Williamsbridge Reservoir property came under the control of the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation on June 27, 1934.

A monotypic genus, it contains the single polypore species Bridgeoporus nobilissimus, first described to science in 1949. Commonly known both as the noble polypore and the fuzzy Sandozi, this fungus produces large fruit bodies (or conks) that have been found to weigh up to . The upper surface of the fruit body has a fuzzy or fibrous texture that often supports the growth of algae, bryophytes, or vascular plants. This species is found in the Pacific Northwest region of North America where it grows on large (at least 1 m diameter) specimens of noble fir (Abies procera), Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis), or western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla). Bridgeoporus nobilissimus causes a brown rot in its tree hosts. Genetic analysis shows that the fungus is more prevalent than fruit body distribution indicates. ==Taxonomy== Bridgeoporus nobilissimus was named for William Bridge Cooke, who originally described the species as Oxyporus nobilissimus in 1949. The fungus was discovered in Clackamas County, Oregon, in 1943 by brothers Ali and Fred Sandoz. Foresters called the species Fomes fuzzii-sandozii, referring to the collectors and the fuzzy surface texture of the conk. Several collections were made in Oregon and Washington in subsequent years. A large specimen was collected in Lewis County, Washington in 1946 that weighed about and measured by . Cooke learned of the fungus in 1948 while visiting Daniel Elliot Stuntz, who kept one of the large fruit bodies that he and Alexander H. Smith had previously collected in Mount Rainier National Park. This fruit body served as the type collection. Species of genus Oxyporus cause white rot in their host trees. Cooke placed the fungus in this genus by despite not knowing definitively what type of rot it caused; he considered it to be closely related to Oxyporus populinus. In 1955, polypore specialist Josiah Lincoln Lowe transferred O. nobilissimus to Fomes, before the concept of this genus was narrowed. In 1996 the new genus Bridgeoporus was circumscribed by Harold Burdsall, Tom Volk and Joseph Ammirati to accommodate this species, in order to rectify incompatibilities with placements in Fomes and Oxyporus. In particular, genus Oxyporus features true cystidia arising from the subhymenium (the supportive hyphae underlying the hymenium), whereas B. nobilissimus has pseudocystidia (sterile structures arising deep in the subhymenium and protruding into the hymenium). Phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial small-subunit rDNA sequences suggests that B. nobilissimus, which belongs in the hymenochaetoid clade, is closely related to the genera Oxyporus and Schizopora. The hymenochaetoid clade includes wood-decaying species previously classified variously in the families Corticiaceae, Polyporaceae and Stereaceae. ==Description== Closeup of \\"fuzzy\\" conk surface Bridgeoporus nobilissimus has perennial, imbricate, sessile fruit bodies that measure by by . From 1966 to 1990, this species was designated the largest pore fungus in the Guinness Book of World Records. Three fruit body shapes are associated with the fungus, depending largely on the location of the fruiting on the host tree. Hoof-shaped and shelf-like conks are located on the sides of hosts; short, oblong-topped conks with tapering pore surfaces occur on the main roots of the host; and centrally substipitate (conical) conks are found on the tops of stumps. The cap surface of young fruit bodies are covered with a dense mat of white mycelial fibers (up to several millimeters long) that in age darken in color and often become stuck together at their tips. Although the surface is typically brown or darker, it may appear green due to epiphytic associations with algae such as Coccomyxa or Charicium species. Bryophytes or sometimes vascular plants grow on the upper surface of the conk. The texture of the fruit body is fibrous; it is rubbery and tough when fresh, but becomes hard and brittle when it is dry. The pores on the underside of the fruit body are round, approximately 2 per mm. The tubes comprising the pores becomes stratified, layering over each other with each successive year of growth. There is a 2‚Äì3 mm-thick layer of sterile tissue between pore layers, and mature tube layers are 2‚Äì7 mm long. Microscopically, B. nobilissimus is characterized by hyphae with a septum, pseudocystidia originating from the trama, closely appressed hyphae in bundles (fascicles) on the upper surface of the fruit body. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are 12‚Äì18 by 4‚Äì10 ¬µm in size, pear-shaped, and four-spored. The roughly ovoid Basidiospores are 5.5‚Äì6.5 by 3.5‚Äì4.5 ¬µm, hyaline, smooth, and have thin walls. ==Habitat and distribution== The fruit bodies (also called conks) of Bridgeoporus are found singly or sometimes in overlapping layers on old trees ( diameter at breast height) of noble fir (Abies procera), and more rarely Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis) or western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla). It has also been recorded growing on a snag of redwood. Other tree species often found in B. nobilissimus habitats include Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), western redcedar (Thuja plicata), and western hemlock. Common shrubs at these sites include salal (Gaultheria shallon), Sitka alder (Alnus sinuata), rhododendron (Rhododendron macrophyllum), and Alaska blueberry (Vaccinium ovalifolium). The use of molecular genetic techniques has demonstrated that the fungus also lives in Douglas fir, western hemlock, and western redcedar, although its fruit bodies have not been seen on these hosts. The fungus has been found in the Cascade Range in Washington and Oregon, the Coast Range on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington, and in Redwood National Park in northern California. Specimens have been found at elevations of . Because the fungus feeds on both dead and living wood, it is both parasitic and saprophytic. B. nobilissimus fruit bodies do not occur on fallen logs or other forms of dead wood lacking roots or some connection to a root system. Conks have been found growing on the still-living roots of an upturned, windthrown tree, while a once-living conk died within several years after the host tree was uprooted by a fallen tree. ==Conservation== Threats to Bridgeoporus nobilissimus include extirpation of known and unknown habitats by logging, fire, or other disturbances, and forestry practices that lead to the loss of large-diameter Abies procera and Abies amabilis trees and large- diameter stumps and snags in managed forests. Due to the scarcity of its mature tree hosts, B. nobilissimus was listed in 1995 as an endangered species by the Oregon Natural Heritage Program, making it the first of the fungi to be listed as endangered by any private or public agency in the United States. It is the sole fungus in category A of the survey and management guidelines for fungi under the Northwest Forest Plan, meaning pre-disturbance surveys and site management are needed before developing areas known to harbor the fungus. There were 13 known sites with the fungus before 1998; extensive surveying in the Pacific Northwest increased this number to 103 sites by 2006. Although it is infrequently observed, the fungus is more abundant than fruit body appearance indicates. Using genetic markers to detect the fungus mycelium in hosts, researchers found that B. nobilissimus was present at low to moderate levels and widespread in forest stands containing at least a single visible fruit body. It was detected in trees of all sizes, and in species not previously thought to harbor the fungus. B. nobilissimus may require decades of mycelial growth in its host before fruit body production is initiated. The fungus has not been successfully grown in vitro despite several attempts. ==See also== *Phellinus ellipsoideus ‚Äì the current record holder for largest polypore fungus *List of world's largest mushrooms and conks ==References== Category:Fungi of the United States Category:Polyporaceae Category:Monotypic Polyporales genera ","title":"Bridgeoporus"},{"id":"20559104","text":"The Calabrian regional election of 1970 took place on 7‚Äì8 June 1970. ==Events== Christian Democracy was by far the largest party and Christian Democrat Antonio Guarasci formed a government with the support of the Italian Socialist Party and the other minor centre-left parties (organic Centre-left).

Kitzhaber's goal was to find a way to put money used for health care, which as of 2006 amounted to about $6.3 billion in Oregon, to better use. That year, it was one of three organizations that drew substantially increased funding levels from the Northwest Health Foundation; its grant funds totaled $82,000. In 2007, members of the organization initially \\"crowded the steps\\" of the Oregon Capitol in support of a bill before the 2007 legislature to establish the Oregon Health Trust, but Kitzhaber later reversed his position, pulling his support from the bill and advising members of the organization that the then-current version of the bill did \\"not reflect the work‚Ä¶done by you through the Archimedes Movement.\\" The organization's goal was to create a national grass-roots effort to reform health care, starting in Oregon. It was founded on the belief that incremental change to existing health programs like Medicare and Medicaid will not be sufficient to solve their long-term problems, and that communities and coalitions outside the political world would need to form consensus around goals and values, and pressure lawmakers to make more fundamental changes. The organization's executive director, Liz Baxter, has advocated for health policy reform to members of the Oregon Legislative Assembly. She also chairs the Oregon Health Insurance Exchange Board, established in 2011. The Archimedes Movement is a member of the Oregon Health Reform Collaborative.oregonhealthreform.org Oregon Health Reform Collaborative web site (as archived January 20, 2009) The organization's original name was based on the ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes, who is quoted as saying \\"Give me a lever and a place to stand, and I can move the Earth.\\" ==Notes and references *We Can Do Better official web site == Further reading == * Op-ed by Executive Director Liz Baxter: * Op-ed by founder John Kitzhaber: * Op-ed by Community Leadership Council member Michael Grady: Category:Healthcare reform advocacy groups in the United States Category:Medical and health organizations based in Oregon Category:2006 establishments in Oregon ","title":"We Can Do Better"},{"id":"20559120","text":"Taplow Choirs is a group of four professional youth choirs for young people which rehearse in the village of Taplow, UK near Slough.

The variant Kevan is anglicized from , an Irish diminutive form.A Dictionary of First Names. Oxford University Press (2007) s.v. \\"Kevin\\". The feminine version of the name is (anglicised as Keeva or Kweeva). ==History== Saint Kevin (d. 618) founded Glendalough abbey in the Kingdom of Leinster in 6th-century Ireland. Canonized in 1903, he is one of the patron saints of the Archdiocese of Dublin. Caomh√°n of Inisheer, the patron saint of Inisheer, Aran Islands, is properly anglicized Cavan or Kevan, but often also referred to as \\"Kevin\\". The name was rarely given before the 20th century but has been \\"widely adopted throughout the English-speaking world\\" since, surging in popularity during the 1950s. The sudden rise in popularity may be tied to actor Kevin McCarthy, who first became famous with Death of a Salesman (1951). In the United States the name's popularity peaked at rank 11 in 1963. It has steadily decreased in popularity since then, but is still given with moderate frequency, at rank 89 as of 2016. The name followed a similar trajectory in the United Kingdom, gaining popularity in the 1950s, peaking in the 1960s, gradually declining in the 1970s to 1980s, and falling out of the top 100 most popularly given names by the 1990s. Oxford's A Dictionary of First Names suggests that anglicized Kevin may have influenced the adoption of Kelvin (in origin a river name) as a modern given name, which peaked in popularity at about the same time, albeit to a much lesser extent (peaking at rank 209 as of 1961 in the US).A Dictionary of First Names. Oxford University Press (2007) s.v. \\"Kelvin\\". Conversely, in non-English-speaking Europe, the name picked up popularity in the 1980s. The name had been introduced to Europe via pop culture, and was notorious for being extremely popular among lower class parents during the end of 1980s to 2000s. The name peaked markedly in the early 1990s, reaching first rank in France during 1989-1994, during 1991-1992 in Switzerland and in 1991 in Germany. The 1991 peak in German-speaking Europe is due to the Christmas comedy film Home Alone, marketed as \\"Kevin ‚Äì Allein zu Haus\\" in German (named for protagonist \\"Kevin McCallister\\", played by 10-year- old Macaulay Culkin). Especially in Germany, the name became associated with low social status, an attitude popularised in German journalism based on a 2009 master thesis on primary teachers' reactions to children's given names. \\"Kevin\\" or \\"Kevinismus\\" in German has become a short-hand for short-lived fads in given names based in pop culture.Katrin Pribyl, \\"KEVINISMUS\\" Wie Namen die Zukunft von Kindern beeinflussen , Welt, 26 February 2008.Sarah Zhang, [The Strange German Disease Called \\"Kevinism\\": Can a Lame Name Mess Up Your Life?], Discoblog (discovermagazine.com), 1 February 2012. \\"Kevinometer: Kennen Sie das Kevinismus-Risiko Ihrer Lieblingsnamen?\\" (beliebte-vornamen.de) ==People== * Kevin Abernathy (born 1991), American editor and occasional host of shows on the Game Grumps platform * Kevin Abley (born 1935), Australian rules footballer * Kevin Anderson (born 1960), American actor * Kevin Anderson (born 1986), South African tennis player * Kevin J.

It is also referred to as a quadricycle, quadcycle, pedal car or four-wheeled bicycle amongst other terms. Quadracycles have been in use since 1853 and have grown into several families of vehicles for a variety of purposes, including tourist rentals, pedal taxis, private touring, mountain and industrial use. ==Nomenclature== There is no consensus amongst manufacturers of four-wheeled, human-powered vehicles as to what this class of vehicles should be called, although quadracycle is the most commonly used term. Manufacturers who do refer to their products by class of vehicle call them: *Quadracycle - 11 manufacturers *Four-wheel bicycle - 7 manufacturers *Quadricycle - 5 manufacturers *Quadcycle - 3 manufacturers *Pedal car - 2 manufacturers *Quad - 2 manufacturers In addition there are single manufacturers who call them Go-kart, Car, Car-Bike, Ecological car, Human Powered Vehicle, Pedal Kart, Quadribent, Quattrocycle, Surrey and Twin bike. ==History== 1885 Coventry Rotary Quadracycle in Washington DC Velorama, Nijmegen, Netherlands The earliest recorded pedal-powered quadracycle was exhibited in 1853 at the Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations World's Fair held in New York City. This was about the same time that two-wheeled bicycles started to become popular. Quadracycles were one solution to the problem of low-speed stability in early cycles and were typically multi-seat models. Both tandem (in line) and sociable (side-by-side) seating configurations were used. One early design, predating 1869 was the Andrews Quadracycle, built by Andrews of Dublin, Ireland. It was made from one inch- square iron and was propelled with foot levers that moved in a long horizontal ellipse. The Sawyer Quadricycle was introduced in 1855 and featured lighter construction, wooden wheels, iron tires and front-wheel steering via a tiller. Like the Andrews Quadracycle it was moved by foot levers driving the rear axle. Starley's Coventry Rotary Quadracycle was introduced in 1885 and used conventional bicycle-style rotary pedals instead of foot levers for drive. It was developed from Starley's Coventry Rotary Tricycle design and featured tandem seating for two. The Rudge Quadracycle of 1888 is described as the first modern practical four-wheeler. It had much lighter construction than earlier models, seated three riders in tandem and was steered by levers from the front seat. Boy on Pedal Car Early in the twentieth century Massey-Harris in Canada developed the Canadian Royal Mail Quadracycle. This was used for mail delivery in Toronto as early as 1901. The Gendron Wheel Company created children's toy replica pedal cars up until World War II.Pedal Car Classics Gendron Pioneer Roadster - Comparison Tests, Brad Nevin, Car and Driver, December 2000 (retrieved 14 September 2010)Peter Gendron: Pedal Car Pioneer , Linda Portell, PedalCarNews.com, date unknown (retrieved 14 September 2010) ==Modern quadracycles== A 1945 model Mochet Velocar Quadracycle use diminished in the late 19th century as a result of improvements in bicycle technology that made their four-wheel cousins largely obsolete, although small numbers were manufactured through the 1950s for rental use in tourist areas. A resurgence of 20th century quadracycle use occurred in France where Charles Mochet introduced his Velocar pedal powered two-seat quadracycle in 1924. The various models of the Velocar featured wooden aerodynamic bodies and usually a three speed transmission. Production of final pedal-powered Mochet Velocar Model H ended in 1938, but Mochet went on to become a manufacturer of automobiles. The Velocar proved quite popular, especially during World War II when the French population was under German occupation and gasoline was virtually unavailable for civil use. Restored Mochet Velocars are still found in France. During the 1970s and 1980s, there was a resurgence of interest in quadracycles as personal transportation, driven by the 1973 oil crisis, environmental concerns about air pollution from automobiles and the search for emission-free alternatives. Modern quadracycles can be generally placed in six categories: ===Tourist destination rental=== A common rental surrey - a 2008 model International Surrey Company DX Series Surrey designed for 3 adults and 2 small children, equipped with 7 speeds. A tourist rental quadricycle, a Quadricycle International Quad-3 Quadricycle International tourist rental quadricycles, Old Montreal, Quebec, Canada Quadracycles can often be found at tourist attractions where they are available to rent by the hour or day. Modern tourist quadracycles usually feature open seating for two or more riders in a sociable configuration. They are often designed to look like early 20th century automobiles with a bench seat, rack-and-pinion steering, and a canopy top. They are commonly called \\"surreys\\", due to their resemblance to horse-drawn wagons of similar appearance and the same name. Examples of this type include: * International Surrey Company Surrey * Quadricycle International Quad-3 * Rhoades Car 4W4P * Sirenetta ===Pedal taxi=== Similar to the surrey are pedal taxis or pedicabs. These tend to be four or even six seaters and are used as taxis, pedaled by professional drivers. Like the rental surreys, they are often found at tourist attractions and in the downtown areas of tourist destination cities. Also like the rental surreys, pedal taxis are often constructed to resemble early 20th century cars and often feature awning coverings for protection from the sun. Examples of this type include: * International Surrey Limousine * Momentum Quadracycles MQ4 Cabbie * Quadracycle Inc QuadraCab * Delphino (Limo) ===Touring=== A modern touring 4-wheel bike - a 2007 model Rhoades Car 4W2PCP Coupe two seater A modern touring 4-wheel bike - a 2011 model Quattrocycle four seater with canopy Touring quadracycles are constructed specifically for the personal ownership market and are built to be lighter and faster than rental surreys. Typically, they seat one person or two people in side-by-side seating and feature independent pedaling and gear selection. They can have up to 192 gears, giving them remarkable hill-climbing capabilities. They are used for long-distance travel as well as local use; some are used for cycle-commuting to work. Compared to touring or hybrid bicycles, touring quadracycles are more comfortable to ride, can navigate steeper hills more easily, deal with crosswinds better, and can carry a much heavier load than a bicycle. They have disadvantages compared to bicycles including that they are heavier, require more storage space, typically have slower cruise speeds, are more complex to maintain, and have a larger turning circle. Unlike bicycles (but like tricycles) they are vulnerable to being rolled over on fast corners, and a very low centre of gravity and/or weight transfer by the riders to the inside of the curve is needed to avoid this. Examples of this type of vehicle include: * Lightfoot MicroCar * Momentum Quadracycles MQ2 Leisure * Pacific Cycle 2Rider * Quadracycle International Little Deuce Coupe * Quadracycle Inc QuadraSport two-seater * QuattroVelo‚Äîa \\"speed\\"-class velomobile * Rhoades Car 4W2PCP two-seater coupe * RJK Ecological Car * Steppe by Steppe Quike * Ultimate Quadracycle CC-Sportster * Utah Trikes Quad * VierBike There are also plans available as well as some amateur-designed touring quadracycles made by combining two bicycles. They have had varying degrees of success. Examples of plans built quadracycles are: * Skeldon Bike Co. Granny Bike *Atomic Zombie StreetFighter ===Mountain quadracycles=== Some quadracycles are designed to be the four-wheel counterparts of mountain bicycles and are optimized for strength and the ability to deal with steep and rough terrain; these are all single seat designs. An example of this type is: * Crank-It Mountain Quad ===Industrial use=== There are quadracycles designed for local delivery of goods, such as spare parts in a factory environment or laundry at spread-out hotel complexes. They may have two seats and a pickup box or flat bed to allow loads to be transported. Industrial use quadracycles are also capable of pulling small trailers. Some quadracycles in this category have also been designed for military applications, such as light logistics transport. Examples of this type of quadracycle include: * Momentum Quadracycles MQ1 Industrial * Rhoades Car 4W2PLF * Rhoades Car Go Boy ===Racing=== Pedal Car Racing can be found in many parts of the world. The UK, France and Italy all have championships and the UK and Hong Kong have a 24-hour race every year. Racing pedal cars are lightweight machines built for the sole purpose of racing and are therefore unsuitable for road use. ===Performance art=== The El Arbol quadracycle was built as a portable stage and sound system to make a point about the use of fossil fuels for transportation. ==Security== \\"U\\" lock to a steel signpost Lacking the mass and door locks of automobiles, quadracycles are often secured in the same manner as bicycles with \\"U\\" or \\"D\\" locks, chains or cables to convenient stout objects such as fence posts, signs or bike racks. ==See also== * Human-powered transport * Outline of cycling * Surrey * Wheeled kicksled ==References * List of quadracycle manufacturers * Four-Wheeled Velomobiles Category:Quadricycles Category:1853 introductions sv:Quadricycle ","title":"Quadracycle"},{"id":"20559222","text":"John William GoddardAnglican Communion (born 8 September 1947)Who's Who2008: London, A & C Black is a retired bishop of the Church of England.

The chain operated 43 stores in 19 southern, western, and mid-western states in the United States. Prior to its bankruptcy filing, the company employed 624 people. The company was granted bankruptcy liquidation on November 10, 2008. ==History== Harold's was founded in 1948 in Norman, Oklahoma by Harold G. Powell. The buying offices were later moved to Dallas, Texas while distribution and operations were based out of Norman, Oklahoma. The chain operated high-end men's and women's clothing stores, usually located in upper-class areas and shopping centers in the southern, western, and mid-western parts of the United States, and targeted sales to customers between the ages of 30 and 50. Originally selling only menswear, Harold's added women's apparel in 1958. The chain issued its own credit card in 1977, became a public company in 1987, and issued its first clothing catalog in 1990. In 1999 it had 53 stores in 22 states. At its peak, Harold's employed up to 1,800 people and its annual sales exceeded $150 million. Harold's locations in Houston were known as \\"Harold Powell\\", the result of a 1992 gentlemen's agreement with Harold's Men's Wear founder Harold Wiesenthal, who had operated there since 1950. By 1996, however, Wiesenthal believed customer confusion had grown and filed a lawsuit blaming Powell's company. The two sides worked out a deal at the end of 1996, before the suit went to trial, with Powell agreeing to use a different cover on catalogs delivered to the Houston area, rather than just a sticker noting the differing store name. ===Changes in leadership=== Powell stepped down from leadership in May 1998 when his daughter, Rebecca Powell Casey, who joined the company in 1977 and was its CEO from 1992, became the company's board chairman. Casey had been president of the company from 1989 to 1992, preceded in that role by former Bonwit Teller president, Bernard H. Newburg. Clark Hinkley replaced Casey as Harold's CEO in February 2001, and in June 2001 the company stopped all of its catalog and Internet ordering activities, which had been losing money. After concentrating on their core business and accumulating seven consecutive months of store sales increases, Harold's reinstituted catalog sales in September 2003. Hugh Mullins, formerly of Neiman Marcus, became the CEO in February 2004 and resigned in August 2005. Hinkley then re- assumed the role as interim CEO. Casey, serving as executive vice president, left the company for personal reasons in January 2006, expressing in her resignation letter a lost faith in the company's leadership. Ronald S. Staffieri, who had been president of Michaels Stores, succeeded Hinkley as CEO in October 2006. ===Decline and bankruptcy=== By 2001, the company was under the control of preferred stockholders Howard Lester of Williams-Sonoma and Ronald de Waal, formerly of Saks. Company headquarters moved that year to Dallas, and Casey stepped down as CEO. Lester and de Waal loaned the company millions of dollars over the next several years to keep it running. Harold's had added new clothing styles to attract more youthful buyers, but alienated its core customers in the process. Hurricanes in 2005 added to heavy losses for stores in three southern states, and the company lost $6 million that year and $11 million in 2006, the year Harold's stock was delisted from the American Stock Exchange. On November 10, 2008, Harold's Stores and six related companies were granted bankruptcy liquidation, stating, \\"Increased competition and a weak economy have left us no choice but to cease operations.\\" The month before, it had hired consultants to look at alternatives, though only received interest from merchandise liquidators, of which it chose Gordon Brothers. The closure surprised some as the Chapter 11 filing is usually to allow for financial restructuring, and the chain had received a $1.8 billion loan in the prior quarter; the filing was converted to Chapter 7 in March 2009. Before bankruptcy, Harold's had 43 stores and 624 employees, about half of whom were part-time, across 19 states. Its assets (and liabilities) were listed as between $10 million and $50 million. Investors Lester and de Wall lost at least $15 million and $23.5 million, respectively. Sidewalk outside Harold's former flagship store in 2009 in Norman, Oklahoma ===Aftermath=== Two years before he became mayor of Knoxville, Tennessee, Bill Haslam of Saks Fifth Avenue was appointed in September 2001 as non-executive chairman of Harold's, a role he kept through the 2008 bankruptcy. In August 2009, the trustee of the bankruptcy filed a lawsuit against Haslam and the other directors and officers of Harold's, charging that the company had illegally paid nearly $6 million in dividends to preferred shareholders while in debt, and that Lester and de Waal's loans to the company were made in bad faith and without considering other options. Harold's leadership denied the claims and both sides ultimately settled out of court for $2 million in February 2014. Haslam said he was not influenced by de Waal and that he never had an operational role in the company, a claim also supported by Casey. Powell had sold most of his stock in the company before it went bankrupt. A large antique carousel horse he bought and which was the basis for a longtime logo and mascot for Harold's, was still at Casey's vacation home in Texas as of September 2014. Cafe Plaid, a restaurant Powell had opened in 1996 next to the flagship store in Norman, was also still in business then, but with different ownership. In October 2010, the former flagship store in the city's Campus Corner district became an OU IT technology store run by University of Oklahoma's Information Technology department, with additional space made available for meetings. Powell died at the age of 92 in June 2016 from complications related to lung cancer. ==References * Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture - Harold's (archived) Category:Companies based in Dallas Category:Companies disestablished in 2008 Category:Norman, Oklahoma Category:Retail companies established in 1948 Category:1948 establishments in Oklahoma ","title":"Harold's"},{"id":"20559290","text":"Boulevard Heights is an urban neighborhood of Atlanta, Georgia located south of United Ave, east of Boulevard, north of Entrenchment Creek and west of the State of Georgia complex.

It is a sequel to Prehistorik 2, featuring similar graphics but a richer and different story, and additional non-player characters which, among other things, provide hints and a tutorial. The game was later released for the Game Boy Advance and the Nintendo DSi (as a DSiWare release), with the latter being released in North America on February 15, 2010. The Super NES version received positive reviews from critics with the story, sound and gameplay being praised. The Game Boy Advance and DSiware ports, however, have gotten mixed reviews. == Plot == Prehistorik Man, like its predecessor, takes place in the Stone Age. In the middle of the night, greedy dinosaurs steal all the food from a small village. With winter coming and the village inhabitants facing starvation, the Village Chief summons Sam, a young and agile villager, and tasks him with obtaining food to help the village survive the impending winter. == Gameplay == hang glider. The player controls Sam by navigating him through a total of 23 side-scrolling levels. The main task is for the player to collect all the food in each level while defeating enemies to make them drop their bones, which is used as currency in the game. The player starts out with three hearts. If the player loses them all, they lose a life and must restart the level. Midway through each level, there is a checkpoint (called a Rees-Tartah) so Sam will not have to start at the beginning once touched. Sam has many abilities to help the player through each level including running \\"like a dog\\" to move faster, and the shout which enables the player to defeat all enemies on screen. Sam's default weapon is a spiked club but he can find other weapons like spears and axes which will replace any weapon used before, however, these weapons have limited ammo. Throughout the game, various items can be found varying from \\"stone age shields\\", which make the player temporarily invincible, heart containers to permanently raise the player's health, and letters which spell out B-O-N-U-S, which when all are collected, send the player to a bonus area for a chance to collect more bones and food. Shops are also available for the player to spend bones to buy various items which the player can use to skip levels or even save their game. At the end of each level, the food is tallied up and the player is given an overall percentage on how well they did. Certain levels have different gameplay gimmicks which the player must learn in order to proceed. The majority of levels are simple platformers but other levels involve the player finding specific key items, limit a player to using a vehicle, or defeating a boss.

Frank Provo of GameSpot, however, praised the music and gave the game a 6.1 of 10, concluding by saying that \\"at best, Prehistorik Man is a weekend diversion from the GBA's more substantial fare.\\" For the DSiware port, Desiree Turner of Nintendo Life gave the game 3 stars of 5, arguing that \\"Though it looks and sounds great, it suffers from shoddy hit detection, hard-to-read fonts, and moments of slowdown that make precision platforming nigh impossible.\\" ==References== Category:Titus Software games Category:Platform games Category:1996 video games Category:Video games developed in France Category:Kemco games Category:Single-player video games Category:Side- scrolling platform games Category:Prehistoric people in popular culture Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Game Boy Advance games Category:DSiWare games Category:Video game sequels ","title":"Prehistorik Man"},{"id":"20559409","text":"Igor Lovchinsky (; born December 15, 1984) is a Russian-American pianist and physicist. ==Performing and recording career== Born in Kazan, then part of the Soviet Union, Lovchinsky began his musical career at the Kazan Special Music School for Gifted Children.

Putnam's Sons after it was rejected by Mailer's publisher, Rinehart & Company, for obscenity. Despite having already typeset the book, Rinehart claimed that the manuscript's obscenity voided its contract with Mailer. Mailer retained his cousin, the attorney Charles Rembar, who became a noted defense attorney for publishers involved in censorship trials. Rembar disagreed with Rinehart's characterization of the manuscript as obscene, and threatened to take the publisher to court. Rinehart settled with Mailer, allowing him to keep his advance. A roman √† clef, the metaphorical \\"Deer Park\\" is Desert D'Or, California (a fictionalized Palm Springs). A fashionable desert resort, Hollywood's elite converge there for fun and games and relaxation. The novel's protagonist, Sergius O'Shaughnessy (a recently discharged Air Force officer), is a would-be novelist who experiences the moral depravity of the Hollywood community first hand. The title refers to the Parc-aux-Cerfs (\\"Deer Park\\"), a resort Louis XV of France kept stocked with young women for his personal pleasure. == Plot Summary == With eighteen thousand dollars of winnings from a poker game in his pocket, Sergius O‚ÄôShaughnessy wanders to Desert D‚ÄôOr to find a sense of purpose after recently being discharged from the Air Force. Desert D‚ÄôOr, a fictionalized Palm Springs, is only hours outside of ‚Äúthe capital‚Äù (Los Angeles), where movie stars, producers, and other Hollywood moguls flock to the small desert town to escape the bustle of the city. Compared to Hollywood celebrities, O‚ÄôShaughnessy comes from modest roots. Raised an orphan, O‚ÄôShaughnessy never had a stable life until he became a fighter pilot in the Air Force. His career as a pilot was short-lived, as they medically discharged him for psychological reasons. O‚ÄôShaughnessy narrates the story, and the plot revolves around his experiences and encounters in the secluded desert city. He befriends former Hollywood director Charles Eitel and other celebrities. Supreme Studios blacklisted Eitel after he was uncooperative in front of a Senate Subversive Committee regarding his alleged communist ties. Like O‚ÄôShaughnessy, Eitel is at a crossroads in his life. He is in the process of writing a new script but is unconfident of his abilities to produce meaningful work. In addition to Eitel and O‚ÄôShaughnessy, the other main characters range from movie star Lulu Meyers and pimp Marion Faye to the up-and-coming producer Collie Munshin and studio mogul Herman Teppis. Sex, alcohol, and adultery is widespread throughout Desert D‚ÄôOr, and O‚ÄôShaughnessy and Eitel both find themselves in multiple flings throughout the novel. Once Teppis meets O‚ÄôShaughnessy, he is immediately struck by the former pilot‚Äôs story and urges Munshin to offer O‚ÄôShaughnessy twenty thousand dollars for the rights to it. O‚ÄôShaughnessy declines the offer because he does not want to sell his life story to be made into a cheap Hollywood flick. However, he ultimately runs out of money and loses his girlfriend, Lulu Meyers. Eventually, Eitel is presented with another opportunity to get back into the film business after he partners with Munshin and cooperates with the Committee. While everyone else heads back to the capital for their movie careers, O‚ÄôShaughnessy wanders to Mexico City, where he becomes a smalltime bullfighter. The book ends with O‚ÄôShaughnessy opening a bullfighting studio in New York, while Eitel marries Elena but continues to have an affair with Lulu Meyers. == Main characters == Sergius O‚ÄôShaughnessy: Standing at six-feet one with blonde hair and blue eyes, O‚ÄôShaughnessy is the novel‚Äôs protagonist and narrator. As an orphan, O‚ÄôShaughnessy‚Äôs past is relatively uneventful until he joined the Air Force and became a fighter pilot. In Desert D‚ÄôOr, O‚ÄôShaughnessy can initially fool his Hollywood friends, claiming that he was the son of a wealthy businessman. During the novel, O‚ÄôShaughnessy falls in love with the glamorous Hollywood actress, Lulu Meyers. The couple dates for an extended time before moves back to the capital to work on another film. Charles Eitel, the once-famous but blacklisted director, is O‚ÄôShaughnessy‚Äôs closest and most trusted friend throughout the novel until Eitel moves back to the capital after clearing his name from the Subversive Committee. O‚ÄôShaughnessy desperately wants to become a writer, and even turns down lucrative acting and movie deals about his life. He claims that he does not want to sell his life story to turn into another ‚Äúslob movie.‚Äù Secretly, O‚ÄôShaughnessy wants to be a writer. After he runs out of money, O‚ÄôShaughnessy wanders from Mexico to New York, taking odd jobs along the way and eventually opening a bullfighting class in New York City. Charles Frances Eitel: Charles Eitel was a once rich and famous Hollywood director that was eventually blacklisted when he was linked to communist organizations. After Eitel did not cooperate with the Subversive Committee, Supreme Pictures blacklisted him. Once he lost his job, Eitel moved from the capital to his property in Desert D‚ÄôOr. Throughout the novel, Eitel struggles with his confidence and desperately wants to write a meaningful script, but lacks the motivation. His relationship with Esposito serves as a spark for his creative writing, and he then cuts a deal with Collie Munshin to sell his script. However, Eitel pities Esposito and believes that the only way to break up with her is by formal marriage and divorce. However, they split before they get married. At the end of the novel, he is reunited with Esposito, and they eventually marry ‚Äì though he remains unfaithful. Once Eitel cooperates with the Committee, his glory is restored, and he becomes a successful Hollywood director once again. Herman Teppis: Herman Teppis, head of Supreme Studios, is described as a ‚Äútall heavy man with silver hair and a red complexion.‚Äù Teppis is the stereotypical big- time Hollywood studio bully who has his actors and actresses on a leash. He alone can make or break a career, as Teppis quickly shunned Eitel after he was uncooperative. He urges Lulu to marry Teddy Pope, even though Teppis knows that Teddy is a homosexual. Despite that fact, Teppis cares more about making his actors famous and pressures them to consider marriage. In addition to bullying his renowned movie stars, he also takes advantage of the aspiring actresses. Towards the end of the novel, Teppis has sexual relations with a young aspiring actress and alludes to a promotion if she does what he wants. Elena Esposito: Elena Esposito finds herself in Desert D‚ÄôOr after being taken there by Munshin during their break-up. Almost immediately after, she starts dating Eitel. Their relationship helps bring fire back into Eitel‚Äôs work, and the two live together for an extended period. A former cheap flamenco dancer, Esposito is admired and pitied by many of the men in Desert D‚ÄôOr. Eitel thinks that the only way he can break up with Esposito without ruining her is to marry her and then file divorce shortly after. In addition to Eitel and Munshin, Marion Faye also is in love with Esposito, and the pair lives together for a short time after Esposito leaves Eitel. After a car wreck with Faye, Esposito and Eitel reunite and eventually get married. Lulu Meyers: The most famous movie star in the novel, Lulu Meyers is sought out by many men in Desert D‚ÄôOr, but falls in love with O‚ÄôShaughnessy. Years ago, Meyers and Eitel were married before they ultimately divorced. The actress is blonde and beautiful, and although already famous, is aspiring to become the most popular actress in America. Her relationship with O‚ÄôShaughnessy lasts for the majority of the novel, but she quickly moves on once she is back in the capital. She marries Tony Tanner, another Hollywood star, though she is unhappy with her marriage and ultimately has a steady affair with Eitel. Collie Munshin: The son-in-law of Herman Teppis, Collie Munshin is one of the most talented producers in the capital. Eitel describes Munshin as ‚Äúclever,‚Äù ‚Äútenacious,‚Äù and ‚Äúscheming, ‚Äù with ‚Äúshort turned-up features‚Äù that made him look like a clown. Before becoming a movie producer, Munshin was previously a salesman, newspaperman, radio announcer, press-relations consultant, and an actor‚Äôs agent. Although Munshin is married to Teppis‚Äôs daughter, he is introduced in the story in the middle of a break-up with another woman, Elena Esposito, the girl whom Eitel then falls in love with and marries. Munshin eventually helps Eitel get back into directing after offering him a contract for his new script. At the end of the story, Eitel regards Munshin as a true friend ‚Äì Munshin plays the best man at Eitel and Elena‚Äôs wedding. Dorothea O‚ÄôFaye: A former personality who had been an actress, night club-singer, and gossip columnist, Dorothea O‚ÄôFaye hosted many parties at her home, The Hangover, where O‚ÄôShaughnessy first met friends in Desert D‚ÄôOr. Dorothea is described as generous and ‚Äúhandsome with a full body and exciting black hair‚Äù and notorious for having been ‚Äúeverywhere and done everything, and knew everything there was to know.‚Äù At an early age, O‚ÄôFaye had an affair with a European prince and gave birth to his illegitimate son, Marion. Dorothea plays a significant role at the start of the novel, but her presence diminishes as the story progresses. Marion Faye: Son of Dorothea O‚ÄôFaye, Marion Faye dropped the ‚ÄúO‚Äù from his last name at a young age. At twenty-four years old, Marion is described as ‚Äúvery special‚Äù with a high level of intelligence and ‚Äúlight wavy hair and clear gray eyes.‚Äù After not finding a job that interested him, Faye started his own small-time escort service. Faye is well-connected with people of all types in Desert D‚ÄôOr ‚Äì everyone from businessmen and entertainers, to gamblers and golfers from the capital. Faye eventually dates Elena after Eitel, but they get into a severe car accident that put him into a coma. ==Stage version== Norman Mailer adapted the novel into a play.

Volunteer workers sort over the piles of contributions.\\" ==History == The organization was founded by Julia Lawrence Terry in 1932 in Short Hills, New Jersey. Terry worked in the Red Cross during the Great Depression and realized the need for eyeglasses in the US. Area residents donated basement space for sorting eyeglasses. By the end of the 1940s, the organization was receiving an average of 1,194 glasses monthly. \\"Old age glasses\\" were sent to hospitals in New York City and nursing homes in Kentucky. New Eyes was also featured in Woman's Day and Parade magazine articles, and had its first television appearance on WCBS. As the organization grew, the Junior Service League of the Oranges and Retired Men's Club in Short Hills began to volunteer. In 1947, the Junior Service League of Short Hills took over New Eyes with the passing of Mrs. Terry. By 1949, 455 people per month were receiving \\"new eyes\\". In the 1950s, New Eyes for the Needy had 55 volunteers sorting eyeglasses. The organization averaged 25‚Äì35 mailbags of glasses weekly. New Eyes was set up as an independent organization, a community project under the Junior League of Oranges. The Jewelry Committee was formed by Connie Hurd. ===1960s and 1970s=== New Eyes opened its new headquarters at 549 Millburn Avenue in the 1960s. At this location, the organization began accepting items for consignment in the jewelry showroom. Additions to the building allowed for a mailroom and second-floor jewelry showroom and sales. The Millburn Old Guard began volunteering at New Eyes for the Needy, which would become a tradition lasting over 40 years. In 1968, the organization paid off its mortgage. By 1979, over 100,000 pairs of eyeglasses were being shipped overseas. $150,000 in grants were allocated to hospitals and medical schools. New Eyes broke the 1,000,000 mark in eyeglass donations for one year, which allowed for the purchase of over 10,000 new prescription glasses. ===1980s and 1990s=== Income from scrap metal declined in the 1980s, while the number of requests for new eyeglasses rose. This marked the start of the eyeglass voucher program. This decade marked the beginning of computer use in the offices and the 50th anniversary of the organization, which was attended by Governor and Mrs. Tom Kean. New Eyes received $35,000 in grants during the 1990s. It launched its first direct mail campaign for new donations and ran a PSA campaign featuring comedian Steve Allen. Susannah Likins became the new executive director in 1993. ===2000s=== In the past decade, New Eyes for the Needy raised reimbursement rates for the voucher program for the first time since the program began. It also introduced its website, www.neweyesfortheneedy.org. Its first fundraising gala, Hocus Focus, took place in 2006. In 2011-12, in partnership with social service agencies and optical dispensers across the country, New Eyes helped 6,066 underserved residents of the U.S. to get the eyeglasses they needed but could not afford. Currently, Susan Dyckman is the organization's executive director. New Eyes celebrated its 80th anniversary in November 2012, marking the event with a gala honoring Honorary Chair actor Jake Gyllenhaal. The group's vision or mission statement is: \\"To empower children and adults in the United States and overseas with the improved vision they need to pursue a better quality of life for themselves, their families and their communities. New Eyes' mission is to purchase new prescription glasses through a voucher program for children and adults in the United States who cannot afford glasses on their own. new Eyes accepts, recycles and distributes donated glasses for poor people overseas.\\" ==Voucher program== New Eyes for the Needy purchases prescription eyeglasses for indigent people in the U.S. through a well-established voucher program. Eligible clients can receive a voucher by working through a social service agency or a school nurse. Clients can present a New Eyes voucher to any participating local optical dispenser, who fits the client with the proper prescription eyeglasses. The dispenser then receives reimbursement directly from New Eyes. To be eligible for the program, applicants must be in financial need, have had a recent eye exam, and have no other resources available to them to pay for glasses, including federal or state programs or assistance from local charitable organizations. New Eyes does not pay for eye exams. A New Eyes voucher typically covers only the cost of a basic pair of single or bifocal eyeglasses. == Funding == Since most contemporary eyeglasses are no longer framed in gold, New Eyes must now rely on a variety of funding sources, including individual donations, grants, corporate gifts, special events and revenue from the Fabulous Finds Jewelry & Giftware Boutique. In 2012, Individual donations and corporate gifts made up 43% of revenue. Grants made up 25% of funding, jewelry sales from the showroom Fabulous Finds made up 14%, and scrap metal made up 3%. == Donations and volunteer work == New Eyes for the Needy depends primarily on volunteer work and donations. A donation of $58 purchases one pair of prescription glasses for someone in need in the United States. Donations may be made by cash, check or credit card through New Eyes' website. New Eyes also recycles donated prescription glasses, reading glasses and sunglasses, manages 250 volunteers, sponsoring holds two fundraising campaigns each year, and works with charitable organizations and small medical missions to distribute recycled glasses in developing nations. Jake Gyllenhaal with Executive Director Susan Dyckman and Treasurer Barb Daney == Operations and accomplishments 2007-2008=== New Eyes for the Needy is run by a 15 person Board of Trustees and runs mainly through volunteer action. It still operates out of its original home in New Jersey but has expanded to become globalized. In 2007-2008, the organization helped 5,845 United States citizens and 200,000 people overseas with their eye care needs. The company has been highlighted in several prominent media outlets such as the Newark Star Ledger, the Philadelphia Inquirer and ABC's Eyewitness News. As of March 2008, the company's net assets have reached $3,303,346. The organization has had celebrity spokespeople such as Jake Gyllenhaal make videos to send their message. In the fall of 2008, the organization was the subject of a school assignment for many students at Seton Hall University as part of a public relations campaign assignment. ===2010-2011=== In 2010-2011, New Eyes purchased eyeglasses for 2,582 adults from 45 states and the District of Columbia, 486 children in 28 states, and 1,096 seniors living in 41 states and the District of Columbia. The group distributed nearly 200,000 pairs of recycled eyeglasses to poor people living in 30 developing nations around the world. Fourteen new volunteers were welcomed at the organization. The Heart of New Eyes fundraiser in February 2010 raised $15,000 to support the U.S. eyeglass voucher program. The second Annual Kids Rock for Vision Concert in March 2010 raised $8,700 for children‚Äôs eyeglasses. The See For Change fundraiser raised nearly $6,000 for children‚Äôs glasses in New York City. Fabulous Finds jewelry and giftware re-sale showroom raised $51,000 for the U.S. eyeglass voucher program. New Eyes secured awards totaling $71,000 in foundation grants. 2011-2012 U.S. Eyeglass Voucher Program * 6,066 U.S. children, working age adults and seniors get prescription glasses in 46 states and the District of Columbia International Eyeglass Recycling Program * Acknowledged 243,000 pair of donated glasses * Distributed 160,000 pair of glasses to people in 28 countries through small medical missions and Physicians for Peace, Feed The Children and Unite for Sight * Hosted 12 corporate, civic, student and scout groups on evenings and weekends.

The observed frequency shift is a good indicator of the velocity of the illuminated moving particles. A potential biomedical application is measuring blood flow. Specifically, when an intensity modulated light wave is exerted on a localized medium, the resulting heat can induce an alternating and localized pressure change. This periodic pressure change generates an acoustic wave with a specific frequency. Among various factors that determine this frequency, the velocity of the heated area and thus the moving particles in this area can induce a frequency shift proportional to the relative motion. Thus, from the perspective of an observer, the observed frequency shift can be used to derive the velocity of illuminated moving particles. ==Theory== To be simple, consider a clear medium firstly. The medium contains small optical absorbers moving with velocity vector \\\\vec{v}. The absorbers are irradiated by a laser with intensity modulated at frequency f_{0}. Thus, the intensity of the laser could be described by: I={I }_{0 } \\\\left[ 1+cos \\\\left ( 2 \\\\pi f_{0}t \\\\right ) \\\\right ] /2H. Fang, K. Maslov, L.V. Wang. \\"Photoacoustic Doppler Effect from Flowing Small Light-Absorbing Particles.\\" Physical Review Letters 99, 184501 (2007) frameright50pxFigure 1: Overview of PAD Effect When \\\\vec{v} is zero, an acoustic wave with the same frequency f_{0} as the light intensity wave is induced. Otherwise, there is a frequency shift in the induced acoustic wave. The magnitude of the frequency shift depends on the relative velocity \\\\vec{v}, the angle \\\\alpha between the velocity and the photon density wave propagation direction, and the angle \\\\theta between the velocity and the ultrasonic wave propagation direction. The frequency shift is given by: f_{PAD}=-f_{0} \\\\frac{ v}{ c_{0}} cos \\\\alpha +f_{0} \\\\frac{v}{c_{a}} cos \\\\theta Where c_{0} is the speed of light in the medium and c_{a} is the speed of sound. The first term on the right side of the expression represents the frequency shift in the photon density wave observed by the absorber acting as a moving receiver. The second term represents the frequency shift in the photoacoustic wave due to the motion of the absorbers observed by the ultrasonic transducer. In practice, since \\\\frac{c_{0}}{c_{a}}\\\\sim 10^{5} and v \\\\ll c_{a}, only the second term is detectable. Therefore, the above equation reduces to: f_{PAD}= f_{0} \\\\frac{v}{c_{a}} cos \\\\theta = \\\\frac{v}{\\\\lambda} cos \\\\theta H. Fang, K. Maslov, L.V. Wang. \\"Photoacoustic Doppler flow measurement in optically scattering media.\\" Applied Physics Letters 91 (2007) 264103 In this approximation, the frequency shift is not affected by the direction of the optical radiation. It is only affected by the magnitude of velocity and the angle between the velocity and the acoustic wave propagation direction. This equation also holds for a scattering medium. In this case, the photon density wave becomes diffusive due to light scattering. Although the diffusive photon density wave has a slower phase velocity than the speed of light, its wavelength is still much longer than the acoustic wave. ==Experiment== Figure 2: Average Photoacoustic Doppler Shift vs. Velocity for a Scattering Medium In the first demonstration of the Photoacoustic Doppler effect, a continuous wave diode laser was used in a photoacoustic microscopy setup with an ultrasonic transducer as the detector. The sample was a solution of absorbing particles moving through a tube. The tube was in a water bath containing scattering particles Figure 2 shows a relationship between average flow velocity and the experimental photoacoustic Doppler frequency shift. In a scattering medium, such as the experimental phantom, fewer photons reach the absorbers than in an optically clear medium. This affects the signal intensity but not the magnitude of the frequency shift. Another demonstrated feature of this technique is that it is capable of measuring flow direction relative to the detector based on the sign of the frequency shift. The reported minimum detected flow rate is 0.027 mm/s in the scattering medium. ==Application== One promising application is the non-invasive measurement of flow. This is related to an important problem in medicine: the measurement of blood flow through arteries, capillaries, and veins. Measuring blood velocity in capillaries is an important component to clinically determining how much oxygen is delivered to tissues and is potentially important to the diagnosis of a variety of diseases including diabetes and cancer. However, a particular difficulty of measuring flow velocity in capillaries is caused by the low blood flow rate and micrometre-scale diameter. Photoacoustic Doppler effect based imaging is a promising method for blood flow measurement in capillaries. === Existing techniques === Based on either ultrasound or light there are several techniques currently being used to measure blood velocity in a clinical setting or other types of flow velocities. Doppler ultrasound The Doppler ultrasound technique uses Doppler frequency shifts in ultrasound wave. This technique is currently used in biomedicine to measure blood flow in arteries and veins. It is limited to high flow rates (>1 cm/s) generally found in large vessels due to the high background ultrasound signal from biological tissue. Laser doppler flowmetry Laser Doppler Flowmetry utilizes light instead of ultrasound to detect flow velocity. The much shorter optical wavelength means this technology is able to detect low flow velocities out of the range of Doppler ultrasound. But this technique is limited by high background noise and low signal due to multiple scattering. Laser Doppler flowmetry can measure only the averaged blood speed within 1mm3 without information about flow direction. Doppler optical coherence tomography Doppler Optical coherence tomography is an optical flow measurement technique that improves on the spatial resolution of laser Doppler flowmetry by rejecting multiple scattering light with coherent gating. This technique is able to detect flow velocity as low as 100 \\\\mu m/s with the spatial resolution of 5\\\\times 5\\\\times 15\\\\mu m^{3}. The detection depth is usually limited by the high optical scattering coefficient of biological tissue to <1mm. ===Photoacoustic doppler flowmetry=== Photoacoustic Doppler effect can be used to measure the blood flow velocity with the advantages of Photoacoustic imaging. Photoacoustic imaging combines the spatial resolution of ultrasound imaging with the contrast of optical absorption in deep biological tissue. Ultrasound has good spatial resolution in deep biological tissue since ultrasonic scattering is much weaker than optical scattering, but it is insensitive to biochemical properties. Conversely, optical imaging is able to achieve high contrast in biological tissue via high sensitivity to small molecular optical absorbers, such as hemoglobin found in red blood cells, but its spatial resolution is compromised by the strong scattering of light in biological tissue. By combining the optical imaging with ultrasound, it is possible to achieve both high contrast and spatial resolution. The photoacoustic Doppler flowmetry could use the power of photoacoustics to measure flow velocities that are usually inaccessible to pure light-based or ultrasound techniques. The high spatial resolution could make it possible to pinpoint only a few absorbing particles localized to a single capillary. High contrast from the strong optical absorbers make it possible to clearly resolve the signal from the absorbers over the background. ==See also== * Photoacoustic spectroscopy * Photoacoustic imaging in biomedicine * Photoacoustic tomography * Doppler effect *Doppler optical coherence tomography * ==References== Category:Doppler effects Category:Radio frequency propagation Category:Wave mechanics Category:Radar signal processing ","title":"Photoacoustic Doppler effect"},{"id":"20559677","text":"Nequepio was a professional soccer team in El Salvador. ==History== The club team originally played and was located on what is now Antiguo Cuscatl√°n, Cuscatl√°n.

In 1971 (or 1972), he was made a Doctor of Science (Sc.D.) of the University of Cambridge. == Biography == Lewin spent nearly 48 years at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California at San Diego and was considered a leading authority in multiple areas of marine biology. Lewin joined the Scripps institution as an associate professor of marine biology in 1960 and retired from that position as a full professor in 1991, remaining extremely active in laboratory and field research and lecturing nationally and internationally. He helped organize and teach courses on marine microbiology and algae for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in Finland, Singapore and China. He published more than 250 scientific papers, among which his 2001 review paper entitled More on Merde was an entertaining review on the worth of feces in biomedicine. He addressed this issue frankly by stating, \\"Whereas food has always received much attention in conversation, commerce, and the literature, the subject of feces has been comparatively neglected. To fill this lacuna, a small book on comparative coprology was recently published (Lewin 1999). The present article aims to supplement this book with a review of overlooked or new items relating to biological and medical aspects of coprology, notably chemical and microbial components of human and animal feces, their uses as fertilizers, and a few other sociological impacts.\\" Ralph Lewin was an Esperantist, and was Ordinary professor (orda profesoro) at Akademio Internacia de la Sciencoj San Marino, the only university in the world where all courses are studied in esperanto. He translated Winnie-the- Pooh into Esperanto with Ivy Kellerman Reed and was the author of Merde: excursions in scientific, cultural and socio-historical coprology.

He won a British Arts Council award to photograph New York and moved to New York City in 1970. There he worked as an assistant for photographer Hiro at the studio of Richard Avedon. The following year, he studied with photographer Diane Arbus in her master class. His photographs quickly drew assignments from major magazines including Esquire, The New York Times Magazine, Interview, Vanity Fair, The New Yorker, and the premier issues of Wired, Paper, Colors , and Spy. By the 1990s Selkirk was known as a portraitist with a distinctive style. In August 1993, the photographs from his limited edition portfolio were featured in the Minneapolis Institute of Art exhibition, 3 Photographers, 3 Portfolios along with the work of Diane Arbus and Richard Avedon. Selkirk‚Äôs photographs are in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Minneapolis Institute of Art, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and other major U.S. institutions. Selkirk is the only person ever authorized to make posthumous prints of the work of Diane Arbus. In an article for iPhoto Newsletter, Jeffrey Fraenkel states that the process by which Selkirk came to make these prints, and the arduous decisions that went into their making, are thoroughly detailed in his essay \\"In the Darkroom\\" (pp. 266‚Äì275 of Diane Arbus Revelations). Selkirk describes his first encounter with an Arbus photograph in a radio interview on Kurt Andersen‚Äôs Studio 360 series, ‚ÄúThe Aha Moment.‚Äù In 2005 Selkirk directed the documentary film, Who is Marvin Israel, about Marvin Israel (1924-1984), artist, designer, art director and teacher, who influenced many of the important photographers and designers of the twentieth century, including Richard Avedon and Diane Arbus, as well as Selkirk himself. The film, which premiered at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and aired on the Documentary Channel, explores Israel's life and work through the words of those who knew him. Selkirk's recent project, Certain Women, was on display from March 19 to May 2, 2015 at the Howard Greenberg Gallery in New York City. ‚ÄúThe series has taken Selkirk far afield from that for which he‚Äôs best known: frank portraits of celebrated authors, filmmakers, statesmen, athletes, and their recognizable ilk, which he has shot since the 1970s for Esquire (where he got his start under Jean-Paul Goude), Vanity Fair, The New Yorker, and many other publications. He also has produced a strong body of documentary and street photography that reflects his having studied with Diane Arbus and worked in the studio of Richard Avedon.‚Äù About the project, Selkirk said in an interview with the Los Angeles Review of Books, \\"Motherhood leaves its mark. And I think that one of the things that the whole project suggests is that maybe it's a really nice mark and something to be proud of. The sort of strength that I thought I saw, that I was looking for, that I was hoping to record is just this knowingness. When you start talking nonsense it‚Äôs like they see it instantly.\\" ==Personal life== Selkirk has two children, Alexander (born September 21, 1977) and Zane (born August 3, 1982), by his former wife, Susan Spiller. ==PublicationsPublications by Selkirk=== *See No Evil.

The most significant variant of the Model K series of overhead camshaft Velocette motorcycles, the TT designation indicated the machine was intended for racing, and was an early example of a 'production racer' (although KTTs could be ordered as road-legal machines). The Velocette KTT was notable for having the first positive-stop foot gear change on a motorcycle, and the first with a swingarm rear suspension using separate shock absorber units 'Velocette; Technical Excellence Exemplified', Ivan Rhodes, 2003 (Motorbooks) . The foot shift innovation significant improvement for racing, and quickly replaced the hand gear change lever, and became the standard for almost all motorcycles to this day. Veloce's swingarm suspension also had profound and lasting effects on the motorcycle industry, and remains the standard for motorcycle rear suspension to this day . ==Development== Based on the Velocette KSS, the KTT was developed as a production racer specifically for the challenging Isle of Man TT course, which was the most important road race in the world at the time. A racing version of the Model K was built by Percy and Eugene Goodman, sons of the Velocette founder Johannes Gutgemann, in 1925 and after twelve months of development secured Velocette their first TT win in 1926. Alec Bennett was the winner with Gus Kuhn and Fred Povey finishing in the first nine to give the factory the team prize. Further work on KTT led to the first positive-stop foot gear change on a motorcycle in 1928. Other makers had modified the hand change for foot operation but none had designed a mechanism which could change gears up or down with a single movement, and return the shift lever to its original position. As well as being significant improvement for racing, this quickly replaced the hand gear change lever and became the standard for almost all motorcycles to this day. The Velocette KTT went on to become one of the most successful 350cc production racing motorcycles of all time, with a host of wins in international competition. The model was continually developed in a 'Mark' series, with the first year (1929) retroactively designated the 'Mark I', and each successive year given its own 'Mark' as changes to the engine, frame, forks, wheels, etc. continued. The first significant change came in late 1935, with the Mark V KTT, which had a new full-cradle frame (replacing the previous open-bottom frame which used the engine as a stressed member, from 1929-'35), which was identical to the KSS Mk2 frame. 1936 saw a break in KTT production, as only an estimated 6 Mark VI KTT's were built, for very select riders. The Mark VI used the cast aluminum cylinder head of the KSS Mk2, the first KTT with an aluminum cylinder head. After contracting Stanley Woods to ride for the Veloce racing team, his feedback led to changes in the KTT chassis for 1937 and the Mark VII KTT, as the engine was moved forward approx. 1.5\\" to give better handling. The engine had been significantly redesigned with a new aluminum cylinder head and barrel of much larger proportions, to improve cooling. The new-look engine produced significantly more power, and while only 37 Mark VII KTTs were built, they are considered among the most beautiful of the series, as well as being very successful racers.'Always in the Picture', Burgess and Clew, 1973 (Goose) 1948 KTT at a museum in Australia Following the introduction of swingarm rear suspension on the factory race team in 1937, Veloce introduced the Mark VIII KTT in 1938, which was the first production motorcycle to use a swinging-arm rear fork with enclosed suspension units ('shocks'), although these were 'oleo pneumatic' and used air as the springing medium, and not spring/oil shocks as adopted by the motorcycle (and car) industry postwar. The system was developed by Veloce designer Harold Willis, who flew a light plane with Oleo suspension legs; he contacted the Oleo company for a special pair of air shocks, which were used by Veloce for their factory racing motorcycles from 1937 onwards, and appeared on the production KTT Mark VIII in 1938. Production of the Velocette Mark VIII KTT ended in 1949, with around 238 models built. Around 1000 KTTs were produced in total from 1929 - 1950. ==See also== * Velocette * Velocette KSS ==References * Original Velocette KTT sales brochure * Velocette KTT video * Motorcycle Classics article on 1933 KTT Mark IV Velocette * Harold Willis, Velocette's Development Engineer on Velobanjogent.blogspot.com * Road Testing a 1933 Velocette KTT Mark IV * The Mysterious Mark VI KTT KTT ","title":"Velocette KTT"},{"id":"20559873","text":"Wood-engraving of 1874's 2,000 Guineas Stakes from May 1874 Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News Wood-engraving by D.

The usual agent is a topical corticosteroid (topical steroid). As the skin fungal infection has lost some of the characteristic features due to suppression of inflammation, it may have a poorly defined border and florid growth. Occasionally, secondary infection with bacteria occurs with concurrent pustules and impetigo.Habif, T. P. (1995) Clinical Dermatology. Mosby, 3rd ed.; pp. 41-42. == Cause == The use of a topical steroid is the most common cause. Frequently, a combination topical steroid and antifungal cream is prescribed by a physician. These combinations include betamethasone dipropionate and clotrimazole (trade name Lotrisone) and triamcinolone acetonide and clotrimazole. In area of open skin, these combinations are acceptable in treating fungal infection of the skin. Unfortunately, in area where the skin is occluded (groin, buttock crease, armpit), the immunosuppression by the topical steroid might be significant enough to cause tinea incognita to occur--even in the presence of an effective antifungal. == Diagnosis == Clinical suspicion arises especially if the eruption is on the face, ankle, legs, or groin. A history of topical steroid or immunosuppressive agent is noted. Confirmation is with a skin scraping and either fungal culture and/or microscopic exam with potassium hydroxide solution. Characteristic hyphae are seen running through the squamous epithelial cells. == Treatment == The removal of the offending topical steroid or immunosuppressive agent and treatment with a topical antifungal is often adequate. If the tinea incognita is extensive or involves hair bearing areas, treatment with a systemic antifungal for minimum three weeks may be needed. But in case of spreading it may need more than one month. ==References == Category:Animal fungal diseases Category:Mycosis-related cutaneous conditions ","title":"Tinea incognita"},{"id":"20560032","text":"Locust Gap is an unincorporated community in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania, United States.

Dissatisfied with subsisting on Government charity, he unsuccessfully made application to Pelham for employment, rather than a pension, in 1752. He was eventually made a Lord of Trade in 1754, when he was returned for Penryn and the next year, a Lord of the Admiralty instead, serving for a year. In 1756, he was appointed Comptroller of the Household and was again mayor of Lostwithiel, being appointed to the Privy Council on 19 November. Succeeding his father in 1758, he was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Cornwall in 1759 and recorder of Plympton Erle. He died childless in 1761 and was succeeded by his brother. == References == Category:1716 births Category:1761 deaths Category:Barons in the Peerage of Great Britain Category:British MPs 1741‚Äì1747 Category:British MPs 1747‚Äì1754 Category:British MPs 1754‚Äì1761 Category:Lord-Lieutenants of Cornwall Category:Lords of the Admiralty Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for Plympton Erle Category:People educated at Eton College Category:Whig (British political party) MPs Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for constituencies in Cornwall ","title":"Richard Edgcumbe, 2nd Baron Edgcumbe"},{"id":"20560203","text":"==Final table *Football Association of Slovenia Category:Slovenian Republic Football League seasons Yugo 3 Football Football ","title":"1959‚Äì60 Slovenian Republic League"},{"id":"20560205","text":"Fort Christanna was one of the projects of Lt. Governor Alexander Spotswood, who was governor of the Virginia Colony 1710-1722. When Fort Christanna opened in 1714, Capt. Robert Hicks was named captain of the fort and he relocated his family to the area. His homestead \\"Hick‚Äôs Ford\\" is close to the modern city of Emporia in Greensville County, VA. The fort was designed to offer protection and schooling to the tributary Siouan and Iroquoian tribes living to the southwest of the colonized area of Virginia. Located in what became Brunswick County, Virginia, near Gholsonville, the fort was completed in 1714 and enjoyed three successful years of operation as the westernmost outpost of the British Empire at the time,Neale p. 16 before being finally closed by the House of Burgesses in 1718. However, the demoralized Saponi and Tutelo continued to live on the allotted land, 6 miles square (36 sq. mi), into the 1730s and 1740s. ==Background== After the Tuscarora War broke out in 1711, Spotswood conceived the idea of a fort where he would settle the Siouan and Iroquoian tribes of Virginia that had been Tributary since 1677. The fort would offer them protection from hostile tribes, act as a trading center, and also provide schooling to their children to learn English culture. In late 1713, he got his idea approved by the Burgesses; it was to be under the jurisdiction of the newly formed Virginia Indian Company, which had a monopoly. ==History== In 1714 Spotswood himself visited the site and successfully persuaded the Siouan tribes, who included the Saponi, Tutelo, Occaneechi, and Nahyssan, to occupy the tract that was surveyed. However, the Iroquoian tribes in Virginia, the Nottoway and Meherrin, refused to take up their portion, saying they would not live with the Siouans.Neale, p 17 Spotswood even contemplated abducting them to make them live at the fort, but they eluded all efforts.Neale, p.18 He named the fort \\"Christ-Anna\\" after Christ, and after Queen Anne, who died later that year. It was built according to state-of-the-art principles of fort construction at that time, in the shape of a pentagon, and a blockhouse with 1400-lb cannon at each of the 5 corners, 100 yards apart, so as to enable each to command within sight of the next two. Inside the fort was a school for Indian children, taught by a Charles Griffin, where they learned to speak and write English, and to read the Bible and Book of Common Prayer. Lieut. John Fontaine, who spent some time there 1715-1716, left a detailed account of his observations on the Indians, and also recorded about 45-50 words and phrases of their Tutelo-Saponi language. He saw the fort at the peak of its success, and described hordes of \\"happy Indian children shrieking through the rain\\".Neale, p. 19 Another visitor, Rev. Hugh Jones, reported that the 77 Indian students could read, write and say their catechisms tolerably well, and that the natives adored Griffin so much, they \\"fain would have chosen him for a King of the Sapony Nation\\". Spotswood continued to take a keen interest and later started building his own house nearby, bringing his family there at one point in 1717. ===Decline=== The monopoly of the Virginia Indian Company on trading soon aroused the ire of private merchants such as William Byrd II, who had inherited his father's lucrative Indian trade. While back in London, he lobbied the Lords of Trade, arguing that Christanna was an unnecessary expense, and calling on them to return to independent trade and dissolve the Company. Despite Spotswood's objections, they did so on November 12, 1717. In May 1718, a treaty was signed with the Iroquois of New York, whereby they agreed not to come east of the Blue Ridge, and the Burgesses thereupon voted to discontinue manning the fort. Mr Griffin remained until September, then transferred to become master of the Indian school at the College of William & Mary. The Saponi and Tutelo remained on the tract for several more years, at a village called Junkatapurse (Tutelo: chunketa pasui, \\"horse's head\\"). They began moving elsewhere in small bands around 1730. The largest part of them moved to Shamokin, Pennsylvania in 1740, where they joined the Iroquois, and were formally adopted by the Cayuga nation in New York in 1753. Meanwhile, colonists had begun moving to the lands around the fort in such numbers that in 1720, Brunswick County was formed there as a separate county. The five large cannon once at the fort are supposed to have been buried in the well; its location is currently uncertain. A lesser cannon said to be from Christanna was for years in the front yard of a private home in the vicinity, fired every July 4 and Christmas, and in 1900, was moved to sit in front of the Christopher Wren Building at William and Mary. Another lesser cannon attributed to Christanna was taken to Lawrenceville, Virginia and fired to celebrate the election of Grover Cleveland in 1887, at which time it accidentally exploded; its remains in 1975 were said to be buried in the filled-in cellar of a former home.Neale, p. 32 It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, as a national historic district. ==References== *Gay Neale, Brunswick County Virginia 1720-1975 Category:Archaeological sites on the National Register of Historic Places in Virginia Category:1714 establishments in Virginia Category:1718 disestablishments in the Thirteen Colonies Category:Colonial Virginia Category:Native American history of Virginia Category:Brunswick County, Virginia Christianna Christianna Category:National Register of Historic Places in Brunswick County, Virginia Christianna Category:National Society of the Colonial Dames of America Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Virginia ","title":"Fort Christanna"},{"id":"20560209","text":"Letitia Dunbar-Harrison (4 February 1906 ‚Äì 1994) was an Irish librarian who became the subject of a controversy over her appointment.Scannal - The Curious Case of the Mayo Librarian, RT√â Television, retrieved 22 January 2010 A graduate of Trinity College Dublin, she is the subject of the 2009 book by Pat Walsh, The Curious Case of the Mayo Librarian, and a RT√â documentary of the same name. ==Mayo county librarian controversy== In 1930, a vacancy for county librarian arose in County Mayo, the county with the smallest non-Catholic minority in Ireland.

Putnam's Sons in 1959 after Mailer secured his reputation with The Naked and the Dead, then endured setbacks with the less-enthusiastic reception of Barbary Shore (1951) and The Deer Park (1955). Advertisements, though chaotic, unapologetically defiant, and often funny, marks the beginning of Mailer's mature style. Advertisements, with its new interest in counterculture, politics, and sexual liberation, is a key book among the dozens that Mailer produced and helped to create his persona as a swaggering, anti-establishment writer and explore \\"the web of relations between personal valor and virtue and literary growth and mastery\\" and serving as Mailer's \\"announcement that he was king of the literary hill.\\"Feeney, Mark (2007). \\"Norman Mailer, Self-titled King of the Literary Hill, dies at 84.\\" While initial sales were modest, Advertisements received many strong reviews, notably from Alfred Kazin and Irving Howe, and the New York Times Book Review, Partisan Review, and the Village Voice.Lennon, Double Life, p. 256-57. ==A Note to the Reader== This section explains the book's two tables of contents. The first lists the contents of the book in chronological order, while the second table of contents categorizes the pieces based on genre, such as fiction, essays, and interviews. Mailer lists what he believes are his best pieces in the book, which are: The Man Who Studied Yoga, \\"The White Negro\\", \\"The Time of Her Time\\", \\"Dead Ends\\", and \\"Advertisements for Myself on the Way Out\\". ==First Advertisement for Myself== Mailer gives readers his perspective, at age 36, on his writing, other writers, and the state of the nation. He believes his work, present and future, will be a key influence on those practicing his craft. In pulling together this collection of short novels, short stories, essays and advertisements, he's making his case and showing how he's matured as a writer over the years. Though at times in his career he was influenced by Ernest Hemingway, he points to the author as a writer who didn't grow. \\"Hemingway has always been afraid to think, afraid of losing even a little popularity‚Ä¶ and his words excite no thought in the best of my rebel generation.\\" It's a generation that he believes has grown up in a world \\"more in decay than the worst of the Roman Empire.\\" Still, he gives Hemingway credit for knowing the value of his own work and fighting to make his personality enrich his books. A writer's personality, Mailer observes, can determine how much attention readers give his work. \\"The way to save your work and reach more readers is to advertise yourself.\\" == Part One: Beginnings == This section includes Mailer's earliest works, written when he was a student at Harvard. Mailer admits that he is not particularly proud of the pieces in this section, but has included them for the readers who are interested in his early works. The pieces in this section are: * Advertisement for A Calculus at Heaven - The author writes that A Calculus at Heaven is his attempt, as a young writer, to imagine what war might really be like. * A Calculus at Heaven (short novel) - Set in the Pacific theater during World War II, five American soldiers - greatly outnumbered by enemy forces - have orders to maintain control of the nearby coastal road at all cost. * Advertisement for \\"The Greatest Thing in the World\\" - In his explanation of this short story, Mailer writes that it won first place in a Story magazine contest in 1941. Still, he was embarrassed to read it in later years. The only redeeming quality he can find in the story, in hindsight, is its sense of pace. * \\"The Greatest Thing in the World\\" (short story) - Al Groot, a broke and hungry drifter, tries to out-maneuver a couple of hustlers he meets at a diner on a rainy night. * Advertisement for \\"Maybe Next Year\\" - The author describes the prose in \\"Maybe Next Year\\" as Salinger-ish, but said the inspiration was really Faulkner. Just a month or so before the story's writing, Mailer had read The Sound and the Fury. * \\"Maybe Next Year\\" (short story) - Set during the Great Depression, a 9-year-old boy retreats the woods and meadows near his home during his parents‚Äô frequent fights over money. == Part Two: Middles == The second section features the short stories Mailer wrote hoping to keep up with the fame and notoriety that followed his best selling novel, The Naked and the Dead. * \\"Second Advertisement for Myself\\" - After his stint in the Army, Mailer spent all his time working on The Naked and the Dead. The novel was a bigger success than he would have ever imagined. But it led to questions about whether he ever would be able to repeat that success. In a sense, he writes, he may have been trying to evade that question by writing Barbary Shore. * Excerpts from Barbary Shore - Michael Lovett, a WWII vet, moves into a boarding house in Brooklyn, where he plans to write a novel. At the boarding house, he observes and interacts with the other characters who live there. * \\"Third Advertisement for Myself\\" - The timing was right for The Naked and the Dead, Mailer writes. It came out when everyone was ready for a long war novel. The timing was wrong for Barbary Shore. The media at the time seemed interested in getting America back to chastity, regularity, the safe, he writes. Mailer includes a number of bad reviews the novel received. The criticisms lead the author to turn his attention to short stories. * Advertisement for \\"Three War Stories\\" - Mailer describes writing ten short stories in a few weeks, using the same method: He'd start in the morning, finish the same day or give up on the idea. He writes that he takes no great pride in the stories. * \\"The Paper House\\" - World War II is over, and Nicholson and his pseudo-friend Hayes are stationed with a company of men in a small Japanese city. The two take frequent trips to a geisha house, where Nicholson longs for the company of Hayes‚Äô regular geisha. * \\"The Language of Men\\" - Sanford Carter, an insecure GI, feels completely worthless in the Army until he becomes a cook. Initially satisfied in the job, he goes through great lengths to gain the approval of his fellow soldiers. But, when they grow indifferent to his efforts, he's forced to stand up for himself. * \\"The Dead Gook\\" - Short story about a group of soldiers who help a group f Gooks, which are Filipino men. The Gooks take the soldiers on a quest to find one of their men who was killed by Japanese soldiers. Brody, one of the soldiers, hates the Gooks and doesn't care about the dead one until the end when he finally realized they weren't so bad. * Advertisement for \\"The Notebook\\" - The author talks about when \\"The Notebook\\" was first published in The Cornhill magazine. Mailer writes how he received many comments about this story and how it had the most comments out of all his stories that were published in English newspapers. He also writes about how he only wrote this story in an hour and was criticized by some of his readers. * \\"The Notebook\\" - Story focuses on a young writer and his girlfriend. They are on a walk when they begin to argue about the writer who never pays attention to his lady. The only thing he pays attention to is his notebook where he writes down all of his ideas for future works. This, in turn, causes a bigger issue, and the lady leaves the writer to be alone with his notebook until he realizes how much his lady meant to him. * Advertisement for \\"The Man Who Studied Yoga.\\" - In this advertisement for \\"The Man Who Studied Yoga\\", Mailer talks about how he was planning on this piece to be a prologue to an eight-part novel. He wanted his characters to appear in each part but at different ages. After finishing the first part, \\"The Deer Park\\", he realized an eight-part novel wasn't going to happen and settled for one with \\"The Man Who Studied Yoga\\" as the prologue. * \\"The Man Who Studied Yoga\\" (A short novel which served the prologue for The Deer Park) - \\"The Man Who Studied Yoga\\" is about a man named Sam Slovoda and his wife, Eleanor. Sam and Eleanor are at constant state of anxiety over their sex life. Their friends end up finding an old pornographic film, and they all gather at the Slovodas‚Äô house to watch it. Afterward, their friends leave, and Eleanor and Sam are having relations while Sam is constantly overthinking if he is doing everything right. In the end, Sam stresses himself out and knows that when he meets his psychoanalyst the next day, he is going to have to explain everything to him. * Advertisement for \\"Three Political Pieces\\" - In this advertisement, Mailer talks about his pieces that were first published in the symposium in the Partisan Review in 1951 and 1952. \\"The Meaning of Western Defense\\" and \\"David Reisman Reconsidered\\" are the two pieces he talks about. Mailer mentions how different the two pieces are, in terms of how they are written. * \\"Our Country and Our Culture\\" (Partisan Review Symposium) - Mailer discusses how writers were not respected as war writers and that a lot of writers were feeling alienated during this symposium. He talks about whether or not writers were ever more alienated than that day. Mailer also discusses how the literary history of that time was mostly produced by the newer, younger writers. * \\"David Riesman Reconsidered\\" - A review by Mailer of Riesman's Individualism Reconsidered. He talks about the only other review he had seen, which was Granville Hick's review in 1954. Throughout the review, he critiques Riesman's work and talks about which ones he thought were actually impressive and which ones he thought to be completely boring. * \\"The Meaning of Western Defense\\" - Mailer gives his thoughts on the Western Defense and how believes it was the ultimate reason for the Western annihilation. He discusses imperialism and Monopoly Capitalism. Mailer talks about what needs to be done in order to gain a socialist world. == Part Three: Births == The third section consists of Mailer's writings for Time, Newsweek, and One, ending with several columns written for The Village Voice. The primary features of this section are: * Advertisement for Part Three - The articles and novel found in this section were considered by Mailer to be some of his worst works. However, he states that he included them due to the personal growth that he experienced while writing them. * Advertisement for \\"The Homosexual Villain\\" - In the 1950s, Mailer was contacted to write an article for One - the Homosexual Magazine. After months of avoiding the situation, he finally sat down and wrote \\"The Homosexual Villain.\\" * \\"The Homosexual Villain\\" - Mailer states that his previous bigoted opinions of homosexuals experienced gradual changes over the course of a few years. He attributes these changes to Donald Cory's The Homosexual in America and becoming friends with his homosexual neighbor. * Fourth Advertisement for myself: The Last Draft of The Deer Park - Mailer's third novel was originally turned down by Rinehart & Company for extreme vulgarity and obscenity. The novel was eventually published up by G.P. Putnam's Sons for publication. The Deer Park underwent extensive editing by Mailer, who identified marijuana and other drugs to be his motivation behind the editing process. * Three Excerpts From Rinehart and Putnam Versions of The Deer Park \\\\- **Rinehart Page Proof: ***(Pages 1‚Äì3)- Sergius O‚ÄôShaugnessy, a former Air Force man, arrives in the Southern California town of Desert D‚ÄôOr. ***(Pages 134-8) - Teppis describes how his lover, Lulu, is considerably flighty and easily distracted. Yet, she maintains a serene control in her career and in-and-out of the bedroom. ***(Page 277) - Teppis is giving sexual praises to a young girl by the name of Bobby. **Changes found in the Putnam Edition: ***(Pages 1‚Äì3) - Mailer adds in more details to O‚ÄôShaugnessy's past by mentioning that he is an orphan. He also removes the notion that bungalows are considerably intimate. ***(Pages 134-9) - Mailer changes Teppis perception of Lulu. In the previous draft, he wrote Teppis as someone who could not find fault in Lulu. However, here Teppis describes Lulu as someone who is conceited and spoiled, and that they have fought because of her disregard for him. But he ignores those faults simply because they are superb lovers. ***(Page 284, previously page 277) - Mailer switches over to the third person point of view from the first person point of view in this edition. He also includes more endearments, such as darling and angel, to describe Bobby. * Two Reviews: Time and Newsweek - Time ‚Äì \\"Love Among the Love-Buckets\\"‚Äî The Deer Park is about medically discharged Sergius O‚ÄôShaugnessy of the Air Force, who experiences trauma and impotence due to dropping napalm on Korean villages. He wishes to write and decides to spend time in a desert gambling resort called Desert D‚ÄôOr. The Deer Park is meant to be overly sexualized for both of the genders. The women are reminiscent of the vulgar boys found in Mailer's The Naked and The Dead. Newsweek ‚Äì \\"Norman Mailer's Despair\\"‚Äî The Deer Park is a study of moral confusion and despair among the masses of the American people. Mailer shows mastery experience within the multiple colors of disillusionment and the morbidity of expecting sexual fascinations as a form of duty rather than affection. Mailer's novel speaks of people everywhere who have succumbed to their appetites and have lost their spirits among the temptations of this world. * Postscript to the Fourth Advertisement for Myself - Following the finally editing of The Deer Park, Mailer attempted to self promote the novel by sending copies to a few well known authors. The lack of response caused a sense of shame for Mailer. He claimed the experience was the motivation for a new era of boldness, half-done work, unbalanced heroics, and a more than a little bit of violence within him. * Advertisement for Sixty-Nine Questions and Answers - Mailer stated that about a month after The Deer Park had been released, a friend, Lyle Stuart editor of The Independent, sent him a list of sixty-nine questions for an interview. He claimed that he glanced over the questions before answering them with a brain full of marijuana. He gave one apology for a fatuous remark about Henry Miller early on in the interview. He also gave an anticipation of the fact that he originally answered the questions with a confidence that The Deer Park would become a best seller. However, this confidence turns into an intricate narcissism when the interview was published in The Village Voice. * \\"Sixty-Nine Questions and Answers\\" (an interview with Lyle Stuart) * Fifth Advertisement for Myself - General Marijuana: Mailer writes about the birth of The Village Voice in the 1950s by Dan Wolf, Edwin Fancher, and himself. He also provides that he considers marijuana to be his secret weapon. * The Village Voice\\": First Three Columns - Mailer discusses the differences between novelists. He states that good novelists suffer from several different mental problems. He continues to state that The Voice received an initial negative feedback. * Postscript to the First Three Columns - Mailer lists examples of what was removed from the columns. * The Village Voice: Columns Four to Seventeen - Mailer discusses communication, parody, and truth. He discusses how his friends, such as Robert Linders, impacted his life. He goes on to break down Linders' work sentence by sentence. He also discusses Ernest Hemingway and the play Waiting for Godot - something he has never seen or read, but has read many reviews. * Advertisement for the End of a Column and a Public Notice - After quitting his column, Mailer discusses reading and going to see the play Waiting for Godot. * A Public Notice on Waiting for Godot - Mailer makes a public apology for describing Beckett's play as a poem to impotency in his last column. Mailer discusses some of the play's characters. He then breaks down what he felt Beckett was saying. == Part Four: Hipsters == In the fourth section, Mailer criticizes the cultural movement of the Beat Generation and questions what exactly it means to be hip between the 1920s and 1950s.

He also discusses worldwide factors that influence writers. == Reception == Initial reactions to this book were widely negative because of its controversial content. But many changed their views over time and came to value and appreciate the perspective of Norman Mailer, whose book gave a voice to the younger generation. The first edition from Putnam featured a photograph of Mailer wearing a yachting cap, for which the author was criticized. Mailer's publisher, Walter Minton, thought the photograph of Mailer was a little silly. But Mailer thought it made him look handsome, and he argued Minton down. Mailer writes: \\"So Advertisements became the book in which I tried to separate my legitimate spiritual bile from my self-pity and maybe it was the hardest continuing task I had yet set myself. What aggravated every problem was that I was also trying to give up smoking, and the advertisements in this book, printed in italics, are testimony to the different way I was now obliged to use language.\\" Ernest Hemingway, in a letter to George Plimpton, characterized the book \\"as a sort of ragtag assembly of his rewrites, second thoughts and ramblings shot through with occasional brilliance.\\" Harry T. Moore, who founded the first branch of the NAACP, describes Norman Mailer's stories as \\"vigorous and often amusing attacks on the society the Squares have built.\\" He would later go on to describe the collections as having interesting views on society. Charles I. Glicksberg, a literary critic, wrote in ‚Ä≥Norman Mailer: The Angry Young Novelist In America,‚Ä≥ \\"Norman Mailer's latest production, Advertisements for Myself, is a painful book to read not because the author is so grimly determined to unburden himself of all his grievances and resentments but because he reveals an aspect of himself as a writer that is not pleasant to contemplate.\\" Gore Vidal, a literary journalist, describes the collection as a \\"wide graveyard of still-born talents which contains so much of the brief ignoble history of American letters, (the book) is a tribute to the power of a democracy to destroy its critics, brave fools and passionate men\\". As he continued to view Mailer's collection, he would later believe them to have been revolutionary in the development of the literary world. David Brooks of the New York Times cited the book as an example of a then-emergent and now- ubiquitous culture of self-exposure and self-love that stands in stark contrast to the humility that exemplified America at the close of World War II. == Cultural Influence == While not initially famous to the overall public, Advertisements for Myself appealed to a genre of people who were considered outcasts in society. For those who enjoyed the collection, it was described as having \\"won the admiration of a younger generation seeking alternative styles of life and art.\\" The younger generation, at the time, found it inspirational. Many also believed that this work \\"gave Mailer a new audience and set the stage for the sixties\\" as it gave way to a new movement through the voices of the younger generation. It would later be considered the peak of Mailer's literary career, often being cited as his most remembered work. ==References== Category:Books by Norman Mailer Category:1959 short story collections Category:Essay collections ","title":"Advertisements for Myself"},{"id":"20560259","text":"Maxwell Lake is a tarn located in the Eagle Cap Wilderness of Northeastern Oregon.

He neglected the precaution of obtaining confirmation of his sovereignty at Rome, and made the additional error of offending Publius Clodius Pulcher, by failing to ransom him when he had fallen into the hands of Cilician pirates.Strabo, xiv.; Appian, B. C., ii. 23 When Clodius became tribune (58 BC), he enacted a law to deprive Ptolemy of his kingdom, and reduce Cyprus to a Roman province. Cato, who was entrusted with carrying out this decree, advised Ptolemy to submit, offering him his personal safety, with the office of high-priest at Paphos and a generous pension. Ptolemy refused, and, wholly unprepared to resist Roman power and deciding to die a king, put an end to his own life, 58 BC.Strabo, xiv.; Dio Cassius, xxxviii. 30, xxxix. 22; Livy, Epit. civ.; Plutarch, Cato Minor, 34-36; Appian, B.

The film is based on her 1983 autobiography Second Serve: The Ren√©e Richards StoryRichards, Ren√©e with John Ames. \\"Second Serve: the Ren√©e Richards Story\\". New York City, New York, USA: Stein and Day, March 1983, that was written with John Ames. The script is by Stephanie Liss and Gavin Lambert and the film was directed by Anthony Page. Second Serve aired on CBS on May 13, 1986. ==Plot== In 1976, Ren√©e Richards is on the tennis court as a professional tennis player. The film flashes back to 1964, when Ren√©e Richards is an eye surgeon named Richard Radley (both roles played by Redgrave). Radley has a successful career and a fianc√©e, but secretly cross-dresses at night. Unable to speak with his mother Sadie (Louise Fletcher), who is a psychiatrist, Radley consults his own psychiatrist, Dr. Beck (Martin Balsam), who advises him to grow a beard. This strategy works temporarily until Radley is drafted into the Navy, which does not allow beards. Following his discharge and a failed marriage, Radley undergoes gender reassignment surgery and becomes Ren√©e. Ren√©e relocates to California, resumes her career as a surgeon and begins dating. After playing in a local tennis tournament in La Jolla, Ren√©e is outed as transgender by a television reporter. In the ensuing controversy, Ren√©e takes the United States Tennis Association to court, where she secures her right to play professional tournament tennis as a woman without being subjected to chromosome testing. ==Cast== * Vanessa Redgrave as Richard Radley/Renee RichardsRichards' birth name was Richard Raskind but the name was changed to Richard Radley for the film. **Whit Hertford as Young Richard Radley * Martin Balsam as Dr. Beck * William Russ as Josh * Alice Krige as Gwen * Kerrie Keane as Meriam * Richard Venture as Dr. David Radley * Reni Santoni as Dr. Roberto Granato * Louise Fletcher as Dr. Sadie M. Bishop * Jeff Corey as Dr. Harry Benjamin ==Critical reception== Critic John J. O'Connor of The New York Times praised Redgrave's performance. Although noting that from a physical standpoint Redgrave is not very believable, O'Connor calls her performance \\"astonishingly convincing\\". While finding the script wanting for its tendency to reduce complexities to cliches, O'Connor also found that Second Serve \\"does manage, despite oversimplifications and evasions, to stick to the point. But it is the extraordinary Redgrave performance that slams the message home.\\" New York magazine concurred in this assessment, with reviewer John Leonard calling the film \\"calm and matter-of-fact, and perhaps too tidy\\". Leonard lavished Redgrave with praise for her performance, writing: > Redgrave, tall and vulnerable, athletic and bewildered, fearful and loving > competitive and lonely, manages to transsex both ways. She embodies, with > the fine bones of that face and the twitching of her various limbs, every > internal contradiction of the polymorphously perverse.\\" Second Serve was not universally praised by critics, receiving negative reviews from such outlets as the Chicago Sun-Times. Redgrave was nominated for an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe for her performance and Second Serve won Emmys for hairstyling and makeup. ==Notes * Category:1986 television films Category:1986 films Category:1980s biographical films Category:1986 LGBT-related films Category:American films Category:American LGBT-related films Category:American biographical films Category:Biographical films about sportspeople Category:Films about trans women Category:1983 non-fiction books Category:Transgender literature Category:Tennis films Category:Films set in 1964 Category:Films set in 1976 Category:CBS network films Category:Films directed by Anthony Page Category:Films scored by Brad Fiedel Category:Cultural depictions of tennis players Category:Cultural depictions of transgender and transsexual people Category:Cultural depictions of American women Category:LGBT-related films based on actual events ","title":"Second Serve"},{"id":"20560411","text":"Hoagland is an unincorporated community in Highland County, in the U.S. state of Ohio. ==History== The community was named after the local Hoagland family.

The Mk VIII KTT was ultimate development of their K series of overhead-camshaft 350cc machines introduced in 1925, and the TT designation indicated a production racing motorcycle, and a near replica of the factory race team machines. Production continued until 1950. ==Development== The final development of the Velocette KTT, the Mk VIII KTT was introduced in 1938 at that year's Earls Court Show, and was the first motorcycle to use the now-conventional swinging-arm rear fork with a shock absorber unit (in this case, an oleo-pneumatic unit built by the Oleo Strut Co. of England). The rear suspension system was designed by Veloce development engineer Harold Willis, and was inspired by the Oleo strut landing gear on the DeHavilland Hornet he borrowed at the Midland Aero Club, while his beloved DeHavilland 'Moth' was undergoing repair. Contact with the Oleo company led to several pairs of air shocks built for Veloce in 1936, for which the factory's racing rigid-frame racers (similar to the Mark VII KTT) were adapted with a swinging-fork rear end and bolt-on subframe for the seat. The experimental first swinging-arms used an adapted steering head lug turned sideways, with the cup-and-cone bearings retained. Production Mark VIII KTTs used a more conventional bronze bush and trunnion shaft pivot for the one-piece rear fork. The first experimental swing-arm machines were raced by the factory in the 1937 season, and introduced as the Mark VIII KTT the next year, for sale to the public.'Velocette; Technical Excellence Exemplified', Ivan Rhodes, 2003 (Motorbooks) The Mark VIII KTT was offered from 1938 - 1950, after which Veloce closed its racing department. ==See also== * Velocette * Velocette KTT ==References * Detailed analysis of the Velocette Mk VIII engine design and construction * Veklocette Mk VIII racing specials KTT Mk VIII ","title":"Velocette KTT Mk VIII"},{"id":"20560465","text":"James Archibald Duncan (1858‚Äì1911) was a British lawyer and a Liberal politician who briefly represented the seat of Barrow-in-Furness.

Tarrant's books include When Sex Became Gender, Men and Feminism, Men Speak Out: Views on Gender, Sex, and Power, Fashion Talks: Undressing the Power of Style, and the forthcoming New Views on Pornography. She is described as an \\"unconventional feminist\\" redefining gender rights, and is considered \\"a national leader in working with younger feminist men\\". She was identified in 2010 as an \\"extraordinarily accomplished thought leader\\" by the national Women's Media Center. In 2012, she was named a Glidden Visiting Professor at Ohio University. ==Career== Tarrant grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, attended Olney Friends School, and lives in Los Angeles. She received a PhD in political science from UCLA in 2001, working with advisor Carole Pateman. Tarrant's Ph.D. thesis topic was \\"Confronting the Bonds of Ideology: Feminist Social and Political Theory, 1945-1965\\". In 2006, Tarrant was an assistant professor of women's studies at Goucher College. In 2010, Tarrant was selected by the Women's Media Center for its Progressive Women's Voices media and leadership training program, which identifies \\"extraordinarily accomplished thought leaders\\" from across the United States. In 2012, she was awarded the Glidden Visiting Professorship at Ohio University. She is currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at California State University, Long Beach. A frequent speaker at college campuses and public venues across the country, Tarrant is frequently quoted in print, radio, television, and online media. Tarrant was interviewed for the 2011 film The Bro Code: How Contemporary Culture Creates Sexist Men. She is a member of the National Advisory Board for the pro-feminist men's magazine Voice Male and a representative for the national organization Faculty Against Rape. ==Writings== Tarrant is the author of Men and Feminism (Seal Press), When Sex Became Gender (Routledge) and editor of the anthology Men Speak Out: Views on Gender, Sex and Power (Routledge). Her book, Fashion Talks: Undressing the Power of Style, with Marjorie Jolles, was published in 2012 (SUNY Press). A second edition of Men Speak Out appeared in 2013 from Routledge. New Views on Pornography: Sexuality, Politics, and the Law was published in February, 2015 (Praeger, co-edited with Lynn Comella). Within Tarrant's Men and Feminism, the first chapter titled ‚ÄúThis Is What A Feminist Looks Like‚Äù introduces the issues of modern feminism, its growing inclusivity and relevance to male identified people (described from this point on as men). The chapter prefaces the book by defining feminism as ‚Äúa movement for ending all forms of oppression, including gender based oppression‚Äù and explains the fundamental principles of the movement which include the necessity of confronting patriarchal, racist and binary thinking. While emphasizing how feminism applies to men (as the system of patriarchy also restricts men's roles), it highlights how by accepting and working within the framework of feminism, men can use their own gender privilege to stand up and better the lives of those oppressed in our current societal system. Relying on quotes and anecdotes, the first chapter of Men and Feminism provides insight to a growing demographic of men who consider egalitarian views and social responsibility to be common sense in today's world and persuades the reader to ponder ‚Äúwhat men can offer feminism and what feminism can offer men‚Äù. The chapter discusses the multiple ways in which all men can commit to acting as proponents for equality. The examples range from deconstructing traditional gender roles to calling out racist or sexist jokes, ultimately stressing the importance of ‚Äúexamining our own place in various systems of domination - how we benefit and how we‚Äôre held back‚Äù in order to generate social and political transformation. The chapter also introduces key aspects of feminism such as the importance of understanding intersectionality and refuting essentialism, effectively laying down the ground rules that are required when learning to think critically about all forms of oppression and the perspectives needed when working to mitigate them. By recognizing the fact that some forms of feminism have been unwelcoming of men's engagement within the movement historically, chapter one also proves that there is room for men today and invites them to be ‚Äúcomrades in struggle‚Äù. Furthermore, while the chapter acknowledges the politics inherent in labeling oneself a feminist, it recommends that men need not fear the term and emphasizes that the success of an effective and well received ally ultimately depends on their actions and level of commitment. In addition to providing real life examples of men working through the lens of feminism and acknowledging opportunities for progress in daily life, the book is written in a clear and straightforward style, making it accessible to not only academics but also the target audience of young males. Overall, Tarrant's ‚ÄúThis Is What A Feminist Looks Like‚Äù provides an informative overview of the movement's evolution and brings the reader to understand that in true bell hooks fashion, feminism is indeed for everybody. Tarrant's writing has appeared in Bitch, Bust, Ms. blog, Women's Studies Quarterly, The Huffington Post, and other mainstream and academic outlets.

He was a personal physician to George Washington. His description of the disease diphtheria was instrumental in formulating treatment for that condition. ==Early life== Bard was born in Philadelphia on April 1, 1742. He was a son of Suzanne (n√©e Valleau) Bard (1720‚Äì1784), a granddaughter of Peter Fauconnier, and Dr. John Bard (1716‚Äì1799), a physician who was born in Burlington, New Jersey. He first studied at King's College, and in September 1761 sailed to Europe to obtain a thorough medical education. He spent five years in France, England, and Scotland and received his M.D. at the University of Edinburgh in May 1765. On his return, he found his father in debt for his education, which had cost more than a thousand pounds. He entered into partnership with him, and for three years drew nothing beyond his expenses from the profits of the business, amounting to 1,500 a year. ==Career== Bard was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1767.Bell, Whitfield J., and Charles Greifenstein, Jr. Patriot-Improvers: Biographical Sketches of Members of the American Philosophical Society. 3 vols. Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society, 1997, I:333, 373-82,374, II:136, III:21, 275, 330, 550-51. In 1769, Bard founded the first hospital in New York called the Hospital in the City of New York in America, which became New York Hospital (now a part of NewYork‚ÄìPresbyterian Hospital). Bard formed the plan of the Medical School of New York, which was published within a year after his return. He was appointed Professor of the Practice of Physics. Medical degrees were first conferred in 1769. In the same year, the hospital was founded by his exertions; but the building was burnt, causing a delay of the establishment until 1791. In the time of the war he left the city, placing his family in the house of his father at Hyde Park; but anxious to provide for his wife and children and to secure his property, in the next year, he returned to New York, while the enemy had possession of it, and engaged in his professional business. After the return of peace, Washington selected him as his family physician. At this period he lost four out of his six children by scarlatina, which prevailed in a violent form. In consequence of the illness of Mrs. Bard, he withdrew from business for a year, devoting himself to her. In 1784, he returned to the city. Having formed the purpose to retire from business, in 1798, he moved to his seat in the neighborhood of his father at Hyde Park. But, when the yellow fever appeared, he resolutely returned to his post. By his fearless exposure of himself he took the disease; but, nursed by his wife, he recovered. The remaining 23 years of his life were spent in happy retirement, surrounded by his children and grandchildren. In 1813, he was appointed President of the College of Physicians and Surgeons. ==Personal life== After paying back his father for his medical school debt, he married his cousin, Mary Bard (1746‚Äì1821), to whom he had long been attached. Together, they were the parents of eight children (five who died young, four from scarlet fever): * Susannah Bard (1772‚Äì1845), who in 1792 married John Johnston (1762‚Äì1850), presiding Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Dutchess County from 1807 to 1817.

After two independent releases, and several years of touring, the band was finally able to get their newest album, titled On the Brink of it All, released on the national level in 2008. ==History== Ever Stays Red formed in the fall of 2002, when the 4 recently graduated high-school friends decided to start a band. Determined to creating music that would touch people's souls, they bought a small home in Phoenix, Arizona, and became roommates. They filled the house with more musical equipment than furniture, and produced more music than meals, soon turning the small home into \\"the\\" loft studio. A short 2 years later, the band hit the road in support of their debut album, I'll Tell The World. Playing in over 250 shows across America, they quickly gathered a group of devoted fans, with 3 songs from their album going into the 'top-twenty rock single' list, and the album selling over 20,000 units. With the money made from the touring, Ever Stays Red managed to fund a trip to Belo Horizonte, Brazil, where they performed nightly for thousands of young Brazilian teens, many of which lived in the inner city. Throughout that 12-day stretch of shows, the band witnessed firsthand the power the music had to transcend culture and creed, making them even more certain of their calling. \\"Brazil was a turning point for this band,‚Äù says Carlson. ‚ÄúIt was the moment in time when we all realized that we were a part of something so much bigger than ourselves. We came home from that trip committed to the idea that music becomes meaningful when it brings hope--we have always strived to make meaningful music.http://www.christianmusic.com/ever_stays_red/ever_stays_red.htm I wrote songs for the new album from my heart; songs about never giving up on the dreams inside of you, songs about redemption, songs about daring to believe in what the world could be.\\" Fueled by the idea of a second trip to Brazil in 2006, the band returned to their home in the states, and started recording its second album. They finally independently released the album, entitled These Words Become Us, an album that quickly gathered airplay at numerous rock radio stations across the states. In anticipation of the album's release, the band invested heavily into their live performances, spending tons of cash and hundreds of hours to build a mesmerizing multi-media production that made the already impressive live show into a spiritually moving experience. Throughout this time, the band toured with bands like Kutless, Sanctus Real, Falling Up, Hawk Nelson, Dizmas, Everyday Sunday, Stellar Kart, and This Beautiful Republic, which helped the band continued to grow their fan base and reach new markets. In the spring of 2007, Ever Stays Red signed with Vertical Shift Records (VSR Music), and was asked to record a third album. Released in March 2008, On the Brink Of It All embodies the band that has given everything to chase their dreams. With compellingly honest vocals, and spiritually gripping lyrics aimed to please fans of rock and roll and worship music alike, the heartbeat of the album is the band‚Äôs firm belief that the dreams that inspire us should never be allowed to die. ==Former members== *Dustin Carlson - lead vocals, guitar *Zach Andresen - guitar, vocals *Erik Brunner - bass *Josh Carlson - drums ==Discography== *I'll Tell the World (2004, Independent) *These Words Become Us (2006, Independent) *On the Brink Of It All (2008, VSR Music) ==References== * Music Faith \\"Ever Stays Red\\" Retrieved 2009-08-30 Category:Christian rock groups from Arizona Category:Musical groups established in 2002 Category:2002 establishments in Arizona ","title":"Ever Stays Red"},{"id":"20560546","text":"Western Athletic Conference in Utah Valley's colors The Utah Valley University (UVU) Wolverines represent Utah Valley University in NCAA DI collegiate athletics and sponsor 16 sporting programs.

He excelled in single make series in the eighties and competed in saloons in the nineties, mainly in the British Touring Car Championship. He still makes occasional appearances in historic racing events. ==Racing careerEarly career=== His first title came in 1979, winning the National Mini 850 Championship. Between 1980 and 1982 he drove in various saloon cars before getting his first taste of the BTCC for Rover Metro Team in 1983 and 1984. In 1986 he raced in the Fiat Uno Turbo Championship. More titles followed, winning the inaugural Honda CRX Championship in 1988, and again in 1990. Also that year he won the Mazda MX5 championship. In 1991 he stepped up to the ESSO Production Saloon Car Championship, winning yet another title with a Peugeot 309. ===BTCC Mazda=== His success in 1991 earned him a drive in the 1992 British Touring Car Championship for the new works Shell Mazda Racing Team in a Mazda 323. The one car the team put out was not on the pace of most of the other works teams, and he finished the season in sixteenth place. In 1993, the team switched to a distinctively painted single Mazda Xedos 6. The new car performed much better than the 323 although easy down on power compared to its rivals. The Xedos did manage to get some promising results throughout the year; Patrick lead races and qualified on the front row on more than one occasion. Unfortunately his season was spoiled by often being caught up in several incidents, and he ended the championship in fifteenth place. Mazda did not continue to run a team in 1994, despite showing promise in 1993 [although a team of 2 semi-works cars ran half of the season]. ===BTCC Peugeot=== In 1994 he replaced Robb Gravett in the Peugeot Sport team with the Peugeot 405. A good year for both driver and team saw him end the year in eighth place, including four podium finishes. Team mate for 1994, Eugene O'Brien, was replaced by newcomer Simon Harrison in 1995. A slightly more troubled season ended with Watts in tenth place with two podiums. The new look Total Team Peugeot had a new car in 1996 with the all new Peugeot 406, along with a new team mate for Watts. Harrison was replaced with 1992 champion and fellow Farnborough racer Tim Harvey. It what was always going to be a year of learning for Peugeot, the car failed to perform on the track, and he finished one down in sixteenth place, one position behind Harvey the lowest position for a works driver. Despite higher hopes for 1997 with MSD running the team, the car performed little better despite an improvement towards the end of the season. In Germany the car was dominating but the British effort struggled mainly due to internal team problems and budget restrictions. Again he finished the year down in sixteenth. With the team struggling, he left at the end of the year following a final race at that year's Bathurst 1000 teamed with Neil Crompton, but failing to finish. He was replaced in 1998 by Paul Radisich who found the team a problem also and fared even worse than Patrick. ===Post BTCC=== He competed in the first two rounds of the Australian Super Touring Championship in 1999 (Peugeot 406), winning one race at round one and finishing 2nd in both races of round two. The race commentators called him ‚ÄúPommy Paddy‚Äù.http://www.supertouringregister.com/document/96/ After that he has done a few rallies including the Armajaro British Historic Rally Championship which he won in 2006 and finished second in 2007. His Touring Car efforts of the nineties were recognised in 2004 when he was selected to drive in the BTCC Masters, where his race ended after a collision with Jason Plato. He now competes in an Allard J2 and FIA mustang and has recently bought the ex-works Computervision MG Metro Turbo he used in BTCC in 1984 and Peugeot 406 that he used successfully in Australia in 1999. In 2017, Watts drove in the Dunlop Endurance championship in Cuda Drinks-entered Ginetta G50 with Richard Burrows. They finished 24th in race one and 13th in race two at Silverstone. Patrick is CEO of recycling company Sweeep Kuusakoski, one of the biggest recyclers of electronic components in the world. ==Racing recordComplete British Touring Car Championship results=== (key) (Races in bold indicate pole position - 1 point awarded 1996 onwards all races, 1983-88 in class) (Races in italics indicate fastest lap - 1 point awarded 1983-88 in class) {  style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:85%\\" !

He was a member of Donegal County Council representing the Letterkenny electoral area from 1999 to 2014. He served as the County Council's chair of the Planning & Economic Development Strategic Policy Committee. He was the highest paid councillor in Ulster. Larkin was the youngest ever chairperson elected to Donegal VEC. He was also a member of Letterkenny Town Council. ==Biography== Born and raised in Letterkenny, County Donegal, Larkin was educated at St Eunan's College in Letterkenny. He has worked in Unifi and been Chairman of the Peace III Partnership Board and Chairman of the Donegal County Development Board. He was married with four children. First elected to the Town Council as a member of Independent Fianna F√°il in 1999, he also served as Town Mayor. He was elected as Chairman of the County Council on 27 June 2005, which resulted in him representing Donegal throughout the country. He served in this position for one year. Until 30 June 2005 he was Mayor of Letterkenny. Larkin joined Fianna F√°il in 2006 alongside Niall Blaney. He died on 18 March 2019. ==Larkin v. the Football Association of Ireland== During a football match played on 3 October 1993, Larkin suffered severe burning to his scrotum and inner thighs. In 2006, he sued the Football Association of Ireland (FAI). His injuries resulted from the lime used to mark the football pitch burning his scrotum and inner thighs. The burning occurred when Larkin was playing a soccer match for Bonagee Celtic Football Club in the FAI Junior Cup. Larkin recalled the lack of changing or showering facilities. He removed his football shorts only to notice \\"white stuff like Alka-Seltzer\\" in his shorts. His skin was also inflamed. After an uncomfortable drive home, Larkin applied Sudocream to the affected area, took painkillers and went to bed. The judge in the case was told there were no instructions from the FAI regarding the amount of lime and water to be included in the mix. The judge awarded Larkin ‚Ç¨9,000, also stating that the onus was on the FAI to ensure players were sufficiently warned to take precautions to prevent such incidents happening. ==Expenses and appointment controversies== Former environment minister John Gormley illegally appointed Larkin to the Private Residential Tenancies Board in 2008. Donegal County Council and several media outlets, including Highland Radio, received documentation alleging Larkin was involved in irregularities in expenses payments. ==NotesReferences== Category:2019 deaths Category:Fianna F√°il politicians Category:Mayors of Letterkenny Category:Local councillors in County Donegal Category:People educated at St Eunan's College Category:Independent Fianna F√°il politicians ","title":"Dessie Larkin"},{"id":"20560645","text":"The Canon lourd de 8 Gribeauval (Gribeauval heavy 8-pounder cannon) was a French canon and part of the Gribeauval system developed by Jean Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval.

It was used for entertainment and political meetings. It was a three-story building where bawdy concerts took place. The building had a front of 40 feet and a depth of 125 feet. Often called Mozart Hall, it was also a gathering place of anti-Tammany Hall political forces in New York City. Fernando Wood, New York Mayor and Congressman, founded the organization. The edifice burned entirely in the early morning hours of March 24, 1861. Proceedings at the venue were frowned upon by newspaper writers such as one from The New York Times. He commented about Canterbury Hall advertisements promoting the prettiest waiter girls in town. Along with a rival theater, the Melodeon, the establishment was \\"a nightly disgrace to Broadway and its adjacent streets\\". In November 1860 the proprietors of the business, Fox & Curran, were compelled to pay a license fee of $500 to keep the venue open. A New York Times editorialist expressed the opinion that this was a first measure in ridding the city of such nuisances, which he predicted the New York State Legislature would soon entirely eliminate.Amusements, The New York Times, November 16, 1860, pg. 5. The property on which Canterbury Hall stood was formerly owned by a Reverend Wiley. His estate encompassed additional buildings on Broadway and was insured for $15,000. The fire which consumed the structure began among stage scenery and was discovered by watchmen. The owners of Canterbury Hall suffered an estimated loss of $10,000. A fire marshal began an investigation into the cause of the fire which was considered to be of incendiary origin.\\"Canterbury Hall Burned Down\\", The New York Times, March 25, 1861, pg. 8. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1861 Category:Cultural history of New York City Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Manhattan Category:Burned buildings and structures in the United States Category:Broadway (Manhattan) Category:Lower Manhattan Category:Event venues in Manhattan ","title":"Canterbury Hall (New York City)"},{"id":"20560676","text":"Coos Bay is a bay on the coast of Oregon in the United States.

In addition to affirmatively specifying the field of use, the license may negatively specify a field or fields, by specifying fields of use from which the licensee is excluded. By way of example, such a license might authorize a licensee to manufacture patented engines only for incorporation into trucks, or to manufacture a chemical only for sale to farmers (as contrasted with home gardeners). If the licensee exceeded the scope of the licensee, it would commit patent infringement. More generally, this kind of license permits the licensee to use the patented invention in some, but not all, possible ways in which the invention could be exploited. In an exclusive field-of-use license the licensee is the only person authorized to use the invention in the field of the license. Field-of-use limitations in patent licenses may raise antitrust issues when such arrangements are used to allocate markets or create cartels. ==USA case law== The US Supreme Court held such arrangements legitimate in General Talking Pictures Corp. v.

By way of example, such a license might authorize a licensee to manufacture patented engines only for incorporation into trucks (the \\"truck field\\"), or to manufacture such engines only for sale to farmers (the \\"field of distribution to farmers\\").For an example of an actual license of this type, see UC Regents License ‚Äì Exclusive field-of-use patent license between the Regents of the University of California and Cepheid. If the licensee exceeded the scope of the licensee, it would commit patent infringement. The doctrine of the General Talking Pictures case does not apply to a patent owner's sale (or its licensee's sale) of a product to a customer that imposes a restriction on what the customer may subsequently do with the product. Such sales are governed by the ‚Äúexhaustion doctrine,‚Äù rather than the General Talking Pictures doctrine. Enforced with fines and often much bad publicity.See Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc., 128 S. Ct. 2109 (2008). Furthermore, when field-of-use licensing is used to create a horizontal cartel by which product markets are allocated among what would otherwise be competitive licensees, the General Talking Pictures doctrine does not shield the arrangement from the antitrust laws. In Hartford-Empire Co. v. United States,323 U.S. 386 (1945). such a cartel based on patents was condemned as an antitrust violation. In United States v. Ciba Geigy Corp.,508 F.Supp. 1118 (D.N.J.1976). the court found an antitrust violation as to patent licenses that restricted use of purchased drug chemicals but no violation as to licenses that limited the use of the same chemicals by licensees manufacturing them. ==Free software licences== It has been argued that field-of-use limitations are inconsistent with W3C standards and with the GNU General Public License.See FSF's Position on W3 Consortium ‚ÄúRoyalty-Free‚Äù Patent Policy. ==See also== * Exhaustion doctrine ==References== Category:Patent law Category:Anti-competitive practices Category:Patent law legal terminology ","title":"Field-of-use limitation"},{"id":"20560808","text":"Death of a Gentle Lady is the twenty-fourth mystery novel in the Hamish Macbeth series by M.

By contrast, each extension has a unique corresponding equivariant L-function.

Awards for actions that took place in a single flight are the norm, with 74 individual aircraft accounting for 82 of the 93 medals awarded for actions while in flight (including eight dual awards representing the same aircraft). Of those 75 planes, 41 were destroyed during the MoH action, while others were lost later. In a few cases the MoH recipient survived while the plane did not (Jimmy Doolittle's North American B-25 Mitchell, as an example). The reverse also occurred: Lts. Jack W. Mathis and Robert E. Femoyer received posthumous awards while their respective Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses survived, only to be scrapped later. Some aircraft were recognized following their crew's award but were not preserved, including Butch O'Hare's Grumman F4F Wildcat, which wasn't stricken until two and one half years after his MoH action, as well as Maj. James H. Howard's \\"borrowed\\" North American P-51 Mustang, whose identity remains a mystery. In wartime often the pressing needs for serviceable aircraft overcame their need for preservation in programs or museums that did not yet exist. ==WWII== By far the most MoH's were issued to crewmen flying on Boeing aircraft. Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress crewmen received 17 awards from 1942 to 1945. Eleven of the Flying Fortress MoH's were posthumous awards, while in 1945 a Boeing B-29 Superfortress crewman was awarded the MoH for saving his plane despite crippling burns. Eleven Consolidated aircraft were involved in MoH missions, including two Consolidated PBY Catalinas. The MoH awarded to Consolidated B-24 Liberator crewmen were largely associated with the series of attacks on the Romanian oil refineries in 1943‚Äì44 although one went to a Navy PB4Y Privateer. The Grumman F4F Wildcat represents the most MoH's for a fighter aircraft serving in World War II by a sizable margin, with 8 MoH recipients. Seven F4F MoH's were to Marine Corps pilots, six of whom received their MoH for missions in the Solomon Islands during 1942‚Äì43. The lone Navy pilot was Lt. (j.g.) Edward H. \\"Butch\\" O'Hare, recognized as the Navy's first World War II ace. Cmdr. David McCampbell's two MoH missions in 1944 were in a Grumman F6F Hellcat bring Grumman's tally to nine MoH aircraft. ==Korea== Korean War MoH aircraft include a wide range of types, from World War II vintage aircraft to jets. They include one each for the North American F-51 Mustang, Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star, North American F-86 Sabre, Douglas A-26 Invader, Vought F4U Corsair, and the first MoH helicopter, a Sikorsky HO3S. ==Vietnam== The Vietnam War produced 20 in-flight MoH awards. They include a very diverse group of 7 fixed-wing aircraft and four helicopters, which range from a Cessna O-1 Bird Dog Forward Air Controller to a Fairchild C-123 Provider transport, to a Republic F-105 Thunderchief fighter-bomber, plus the well-represented Bell Huey. The McDonnell-Douglas F-4 Phantom II is represented only by pilot Lance Sijan, who was awarded a posthumous MoH for his exceptional courage as a POW. Notable for its absence is the Grumman A-6 Intruder. ==Survivors== Very few MoH aircraft survive today, especially since nearly half of all awards have been posthumous. Today four MoH combat aircraft still exist, plus two non-combat aircraft and the parts of one MoH Grumman F4F Wildcat. *Ryan NYP. Charles Lindbergh's custom Ryan aircraft is on display at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. *Fokker Trimotor. Richard Evelyn Byrd and Floyd Bennett's Trimotor, the Josephine Ford, is on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan. *Douglas A-1E Skyraider (s/n 52-132649) is on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio. In 1967, one year after the action for which its pilot, Maj, Bernard Fisher, was awarded the MoH, the aircraft crashed on a training flight. Being well- used and in bad condition, it was sent back to the U.S. for scrapping. Fortunately its identity was recognized by a staff member at the scrapping site, and the aircraft was sent to the Museum for preservation. The aircraft is on display in the Museum's Modern Flight gallery. *Bell UH-1C Huey (s/n 66-00528) is owned 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, and is on display at Fort Irwin, CA. This is the aircraft for which Sgt. Rodney Yano was awarded the MoH for his actions on 1 January 1969. On that date Sgt. Yano, serving as a volunteer crew chief aboard Maj. John Bahnsen's command helicopter of the 11th Cavalry Regiment, was dropping grenades from the aircraft to mark a target for fighter-bombers. A phosphorus grenade detonated prematurely and began to ignite the remaining ammunition on board. Despite the loss of his left hand, severe burns, and loss of sight, Sgt. Yano searched through the aircraft as the explosives detonated around him, throwing the ammunition overboard. His action saved the aircraft and its crew. Sgt. Yano, the son of a Hawaiian fisherman, died that night of his injuries. *Bell UH-1E Huey (BuNo. 154760) is on display at the National Museum of the Marine Corps in Triangle, Virginia. This is the aircraft for which Capt. Steve Pless was awarded the MoH for his actions in August 1967. His aircraft was diverted to the site of an Army helicopter that had been shot down behind enemy lines. Four GIs survived the crash and were pinned down by enemy fire. Capt. Pless fired his machine guns and rockets at the enemy forces then landed his helicopter between them and the trapped Americans. Three of the GIs were able to board the aircraft while his copilot and crew chief killed additional enemy troops, some less than 10 feet away. Capt. Pless got the overloaded aircraft airborne and returned safely to base. Two of the rescued soldiers died, but the survivor owed his life to Capt. Pless and his crew. *Boeing Vertol CH-46D Sea Knight (BuNo. 153389) is on display at the Carolinas Aviation Museum in Charlotte, North Carolina. It has been restored to the marking of its MoH mission, including the name Blood, Sweat & Tears. In addition to its MoH action, this remarkable aircraft is reported to have flown in every major Marine Corps operation since Vietnam, including Beirut, Grenada, Kuwait and Somalia. *Grumman F4F-3 Wildcat (BuNo. 4019) (parts). Capt. Henry T. Elrod was awarded a posthumous MoH in recognition for his heroism while flying this aircraft, known as Mike Fox 11, over Wake Island in December 1941. A postwar memorial on Wake featured the cowling nose ring and propeller of an F4F believed to be Capt. Elrod's aircraft. When the tribute was dismantled around 1965 the parts were sent to the Marine Corps Museum. When the National Air and Space Museum restored its FM-1 the only cowling nose ring that could be located was the one taken from the Wake Island memorial. Though it cannot be proven conclusively that the cowling nose ring is indeed from Mike Fox 11, leathernecks certainly like to believe that it is. One near-survivor was Fairchild C-123 Provider (55-4542), the aircraft MoH recipient Maj. Joe Jackson was piloting when he made his daring rescue of Air Force personnel trapped on an airstrip being overrun by Communist forces in 1968. By the time the Air Force History Office learned the aircraft still existed it had been transferred to the South Vietnamese government, who later transferred it to the Thai government. The aircraft was apparently not scrapped until the early 1990s. Another was Republic F-105 Thunderchief (63-8301), which had been piloted by Leo Thorsness while he provided cover for a rescue mission for a downed pilot. Despite having been slated for display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force, it was lost to a crash in 1974 after pilot Paul Metz was forced to eject due to engine failure. ===In-Flight Medal of Honor Awards: Aircraft=== {  width=\\"80%\\" - CCCCCC;\\" !Manufacturer !!Model !!Medals of Honor awarded !!Surviving aircraft - Bell UH-18 (6 Army, 1 USAF, 1 USMC)2 - Boeing B-1717 0 - Boeing B-2910 - CessnaO-110 - Consolidated B-24/PB4Y  9 (1 Navy)0 - Consolidated PBY20 - CurtissJN-410 - DeHavillandModel 44 (2 Army, 2 USMC)0 - DouglasA-121 - DouglasA-410 - DouglasA-2610 - DouglasAC-4710 - DouglasSBD20 - FokkerTrimotor21 - FairchildC-12310 - GrummanF4F81 (parts) - GrummanF6F10 - HughesOH-610 - KamanUH-210 - LockheedP-3820 - LockheedF-8010 - MacchiM-510 - MartinB-2610 - North AmericanB-2530 - North AmericanF-8610 - North AmericanOV-1010 - North AmericanP-51/F-63 (2 World War II, 1 Korea)0 - RepublicP-4720 - RepublicF-10520 - RyanNYP11 - SikorskyHO3S10 - SikorskyHH-310 - SPADXIII20 - VoughtO2U10 - VoughtSB2U10 - VoughtF4U4 (3 World War II, 1 Korea)0 - Total927 } ===Medal of Honor Awards: Aviation-related actions (aircraft not in flight and aircraft of POW's)=== {  width=\\"80%\\" - CCCCCC;\\" !Manufacturer !!Model !!Medals of Honor awarded !!Surviving aircraft - BellUH-130 - Boeing CH-4611 - BurgessN-910 - KamanHH-4310 - McDonnell DouglasA-410 - McDonnell DouglasF-410 - North AmericanF-10010 - KiteBalloon10 - Total101 } ==References== * * ==External links== * Medal of Honor Recipients of the Vietnam War at the United States Army Center of Military History * MOH Aviation Master List - Scribd Category:Medal of Honor ","title":"Medal of Honor Aircraft"},{"id":"20560943","text":"The Velocette KSS is a British motorcycle made by Velocette.

It is also used in planning missions and conducting numerous engineering functions needed to carry out those missions. SPICE was developed at NASA's Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF), led by Charles ActonNAIF/SPICE Newsletter February 2019 NASA Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) and located at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. It has become the de facto standard for handling much of the so- called observation geometry information on NASA's planetary missions, and it is now widely used in support of science data analysis on planetary missions of other space agencies as well. Some SPICE capabilities are used on a variety of astrophysics, solar physics and earth science missions. SPICE consists of both data and software. All SPICE components are freely available to everyone, including commercial entities. There are no export restrictions. Usage rules may be found on the \\"Rules\\" page of the NAIF website. == Data == SPICE data files are usually referred to as \\"kernels.\\" These files provide information such as spacecraft trajectory and orientation; target body ephemeris, size and shape; instrument field-of-view size, shape and orientation; specifications for reference frames; and tabulations of time system conversion coefficients. SPICE data are archived in a national archive center such as the NASA Planetary Data System archives. == Software == The SPICE system includes software referred to as The SPICE Toolkit, used for reading the SPICE data files and computing geometric parameters based on data from those files. These tools are provided as subroutine libraries in four programming languages: C, FORTRAN, IDL, MATLAB and Java Native Interface. Third parties offer Python and Ruby interfaces to the C-language Toolkit. The Toolkits also include a number of utility and application programs. The SPICE Toolkits are available for most popular computing platforms, operating systems and compilers. Extensive documentation accompanies each Toolkit. Those unable to write their own SPICE- based program may try using WebGeocalc, a browser interface to a SPICE-based geometry engine running on the NAIF server. Using WebGeocalc is much easier than writing your own program, but it still requires considerable knowledge about SPICE data and solar system geometry, and it doesn't offer the full range of computations available when using Toolkit software in your own program. The NAIF Group also offers a 3-D mission visualization program named SPICE-Enhanced Cosmographia. This program runs in the OSX, Windows and Linux environments. Visual representations of mission SPICE data are controlled using an assortment of menus and GUI controls. A scripting interface is also available. == Tutorials and programming lessons == A set of tutorials is available to help users understand the SPICE data and software. Some \\"open book\\" programming lessons useful in learning how to program using Toolkit subroutines are also available. == Availability == The SPICE data, Toolkit software, tutorials and programming lessons are all freely available from the NAIF website.

In the energy methods of simulating the dynamics of complex structures, a state of the system is often described as an element of an appropriate function space. To be in this state, the system pays a certain cost in terms of energy required by the state. This energy is a scalar quantity, a function of the state, hence the term functional. The system tends to develop from the state with higher energy (higher cost) to the state with lower energy, thus local minima of this functional are usually related to the stable stationary states. Studying such states is part of the optimization problems, where the terms energy functional or cost functional are often used to describe the objective function. ==Examples== * In Hamiltonian systems, the energy functional is given by the Hamiltonian. ==See also== * Action (physics) * Density functional theory * Hamilton's principle * History of variational principles in physics * Potential well ==External links== * Energy methods in elasticity, Wikiversity.

She was confirmed by the United States Senate with a vote of 57‚Äì36 on June 5, 2019. On April 13 2020, Combs submitted her resignation which went into effect on April 25, 2020. Combs, formerly a Republican politician, is from the U.S. state of Texas, where she served from 2007 to 2015 as the state's comptroller of public accounts. Prior to her tenure as comptroller, Combs had served two terms as commissioner of the Texas Department of Agriculture from 1999 to 2007, taking the reins as the first woman elected to that office in 1998. Combs also served two terms in the Texas House of Representatives. On July 10, 2017, Combs was nominated by U.S. president Donald Trump to be the assistant secretary of the interior for policy, management and budget.Svitek, Patrick. Trump to nominate former comptroller Combs for Interior Department job, Texas Tribune, Austin, Texas July 10, 2017. As a former Texas state comptroller, Combs wrested control of the state's endangered species program from the Department of Parks and Wildlife to her office, which managed state fiscal and tax matters, not biology. She used her authority to oppose any Endangered Species Act protections, often teaming with the oil and gas industry. Combs was nominated in 2017 to be the U.S. Department of the Interior's assistant secretary for policy, management and budget to oversee the entire department, including the Fish and Wildlife Service. Her nomination was approved on a party-line vote in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. However, the full Senate did not take up her nomination and sent it back to the White House at the end of 2017. In 2018, the Trump administration re-nominated Combs to the same position. More than 70 conservation organizations sent a letter to the Senate opposing her nomination. == Early life and family == Combs was born in San Antonio. She grew up in a ranching family in West Texas. She runs a cow-calf operation on her family's ranch in Brewster County; the ranch has been in her family since the turn of the 20th century. She lives in Austin with her husband, Joe W. Duran, a computer scientist. She is the mother of three sons. Combs graduated from Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York, majoring in French and religion. She worked in international advertising in New York City, in the financial markets on Wall Street, and for the U.S. government before returning to Texas to obtain credentials from the University of Texas Law School at Austin. After graduation from law school, she served as an assistant district attorney in Dallas, Texas. == Political career == Combs' first electoral outing was for the 47th legislative district, in Travis County. She won the Republican runoff election by seven votes over intraparty challenger Bill Welch. Combs polled 2,279 votes (50.07 percent) to Welch's 2,272 (49.92 percent). The two had led a five-candidate field in the primary. In the general election, Combs handily defeated the Democrat Jimmy Day, 45,355 (65.4 percent) to 23,987 (34.6 percent). Combs served two terms in the Texas House of Representatives from 1993 and 1996, resigning midway in her second term to join the staff of U.S. senator Kay Bailey Hutchison as the lawmaker's state director. She was succeeded by fellow Republican Patty Keel of Austin. She served as the Texas agriculture commissioner from 1999 to 2007, being the first woman to serve in the position. She succeeded Rick Perry as commissioner, who was instead elected as lieutenant governor. Combs was initially elected as Texas comptroller of public accounts to succeed Carole Strayhorn, a Republican who ran unsuccessfully for governor as an Independent in the same election. Combs served as comptroller from 2007 to 2015. In 2010, Combs was unopposed for a second term as comptroller in the Republican primary, and she faced no Democratic opponent in the November 2 general election. Unsuccessful nominees of the Green and Libertarian parties did seek the position. Combs did not seek reelection to a third term as comptroller or any other statewide office in the 2014 elections. In 2015, Combs endorsed Carly Fiorina for president. ==Texas Smart Schools Initiative== After leaving state politics in 2015, Combs launched the Texas Smart Schools Initiative, intended for parents and officials as a data-driven approach to show which public schools and districts are achieving the highest student performance for the lowest cost. The material, arranged on a five-star scale, was made available without charge. It is funded from her leftover campaign contributions. \\"Public education is one of the largest items in the state budget; so Texans need to know where their dollars are getting the highest return in terms of student performance,\\" Combs said.Andrew, Zelinski, \\"Combs helps fund school rating website\\", San Antonio Express-News, May 27, 2016, p. A3 Also with leftover campaign cash, Combs formed a 501(c)(4) nonprofit called the Anywhere Woman Project, an online platform aiming to help women ask questions and exchange ideas. ==US Department of the Interior== On July 10, 2017, U.S. president Donald Trump nominated Combs to be the assistant secretary for policy, management, and budget at the United States Department of the Interior.Svitek, Patrick. Trump to nominate former comptroller Combs for Interior Department job, Texas Tribune, Austin, Texas July 10, 2017. Earlier in the year, Trump had considered naming Combs to be the secretary of agriculture, a position which went instead to Sonny Perdue, a former governor of Georgia. The administration cited Combs' career in public office and in the private sector as a small business owner with a ranch in the Big Bend section of West Texas as factors in her selection. U.S. Senator John Cornyn said that he will work for Combs' confirmation and called her \\"always a fierce advocate for rural Texans.\\" Combs was confirmed by the United States Senate on June 5, 2019, by a vote of 57‚Äì36. Combs resigned on April 25, 2020. ==Other activities== ‚ÄúCombs has spent her career putting polluters and special interests ahead of the needs of our most endangered animals and plants,‚Äù said Stephanie Kurose, endangered species policy specialist at the Center for Biological Diversity. ‚ÄúThe Senate is rubber-stamping a Trump appointee who wouldn't cross the street to save imperiled wildlife for a job that'll let her veto crucial environmental protections.‚Äù As Texas state comptroller, Combs wrested control of the state's endangered species program from the Department of Parks and Wildlife to her office, which managed state fiscal and tax matters and did not have a single biologist. She then used her authority to vigorously oppose any Endangered Species Act protections, often teaming up with the oil and gas industry to do so. As a state representative in the 1990s, Combs passed a law designed to restrict the state from sharing data with the Fish and Wildlife Service‚Äîdata that might have been used to identify those species in need of critical lifesaving protections. Combs served on the boards of the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association in Fort Worth and the Texas Wildlife Association. She has also served on the boards the Texas Beef Council and the Texas Production Credit Association. In 2016, Combs launched \\"HERdacity\\" a \\"nonprofit online platform and mobile app\\" intended to \\"give women with shared interests and career ambitions a forum to exchange ideas and offer each other support.\\" In addition, she wrote a memoir entitled Texas Tenacity. As a member of the Texas House of Representatives in the 1990s, Combs championed legislation prohibiting state wildlife officials from gathering endangered species data from private lands without permission, according to the Austin Chronicle. It also sought to restrict the state from sharing endangered species data with the Fish and Wildlife Service...Following her nomination in July, some 70 conservation groups sent a letter to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee urging members to reject her confirmation. They described Combs as someone who ‚Äúbuilt her career favoring big corporations and special interests over the needs and survival of imperiled species.‚Äù In August 2019, the Women's Suffrage Celebration Commission elevated Combs to Chairwoman. Prior to that, Combs was a Commission member, appointed to that position in December 2018. ==ReferencesProfile at The Texas Tribune * Profile at Project Vote Smart * Profile at Ballotpedia * Window on State Government - - - Category:1945 births Category:Agriculture commissioners of Texas Category:Comptrollers of Texas Category:Living people Category:Members of the Texas House of Representatives Category:People from Austin, Texas Category:People from Brewster County, Texas Category:People from San Antonio Category:Politicians from Dallas Category:Politicians from New York City Category:Ranchers from Texas Category:Texas lawyers Category:Texas Republicans Category:Trump administration personnel Category:United States Assistant Secretaries of the Interior Category:University of Texas School of Law alumni Category:Vassar College alumni Category:Women state legislators in Texas ","title":"Susan Combs"},{"id":"20561032","text":"==Final table *Football Association of Slovenia Category:Slovenian Republic Football League seasons Yugo 3 Football Football ","title":"1962‚Äì63 Slovenian Republic League"},{"id":"20561040","text":"Stephen Rowe (born April 7, 1980) is a Canadian poet. == Biography == Born in Heart's Content, Newfoundland and Labrador, Rowe, lover of the Russian queen, was educated first in Heart's Content and Carbonear and then in St. John's, where he attended Memorial University of Newfoundland.

It is located at El Palomar, Buenos Aires. Established on October 11, 1869, by President Domingo Sarmiento at the height of the Paraguayan War, its original quarters were opened in where the Parque Tres de Febrero stands today, with Col. Juan F. Czetz as the first superintendent. It was transferred to San Mart√≠n in 1892, and to its present location, the site of the 1852 Battle of Caseros that deposed mid-19th century strongman Juan Manuel de Rosas, in 1938. Its present facilities were inaugurated in 1937. El Palomar and La Casa de Caseros, installations involved in the Battle of Caseros, were declared a National Historic Monument. Traditionally, most cadets belonged to high- or middle- class families, with many of them having a long military tradition. This has changed in recent years, the Cadet's Corp becoming more representative of lower-class families. Women were first admitted in the College in 1999, and allowed into Infantry and Cavalry arms in 2013. ==Courses== There are four different type of courses in the College: Regular, four-year course. For officers of the five combat branches (Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery, Engineers and Signals), plus Quartermaster and Ordnance corps. Cadets graduate as second lieutenant and get a degree in administration. Four-year Course for professional nurses. Cadets graduate as second lieutenants and get a degree in Nursing. One-year course for officers of the professional corps. For university graduates (in medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, biochemistry, veterinary, law, information technology and physical training) and private aviators. Graduate as either a lieutenant or second lieutenant (according to the duration of the previous career) in the relevant branch. Two-year course for band officers. For band NCOs with at least five years of service. Graduate as second lieutenant. A system of short courses for reserve officers was established in 2000, but was discontinued after a few years due to the poor performance of the graduates. ==Admission== Admission is on a competitive basis, and consists of academic (according to the course of choice), medical, psychological and physical training examinations. For the four- and three-year courses, a high school diploma is the minimum previous education requirement, although a number of applicants usually have at least one year of college- level education. == Cadet life == Cadets are not referred to as freshmen, sophomores, juniors, or seniors. Instead they are officially called fourth class, third class, second class, and first class cadets. Unlike most academies the Regiment of Cadets marches on parade in the following order of precedence, in full dress uniforms: * Infantry - with Mauser rifles and using the goose step, currently the only military unit in Argentina to do so * Cavalry, Artillery, Engineers, Signals and services - with M4 or FN FAL slung rifles, marches on the high step * Cavalry Troop - with lances, using the cavalry walk or trot march Formerly the College sported a horse artillery battery which used the walk or the trot march of the cavalry, in 2020, to honor the College's sesquicentennial the horse artillery was restored as a horse artillery section under the Cavalry Troop. Also, all the cadet specialty companies now have a company standard, all of these being consecrated as well that same year and now are paraded at the head of their formations. ==References== * Ernesto Luis Cardoso 'Rumbo a la gloria Promoci√≥n 78 Colegio Militar de la Naci√≥n Buenos Aires' translation 'Headed for glory 78 Promoting the National Military College of Buenos Aires' 1948 ==External links== * Official website Category:Argentine Army Category:Military schools Category:Educational institutions established in 1869 Category:National Historic Monuments of Argentina Category:School buildings completed in 1937 Category:Buildings and structures in Buenos Aires Category:Education in Buenos Aires Category:1869 establishments in Argentina ","title":"Colegio Militar de la Naci√≥n"},{"id":"20561065","text":"Luis Antonio Liendo Asb√∫n (born February 25, 1978 in La Serena) is a retired Chilean-Bolivian football midfielder, who has played in different leagues throughout South America, Europe and North America.

He appeared in only one big league game, during the season. Listed at , 225 lb., Fritz batted and threw left-handed. A native of Whiting, Indiana, Fritz attended Whiting High School and Arizona State University. Fritz was selected by the New York Mets in the third round (57th overall) of the 1969 Major League Baseball draft, playing in their Minor League Baseball (MiLB) system for the Marion Mets (1969, 1971-72), Visalia Mets (1970, 1972), Memphis Blues (1972), and Tidewater Tides (1972-73), before joining the Phillies organization in 1974.

During the midseason, he gained a promotion to Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens, where he batted three homers and drove in seven runs in 16 games. In 1975, Fritz was purchased by Philadelphia from Toledo after Phillies shortstop Larry Bowa broke his hand in a game against the San Francisco Giants on May 27. Fritz made his lone MLB appearance on May 30, 1975 at Veterans Stadium against the Houston Astros. With the Phillies trailing 5 to 0, and with two- outs and Mike Anderson on first in the bottom of the ninth-inning, Fritz pinch-hit for Larry Christenson. Facing Astros pitcher Doug Konieczny, Fritz flew out to left-field to end the game. On June 6, 1975, Mud Hens first baseman Andy Kosco broke his wrist. The Phillies returned Fritz to Toledo and in his place recalled outfielder Mike Rogodzinski from Reading.

Most of the drives in this series have a spindle speed of 7200 RPM. The line initially focused on high- capacity, high-performance SCSI drives; since 2001, it became Seagate's most popular product as the hard disk drive industry started to move to a 7200 RPM spindle speed. ==SCSI models== Launched in 1991, the Seagate Barracuda was the first 7200 RPM hard drive. Owing to its rotational speed, it was very fast but very expensive at the time. Its SCSI-2 interface targeted the drive to servers and high-performance systems. The original models, called the Barracuda 2LP series, were available with a 2.5 GB1 GB = 1000 bytes or 1.2 GB capacity with up to six platters. ==ATA and SATA modelsBarracuda ATA (1999)=== Available in capacities between 6.8 GB and 28.2 GB, with a 512 KB1 KB = 1024 B (1 KiB) cache buffer and an ATA/66 interface. This is the first model in the Barracuda family equipped with an ATA/IDE interface. ===Barracuda ATA II (2000)=== Available in capacities between 10 GB and 30 GB, with a 2 MB (2 MiB) cache. Supports up to ATA/66 interface. ===Barracuda ATA III (2000)=== Available in capacities between 10 GB and 40 GB, with a 2 MB cache. Supports up to ATA/100 interface. ===Barracuda ATA IV (2001)=== Available in capacities between 20 GB and 80 GB, with a 2 MB cache. Supports up to the ATA/100 interface. These drives operate very quietly as they are one of the first hard drives to use fluid dynamic bearings in their spindle motors. These disks cannot operate reliably at ATA/100 on RCC/ServerWorks IDE controllers, as their drivers blacklist the disks, thus limiting their operation to ATA/66. ===Barracuda ATA V (2002)/Barracuda ATA V Plus (2003)/Barracuda Serial ATA V (2003)=== Available in capacities between 30 GB to 120 GB, with a 2 MB cache, with either SATA/150 and ATA/100 interfaces. Barracuda V with SATA port is one of the first hard drives to feature a SATA interface. The SATA models have many problems, including random data loss (such as disappearing partitions). These disks cannot work with some Silicon Image SATA controllers, as their drivers blacklist the disks and limit the maximum sectors of each transaction below 8 KB (15 sectors), leading to considerably reduced performance. ===Barracuda 7200.7 (2003)/Barracuda 7200.7 Plus (2004)=== Available in capacities between 40 GB and 200 GB, with ATA/100 and SATA with NCQ. The drives have 2 MB or 8 MB of cache, depending on the model. ===Barracuda 7200.8 (2004)=== Available in capacities between 200 GB and 400 GB, with either an ATA/100 or SATA interface with NCQ, these were sold alongside the 7200.7 series, providing higher capacities than the 7200.7. The drives have 8 MB or 16 MB of cache, depending on the model. ===Barracuda 7200.9 (2005)=== Available in capacities between 40 GB and 500 GB, with either ATA/100 or SATA 3 Gbit/s interfaces. 2 MB, 8 MB or 16 MB, depending on the model and interface. ===Barracuda 7200.10 (2006)=== Available in capacities between 80 GB to 750 GB and either an ATA/100 or SATA 3 Gbit/s interface. 2, 8 or 16 MB of cache, depending on the model. This was the first Seagate hard drive to use perpendicular magnetic recording technology (only in 250 GB models: ST3250410AS with 16 MB of cache and ST3250310AS with 8 MB of cache). This is the last generation of Barracuda to feature IDE interface on certain models. This is the only generation of Barracuda to feature 750 GB as the greatest in storage limit of IDE drive ever made by any manufacturer. Industry's competitors ended development of IDE hard drives on lower capacities: Maxtor (before its acquisition by Seagate) and Western Digital ended on 500 GB and Hitachi and Samsung ended on 400 GB. Firmware bug The SATA models of this family with firmware 3.AAK [codename GALAXY] or older (e.g. 3.AAE[codename TONKA]) have introduced a firmware (microcode) bug: * There is a performance anomaly using hdparm with an NCQ queue depth of 31 in AHCI mode. Speed test measures only 55‚Äì64 MB/s (expected: >70‚Äì75 MB/s).1 MB = one million bytes Seagate does not officially provide firmware updates for this issue; however, an unofficial firmware update (3.AAM) exists for the following drive models: * ST3320820AS with part number 9BJ13G-308, * ST3320620AS with part number 9BJ14G-308 (with firmware 3.AAK), * ST3500830AS with part number 9BJ136-308 and * ST3500630AS with part number 9BJ146-308. ===Barracuda ES (2006)=== Available in capacities between 250 GB to 750 GB, with SATA 3 Gbit/s interface and 8 or 16 MB of cache depending on model. The ES (Enterprise Storage) family were high-reliability drives based on Barracuda 7200.10 design. Intended for business-critical use, with all drives having a 5-year warranty. Barracuda ES series replaced previous NL35 series (based on 7200.8) and NL35.2 series (based on 7200.9) enterprise drives. ===Barracuda 7200.11 (2007)=== With a SATA 3 Gbit/s interface, capacities range from 160 GB to 1.5 TB1 TB = one thousand billion bytes (1000 GB). Codenames are Moose (earlier revision) and Brinks (later revision). Their cache size can be 8 MB, 16 MB or 32 MB, depending on the drive model.http://www.seagate.com/docs/pdf/datasheet/disc/ds_barracuda_7200_11.pdf Firmware bug This family has introduced many severe firmware (microcode) bugs: # Disks may not show and utilize all the cache.http://seagate.custkb.com/seagate/crm/selfservice/search.jsp?DocId=203791 # FLUSH_CACHE commands may time out when NCQ is used. # There is a performance anomaly using hdparm with NCQ queue depth 31 in AHCI mode. Speed test measures only 45‚Äì50 MB/s (expected: > 100‚Äì110 MB/s). # Disks may be inaccessible at power on.http://seagate.custkb.com/seagate/crm/selfservice/search.jsp?DocId=207951http://seagate.custkb.com/seagate/crm/selfservice/search.jsp?DocId=207957 Disks affected by the last bug will not be detected by the computer BIOS after a reboot. Numerous users have complained about this and are discussing it in a public forum when discussions in Seagate's forums were subjected to heavy moderation and subsequently closed. The symptom of the problem is that the computer BIOS will no longer detect the hard disk after a reboot, and upon connecting to the hard disk with a serial TTL board, this error code will be seen as \\"LED:000000CC FAddr:0024A051.\\" Faulty firmware triggers this \\"failure.\\" Seagate FreeAgent external drives have also utilized 7200.11 hard disks with the SDxx firmware, and failures of these hard drives were also reported. The access LED remains permanently on, despite being disconnected from USB and no longer being recognized by the computer. However, Seagate says that the LED light remaining permanently on had nothing to do with firmware problems. The drives have also become known for their unusually high failure rates, including sudden mechanical failures; the rapid development of large numbers of bad sectors; the motherboard detecting the drive as a different model and the drive regularly \\"freezing\\" when being read from or written to. Other companies have claimed to be able to resolve this problem using their own solution, namely Ace Laboratory PC3000-UDMA (version 4.13). In order to fix the first bug, Seagate released firmware update AD14 for the affected disk models; to fix the second, third and fourth bugs, Seagate released firmware updates SD1A, SD1B, SD2B and SD81. The SD2B firmware update for Brinks removes the DCO ATA feature from the disks, while SD1A for Moose adds two ATA features. ===Barracuda ES.2 (2007)=== Available in capacities between 250 GB and 1 TB, 16 MB cache for SAS models and a 32 MB cache for SATA 3 Gbit/s models. Enterprise-grade drives based on 7200.11 series. http://www.seagate.com/files/docs/pdf/datasheet/disc/ds_barracuda_es.pdf Firmware bugs Similar to the 7200.11 family, this family has introduced many firmware (microcode) bugs, which was fixed by SN06 firmware released by seagate: * RAID arrays using these disks may fail. * Secure Erase command is not handled properly. * There is a performance anomaly using hdparm with NCQ queue depth 31 in AHCI mode. Speed test measures only 50 MB/s (expected: >100 MB/s). * Disks may be inaccessible at power on. Barracuda ES.2 is currently the last product in Seagate's enterprise line to bear the \\"Barracuda\\" name. The successor of ES.2, launched in early 2013, is branded as \\"Constellation ES.3\\" which is based on the design of 14th-generation Barracuda. ===Barracuda 7200.12 (2009)=== Available in capacities between 160 GB to 1.0 TB. Initial models (CCxx firmware) supported up to SATA 3 Gbit/s, while later revisions (firmware JCxx) support the newer SATA 6 Gbit/s interface. Their cache size can be 8 MB, 16 MB or 32 MB, depending on the drive model. Power consumption is reduced from previous models, resulting in lower heat dissipation and claimed reliability improvements. ===Barracuda XT, LP and Green (13th generation) (2010)=== Hard disk Seagate Barracuda 1500 GB, 3.5 inch, capacity 1.5 TB, built 2011 Available in capacities between 2 TB and 3 TB (XT) with 64 MB cache, 1 TB and 2 TB (LP) with 16 MB or 32 MB cache, 1 TB, 1.5 TB and 2 TB (Green) with 16 MB to 64 MB cache depending on model. This is the first Barracuda series to support SATA 6 Gbit/s and its buffer size is 64 MB. Rotation speed is 7,200 RPM for XT, and 5,900 RPM for LP and Green. XT is Intended for high-performance gaming computers and workstations with sustained data transfer rate of 149 MB/s. LP is designated for mass storage applications favoring low heat output, quiet operation and better-than-average energy efficiency. Barracuda Green 2000 GB (ST2000DL003)The Barracuda Green series was introduced in December 2010 as a high-performance, eco-friendly, low-power internal drive, replacing the Barracuda LP series. It is the first to use Advanced Format sectors and operates at 5900 RPM. Firmware bugs The Barracuda LP series also present firmware issues that might be alleviated by the latest firmware available on the Seagate web site (CC35), although there are reports that drives with the CC35 firmware loaded continue to exhibit the same problems as earlier firmware releases.http://forums.seagate.com/t5/Barracuda-XT-Barracuda- and/ST31000528AS-7200-12-1TB/m-p/43562 The most commonly referred issue with the Barracuda LP series drives appears to be one variation or another of the infamous click of death problem; the drive will start to emit a regular clicking noise at some point in its early life (possibly even at first start) and after some time will fail altogether, often after a few months of use. While the clicking noise is emitted, the hard drive is inaccessible and may prevent the BIOS from detecting it. There is also a CC95 firmware (at least some of those drives came as part of external Seagate FreeAgent drives), but it is not clear whether this build fixes all known issues, and why firmware versions between CC35 and CC95 do not seem to exist. ===Barracuda (14th generation) (2012)=== Available in capacities between 250 GB to 3 TB, 7200 RPM, 16 MB to 64 MB cache, depending on the model. First Seagate hard drives with 1 TB1 TB = one thousand billion bytes per platter technology. From this generation onwards, Seagate phased out previous \\"green\\" models, citing the inherent power saving functions featured on the 14th generation removed the need for a separate low-power design. ===BarraCuda (16th generation) (2016)=== The successor of the 14th generation Barracuda, branded as \\"Desktop HDD\\", was a 5,900 RPM series launched in early 2013 and was not considered part of the Barracuda line. \\"Barracuda\\" series made a comeback in 2016 with a stylized BarraCuda trademark. Available in capacities between 500 GB to 8 TB. Buffer sizes vary from 32 MB (32 MiB) for 500 GB and 1 TB models to 256 MB (256 MiB) for 3 TB to 8 TB units. . ===BarraCuda Pro (2016)=== Available in capacities between 2 TB and 14 TB. Launched alongside BarraCuda, it is described as \\"Perfect for high performance desktop, creative pro desktop applications, and gaming\\". This series has higher read/write performance than standard BarraCuda drives; one PCWorld review noted its consistent read speed throughout its entire capacity, which is unusual for a conventional HDD. == Warranty length == Warranty period is either 1 year, 2 years, 3 years or 5 years from the documented date of purchase, depending on the type of product and where it was purchased. ==See also== *Seagate SeaShield == References  * Seagate Barracuda Hard Drives * How to Force Firmware update on the Seagate Barracuda LP Category:Computer storage devices Category:Seagate Technology ","title":"Seagate Barracuda"},{"id":"20561116","text":"Dragan Talajiƒá (born 25 August 1965) is a Croatian former footballer who last coached Henan Jianye of the Chinese Super League.

Its clientele includes performance venues, houses of worship, educational institutions, museums, cruise ships, and legislative buildings. ==About Jaffe HoldenHistory=== In 1968, Jaffe Holden Acoustics was founded by acoustician Christopher Jaffe in Norwalk, Connecticut. The company first grew from Jaffe‚Äôs discovery that lightweight tunable reflector panels placed in the reverberant stage towers of multi-use theatres increased orchestral liveness, intimacy and warmth. Since these designs allowed acousticians to place overhead ceiling reflectors closer to the musicians, the shells improved on stage hearing to the benefit of orchestral ensemble and sectional balance. Some early challenges for JaffeHolden were designing a shell for the Youth Symphony concerts on the South Lawn of the White House sponsored by Jacqueline Kennedy; renovations of Lewisohn Stadium for the Metropolitan Opera and the Hollywood Bowl for the Los Angeles Philharmonic; and the design for the first touring symphonic stage used by the New York Philharmonic for their innovative series of free parks concerts in 1965. Early in the company‚Äôs history, while working on a grant for the National Endowment for the Arts, Jaffe realized that the elitist image of orchestral performance and the formal seating arrangement of the typical concert hall were actually reducing attendance at these events. Researching older halls such as the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, JaffeHolden designed the first surround concert hall in the Western hemisphere, Sala Nezahualcoyotl Hall in Mexico City. JaffeHolden also developed the use of electronic reflections to provide needed aural information in specialized circumstances where physical acoustic solutions alone could not meet the required symphonic criteria due to budget constraints, building landmark restrictions and/or operational flexibility. Also known as ERES (Electronic Reflected Energy System),Jaffe, Christopher. Variable acoustics for multi-use halls using electronic reflected energy systems. The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, Volume 69, Issue S1, April 15, 1981, p. S75 these systems have been successfully implemented in theaters and halls throughout the United States.

June 2006 revolutionized multi-use theater design in providing mixed-use theaters with the level of acoustic parameters found in a dedicated concert hall. This was first utilized in the Tokyo International Forum, and subsequently at the Bass Performance Hall in Fort Worth, Texas and the Thelma Gaylord Theater at the Oklahoma City Civic Center. ===Recent Business=== In 2008, Jaffe Holden Acoustics, Inc. expanded its consulting services to include information technology services. Services include the areas of telecommunications, data, voice and cable infrastructure and network technologies. ===Current CEO=== In 2005, Mark Holden became chairman of Jaffe Holden Acoustics, Inc. Educated at Duke University with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering, Mr. Holden has authored numerous papers and columns for major trade publications.

She also has long-standing collaborations with cellists Truls M√∏rk, Christian Polt√©ra and Natalie Clein, violinist Janine Jansen, and pianist Noriko Ogawa.Kathryn Stott: Pianist: Biography (accessed 8 December 2008) ==Artistic direction== Stott has directed several successful music festivals and concert series in the north of England. In 1995, she organised a Faur√© festival in Manchester to mark the composer's 150th anniversary. According to the Independent, the event was \\"transformed by her enthusiasm and her own sumptuous performances of this neglected composer's works.\\" The success of the festival led to her appointment as Chevalier dans l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government.Kathryn Stott: Pianist: Artistic Director (accessed 8 December 2008) She directed two major piano festivals at the Manchester Bridgewater Hall in 2000 and 2003. As Stott considers \\"It's very important at an event like this that we should let people play\\", both festivals featured multiple Steinway grands that the public were allowed to try, as well as a variety of novelty pianos including a red \\"Ferrari\\" Steinway, an \\"exploded\\" piano revealing the internal workings, a grove of woven pianos, and a concert grand fitted with a pool which played a variety of watery sounds.Ward D. Piano hits right note for festival. Guardian (5 December 2002) (accessed 9 December 2008) In 1998, Stott directed a concert series \\"Out of the Shadows\\" with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, featuring two neglected female composers, Clara Schumann and Fanny Mendelssohn. More recently, she has directed the series \\"Chopin: The Music and the Legacy\\" at Leeds College of Music (2004‚Äì05) and \\"Paris\\" at the Sheffield Crucible (2006). In 2008, she was appointed the musical director of the Manchester Chamber Concerts Society. She is also on the board of the Hall√© Orchestra.The Hall√©: Board (accessed 9 December 2008) She will succeed Piers Lane as the artistic director of the Australian Festival of Chamber Music in 2018. ==Teaching== As of 2008, Stott teaches at the Royal Academy of Music in LondonRoyal Academy of Music: Piano staff (accessed 5 December 2008) and at Chetham's School of Music in Manchester.Chethams: Staff (accessed 5 December 2008) She formerly taught at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester.Harris P.

Conceptually it is similar to the dq0 transformation. One very useful application of the \\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\gamma transformation is the generation of the reference signal used for space vector modulation control of three-phase inverters. ==Definition== The \\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\gamma transform applied to three-phase currents, as used by Edith Clarke, is :i_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\gamma}(t) = Ti_{abc}(t) = \\\\frac{2}{3}\\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -\\\\frac{1}{2} & -\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{2} & -\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{2} & \\\\frac{1}{2} & \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\begin{bmatrix}i_a(t)\\\\\\\\\\\\i_b(t)\\\\\\\\\\\\i_c(t)\\\\end{bmatrix} where i_{abc}(t) is a generic three-phase current sequence and i_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\gamma}(t) is the corresponding current sequence given by the transformation T. The inverse transform is: :i_{abc}(t) = T^{-1}i_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\gamma}(t) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1\\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\frac{1}{2} & \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{2} & 1\\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\frac{1}{2} & -\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{2} & 1\\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix}i_\\\\alpha(t)\\\\\\\\\\\\i_\\\\beta(t)\\\\\\\\\\\\i_\\\\gamma(t)\\\\end{bmatrix}. The above Clarke's transformation preserves the amplitude of the electrical variables which it is applied to. Indeed, consider a three-phase symmetric, direct, current sequence : \\\\begin{align} i_a(t)=&\\\\sqrt{2}I\\\\cos\\\\theta(t),\\\\\\\\\\\\ i_b(t)=&\\\\sqrt{2}I\\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\theta(t)-\\\\frac23\\\\pi\\\\right),\\\\\\\\\\\\ i_c(t)=&\\\\sqrt{2}I\\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\theta(t)+\\\\frac23\\\\pi\\\\right), \\\\end{align} where I is the RMS of i_a(t), i_b(t), i_c(t) and \\\\theta(t) is the generic time-varying angle that can also be set to \\\\omega t without loss of generality. Then, by applying T to the current sequence, it results : \\\\begin{align} i_{\\\\alpha}=&\\\\sqrt2 I\\\\cos\\\\theta(t),\\\\\\\\\\\\ i_{\\\\beta}=&\\\\sqrt2 I\\\\sin\\\\theta(t),\\\\\\\\\\\\ i_{\\\\gamma}=&0, \\\\end{align} where the last equation holds since we have considered balanced currents. As it is shown in the above, the amplitudes of the currents in the \\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\gamma reference frame are the same of that in the natural reference frame. === Power invariant transformation === The active and reactive powers computed in the Clarke's domain with the transformation shown above are not the same of those computed in the standard reference frame. This happens because T is not unitary. In order to preserve the active and reactive powers one has, instead, to consider :i_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\gamma}(t) = Ti_{abc}(t) = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{3}}\\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -\\\\frac{1}{2} & -\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{2} & -\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt2} & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt2} & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\begin{bmatrix}i_a(t)\\\\\\\\\\\\i_b(t)\\\\\\\\\\\\i_c(t)\\\\end{bmatrix}, which is a unitary matrix and the inverse coincides with its transpose. In this case the amplitudes of the transformed currents are not the same of those in the standard reference frame, that is : \\\\begin{align} i_{\\\\alpha}=&\\\\sqrt3 I\\\\cos\\\\theta(t),\\\\\\\\\\\\ i_{\\\\beta}=&\\\\sqrt3 I\\\\sin\\\\theta(t),\\\\\\\\\\\\ i_{\\\\gamma}=&0\\\\. \\\\end{align} Finally, the inverse transformation in this case is : i_{abc}(t) = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{3}}\\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\frac{1}{2} & \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{2} & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\frac{1}{2} & -\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{2} & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\begin{bmatrix}i_\\\\alpha(t)\\\\\\\\\\\\i_\\\\beta(t)\\\\\\\\\\\\i_\\\\gamma(t)\\\\end{bmatrix}. === Simplified transformation === Since in a balanced system i_a(t)+i_b(t)+i_c(t)=0 and thus i_\\\\gamma(t)=0 one can also consider the simplified transformF.

This saltwater animal, from here on referred to as Hydractinia, is at the base of the Cnidaria phylum and in many ways, is similar to the freshwater Hydra. In the wild, Hydractinia feed on smaller invertebrates found in the shallow mud, however in laboratory environments they are fed brine shrimp. Hydractinia symbiolongicurpus and its sibling species, Hydractinia echinata, are the two species from the genus Hydractinia on which most work has been published. == Description == Hydractinia consist of a network of gastrovascular canals embedded in a plate of tissue called the mat. When gastrovascular canals extend outside of the mat, they are called stolons. The stolon tips on the outer edge of the colony secrete SIF (Stolon Inducing Factor) allowing for the creation of branching stolons In the field, colonies exhibit morphologies that range from highly stoloniferous to completely stolonless. Four types of polyps are found on Hydractinia colonies, including feeding polyps, sexual polyps, and two other types of polyps called dactylozooids and tentaculozooids, which protect the colony. Nematocyte precursors migrate into feeding polyps and germ cells migrate into sexual polyps. Nerve cells are found in all parts of the colony. While Hydractinia do not have a bodily axis of symmetry, the polyps exhibit oral/aboral symmetry. In the planula stage, the Hydractinia exhibit anterior/posterior symmetry. == Growth and development == Hydractinia colonies are either male or female, and sexes are probably genetically determined. In the shallow waters, where Hydractinia are found, colonies release gametes on a light cue. After a period of darkness, sunlight triggers the rupture of gonadal walls in males and females, causing the release of gametes. Embryos develop in two to three days leading to a planula larvae. The planula then attaches to a hermit crab shell and subsequently undergoes metamorphosis to turn into a single polyp with extending stolons. During metamorphosis, cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration occur. Metamorphosis is triggered by unknown cues from bacteria found on the hermit crab shell. After metamorphosis, the single polyp grows and extends its stolonal network and can reach adult size fairly quickly. The animal can complete its whole life cycle in 2‚Äì3 months. == Allorecognition == Allorecognition is the ability to tell self from non-self within the same species. In Hydractinia, work on laboratory strains has revealed that this ability rests at two genetically inherited loci, called alr1 and alr2. If two colonies share an allele at both alr1 and alr2, they fuse and subsequently establish a continuous gastrovascular system. A complete mismatch at alr1 and alr2 leads to rejection, in which the colonies fight with each other until one colony dies. In rejection, the colonies inflict damage on each other by shooting nematocysts at each other where their stolons and mat contact. If two colonies match at one locus, they initially fuse and later separate their tissues, a response called transitory fusion. Fusion tests along with other molecular techniques are used to determine the unknown genotypes of Hydractinia colonies. == Habitat == Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus lives in shallow environments along the North Atlantic coast and is primarily found on hermit crab shells. == References == * * * ;Notes == See also == Hydractinia echinata Category:Anthomedusae Category:Animals described in 1989 Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus"},{"id":"20561307","text":"A Diploma of Journalism (or Diploma in Journalism) is an academic qualification in journalism issued by a university or college. The diploma is generally issued after one year of study. As is common with diplomas in general, diplomas in journalism are often more practical or applied than a course leading to a bachelor's or master's degree in journalism. Some universities offer postgraduate Diplomas of Journalism. Historically, the emergence of journalism diplomas reflected the somewhat condescending view of journalism education which emerged in Britain and British Commonwealth countries, unlike the United States. Briggs and Burke point out that, despite the emergence of university degree programs in the United States from the late 19th century, British universities were uninterested in formal journalism education, and entered the field only at sub-degree level: \\"between 1919 and 1939 the only University Diploma for Journalism in Britain was offered at London University\\".Briggs & Burke, p.165. In the 1920s and 1930s in Australia, four universities started journalism diploma courses as sub-degree programs, but none of the courses survived in this form. (They have since emerged as degree courses.)Kirkpatrick More recently, there has been debate about comparisons between diploma and degree programs in journalism, with advocates of diplomas arguing that the shorter courses, with their lesser emphasis on theory, are often more relevant to industry needs. Degree courses, however, offer deeper theoretical exposure and greater analysis of ethical and legal issues. In New Zealand, the media industry has developed a national diploma of journalism, establishing a curriculum which is followed by accredited training institutions, including universities and colleges. Britain National Council for the Training of Journalists offers certificate courses and accredits colleges and universities offering diplomas and degrees in journalism.

Her parents decided that she was not yet ready for college, so she attended preparatory school at the Baldwin School in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. After graduation she attended Wellesley College where she graduated with an AB degree in 1924. She later received Master of Arts degree from Columbia University. Adkins also received honorary degrees from Hood, Salisbury State, Western Maryland, Wheaton and Wilson Colleges.Helmes, Winifred G. (2002). Orchids in the Icebox: The Story of Bertha Adkins and Other Influential Women in the Eisenhower Administration, Chapel Hill Press. Her first job after college was as a teacher at Miss Harold's School, a private elementary school in Salisbury. She held this position from 1928-1932. She felt unchallenged by the position and left. After a brief trip to Europe she began working as a secretary in the family business, E. S. Adkins Lumber Company. In 1934 Western Maryland College (currently McDaniel College) in Westminster, Maryland offered her the position of Dean of Women. She accepted and stayed until 1942 when she became the Dean of Residence at Bradford Junior College in Bradford, Massachusetts. ==Later life== After the death of her mother in 1946, Adkins returned to Salisbury to run her father's household. At that time she was active in community affairs and also began her political career by volunteering her services to the local Republican Party. In recognition of her organizational abilities and skill in working with the public, she was appointed as Republican National Committeewoman for Maryland in 1948. Some women who had long been active in the Maryland Federation of Republican Women protested this appointment, resentful that the relative newcomer was appointed over other candidates and fearing that this was a case of the men of the party imposing their will on the women's activities. Adkins‚Äô down-to-earth strength in organizing and motivating workers at the precinct level soon won over all but her most bitter rivals. Two years later, she was appointed Executive Director of the Women's Division of the Republican National Committee (RNC). In 1953, she became Assistant to the Chairman of the RNC. During this time, she instituted a series of \\"Breakfasts with the President\\" and set an example for a series of annual national conferences of Republican women. In her work for the RNC Adkins traveled extensively across the country speaking to Republican women's groups, at Lincoln Day dinners, and at a wide range of party events. Frequently in her speeches she encouraged women to take an active role in party politics and to consider running for elected office. An active member of the American Association of University Women (AAUW), The Bertha Sheppard Adkins fellowship was established in her honor in 1958, for a female scholar pursuing advanced work in American history, government of politics. She maintained close relationships with Democratic women leaders throughout her political career, maintaining that strong participation by women in both parties was needed to ensure a strong two-party system. She continued to be active in the Republican Party throughout her life. In 1968 she helped organize the unsuccessful Presidential campaign bid of Nelson Rockefeller. President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Bertha Adkins the Under Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) in 1958. She was the first woman to hold this position. One of her chief responsibilities was the oversight of aging programs. In this capacity she directed the organization of the first White House Conference on Aging in 1961. She also played a role in the White House Conference on Children and Youth held in 1960. She hired Winifred G. Helmes as her Special Assistant in 1959. As Under Secretary she also served on the Advisory Board for Economic Growth and Stability, the Committee for Rural Development, the Committee to Coordinate Federal Urban Area Assistance Programs, and served as chairman of the Department Board on Employee Awards. She continued her extensive speaking schedule with a new agenda; now she promoted HEW programs, in particular, the White House Conference on Aging. As Under Secretary she attended the United Nations Seminar on the Participation of Women in Public Life in Bogota, Colombia, May 18-29, 1959 and the UNESCO General Conference in Paris in November-December, 1960. She also traveled to Finland, Norway, Sweden Soviet Union, and Poland in 1959. In 1957 President Eisenhower appointed Adkins to the Lincoln Sesquicentennial Commission. She served as chair of the Executive Committee. The Commission organized publications, promotions and educational programs to commemorate Abraham Lincoln. The activities culminated on Lincoln's 150th birthday in 1959. After leaving Federal service in 1961 Adkins returned to education. She accepted the position as Head of Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Virginia. She worked to strengthen the academic program at the school. In 1967 she retired to her home in Oxford, Maryland. Instead of a quiet retirement, Adkins once again entered Federal service, returning to her role as an advocate for the elderly and aging programs. In 1969 President Richard Nixon appointed her to the Task Force on the Problems of the Aging. In 1970 she served on the President's Advisory Committee on Social Security. She served as vice-chairman of the 1971 White House Conference on Aging. In 1972 she served on the Advisory Committee on Older Americans. In 1974 she was appointed to the Advisory Committee on Social Security. Finally, on March 27, 1974, President Nixon appointed her as chairman of his new Federal Council on Aging. As chairman, she organized public hearings on national policy concerns for older women. Her work in this area set the tone for the work of the Council. She served as chairman until 1977 and retired completely from the committee in 1978. ==References *Papers of Bertha Adkins, Dwight D.

He was owned by Mrs Violet O'Leary and trained by Willie Mullins. His major race successes included the Champion Bumper, Royal & SunAlliance Chase, King George VI Chase, and a record four Irish Hennessy's (Hennessy Gold Cup (Ireland)), among other races. Florida Pearl made his debut when winning a 4YO Maiden at Lismore in March 1996. He did not reappear then until December of that year, where he followed up by winning a National Hunt Flat Race at Leopardstown. He was then stepped straight up to Grade 1 class for the 1997 Cheltenham Festival, where he won the Champion Bumper by five lengths in his final appearance of that season. He reappeared in December 1997, where he won a Beginners Chase at Leopardstown. Following that, he was stepped up in class for the Grade 2 Dr.P.J. Moriarty Memorial Novice Chase, for which he was an odds on favourite and obliged with a 1-length victory over Boss Doyle. Following that victory, he was sent off the 11/8 favourite for the Royal & SunAlliance Chase, where he defied his relative inexperience over fences to record a 1¬Ω length victory over Escartefigue, under Richard Dunwoody, maintaining his unbeaten record. He made his first start of the 1998/99 season at Leopardstown in December in the Ericsson Chase, where he was sent off an odds-on favourite. Travelling strongly in the race, he made a mistake three out which resulted in him falling, leaving Doran's Pride to win. Despite this fall, he was still sent off an odds-on favourite for the Irish Hennessy in February 1999, where he recorded a 2-length victory over old rival Escarefigue. He was then sent off the 5/2 favourite for the 1999 Cheltenham Gold Cup under Richard Dunwoody, finishing a 17-length 3rd behind the winner, See More Business. Florida Pearl made his final appearance of that season in April in the Punchestown Gold Cup, where he was once again sent off the odds- on favourite and finished a 14-length 2nd to Imperial Call. He began the 1999‚Äì00 season in the Grade 1 James Nicholson Wine Merchant Champion Chase, which he won from Doran's Pride by 2¬Ω lengths. He then contested Ericsson Chase for the second season in a row, where he again failed to justify odds-on favouritism when finishing 2nd to Rince Ri. He came back to Leopardstown to contest his first Handicap, where he only just defied top weight when running out a short winner from Amberleigh House. He then contested the Irish Hennessy for the 2nd successive season and was a 5¬Ω length winner over old foe Doran's Pride. Florida Pearl came back to contest the Cheltenham Gold Cup, where he was sent off the 9/2 joint 2nd favourite behind the previous year's winner and favourite, See More Business (9/4). In a race which was marred by the subsequent death of the then-race leader Gloria Victis, Florida Pearl was unsuccessful in his bid to win the Cheltenham Gold Cup, finishing a 5-length second to fellow 9/2 joint favourite Looks Like Trouble. In the 2000/01 season, Florida Pearl made five appearances, all at Grade 1 level. He had no luck in his first three races of the season, starting in the James Nicholson Wine Merchant Champion Chase, where he finished a distant fourth to reigning Cheltenham Gold Cup Champion Looks Like Trouble. He went on to be denied by a short head by Native Upmanship in the John Durkan Memorial Chase at Punchestown. Florida Pearl then made his first appearance at Kempton in the King George VI Chase, where he finished a 10-length 2nd to First Gold. He regained the winning thread, when winning the Irish Hennessy for the 3rd successive season, beating stablemate Alexander Banquet by 2 lengths. He was unable to run at the Cheltenham Festival because it was abandoned due to the 2001 UK foot and mouth crisis. In his final appearance of the season, Florida Pearl finished a 6-length 2nd to Moscow Express in the Powers Gold Cup at Fairyhouse. The 2001/02 season proved to be a lot more successful for Florida Pearl, although it began with a 2¬Ω length 3rd behind Foxchapel King in the James Nicholson Wine Merchant Champion Chase. He exacted revenge on Native Upmanship from the previous season with a short head win in the John Durkan Memorial Chase. Florida Pearl then returned to Kempton for the King George VI Chase in December, where he again exacted revenge on last year's winner, First Gold, with a 3/4 length victory over Best Mate. He went back to Leopardstown to contest the Irish Hennessy for the 4th successive season, where he was sent off the 6/4 favourite and finished a 25-length 4th behind the winner and stablemate Alexander Banquet. He went back to contest the 2002 Cheltenham Gold Cup, where he finished 11th of 18 behind the winner, Best Mate. He returned to England for his next start in the Grade 2 Martell Cup Chase, where he cruised to an 11-length victory over Cyfor Malta. He made one more successful appearance that season when winning the Punchestown Gold Cup by 3 lengths over Native Upmanship. In 2002‚Äì03, Florida Pearl failed to get his head in front in five attempts. After being beaten a distance in the James Nicholson Wine Merchant Champion Chase and the King George VI Chase, behind More Than A Stroll and Best Mate respectively, he was pulled up in the race associated with him, the 2003 Irish Hennessy. He was then dropped down to 2 miles at the Cheltenham Festival and finished 8th of 11 behind Moscow Flyer in the Queen Mother Champion Chase. In his final start of the season, he finished fifth behind old foe First Gold in the Punchestown Gold Cup. The following season, 2003‚Äì04, proved to be Florida Pearl's final season racing, and he only made two appearances on the racecourse. He began the season in January 2004, where he made a successful return to action at Fairyhouse in the Grade 3 Norman Grove Chase, running out a 2-length winner over Rince Ri. In his final race, Florida Pearl returned to Leopardstown to contest the Irish Hennessy one last time, where he was sent off the 5/1 fourth favourite in the betting under jockey, Richard Johnson. He defied these odds to win the race for the fourth time at the age of 12, with a 3-length victory over the 15/8 favourite, Le Coudray. Florida Pearl was euthanised on 5 May 2012 due to a rare condition linked to a malignant cancer. ==External links== * pedigreequery.com - Florida Pearl's pedigree * racingpost.com - Florida Pearl's race record == References == Category:1992 racehorse births Category:2012 racehorse deaths Category:Cheltenham Festival winners Category:National Hunt racehorses Category:Racehorses bred in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in Ireland Category:Thoroughbred family 3 ","title":"Florida Pearl"},{"id":"20561457","text":"The Booze News is a satirical newspaper founded at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in February 2004 by Atish Doshi and Derek Chin.

The ramp is part of Ludwig's Western Railway and the section from W√ºrzburg via Aschaffenburg to the state border at Kahl am Main was opened on 1 October 1854 by the Royal Bavarian State Railways. The ramp enabled the difference in height between the Laufach valley and the Lohr valley to be overcome as it crossed the Spessart between Kahl am Main and Aschaffenburg on the one side and W√ºrzburg/Bamberg on the other. In keeping with the philosophy for railway construction at that time it was decided that the way to cope with large differences in height was the construction of a relatively short, steep section of line and to haul trains up the incline with the aid of banking locomotives, whilst the remaining section of the route could be made relatively level. A structure using the same concept is the ' between Neuenmarkt-Wirsberg and Marktschorgast, which was built between 1844 and 1848 as part of the Ludwig South-North Railway. The Spessart Ramp, together with the adjoining Schwarzkopf tunnel had been double-tracked in 1854, whilst the remaining parts of the line between Kahl am Main and W√ºrzburg were not doubled until the 1890s. The Spessart Ramp was electrified in 1957. During the steam locomotive era, heavy goods trains were frequently hauled up the ramp at just 6 km/h. In 1914 the legendary 0-8-8-0 Mallet locomotives, the Bavarian Gt 2x4/4s (later DRG Class 96) arrived as banking engines for the Spessart Ramp. Later they were replaced by Prussian T 16.1 (DRG Class 94.5-17) which remained in service until 1957, and also sometimes by the Prussian T 20s (Class 95s). From 1957 to autumn 1987 the Class E 94.2s (194.5) took on the banking duties. These were replaced from late 1987 to 2003 by the DB Class 150, that have been in operation there briefly in 1957 for a few weeks as pushers. Since 2003 the DB Class 151 has performed the banking task. Because the Deutsche Bahn does not push the goods trains of private railway companies for competition reasons, since 2004 the Mittelweserbahn has stationed locomotive number 1020 041 ( ex √ñBB, known as ') at Laufach for the goods trains of private railways. As a result, an example of Class E93/E94 has returned after a break of many years to banking duties on the Spessart Ramp. == New ramp== In August 2006 the German Federal Transport Ministry gave financial approval for the construction of a new, less steep, double-tracked line with 4 tunnels. Construction started in 2009 at a cost of ‚Ç¨240 million (2006 estimate) and was expected to be completed by 2014. The main tunnel is the 2,600 m long Falkenberg tunnel, which joins the existing line on the eastern side of Heigenbr√ºcken. After the new line entered service, the old route was closed. ===Commissioning new building / decommissioning old building=== Test and acceptance drives took place from April 2017.db/schr/kar: Spessart-NBS vor der Betriebsaufnahme.

Leavitt was also co-founder of another early New York publishing house with his brother-in-law Daniel Appleton. George Palmer Putnam, who went on to found a New York publishing dynasty, received his first job from Leavitt. Eventually Jonathan Leavitt went into business on his own, and after his death the firm was run by his son George Ayres Leavitt. ==History== Early bookbindery. Jonathan Leavitt, publisher, began his career as apprentice bookbinder in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Jonathan Leavitt was born in 1797 at Hampton Falls, New Hampshire likely to Simeon Leavitt and his wife Betty (n√©e) Tuck. An obituary in The Publishers' Weekly for Jonathan Leavitt's son George Ayers Leavitt, who followed his father into the publishing industry, indicates a family association with Effingham Falls (now simply Effingham), New Hampshire. The New Hampshire town had once been named Leavitts Town, and was settled chiefly by members of the Leavitt family from Hampton, New Hampshire. Leavitt served as an apprentice bookbinder in Cambridge, Massachusetts and then moved to Andover, Massachusetts in 1812-13\\\\. In Andover, Leavitt and printers Abraham Gould and Timothy Flagg set up a press for the Andover Theological Seminary. Leavitt and his two partners continued to operate their printing and bookbinding operation after Leavitt decided to relocate after over a decade in Andover. Leavitt married the former Joan Ayres at Haverhill, Massachusetts, on July 8, 1820 at the age of 23. Although most accounts give the name of Leavitt's wife as Joan Ayres - and Ayres was subsequently the middle name of Leavitt's son George, who took over his father's publishing business - Sidney Perley, in his authoritative The Essex Antiquarian, lists under the 'Adams Genealogy' the information that Major John Adams of Andover, Massachusetts, had daughters Louisa (who married 'Jonathan Leavitt') and Hannah (who married \\"Daniel Appleton of Haverhill' of \\"the Appleton Publishing House of New York City.\\"). Leavitt's first wife Joan Ayer Leavitt died at Andover on November 7, 1824.Massachusetts: Vital Records, 1620-1850 (Online Database: AmericanAncestors.org, New England Historic Genealogical Society, 2001-2016). Andover Deaths p 489 On 7 December 1825, Jonathan married his second wife Louisa Adams who was born at Andover December 28, 1803 daughter of John and Dorcas (Faulkner) Adams. Louisa's sister Hannah was the wife of Daniel Appleton.Essex County, MA: Probate File Papers, 1638-1881.Online database. AmericanAncestors.org. New England Historic Genealogical Society, 2014. Case 259 ==New York City== George Palmer Putnam, hired at 16 years old by Jonathan Leavitt as apprentice and right-hand man. Putnam went on to found a publishing powerhouse of his own. In 1825, Leavitt moved to New York City and went into business with his brother-in-law Daniel Appleton, who formerly worked as a Boston dry goods merchant but who had founded D. Appleton & Co., a large store on Exchange Place opposite the Customs House, to sell books. Appleton put up the capital for the founding of a publishing business with his brother-in-law Leavitt. The store on Exchange Place was divided into two sections, with Appleton's son William later taking charge of the bookselling functions. After five years of partnership, and feeling he could continue his business without further capital infusions from his brother-in-law, Jonathan Leavitt went into business for himself, opening a store at Broadway and John Streets and hiring George Palmer Putnam (then aged 16) as his apprentice and right-hand man. Appleton and his son subsequently moved their business to what was known as Clinton Hall, on Beekman Street, where they established themselves as well-known booksellers. With his partnership with Appleton dissolved, Leavitt became the leading publisher of religious and theological works in New York city. Leavitt also acted as publisher for his early employee Putnam, who went on to open his own eponymous publishing firm, which became an industry fixture. \\"Mr. Leavitt is willing to publish the volume I have compiled\\", Putnam wrote to a correspondent during his term of employment with Jonathan Leavitt, \\"as soon as he is satisfied that it will be acceptable with the public.\\" In 1833, Leavitt publish Putnam's first book: Chronology, or An Introduction and Index to Universal History, Biography, and Useful Knowledge. The volume, which Putnam had first compiled for his own use, received a then-enormous printing run of 1,000 copies. The book's success, and Putnam's increasing usefulness to Leavitt's business caused the proprietor to advance him to a salary of two dollars per week, and within a few months to four dollars per week. Broadway emerged early as center of the publishers who came to New York City, and Leavitt was among the pioneers of the business. Leavitt's brother-in-law Appleton had worked in the dry goods business in Boston, and took on management of the wholesale part of the new firm's printing business. Appleton later founded his own publishing firm, which later grew into one of the industry's largest, nearby at 200 Broadway. ==John F. Trow & Co.== In 1840, Leavitt became partners with fellow Andover native John F. Trow, a veteran of the Andover publishing firm Leavitt had helped found: Flagg & Gould, operator of the Codman Press. The pair of Andover men founded two publishing firms - both located at 191 Broadway in Lower Manhattan. They founded John F. Trow & Co., as well a second firm under their combined names, Leavitt & Trow, to do publishing and bookselling. From the beginning, the new firm published a wide array of books and pamphlets. In 1841, for instance, its presses turned out Merciful Rebukes: A Sermon Preached in the Rutgers Street Church, New York, on Friday, May 14, 1841, On Occasion of the National Fast Recommended by the President of the United States. Two years later, the firm published a more ambitious project: a four-volume set of the sermons and papers of Rev. Jonathan Edwards entitled The Works of President Edwards, in Four Volumes. The firm, with the experienced Trow in command of the printing end, also published the classical series of Prof. John J. Owen, which was wildly popular and went through several printings. Leavitt's partner Trow was an early adapter of new printing technologies, and among the first to use power presses, then in 1840 a stereotype press as well. In 1843, the John F. Trow firm printed in 1843 Memoir of Mrs. Louisa Adams Leavitt by Rev. Asa Dodge Smith. Leavitt & Trow became a prominent presence on the early New York publishing landscape, not least because of partner Trow's familiarity with the latest printing technologies, but also due to his heavy involvement in the business. \\"Our business has the personal attention of ourselves\\", Trow wrote to the public in 1845, \\"and we trust by unwearied application to receive from our patrons and the public in general a continuance of their patronage.\\" In 1847 the two Andover natives began publishing directories. (In the following years the Trow directories to New York became an established city institution). The pair were soon joined in the business by George Ayres Leavitt, Jonathan's son, who had recently graduated from Phillips Academy in Andover, and who had served an early apprenticeship with publishers Robinson & Franklin. About 1848 the two founding partners split their interests: Trow returned to running his own company (primarily his increasingly lucrative directory business, which he largely invented); and Leavitt went into business with his son until his death. The firm retained the name Leavitt & Trow up until Jonathan Leavitt's death. George A. Leavitt continued his father's business as a sole proprietorship for a year until he joined forces with childhood playmate John K. Allen, who had been brought up in the publishing business. ==See also== *George Ayres Leavitt ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Statement of John F.

He later shortened his name to Maurice Arnold. Arnold's father was a physician and his mother a prominent pianist and his first teacher. At the age of fifteen he went to Cincinnati, Ohio studying at the College of Music for three years. In 1883 he traveled to Germany to study counterpoint and composition with Georg Vierling and Heinrich Urban in Berlin. Mr. Urban attempted to discourage him when Arnold began to incorporate African-American \\"plantation\\" dance elements into his music. Following studies in Berlin Arnold went on a tour of Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey. Some of his compositions show the influence of his travels through those countries. Upon returning to Germany he then entered the Cologne Conservatory of Music where his first piano sonata was written and performed. He next went to Breslau, where, under the instruction of Max Bruch, he wrote one of his first major works, his cantata \\"The Wild Chase.\\" Returning to Saint Louis he busied himself as a solo violinist and teacher, traveling also as an opera conductor. Maurice Arnold was one of many African-American students of Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k during the Bohemian composer's stay in the United States as director of the newly formed National Conservatory of Music of America in New York (1892‚Äì1895). Arnold participated in Dvo≈ô√°k's famous January 23, 1894 concert about which the New York Herald wrote \\"It was a remarkable event. Each soloist with one exception belong to the colored race. Bodies had been liberated but the gates of the artistic world were still locked. (Conservatory founder) Jeannette Thurber's efforts in this effort were ably seconded by Dr. Dvo≈ô√°k.\\" And while the program included Arnold's four \\"American Plantation Dances\\" the main attraction of the evening was Dvo≈ô√°k's arrangement of Stephen Foster's \\"The Old Folks at Home\\" for chorus and orchestra. Arnold's four-movement suite, \\"Plantation Dances.\\" Op. 32, was thereafter performed with some regularity and was published for full orchestra as well as in an arrangement for piano duet in the United States and in Germany. Arnold also wrote a work entitled \\"Dramatic Overture\\" and two comic operas. His \\"Valse Elegante\\" for two pianos, eight hands is composed in a charming salon style typical of the time and easily performed with a quartet of amateur pianists. Arnold also wrote a fugue for two pianos, eight hands, a \\"Minstrel Serenade\\" for violin and piano, and six duets for violin and viola. Among his many vocal works the most remarkable is his setting of the poem, \\"I Think of Thee in Silent Night.\\" Arnold also wrote works for ballet, a tarantella for string orchestra, and a symphony (unpublished). He was also the author of the textbook \\"Some Points in Modern Orchestration.\\" But it is as a student at the then newly formed National Conservatory of Music in New York City and his association with the conservatory's director Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k for which Maurice Arnold is most remembered. Dvo≈ô√°k was extremely encouraging to the young Arnold at a time when Dvo≈ô√°k's philosophy of American nationalism in music was ridiculed by many of the musical establishment in New England. Even Edward MacDowell, the dean of American composers of his day, wrote \\"In spite of Dvo≈ô√°k's efforts to dress up American music in Negro clothing, it is my opinion that foreign artistry should have no place in our music, if it is to be worth of our free country.\\" Crusading against the \\"social sanctification of the arts\\" popular in certain circles of the day Dvo≈ô√°k stated in the New York Herald (May, 1893) \\"I am now convinced that the future music of this country must be built on the foundations of the song which are called Negro melodies. They must become the basis of a serious and original school of composition which should be established in the United States of America.\\" Dvo≈ô√°k's students were represented in full force at the Carnegie Hall premiere of his Symphony \\"From the New World\\" on December 16, 1893. Dvo≈ô√°k, his wife, and their two sons, sat in a box of honor with Maurice Arnold, as the student composer for whom Dvo≈ô√°k had the highest hopes. Also in attendance was the great African American composer, singer and writer Harry Burleigh. The English horn solo in the second movement Largo made a lasting impression on Maurice Arnold and his fellow composition students, Harvey Worthington Loomis, William Arms Fisher, and Will Marion Cook. Dvo≈ô√°k had described the slow movement as \\"a study or sketch for a longer work, either a cantata or an opera based on Longfellow's 'Hiawatha.'\\" William Arms Fisher adapted the English horn melody using his own text \\"Goin' Home\\" that eventually established itself as a popular Negro \\"spiritual.\\" Arnold's version had the text \\"Mother Mine.\\" from M. Peress \\"Dvo≈ô√°k to Duke Ellington\\".Oxford University Press The title page of the autograph score of Dvo≈ô√°k's ninth symphony, 1893 African American composers such as Maurice Arnold, Will Marion Cook and Harry Burleigh applied Dvo≈ô√°k's command of using Creole folk music, spirituals, plantation work songs, and popular music as a basis for the formation of a new American nationalist musical sound. Clara Gottschalk (the pianist, composer Louis Moreau Gottschalk's sister) wrote in the preface to her 1902 arrangements of \\"Creole songs,\\" \\"if as Dr. Dvo≈ô√°k has claimed there is in time to be a native school of American music based on the primitive musical utterances of the red man and the black man these negro melodies are historical documents of some interest.\\" While Maurice Arnold did not become the main musical proponent of Dvo≈ô√°k's philosophy for a new American sound in music he did live long enough to see much of what Dvo≈ô√°k fought for come to pass; the birth of the blues, ragtime, jazz all leading to the first major African American composer William Grant Still. It was Still who finally did utilize the spiritual as a basis for one of the first important and original works for orchestra written by an African American, his \\"Afro-American Symphony\\" composed in 1930, seven years before Maurice Arnold's death in New York in 1937. ==References== * Nytimes.com * Lcweb2.loc.gov * Nytimes.com ==External links== * Category:1865 births Category:1937 deaths Category:African-American classical composers Category:African-American classical musicians Category:American male classical composers Category:American classical composers ","title":"Maurice Arnold Strothotte"},{"id":"20561686","text":"Guadalupe Victoria Municipality is a municipality in the Mexican state of Puebla.

He is recognized for his contribution to film and pop music in Iran. His major works include Qeysar, Toughi, Dash Akol, Tangna, The Deers (GavaznhƒÅ). ==Career Early years === He started his career early in his teens as percussionist and accordionist in the National Iranian Radio Children's Program. In 1958, he joined the Youth Orchestra of National Iranian Radio as contrabassist where shortly after he would be trusted with all the music arrangement and the conductor duties. === Cinema === From his early ages, he was fascinated by cinema and filmmaking. This was the dream which he and his long-life friend Masoud Kimiai (Iranian film director, screenwriter, and producer) shared. Finally, in 1967, when Masoud Kimiai got a chance to direct his first film (Come Stranger, 196, Monfaredzadeh composed the score. However, it was their second collaboration (Qeysar, 1969) that made history. Months before Qeysar was released, he had left Iran to continue his studies in Germany where he had the opportunity to be acquainted with the Confederation of Iranian Students which helped him to reshape and deepen his social and political ideas. Hence, the Qeysar outbreak made him give up his studies and come back to Iran to pursue his cinematic career. The quality of his work in Qeysar, along with the success of the film at the box office and among the critics, put more attention on the music for films in Iran which until that day was not taken seriously by the Iranian film industry. The following year, he won the Best Film Score award for Qeysar at the second \\"Sepas Awards\\" ceremony which would be repeated the next year for his third collaboration with Masoud Kimiai (Reza Motori, 1970). His film scores continued with Toughi (Ali Hatami, 1970), Window (Jalal Moghaddam, 1970), Dash Akol (Masoud Kimiai, 1971), Topoli (Reza Mirlohi, 1972), Balouch (Masoud Kimiai, 1972), Soil (Masoud Kimiai, 1973), Tangna (Amir Naderi, 1973), and The Deers (Gavaznha) (Masoud Kimiai, 1974). === Pop music === In 1965 and after working on the National Iranian Radio and later the University of Tehran orchestra, he began his collaboration with the Tanin Recording Studio (the first private recording studio in Iran), and along with his comrades contributed to shape a new atmosphere in the Iranian pop music. In parallel to his cinematic activities and through his well-known songs such as \\"Friday\\" and \\"Nightly 1\\", he tried to represent Iranian people by picturing their pains and sorrows under the totalitarian Shah‚Äôs regime. In 1973, he was sentenced to jail for his social and political ideas. However, after his release he would not remain silent and with his works (songs such as \\"Gonjishkak-e Ashi Mashi\\", \\"Childish (Koudakaneh)\\", \\"Nightly 2\\" or \\"Friday for Friday\\"), he accompanied and supported people in the upcoming revolution. === Institute for the Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults === In 1970, he joined the ‚ÄúInstitute for the Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults\\" where he contributed to establish the Children‚Äôs Film Training Center as well as writing music for audio books, animations, and short films produced by the institute. == Exile == Shortly after the Iranian Revolution in February 1979, he concluded that this was not what he has wished for, so he expressed his concerns with the songs \\"Unity\\" and \\"Whisper\\". He decided to leave Iran and go to a self-imposed exile which continues to this day. During the exile, his artistic activities were extremely limited; however, he still believes in change for his country and his people. ==Selected filmography== * Keep the Flight in Mind (2012) * Iranian Taboo (2011) * Epitaph (2004) * Sobh-e Khakestar (1977) * Gavaznha (1976) ‚Äì aka The Deers * Ghazal (1975) * Haft-tir- ha-ye Choubi (1975) * Pesar-e Sharghi (1975) * Rokh (1974) * Nefrin (1973) * Tangna (1973) ‚Äì aka Strait * Balouch (1972) * Khak (1972) ‚Äì aka The Soil * Topoli (1972) * Dash Akol (1971) * Khastegar (1971) ‚Äì aka The Suitor * Khodahafez Rafigh (1971) ‚Äì aka Goodbye, Friend! * Toughi (1971) * Hassan Kachal (1970) * The Window (1970) * Raqqase-ye Shahr (1970) * Reza Motori (1970) ‚Äì aka Reza, the Motorcyclist * Amou Sibilou (1969) * Qeysar (1969) ==References *Esfandiar Monfaredzadeh's official website *Esfandiar Monfaredzadeh on Spotify *Esfandiar Monfaredzadeh on Youtube * Category:Iranian composers Category:Iranian film score composers Category:1941 births Category:Living people Category:Iranian emigrants to Sweden Category:Iranian music arrangers ","title":"Esfandiar Monfaredzadeh"},{"id":"20561776","text":"The Overthrow of Apollo and the Pagan Gods (1809), one of William Blake's illustrations of On the Morning of Christ's Nativity On the Morning of Christ's Nativity is a nativity ode written by John Milton in 1629 and published in his Poems of Mr. John Milton (1645). The poem describes Christ's Incarnation and his overthrow of earthly and pagan powers. The poem also connects the Incarnation with Christ's Crucifixion. ==Background== Milton composed On the Morning of Christ's Nativity in December 1629, after celebrating reaching the age of maturity in England,Corns 2003 p. 216 in commemoration of the Nativity of Jesus. It was written while Charles Diodati, Milton's friend, was composing his own poem, and the poem reflects his sober, contemplative lifestyle in comparison to Diodati's extravagant way of living.Shawcross 1993 pp. 43‚Äì44 The ode was composed during a time in Milton's life that he based his understanding of religion on Scripture, but he was still influenced by myth.Shawcross 1993 p. 23 Although the ode was the first poem of Milton's 1645 collection, it was not the first poem that he wrote; many of the Latin and Greek poems included in the 1645 collection were composed during an earlier time. According to Thomas Corns, \\"Quite probably, its location indicates the poet's assessment of its quality\\"; this consideration is significant because Humphrey Moseley, an important bookseller, was the publisher of the volume and the ode serves as an introduction to Milton's poetry. ==Form== The poem is divided into two sections. \\"The Hymn,\\" which comprises the bulk of the poem (27 stanzas) is prefaced by a four stanza introduction. Milton's introductory stanzas are seven lines each: five lines of iambic pentameter, using the rhyme scheme ABABB, followed by a rhyming couplet. The final line of each stanza is written in iambic hexameter. For example, see the first stanza: > \\"This is the month, and this the happy morn / Wherein the Son of Heav'n's > eternal King, / Of wedded maid, and virgin mother born, / Our great > redemption from above did bring; / For so the holy sages once did sing, / > That he our deadly forfeit should release, / And with his Father work us a > perpetual peace.\\" The hymnal stanzas are eight lines each, uniformly written in iambic meter. As in the introductory stanzas, the final two lines form a rhyming couplet, with a line in tetrameter followed by a line in hexameter, which closes out each stanza. The first six lines are made up of two tercets organized by the rhyme scheme AABCCB. The first two lines of each tercet are in trimeter, and the third in pentameter. For example, the first stanza of the Hymn: > \\"It was the winter wild, / While the Heav'n-born-child, / All meanly wrapped > in the rude manger lies; / Nature in awe to him / had doffed her gaudy trim > / With her great master so to sympathize: / It was no season then for her / > To wanton with the sun her lusty paramour.\\" ==Themes== The ode with The Passion and Upon the Circumcision form a set of poems that celebrate important Christian events: Christ's birth, the feast of the Circumcision, and Good Friday. The topic of these poems places them within a genre of Christian literature popular during the 17th century and places Milton alongside of poets like John Donne, Richard Crashaw, and George Herbert. However, Milton's poetry reflects the origins of his anti-William Laud and anti-Church of England based religious beliefs.Corns 2003 pp. 216‚Äì217 The poem deals with both the Nativity and the Incarnation of Christ and Milton believed that the two were connected. The Nativity and the Crucifixion represent Christ's purpose as Christ in Milton's poetry, and contemporary poem, because Christ becomes human-like in the Nativity to redeem fallen man and humanity is redeemed when Christ sacrifices himself during the Crucifixion. Milton's reliance on the connection is traditional, and Milton further connects the Nativity with the creation of the world, a theme that is expanded upon later in Book VII of Paradise Lost. Like the other two poems of the set and like other poems at the time, the ode describes a narrator within the poem and experiencing the Nativity.Corns 2003 pp. 221‚Äì213 ==Critical response== The ode has, according to Thomas Corns, \\"generally been recognized as Milton's first manifestation of poetic genius and, qualitatively, a poem to be set alongside 'Lycidas' and A Masque presented at Ludlow Castle, 1634 as his most significant poetic works before Paradise Lost.\\" He further claims that the ode \\"rises in many ways above the rather commonplace achievements of Milton's other devotional poems and stands out from the mass of other early Stuart poems about Christmas.\\"Corns 2003 p. 221 ==In music== * In 1928 the first complete setting of Milton's Ode was undertaken by the Cambridge composer Cyril Rootham. The work is set for soli, chorus, semi-chorus and orchestra. * Portions of the ode are set as part of the text of Ralph Vaughan Williams' Christmas cantata, Hodie (1954). * Stanza XIII of the Hymn portion of this poem was set by Stephen Paulus in the second movement - \\"Ring Out! Ye Crystal Spheres\\" - of his 1990 work \\"Canticum Novum\\". * John Blackwood McEwen, Hymn on the Morning of Christ's Nativity, Ode for soprano, chorus and orchestra (1905). ==NotesReferences== * Corns, Thomas. \\"'On the Morning of Christ's Nativity', 'Upon the Circumcision' and 'The Passion'\\" in A Companion to Milton.

On Carly and Sam's web show, they have a segment called \\"Messin' With Lewbert\\" where the two girls play pranks on Lewbert downstairs in the lobby of the building.

Rowley has also appeared on The Amanda Show, most notably the sketch called \\"Blockblister\\" (a parody of the video retail chain Blockbuster), where he plays a customer who is angry because he did not get the movie he wanted (he paid for the video by tearing off his arm and giving it to them, replying \\"Keep the change!\\").

They used their huge talent, exploited other drivers' errors and also the performance of the New Civic of the Honda Petrobras team. The team's happiness was even greater because another of its cars placed second, in the hands of Juan Manuel Silva/Leonel Ugalde. Alain Menu/Christian Ledesma (Chevrolet Elaion) completed the podium. Buenos Aires, August 10, 2008.- With more than 70.000 spectators attending the event, Argentina's Jos√© Mar√≠a L√≥pez and Scotland's Anthony Reid won the 5th edition of the Buenos Aires 200 km, after a great initial stint by the local driver and a similarly impressive second one by the Scot. They used their huge talent, exploited other drivers' errors and also the performance of the New Civic of the Honda Petrobras team. The team's happiness was even greater because another of its cars placed second, in the hands of Juan Manuel Silva/Leonel Ugalde. Alain Men√∫/Christian Ledesma (Chevrolet Elaion) completed the podium. This is a dream come true. It is the happiest day of my life. Tears came to my eyes because of all the work we did to achieve this result. It is Honda's victory. It is the team's victory. I suffered very much when I was not at the wheel of the car, it is very different. There were times in which I wanted him to go faster, to take it easier, but I did not want to influence what Anthony was doing at the wheel of the car. We formed a great driver pairing, sincerely\\", said L√≥pez, full of emotion. Pechito has become a specialist in the so-called special events this season, as he recently won on the Santa Fe street circuit and now he has won the Buenos Aires 200 km, the two most outstanding events so far this year. Not forgetting to mention the great performance of the Honda Petrobras team during the entire weekend, having been ahead of its rivals right from the onset. This was also Anthony Reid's first victory in the division, and he has competed in all five editions which so far have taken place. He was second in last year's event, co-driving with Brazil's Carlos Bueno. \\"I've spent five years trying to win this race. Last year we were second. We've raced with V√≠ctor Rosso in Japan, I know him very well and to be here is terrific. I also want to thank L√≥pez for the great job he did today ... he should be in Formula 1.\\" said the Scot. L√≥pez and Reid claimed victory thanks in part to the great job of the driver from C√≥rdoba in what refers to the initial stint. After the driver change, when the Silva/Ugalde car grabbed the lead ahead of L√≥pez/Reid, the Briton cautiously tried to find a way past Ugalde. The latter found a good rhythm, but on lap 52 he overdid things while descending the Tobogan esses and lost the lead to Reid, who from then on controlled the race and headed towards victory, followed by Ugalde who kept Felipe Maluhy's Renault M√©gane at bay. Maluhy was co-driving with standings leader Guillermo Ortelli. It was Maluhy, who had finished 5th in the 2006 edition and 4th in 2007, who appeared to heading for the final podium placing until being nerfed by his countryman Cac√° Bueno in the Omb√∫ Curve and being demoted to fifth, as he was overtaken by Bueno and also by Alain Men√∫, who was co-driving a Chevrolet Astra with Christian Ledesma. Once the race had ended, the Stewards handed out a 30-second penalty to Bueno and this relegated him to 10th, so the third step of the podium finally corresponded to Ledesma/Men√∫, while Ortelli/Maluhy ended up fourth, ahead of Mat√≠as Rossi/Thiago Camilo.

South Africa introduced apartheid in 1948, as a systematic extension of pre-existing racial discrimination laws. Initially the regime implemented an offensive foreign policy trying to consolidate South African hegemony over Southern Africa. These attempts had clearly failed by the late 1970s. As a result of its racism, occupation of Namibia and foreign interventionism in Angola, the country became increasingly isolated internationally. ==Initial relations== In the aftermath of World War II and the Nazi Holocaust, the Western world quickly distanced itself from ideas of racial dominanceSee Borstelmann, Thomas; ‚ÄòJim Crow‚Äôs coming out: Race relations and American foreign policy in the Truman years‚Äô; Presidential Studies Quarterly; volume 29, issue 3, (September 1999), pp. 549-569 and policies based on racial prejudice.Borstelmann, Thomas; Apartheid's Reluctant Uncle: The United States and Southern Africa in the Early Cold War, pp. 83-85 Racially discriminatory and segregationist principles were not novelties in South Africa, given the racial make-up of their society. From unification in 1910, the state had been run by the white minority and pursued segregation from there. Apartheid was a certified, lawful and inflexible type of separation that was methodically entrenched from 1948 through a battery of legislation. As it was not completely new to the country, and because many Western countries still exercised their own forms of prejudice in their assorted colonies, there was minimal rejoinder and indignation. The conclusion of the Second World War signified the commencement of the Cold War, and South Africa, with its anticommunist stance, was considered a possible assistant in the passive battle against the Soviet Union. The world did not, however, condone South Africa's discriminatory policies. At the first UN gathering in 1946, South Africa was placed on the program. The primary subject in question was the handling of South African Indians, a critical cause of hostility between South Africa and India.Hamilton, Thyomas J.; ‚ÄòIndia Calls on U.N. to Discuss Friction with South Africa‚Äô; New York Times, June 24, 1946, p. 1 In 1952, apartheid was thrashed out again in the aftermath of the Defiance Campaign, and Indian demands caused the U.N. set up a task team to keep watch on the state of racial affairs and the progress of apartheid in South Africa.Borstelmann; Apartheid's Reluctant Uncle, p. 173 Although racial segregation in South Africa was a cause for concern, most countries in the UN concurred that race was an internal issue for South Africa, which fell outside the UN's jurisdiction. Only later did the United Nations become resolute in challenging South Africa. ==Sharpeville and the severing of British ties== South Africa's policies were subject to international scrutiny in 1960, when British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan criticised them during his celebrated Wind of Change speech in Cape Town. Weeks later, tensions came to a head in the Sharpeville Massacre, resulting in more international condemnation. Soon thereafter, Verwoerd announced a referendum on whether the country should sever links with the British monarchy and become a republic instead. Verwoerd lowered the voting age for whites to eighteen and included whites in South West Africa on the voter's roll. The referendum on 5 October that year asked whites, \\"Do you support a republic for the Union?\\", and 52 per cent voted \\"Yes\\". As a consequence of this change of status, South Africa needed to reapply for continued membership of the Commonwealth, with which it had privileged trade links. Even though India became a republic within the Commonwealth in 1950 it became clear that African and Asian member states would oppose South Africa due to its apartheid policies. As a result, South Africa withdrew from the Commonwealth on 31 May 1961, the day that the Republic came into existence. In 1960, the UN's conservative stance on apartheid changed. The Sharpeville massacre had jolted the global neighbourhood, with the apartheid regime showing that it would use violent behaviour to repress opposition to racial inequity. Many Western states began to see apartheid as a possible danger to global harmony, as the policy caused much intercontinental abrasion over human-rights violation. In April 1960, the Security Council of the UN settled for the first time on concerted action against the apartheid regime, demanding that the NP bring an end to racial separation and discrimination; but, instead, the South African administration merely employed further suppressive instruments. The ANC and PAC were forbidden from continued existence, and political assemblies were prohibited. From then on, the UN placed the South African issue high on its list of priorities. In 1961, UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskj√∂ld stopped over in South Africa and subsequently stated that he had been powerless to effect a concurrence with Prime Minister Verwoerd. That same year, Verwoerd proclaimed South Africa's extraction from the Commonwealth as a result of its censure of his government. ==Sanctions== On 6 November 1962, the United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution 1761, condemning South African apartheid policies. On 7 August 1963 the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 181 calling for a voluntary arms embargo against South Africa, and that very year, a Special Committee Against Apartheid was established to encourage and oversee plans of action against the regime. In 1966, the United Nations held the first (of many) colloquiums on apartheid. The General Assembly announced 21 March as the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, in memory of the Sharpeville bloodbath. In 1971, the UN General Assembly formally denounced the institution of homelands, and a motion was passed in 1974 to eject South Africa from the UN, but this was discarded by France, Britain and the United States of America, all of them key trade associates of South Africa. One probable type of action against South Africa was economic sanction. If UN affiliates broke fiscal and trading links with the country, it would make it all the trickier for the apartheid government to uphold itself and its policies. Such sanctions were argued frequently within the UN, and many recognised and backed it as an effectual and non-violent way of applying force, but South Africa's major trading partners once more voted against mandatory sanctions. In 1962, the UN General Assembly requested that its members split political, fiscal and transportation connections with South Africa. In 1968, it suggested the deferral of all cultural, didactic and sporting commerce as well. From 1964, the US and Britain discontinued their dealings of armaments to South Africa. In spite of the many cries for sanctions, however, none were made obligatory, because South Africa's main trading partners were again primarily concerned for their own financial security. In 1977, the voluntary UN arms embargo became mandatory with the passing of United Nations Security Council Resolution 418. An oil embargo was introduced on 20 November 1987 when the United Nations General Assembly adopted a voluntary international oil embargo. ==Aid to apartheid casualties== Another way in which the UN could do something to combat apartheid was to lend support and aid to its victims. In 1963, the General Assembly passed a decree requesting that members contribute financially towards assisting apartheid sufferers. ===Lusaka Manifesto=== The Organisation for African Unity (OAU) was created in 1963. Its primary objectives were to eradicate colonialism and improve social, political and economic situations in Africa. It censured apartheid and demanded sanctions against South Africa. African states swore to aid the freedom movements in their fights against apartheid. In April 1969, fourteen autonomous nations from Central and East Africa gathered in Lusaka, Zambia, to argue about various African matters. The assembly formulated the 'Lusaka Manifesto', which was signed on 13 April by all of the countries in attendance, except for Malawi. This manifesto was later taken on by both the OAU and the United Nations. The Lusaka Manifesto summarised the political situations of self-governing African countries, snubbing racism and inequity, and calling for black majority rule in all African nations. It did not rebuff South Africa entirely, though, adopting an appeasing manner towards the apartheid government, and even recognising its autonomy. Although African principals desired the emancipation of black South Africans, they trusted in their abilities to attain this in peaceable ways, intercession instead of militancy. The manifesto's signatories did not want to engage in a military war by supporting the liberation pugilists, because, for one thing, they could ill afford it and, for another, they dreaded retaliation. ===Morogoro Conference=== Neither the ANC nor the PAC was content with the Lusaka Manifesto. The signatories had not checked with them before laying out the document, and they foresaw the fact that African backing for the struggle would taper. The Manifesto did not truly recognise the significance of the liberation groups in the answer to South Africa's problems and even proposed dissuading them from an armed struggle. Both the ANC and the PAC had started using violent means in the 1960s, with the formation of their military wings. Disinclined to destroy the support that they did have, however, the ANC and PAC did not explicitly condemn the Manifesto. In 1969, though, the ANC held the inaugural National Consultative Conference in Morogoro, Tanzania, where it ironed out its troubles and anxieties. The result was a decision not to end the armed struggle but, rather, to advance it. Oliver Tambo summed up thus: \\"Close Ranks! This is the order to our people, our youth, the army, to each Umkhonto we Sizwe militant, to all our many supporters the world over. This is the order to our leaders, to all of us. The order that comes from this conference is 'Close Ranks and Intensify the Armed Struggle!'\\" Unlike the independence factions, the South African administration hailed the Lusaka Manifesto's plans for arbitration and d√©tente. This tied in nicely with Prime Minister Vorster's own plan for the reduction of South Africa's seclusion from the rest of the world. He called his \\"Outward looking\\" policy. The state also maintained that the preservation of separate development through homelands carried out the Manifesto's insistence on human equality and dignity. The homelands, it argued, were meant eventually to be self-governing, decolonised nations where black people could take part in ballots and be free to live how they wished. That is not to say that the NP government agreed to the Lusaka Manifesto, however. It rejected the manifesto's backing of liberation movements, although the movements themselves felt the Manifesto was showing a lack of support. ===Mogadishu Declaration=== South Africa's negative response to the Lusaka Manifesto and rejection of a change to her policies brought about another OAU announcement in 1971. The Mogadishu Declaration declared that South Africa's rebuffing of negotiations meant that her black people could only be freed through fighting, and that no African state should converse with the apartheid government. Henceforth, it would be up to South Africa to keep contact with other African states. However, after the Ogaden War Somalia soon aligned itself with South Africa. Even receiving military aid and volunteers from South Africa to fight the rebels in Somaliland in the mid 1980s. ==Outward-Looking Policy== In 1966, BJ Vorster was made South African Prime Minister. He was not about to eliminate apartheid, but he did try to redress South Africa's seclusion and the purported larger mentality. He wanted to perk up the country's global reputation and overseas dealings, even those with black-ruled nations in Africa. This he called his \\"Outward-Looking\\" policy: South Africa would look outwards, towards the global neighbourhood, rather than adopting a siege mentality and estranging it. The buzzwords for his strategy were \\"dialogue\\" and \\"d√©tente\\", signifying arbitration and reduction of pressure. ===Western ties=== The \\"Outward Looking\\" principle had a significant consequence for South Africa's relationships with Western nations. When Vorster brought forth his strategy, it appeared to them that South Africa might be loosening her grip. At the same time, the West regarded the apartheid administration as a significant friend in the Cold War. Economically, such nations as Britain and America had numerous concerns in South Africa, and, although they did not endorse apartheid, these concerns led them to a more moderate stance on the country and to vote against financial sanctions against her at UN conferences. UK When South Africa pulled out of the Commonwealth in 1961, the United Kingdom led resistance to calls for punitive monetary and trade sanctions. It had many key trade links and, in particular, needed South Africa's gold. There were also strategic motives for not severing all ties with the apartheid government. As the southernmost nation in Africa, and the juncture of the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, South Africa was still a vital point in sea-trade routes. In 1969, the Commandant General of the South African Defence Force (SADF) confirmed that, \\"[i]n the entire ocean expanse from Australia to South America, South Africa is the only fixed point offering modern naval bases, harbours and airfield facilities, a modern developed industry and stable government.\\" South Africa was also a pivotal partner to the West in the years of the Cold War. If the West ever required martial, maritime or air-force services on the African continent, it would have to rely on South Africa's assistance. From 1960 to 1961, the relationship between South Africa and Britain started to change. In his \\"Wind of Change\\" speech in Cape Town, Harold Macmillan spoke of the changes in Africa and how South Africa's racist policies were swimming upstream. Even as more countries added to the call for sanctions, Britain remained unwilling to sever her ties with the apartheid administration. Possible reasons were her copious assets in the state, an unwillingness to hazard turbulence brought on by intercontinental meddling, and the fact that many British people had kith and kin living in South Africa or, indeed, were living there themselves. Along with America, Britain would persistently vote against certain sanctions against South Africa. However, there was significant and notable resistance to apartheid within the United Kingdom, such as the Anti-Apartheid Movement. London Recruits: The Secret War Against Apartheid is a 2012 book documenting assistance given to the ANC from activists in the UK. In 1995, during his official state visit to the UK, Nelson Mandela appeared on the balcony of High Commission of South Africa, London to thank supporters in the UK. The High Commission had been a constant target of protests during apartheid. South Africa rejoined the Commonwealth in 1994, albeit, as a Commonwealth republic and not a realm. US At the outset of apartheid, the United States avoided serious criticism of South Africa's racial policies in part because several U.S. states, especially in the Deep South, had similar policies under the Jim Crow laws. Following the 1960 Sharpeville massacre, however, the country voted at the UN conference against it. The US impressed a severe armament embargo on South Africa from 1964, and, from 1967, the United States Navy avoided South African harbors. Unlike Britain, the USA did not see much importance in the Cape route, but they did see the economic opportunities for South African investment. Imports and exports between the two states came to many millions of dollars. Financial ties aside, there were also numerous cultural links between South Africa and the United States. South Africans of all races were given the chance to study in the US with scholarships. The US even utilised South Africa for her exploration of outer space, setting up a satellite tracking post near Krugersdorp, and building numerous telescopes for lunar probes. This picked up ailing ties between the two countries, but, in the 1970s, the United States withdrew from the tracking station. Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger had adopted a policy known as the Tar Baby Option, according to which the US ought to maintain close relations with the white rulers in South Africa. The Reagan administration evaded international sanctions and provided diplomatic support in international forums for the South African government. The United States also increased trade with the white supremacist South Africa regime, while describing the ANC as \\"a terrorist organisation.\\"Joseba Zulaika and William Douglass, \\"Terror and Taboo\\" (Routledge, 1996), p. 12 The Reagan administration also vetoed the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act, which mandated compliance by the U.S. with the international sanctions and increased distance between the two governments, but Congress in 1986 overruled President Reagan's veto despite some Republican opposition. As fiscal ties between South Africa, the United States and the United Kingdom were reinforced, however, sporting and cultural boycotts became important gadgets in South Africa's isolation from international society. The arms prohibition obliged South Africa to look elsewhere (particularly France) for its artillery, build up its own technology and manufacture weapons itself. At first, the Cold War had little influence on the connection between the West and South Africa: the US believed that the armament embargo would not put up a barrier between them. If a major quarrel broke out in Africa, South Africa would be forced to work with the US anyway. Israel Israel Military Industries Galil assault rifle, manufactured under license in South Africa as the R5 Relations between Israel and the Union of South Africa were established as early as 1948, the Nationalist Prime Minister Daniel Fran√ßois Malan paying a visit to Israel and ignoring the clearly antisemitic profile his own party earned during the 1930s and by its opposition to joining in the Anti-Hitlerite coalition in World War II. In 1963, Israel imposed an arms embargo in compliance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 181, and recalled its ambassador. During this period, Israel contributed an annual $7,000,000 in medical, agricultural, and other aid to Sub-Saharan states. After the 1967 Six-Day War Sub-Saharan African nations cut off diplomatic relations with Israel, and the latter became Pretoria's strategic partner, establishing strong economic and military relations with the 1975 Israel‚ÄìSouth Africa Agreement, which included alleged nuclear collaboration. ===Other African states=== Vorster's attitude towards other African countries was not so much a modification of strategy as a continuance of Verwoerd's approach. Vorster's forerunner had already become aware of the fact that cordial dealings with as many black states as possible was of paramount importance. As more and more African states acquired statehood from their colonial rulers, and as the Portuguese hold over neighboring Mozambique and Angola weakened, bitterness towards the South African apartheid system increased. If South Africa did not wish to become completely cut off from the rest of the African continent, she had to sustain associations with it, starting, of course, with mutual economic support. Vorster persisted with this strategy and built good relationships with a number of independent African states. In 1967, Vorster proffered technological and fiscal counsel gratis to any African state prepared to receive it, asserting that absolutely no political strings were attached. He gave great attention to financial facets, aware of the fact that many African states were very run-down and would require financial aid in spite of their rebuffing of South Africa's racial principles. Malawi and Lesotho were the first countries to enter discussions with the NP government. One of the first steps to take in initiating dealings was to convene with the heads of these African countries. Here Vorster worked decidedly contrary to Verwoerd's policies. Where Verwoerd had declined to get together and engage in dialogue with such leaders as Abubakar Tafawa Balewa of Nigeria in 1962 and Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia in 1964, Vorster, in 1966, met with the heads of the states of Lesotho, Swaziland and Botswana. There was still mutual suspicion, however, particularly after Vorster's denunciation of the Lusaka Manifesto in 1969. Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland stayed candid critics of apartheid, but they hinged on South Africa's economic aid. This was inclusive of pecuniary credit and the fact that many natives from these states worked the South African mines. Malawi was the first country not on South African borders to accept South African aid. She identified the monetary benefits of such a deal, for there were also many Malawians working in South African mines. In 1967, the two states delineated their political and economic relations, and, in 1969, Malawi became the only country at the assembly which did not sign the Lusaka Manifesto. In 1970, Malawian President Hastings Banda made his first and most successful official stopover in South Africa. Associations with Mozambique followed suit and were sustained after that country won its sovereignty in 1975. Angola was also granted South African loans. Other countries which formed relationships with South Africa were Liberia, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Madagascar, Mauritius, Gabon, Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), Ghana and the Central African Republic. These African states criticised apartheid (more than ever after South Africa's denunciation of the Lusaka Manifesto), but fiscal reliance on South Africa, together with fear of her armed potency, resulted in their forming the aforementioned ties. ==Effect of the Soweto Uprising== Following the Soweto Uprising in 1976 and its brutal suppression by the apartheid regime, the arms embargo was made mandatory by the UN Security Council on 4 November 1977 and South Africa became increasingly isolated internationally, with tough economic sanctions weighing heavily. Not all countries imposed or fully supported the sanctions, however; instead, they continued to benefit from trade with apartheid South Africa. During the 1980s, though, the number of countries opposing South Africa increased, and the economy came under tremendous strain. ==Isolation== While some countries and organizations, like the Swiss-South African Association, supported the Apartheid government, most of the international community isolated South Africa. One of the primary means for the international community to show its aversion to apartheid was to boycott South Africa in a variety of spheres of multinational life. Economic and military sanctions were among these, but cultural and sporting boycotts also found their way in. South Africa, in this way, was cut off from the rest of the globe. It also awakened the South African community to the opinions of other countries. Despite financial shunning causing significant harm to black South Africans, the ANC proclaimed it as an essential means of achieving liberty. Cultural and sporting boycotts, on the other hand, did not have a negative effect on the lives of blacks, as they were already barred from these by their own government. Sporting seclusion commenced in the mid-1950s and increased through the 1960s. Apartheid forbade multiracial sport, which meant that overseas teams, by virtue of their having players of diverse races, could not play in South Africa. In 1956, the International Table Tennis Federation severed its ties with the all-white South African Table Tennis Union, preferring the non-racial South African Table Tennis Board in its stead. The apartheid government came back by confiscating the passports of the Board's players so that they were unable to attend international games. Other global sports unions followed the example, but they were sluggish in doing so. In 1959, the non-racial South African Sports Association (SASA) was shaped to secure the rights of all players on the global field. After meeting with no success in its endeavours to attain credit by collaborating with white establishments, SASA went to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1962, calling for South Africa's eviction from the Olympic Games. The IOC sent South Africa a caution to the effect that, if there were no changes, it would be barred from the 1964 games. The changes were initiated, and in January 1963, the South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee (SANROC) was set up. The Anti-Apartheid Movement persisted in its campaign for South Africa's exclusion, and the IOC acceded in barring the country from the 1964 Games in Tokyo. South Africa selected a multi-racial side for the next Games, and the IOC opted to incorporate her in the 1968 Games in Mexico. Because of protests from AAMs and African nations, however, the IOC was forced to retract the invitation, along with one for Rhodesia. Foreign complaints about South Africa's bigoted sports brought more isolation. In 1960, Verwoerd barred a MƒÅori rugby player from touring South Africa with the All Blacks, and the tour was cancelled. New Zealand made a decision not to convey an authorised rugby team to South Africa again. B. J. Vorster took Verwoerd's place as PM in 1966 and declared that South Africa would no longer dictate to other countries what their teams should look like. Although this reopened the gate for sporting meets, it did not signal the end of South Africa's racist sporting policies. In 1968, Vorster went against his policy by refusing to permit Basil D'Oliveira, a Coloured South African-born cricketer, to join the English cricket team on its tour to South Africa. Vorster said that the side had been chosen only to prove a point, and not on merit. After protests, however, \\"Dolly\\" was eventually included in the team; see the D'Oliveira affair. Protests against certain tours brought about the cancellation of a number of other visits, like that of an England rugby team in 1969/70. As sporting segregation persisted, it became obvious that South Africa would have to make further changes to its sporting policies if it was to be recognised on the international stage. More and more careers were impinged upon by segregation, and they began to stand up against apartheid. In 1971, Vorster altered his policies even further by distinguishing multiracial from multinational sport. Multiracial sport, between teams with players of different races, remained outlawed; multinational sport, however, was now acceptable: international sides would not be subject to South Africa's racial stipulations. International censure of segregated sport and calls for sporting sanctions persisted. The UN would continue to hold them against South Africa until the end of apartheid. These measures did not bring an end to international sport for South African teams, but they added very much to the country's seclusion. The bans were revoked in 1993, when conciliations for a democratic South Africa were well under way. In the 1960s, the Anti-Apartheid Movement worldwide began to campaign for cultural boycotts of apartheid South Africa. Artists were requested not to present or let their works be hosted in South Africa. In 1963, 45 British writers put their signatures to an affirmation approving of the boycott, and, in 1964, American actor Marlon Brando called for a similar affirmation for films. In 1965, the Writers' Guild of Great Britain called for a proscription on the sending of films to South Africa. Over sixty American artists signed a statement against apartheid and against professional links with the state. The presentation of some South African plays in Britain and America was also vetoed. After the arrival of television in South Africa in 1975, the British Actors Union, Equity, boycotted the service, and no British program concerning its associates could be sold to South Africa. Sporting and cultural boycotts did not have the same impact as economic sanctions, but they did much to lift consciousness amongst normal South Africans of the global condemnation of apartheid. These facets of social remoteness from the worldwide hamlet made apartheid a discomfiture and were most trying for sports and culture fans. These boycotts effectively egged on little changes to apartheid policy, and corroded white South Africans' dedication to it. Numerous conferences were held and the United Nations passed resolutions condemning South Africa, including the World Conference Against Racism in 1978 and 1983. A significant divestment movement started, pressuring investors to refuse to invest in South African companies or companies that did business with South Africa. South African sports teams were barred from participation in international events, and South African culture and tourism were boycotted. Countries such as Zambia, Tanzania and the Soviet Union provided military support for the ANC and PAC. It was more difficult, though, for neighbouring states such as Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland, because they were economically dependent on South Africa. Still, they did feed the struggle underground. Ordinary people in foreign countries did much in protest against the apartheid government, too. The British Anti-Apartheid Movement was one of these, organising boycotts against South African sports teams, South African products such as wine and fruit, and British companies that traded with or in South Africa. Other organisations were formed to prevent musicians and the like from coming into the country, and others raised funds for the ANC and PAC. After much debate, by the late 1980s the United States, the United Kingdom, and 23 other nations had passed laws placing various trade sanctions on South Africa. A divestment movement in many countries was similarly widespread, with individual cities and provinces around the world implementing various laws and local regulations forbidding registered corporations under their jurisdiction from doing business with South African firms, factories, or banks. In an analysis of the effect of sanctions on South Africa by the FW de Klerk Foundation, it was argued that they were not a leading contributor to the political reforms leading to the end of Apartheid. The analysis concluded that in many instances sanctions undermined effective reform forces, such as the changing economic and social order within South Africa. Furthermore, it was argued that forces encouraging economic growth and development resulted in a more international and liberal outlook amongst South Africans, and were far more powerful agents of reform than sanctions. ==Western influence in anti- apartheid movement== Swedish Prime Minister, Olof Palme rallied international opposition to Apartheid While international opposition to apartheid grew, the Nordic countries in particular provided both moral and financial support for the ANC. On 21 February 1986‚Äì a week before he was murdered‚Äì Sweden's prime minister Olof Palme made the keynote address to the Swedish People's Parliament Against Apartheid held in Stockholm. In addressing the hundreds of anti-apartheid sympathisers as well as leaders and officials from the ANC and the Anti-Apartheid Movement such as Oliver Tambo, Palme said Apartheid needed to be abolished, not reformed. Other Western countries adopted a more ambivalent position. In the 1980s, both the Reagan and Thatcher administrations in the US and UK followed a 'constructive engagement' policy with the apartheid government, vetoing the imposition of UN economic sanctions on South Africa, as they both fiercely believed in free trade and saw South Africa as a bastion against Marxist forces in Southern Africa. Thatcher declared the ANC a terrorist organisation, and in 1987 her spokesman, Bernard Ingham, famously said that anyone who believed that the ANC would ever form the government of South Africa was \\"living in cloud cuckoo land\\". By the late 1980s, however, with the tide of the Cold War turning and no sign of a political resolution in South Africa, Western patience with the apartheid government began to run out. By 1989, a bipartisan Republican/Democratic initiative in the US favoured economic sanctions (realised as the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act), the release of Nelson Mandela and a negotiated settlement involving the ANC. Thatcher too began to take a similar line, but insisted on the suspension of the ANC's armed struggle. ==South West Africa== Separate from the issue of apartheid was a major quarrel between the UN and South Africa about the management of South West Africa. After World War I, all German colonies were made mandates of the League of Nations, the UN's forbearer. Direction of these mandates was allotted to certain countries. The Treaty of Versailles declared German West Africa a League of Nations Mandate under South African administration, and it then became known as South West Africa.Carroll Faye; South West Africa and the United Nations, p. 115 Walvis Bay was annexed by Britain in 1878 and incorporated into the Cape Colony in 1884.Statesman's Year-Book 1993 It thus became part of the Union of South Africa in 1910. In 1915 the Union occupied German South West Africa at the request of the Allied powers. South Africa was granted a \\"C\\" Class mandate by the League of Nations to administer this former German colony as an integral part of South Africa. The South African government transferred administration of Walvis Bay to South West Africa in 1922 but would in 1977 transfer it back to Cape Province. After the configuration of the UN in 1945, and the transfer of mandates from the League of Nations to the new body, the arrangement changed: former obligatory powers (vis-√†-vis those in charge of ex-German colonies) were now obliged to form new concurrences with the U.N. over their management of the mandates. South Africa, however, refused to play ball, declining to allow the territory to move towards independence.Borstelmann; Apartheid's Reluctant Uncle, p. 78 The National Party government argued that, for a quarter of a century, South-West Africa had been directed as a piece of South Africa,Potholm, Christian P. and Dale, Richard; Southern Africa in Perspective: Essays in Regional Politics, p. 134. Published 1972 by Free Press and the preponderance of South-West Africans wanted to become South Africans anyway. Instead, South-West Africa was treated as a de facto \\"fifth province\\" of the Union.Eschen, Penny M. von; Race against Empire: Black Americans and Anticolonialism, 1937-1957, p. 92 The South African government turned this mandate arrangement into a military occupation, and extended apartheid to South-West Africa.Mwakikagile, Godfrey; Namibia: Conquest to Independence: Formation of a Nation, pp 87-88 The UN attempted to compel South Africa to let go of the mandate, and, in 1960, Liberia and Ethiopia requested that the International Court of Justice announce that South Africa's management of South West Africa was illegitimate. They argued that South Africa was bringing apartheid to South-West Africa, too. South Africa was formally accused of maladministration, and the lawsuit, commencing in November 1960, lasted almost six years. The International Court's verdict astonished the UN: it ruled that Liberia and Ethiopia had no right to take issue with South Africa's deeds in South-West Africa. The Court did not, however, pass judgement on whether or not South Africa still had a mandate over the region. The UN declared that the mandate was indeed concluded, and a council of the UN was to run the state until its independence in 1968. South Africa rebuffed the resolution, but declared its ostensible intention to ready South-West Africa for independence. Anxiety increased when the UN Council for South-West Africa was declined admission, and steepened still further when South Africa indicted 35 South- West Africans and then found them guilty of terror campaigns. The UN reproached South Africa and declared that South-West Africa would thenceforth be known as Namibia. At the New York Accords in 1988, South Africa finally signed the agreement that granted the country its independence. The UN allowed the South African government back in 1994, however the South African government had to first show that they had undertaken certain measures to get rid of the racial judgement. Soon after the South African government created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was supposed to aid the transition from Apartheid to Democracy. ==Border War== By 1966, SWAPO launched guerilla raids from neighbouring countries against South Africa's occupation of South-West Africa/Namibia. Initially South Africa fought a counter- insurgency war against SWAPO. But this conflict deepened after Angola gained its independence in 1975 under Communist leadership, the MPLA, and South Africa promptly challenged them, allying with the Angolan rival party, UNITA. By the end of the 1970s, Cuba had joined the fray, in one of several late Cold War flashpoints throughout Southern Africa. This developed into a conventional war between South Africa and UNITA on one side against the Angolan government, the Cubans, the Soviets and SWAPO on the other side. ===Total onslaught=== By 1980, as international opinion turned decisively against the apartheid regime, the government and much of the white population increasingly looked upon the country as a bastion besieged by communism and radical black nationalists. Considerable effort was put into circumventing sanctions, and the government even went so far as to develop nuclear weapons, allegedly with the help of Israel. South Africa is the only country to date to have developed and voluntarily relinquished a nuclear arsenal. Negotiating majority rule with the ANC was not considered an option (at least publicly), and it left the government to defend the country against external and internal threats through sheer military might. A siege mentality developed among whites, and, although many believed that a civil war against the black majority could not possibly be won, they preferred this to \\"giving in\\" to political reform. Brutal police and military actions seemed entirely justifiable. Paradoxically, the international sanctions that cut whites off from the rest of the world enabled black leaders to develop sophisticated political skills as those in exile forged ties with both regional and world leaders. P. W. Botha initiated a policy of \\"Total Onslaught, Total Strategy\\", whereby reform was mixed with repression. With big businesses (affected by apartheid policies) ardently desirous of change, the government established two important commissions of enquiry. The Riekert Commission concluded that blacks ought to be allowed to buy their own homes in urban areas, while the Wiehahn Commission dictated that black trade unions be given more freedom, more money be spent on black education and some apartheid legislation be abolished. The Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act was repealed, while the pass laws and employment colour bar were relaxed. Fewer people were arrested for offences pertaining to the latter as segregation in everyday life was gradually lessened. The government also gave so-called \\"independence\\" to a number of the homelands, but this seems to have been in part due to the fact that, as foreign citizens, their people could no longer expect anything from the South African government. Indeed, none of these reforms lessened the power of the white minority. The term \\"front-line states\\" referred to countries in Southern Africa geographically near South Africa. Although these front-line states were all opposed to apartheid, many were economically dependent on South Africa. In 1980, they formed the Southern African Development Coordination Conference (SADCC), the aim of which was to promote economic development in the region and hence reduce dependence on South Africa. Furthermore, many SADCC members also allowed the exiled ANC and PAC to establish bases in their countries. Other African countries also contributed to the fall of apartheid. In 1978, Nigeria boycotted the Commonwealth Games because New Zealand's sporting contacts with the South African government were not considered to be in accordance with the 1977 Gleneagles Agreement. Nigeria also led the 32-nation boycott of the 1986 Commonwealth Games because of British prime minister Margaret Thatcher's ambivalent attitude towards sporting links with South Africa, significantly affecting the quality and profitability of the Games and thus thrusting apartheid into the international spotlight. ==Cross-border raids== South Africa had a policy to attack terrorist bases in neighbouring countries. These attacks were mainly aimed at ANC, PAC and SWAPO guerrilla- bases and safe houses in retaliation for acts of terror ‚Äì like bomb explosions, massacres and guerrilla actions (like sabotage) by ANC, PAC and Swapo guerrillas in South Africa and Namibia. The country also aided organisations in surrounding countries who were actively combatting the spread of communism in Southern Africa. The results of these policies included: *Support for anti-government guerrilla groups such as UNITA in Angola and RENAMO in Mozambique *South African Defence Force (SADF; now the South African National Defence Force; SANDF) hit-squad raids into front-line states. Bombing raids were also conducted into neighbouring states. *A full-scale invasion of Angola: this was partly in support of UNITA, but was also an attempt to strike at SWAPO bases. *Attacks in other frontline states: including Botswana and Zambia, condemned in Security Council resolutions. *Targeting of exiled ANC leaders abroad: Joe Slovo's wife Ruth First was killed by a parcel bomb in Maputo, and 'death squads' of the Civil Co-operation Bureau and the Directorate of Military Intelligence attempted to carry out assassinations on ANC targets in Brussels, Paris and Stockholm, as well as burglaries and bombings in London. In 1984, Mozambican president Samora Machel signed the Nkomati Accord with South Africa's president P.W. Botha, in an attempt to rebuild Mozambique's economy. South Africa agreed to cease supporting anti- government forces, while the MK was prohibited from operating in Mozambique. This was an awful setback for the ANC. In 1986 President Machel himself was killed in an air crash in mountainous terrain near the South African border after returning from a meeting in Zambia. South Africa was accused of continuing its aid to RENAMO and having caused the crash using a new advanced electronic beacon capable of luring aircraft into crashing. This was never proven and is still a subject of great controversy. The South African Margo Commission found that the crash was an accident while a Soviet delegation issued a minority report implicating South Africa. ==See also== *Military history of South Africa *South Africa under apartheid ==References== Category:International opposition to apartheid in South Africa Category:Foreign relations of the Commonwealth of Nations Apartheid Category:South Africa and the Commonwealth of Nations ","title":"Foreign relations of South Africa during apartheid"},{"id":"20561972","text":"Dentalium is a large genus of tooth shells or tusk shells, marine scaphopod molluscs in the family Dentaliidae. The genus contains 50 described species and about 50 extinct species. MolluscaBase eds. (2020). MolluscaBase. Dentalium Linnaeus, 1758. Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at: http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=137886 on 2020-10-19 ==Etymology== The scientific name of this genus comes from the Latin word dentis, meaning tooth, based on the tooth or tusk-shaped form of these molluscs. ==Description== The mantle of Dentalium species is entirely within the shell. The foot extends from the larger end of the shell, and is used to burrow through the substrate. They position their head down in the substrate, with the apical end of the shell (at the rear of the animal's body) projecting up into the water. These molluscs live on seafloor sediment, feeding on microscopic organisms, detritus and foraminiferans. The shells are conical and curved in a planispiral way, and they are usually whitish in color. Because of these characteristics, the shell somewhat resembles a miniature elephant's tusk. They are hollow and open at both ends; the opening at the larger end is the main or anterior aperture of the shell. The smaller opening is known as the apical aperture. ==Human useSouth Asia=== At Mehrgarh, a village located at the foot of the Bolan Pass in Balochistan in modern-day Pakistan, ornaments made of Dentalium shell have been found at burial sites dating back to 6000 BCE. Excavations conducted by Jean-Fran√ßois Jarrige have described 'Exceptional grave deposits of Dentalium headbands found on the heads of several females...In Burial 274, the headband was made of woven rows of small dentalium and closed by two straps used as a clasp'. ===Native Americans=== The shells of Dentalium neohexagonum are known to have been used by the Chumash people as a form of currency at least as early as circa 1000 AD, in the Morro Bay area.Hogan, 2008 ===18th-century European use=== In pre-modern medicine, these shells were considered an excellent alkali, and apothecaries would pulverize them for use in several preparations. The shell used for this purpose was described by Joseph Pitton de Tournefort in London in the 18th century as being \\"of a tubular, or conical form, about 3 inches long; of a shining, greenish white; hollow; light, and divided lengthwise by parallel lines, running from top to bottom. It is about the thickness of a feather, and bears some resemblance to a canine tooth.\\" However, it was considered at that time to be very rare, and in lieu of that, another shell was usually substituted. This was described as a multi-colored shell found in the sand where the tide had fallen; this shell was not channeled, or fluted. The large green shell to which the writer first refers must have been either Dentalium elephantinum or Dentalium aprinum, both of which are large and greenish, and live in the Indo-Pacific zone. The other shell was presumably another species, possibly Dentalium entale, which is native to Great Britain. ==Species== Species within the genus Dentalium include:Catalogue of lifeITISAnimal Diversity * Dentalium aciculum Gould, 1859 * Dentalium adenense Ludbrook, 1954 * Dentalium agassizi Pilsbry and Sharp, 1897 Stained tuskshell * Dentalium americanum Chenu, 1843 American tuskshell * Dentalium antillarum D'Orbigny, 1842 * Dentalium aprinum Linnaeus, 1766 * Dentalium bartletti Henderson, 1920 * Dentalium calamus Dall, 1889 * Dentalium callipeplum Dall, 1889 * Dentalium callithrix Dall, 1889 * Dentalium carduum Dall, 1889 * Dentalium ceratum (Dall, 1881) * Dentalium circumcinctum Watson, 1879 * Dentalium cheverti Sharp & Pilsbry, 1897 * Dentalium clavus A.

He played for the Greek national team from 2011 to 2016. ==Early years== Holebas was born in Aschaffenburg, Bavaria, West Germany, to a Greek father, Achilles, from Vasiliki, Trikala, and an American-German mother, Lowis. Achilles left the family not long after he was born and Jos√© was raised only by his mother and her family. ==Club careerEarly years=== Holebas' first club was local youth team S√ºdring, which he joined in 1992 when he was eight. He played at non-professional youth football teams in German football which included playing for S√ºdring, FC Kleinwallstadt and TSV Teutonia Obernau until 2001, when his girlfriend got pregnant and Jos√©, at age 18, decided to temporarily give up football. He had to work the double shift as a warehouse assistant in order to financially support his family. A year later, in 2002 and with the guidance of his German-American uncle, Alfonso, whom Holebas described as his \\"second father\\" and \\"who gave me the kicks I needed to get my life back on track,\\" helped him begin playing football again. He played for local youth side Aschaffenburg-Damm from 2002 to 2005. ===Viktoria Kahl=== In 2005, Holebas was signed by German 6th-tier Landesliga Bayern-Nordwest club FC Viktoria Kahl. Under manager Antonio Abbruzzese, he played as a striker and scored 15 goals in 33 appearances and finished among Landesliga's top scorers. 1860 Munich scouts approached him and Holebas joined their club in the summer of 2006. ===1860 Munich=== Holebas training with 1860 Munich in 2009 In his first season in Munich, Holebas was in 1860's second team, where, at 22 years of age, he was considered \\"too old\\" by the club's youth academy coach, Ernst Tanner. Holebas officially made his debut for 1860 Munich II on 5 August 2006 in a Regionalliga S√ºd game against 1899 Hoffenheim. A year later, in the summer of 2007, Holebas signed his first professional contract with the first team. He made his professional debut for the \\"Munich Lions\\" on 21 September 2007 at 23 years of age against St. Pauli, in a 2. Bundesliga game. Holebas accumulated three years of professional football experience in the German second tier with 1860 Munich, with the side finishing 11th in 2007‚Äì08, 12th in 2008‚Äì09 (while also dropping back to 1860 Munich II for a number of games) and 8th in 2009‚Äì10. In the summer of 2009, new coach Ewald Lienen, advised 25-year-old Holebas to stay back and play as a defending left-winger. Holebas finished his five-season stint in Germany with both Viktoria Kahl and 1860 Munich, scoring a total of 34 goals in 154 games in all competitions. Despite initially disliking the club as a child due to being a childhood fan of 1860's fierce cross-city Munich rivals Bayern, Holebas stated his changed opinion of the club that gave him his breakthrough in professional football, stating, \\"I'll forever be grateful to 1860 Munich.\\" ===Olympiacos=== 2010‚Äì11 season Ewald Lienen left 1860 Munich to become the coach of Superleague Greece club Olympiacos. Lienen signed Holebas for a transfer fee of ‚Ç¨500,000. Holebas stated in an interview, \\"My father is Greek, but this is only the second time that I have come back to the country. When I was [here] first here, I was very young and do not remember many things, but I must say that I am very happy to play in the old country.\\" On 15 July 2010, Holebas made his debut for Olympiacos in a 5‚Äì0 away victory over Albanian club Besa Kavaj√´ in the first leg of a Europa League second qualifying round tie. On 5 August, Olympiacos were knocked out of the UEFA Europa League by Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv, on the away goals rule and after a 2‚Äì2 draw. Olympiacos sacked Lienen; the new coach, Ernesto Valverde, began to use Holebas both as a defending and an attacking left winger, depending on Olympiacos' opponent. Holebas scored his first goal for the club on 20 March 2011 in a 6‚Äì0 home league win over AEK Athens, which sealed the club's 38th Greek championship title. 2011‚Äì12 season On 19 October 2011, Holebas opened the score with a header against Borussia Dortmund in a 3‚Äì1 home victory on matchday 3 of the Champions League group stage. On 3 March 2012, Holebas scored his second goal of the season in a 2‚Äì0 away league victory over OFI Crete, a goal that won the Superleague goal of the week award.OŒ¶Œó-ŒüŒªœÖŒºœÄŒπŒ±Œ∫œåœÇ 0‚Äì2 On 11 March, the next week, Holebas scored Olympiacos' second goal from the penalty spot in a 3‚Äì0 league away win over Aris. Olympiacos went on to retain their league title for their second season in a row, winning their 39th Greek Championship title. On 28 April, Holebas started the Greek Cup Final against Atromitos, where he missed a penalty kick in the first-half. Nonetheless, Olympiacos went on to win the Cup 2‚Äì1 after extra time, at the Athens Olympic Stadium. Holebas in the 2011‚Äì12 season scored 3 goals in 35 games in all competitions. 2012‚Äì13 season On 23 September 2012, Holebas netted his first goal of the season by scoring Olympiacos' second goal in a 4‚Äì1 home league win over Panthrakikos. On 7 October, Holebas scored his second goal of the season by netting Olympiacos' first and only goal of the game in a 1‚Äì0 league home win over Asteras Tripoli. The next week, Holebas scored his third goal of the season by scoring the second goal in a 4‚Äì0 home league win over Skoda Xanthi. On 29 October, Holebas scored his fourth goal of the season by scoring Olympiacos' second goal and second equalizer in a 2‚Äì2 away league draw against Aris. Olympiacos went on to retain their league title for a third season in a row, their 40th Greek Championship title. On 11 May 2013, Holebas started and played in the Greek Cup final, where Olympiacos went on to retain the cup for a second season in a row with a 3‚Äì1 victory after extra time over Asteras Tripoli with goals from David Fuster, Rafik Djebbour and Djamel Abdoun at the Athens Olympic Stadium.Œ§Œø Œ∫œçœÄŒµŒªŒªŒø œÉœÑŒøŒΩ ŒüŒªœÖŒºœÄŒπŒ±Œ∫œå, ŒøœÅŒ≥ŒÆ œÉœÑŒøŒΩ ŒëœÉœÑŒ≠œÅŒ± Œ≥ŒπŒ± œÑŒ∑ Œ¥ŒπŒ±ŒπœÑŒ∑œÉŒØŒ± Holebas the 2012‚Äì13 season scoring four goals in 40 games in all competitions, winning another league and cup double. 2013‚Äì14 season In the summer of 2013, there were rumours that Holebas would join Turkish club Be≈üikta≈ü, according to the Turkish media, which reported that he had agreed to sign a deal with the Black Eagles. The Turks reportedly offered the 29-year-old defender a three- year contract, with an annual salary reaching ‚Ç¨750,000, a significant pay rise than what he was being paid by Olympiacos. The deal, however, was not completed, and Holebas decided to stay in Piraeus, subsequently signing a contract extension lasting until 2017. On 27 October 2013, Holebas scored his first goal of the season by netting Olympiacos's third goal with a wonderful free-kick in a 5‚Äì1 league home win over OFI Crete. On 18 January 2014, he scored his second goal of the season by netting their second goal in a 2‚Äì0 home league win over Levadiakos. Olympiacos went on to retain their league title again for a fourth season in a row by winning their 41st Greek championship. He finished the 2013‚Äì14 campaign scoring two goals in 29 games in all competitions and winning another League title. Holebas finished his very successful four-season stint with Olympiacos by netting ten toal goals in 135 games in all competitions, and also by winning the Superleague Greece four times in 2010‚Äì11, 2011‚Äì12, 2012‚Äì13 and 2013‚Äì14; the Greek Cup twice and in a row in 2011‚Äì12 and 2012‚Äì13; and participating in both the Champions League and Europa League. ===Roma=== On 30 August 2014, Holebas joined Serie A club Roma for a ‚Ç¨1 million transfer fee from Olympiacos, plus ‚Ç¨500,000 in bonuses. He signed a three-year contract. After being presented to the media in Rome by Roma CEO Italo Zanzi, Holebas stated why he joined Roma in a press conference: \\"I had other offers, but I decided on Roma because they are a great club at a European level. Was I expecting this move? I had discussions, it was a difficult situation because I was at the World Cup, but I am happy to be here because this is a great club. My preferred position? Certainly I will do my best. I am a left-back, playing in an attacking manner. I can also play at centre-back, but the Coach will decide.\\" On 24 September 2014, Holebas made his debut for the club, by playing the full 90 minutes in a 2‚Äì1 away league victory over Parma in their fourth match of the 2014‚Äì15 Serie A. On 30 November, Holebas scored his first goal for Roma in an important 4‚Äì2 home victory over Internazionale in their 13th match of Serie A to stay in touch with the top of the table. He finished his 2014‚Äì15 season scoring one goal in 34 games in all competitions, whilst keeping veteran English international left back Ashley Cole out of the team for much of the season. For the second season in a row, Roma finished runners-up to league champions Juventus, marking for the first time since the 2009‚Äì10 season that Holebas did not win any piece of silverware. Transfer speculation and controversy On 25 June 2015, it was reported that recently promoted Premier League club Watford were close to securing a deal for Holebas after the side confirmed interest by contacting the Italians and admiring the player's profile; they allegedly offered between ‚Ç¨2‚Äì3 million for his services. At that point, there was a summit at Trigoria between Roma Sporting Director Walter Sabatini and the entire staff, including head coach Rudi Garcia and Simone Beccaccioli. Talks between the two clubs continued, where it was growing likely that the deal would officially be announced the following Monday. Fabio Parisi, Holebas' agent, spoke to VoceGiallorossa about the situation: \\"Nothing is done. There is confirmation of Watford‚Äôs interest, but there is absolutely nothing done. For now, the player's will is to have a holiday.\\" On 2 July, Watford officially announced the signing of the Greek international from Roma, which Holebas denied when he found out 24 hours later after the announcement, claiming he did not know anything about it. He later stated in an interview, \\"They arranged my transfer without asking me. I haven't signed anything yet, I have to see the contract first. I don't know why this has happened, I know that both Roma and Watford announced my transfer, but they'd have to talk to my representatives first. I never said I wanted to leave Roma. I'll sign after first agreeing to the terms of the contract. I can't understand why this has happened, I came back from my holiday in Dubai and everyone started telling me my transfer had been officially announced. I'm in Germany right now, how could I sign a contract?\\" Following that claim, and after days of confusion and wondering if Holebas was going to either continue his contact and talks with Watford and eventually sign for them, or if he was going to turn his back on Watford's offer to stay committed to the three-year deal he signed at Roma a year earlier, it was reported that on 5 July that Holebas had decided to revive his contact and discussions with Watford. ===Watford=== Watford eventually officially completed the signing of Holebas for an initial fee of ¬£1.8 million, which Roma confirmed. On 8 August 2015, he made his debut for the club, playing the full 90 minutes in a 2‚Äì2 away league draw against Everton in their opening 2015‚Äì16 Premier League match and Watford's return to the top division. He picked up a yellow card in the match. Playing just three games in all competitions in the first two-and-a-half months of the season, he struggled to secure a first place spot in the Watford side, sitting third in the pecking order behind Nathan Ak√© and Ikechi Anya for the starting left-back spot. As a result, rumours circulated that he could be off-loaded already in the January transfer window. After three months of not playing, Holebas returned to the side on 26 December to play the full 90 minutes in a 2‚Äì2 league draw away against reigning league champions Chelsea, picking up a yellow card. On 7 January 2016, reports surfaced that French Ligue 1 giants Marseille were keen on signing Holebas, and that their head coach M√≠chel was seeking to rekindle the relationship that he and Holebas formed whilst working together for a season-and-a-half at Olympiacos. On 1 March, Holebas complained on social media after being dropped for Ak√© in a game against Bournemouth. On 24 March 2016, radio station Radyospor reported that Holebas had been offered to Turkish giants Fenerbah√ße, as a potential replacement for Caner Erkin if the latter left at the end of the season. However, Holebas remained at the club, and on 9 April 2016, he thought he had scored his first goal with a header just before the break in a 1‚Äì1 home draw against Everton, helping the club end a poor run of four consecutive league defeats. It was later given as a Seamus Coleman own goal. On 10 September 2016, Holebas scored his first goal for the club in a 4‚Äì2 comeback victory at West Ham United. On 16 October, he scored the only goal of an away win against Middlesbrough. In January 2018, Holebas signed a new deal to keep him at Vicarage Road until the summer of 2020. On 26 August 2018, Holebas scored to give his club a two-goal lead in a 2‚Äì1 victory over Crystal Palace, his first goal of the 2018‚Äì19 season. On 2 September 2018, Holebas helped his club to maintain their perfect start to the Premier League season, setting up goals for Troy Deeney and Craig Cathcart in a 2‚Äì1 home win against Tottenham. On 10 November 2018, he scored his second goal of the season in a 1‚Äì1 away draw against Southampton. On 15 December 2018, he curled in a left-footed strike from the edge of the box to give Watford a two-goal lead in a 3‚Äì2 win against Cardiff. On 12 May 2019, in the last matchday of the season and his 100th match in Premier League, West Ham's winger Michail Antonio causing the problems, outpacing the Greek left back onto Felipe Anderson's through ball, and the former Greek international tugs him back receiving a straight red card, that will keep him away of the FA Cup final, in a hammering 4-1 home loss against West Ham, but a day later Holebas will be available for the FA Cup final against Manchester City after his red card was rescinded. He started the 2019‚Äì20 season as a key figure of the club's defence. On 7 December 2019, Jose Holebas has ruled himself out of this game with an ankle injury, and his rehabilitation process is under examination. He returned to the squad as a substitute in a 2‚Äì1 home win against Wolverhampton. He left Watford at the end of the season as he found playing time hard to come by and admitted in a statement that he felt \\"left out\\". ===Return to Olympiacos=== On 18 August 2020, Holebas rejoined Olympiacos. Holebas was available as a free agent after leaving Watford at the end of the 2019‚Äì20 Premier League campaign. The vastly experienced left-back, now 36 years of age, has been signed as a replacement for Konstantinos Tsimikas who recently joined Liverpool and in overall he participated in 114 Premier League games, contributing with six goals and 14 assists. ==International career== Austria in August 2013 Holebas being born in West Germany was eligible to represent Germany and through his Greek-German American heritage was also eligible to represent Greece or United States in international football. He never appeared for any of the countries at youth level. In an interview about his International ambitions with a Greek reporter, he stated, \\"My dream growing up was to play for Germany, but my father is Greek so I would be happy to play for Greece.\\" In November 2011, he received Greek citizenship as \\"Iosif Cholevas,\\" and on the 11th of the same month, he officially made his debut for Greece in a friendly match against Russia, which ended in a 1‚Äì1 draw at the Georgios Karaiskakis Stadium in Piraeus. Holebas playing for Greece against Austria in 2013 In 2012, Holebas was part of Greece's 23-man squad for the UEFA Euro 2012 finals held in Poland and Ukraine. He started the first two group games against Poland in a 1‚Äì1 draw and against Czech Republic in a 2‚Äì1 loss and was dropped for the third match due to heavy criticism that his attacking tendency was becoming hazardous to the usually-solid defensive tactics of Greece. Nonetheless, he did come on for the final 30 minutes of the match, playing admirably and assisting Greece in holding on to the 1‚Äì0 win against Russia, which took them to the quarter- finals. Here, however, Greece fell to Germany by a score of 4‚Äì2, a defeat in which Holebas picked up a suspension for receiving another yellow card after his previous booking in the game against Russia. Holebas scored his first international goal for Greece in a 1‚Äì0 victory against the Republic of Ireland in November 2012, a friendly match played at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin. Holebas' impressive 2013‚Äì14 season with Olympiacos prompted his nomination from Greek manager Fernando Santos as a part of the final 23-man squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. He played in all of Greece's matches, which included a 3‚Äì0 loss to Colombia, a 0‚Äì0 draw with Japan, a 2‚Äì1 victory over Ivory Coast in the Group Stages, and the 1‚Äì1 (5‚Äì3 penalty shoot-out) defeat to Costa Rica in the last 16, during which he converted his penalty kick. On 27 March 2015, two days before the crucial Euro 2016 qualifier for Greece against Hungary, media reports claimed that Holebas had trained normally with his Roma squad after departing from Austria on Tuesday. \\"On Monday Jos√© underwent a radiographic examination of which it was diagnosed that he was suffering from a left rib case injury. The player trained in Austria under an individual program but was not fit to be available to play against Hungary,\\" the Hellenic Football Federation (HFF) said in an announcement. The HFF added that reports out of Italy cited by the Greek media \\"lead to completely erroneous conclusions in regards to the willingness of the player to contribute to his commitments with the national team any further.\\" This was probably the cause for the non-call-up of the player for the national team, creating tension with new Greek sporting director and former national team teammate Georgios Karagounis. On 4 September 2015, Holebas returned to the national side after being picked by caretaker coach Kostas Tsanas, where he appeared for Greece for the first time in 12 months in Greece's 0‚Äì1 home defeat against Finland in a Euro 2016 qualifier in Piraeus. The defeat officially ended Greece's hopes of qualification to the final tournament in France in a poor overall qualifying campaign for Greece. In 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification, Holebas played his 38th and last ever cap for Greece when he came on as a second-half substitute in the Greek 2‚Äì0 home win over Cyprus on 7 October 2016 in Piraeus. Then on 10 October 2016, after a 2‚Äì0 away win against Estonia, Holebas officially announced his decision to retire from International football because he feels that it is time for the younger footballers of Greece to step up and become Greek international regulars. However on 1 September 2017, Holebas admitted he had left the Greek national team due to his dislike of national team coach Michael Skibbe.http://www.contra.gr/Soccer/Hellas/National-Greece/o-xolempas-adeiase- skimpe-gia-tis-epiloges-paiktwn-sthn-ethnikh.4747512.html ==Personal life== At the age of 18, Holebas became father to daughter Tanisha. In 2011, Holebas married Diana J√§ger, a German woman who also hails from Aschaffenburg. Holebas speaks German and English fluently and although he does not speak much Greek, he understands it. He is a Roman Catholic Christian. ==Career statisticsClub=== {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - !rowspan=2Club !rowspan=2Season !colspan=3League!!colspan=2Cup!!colspan=2League Cup!!colspan=2Continental !! colspan=\\"2\\" Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=31860 Munich II2006‚Äì07 rowspan=\\"2\\" Regionalliga S√ºd321200 colspan=\\"2\\" ‚Äî003212 - 2007‚Äì0811000 colspan=\\"2\\" ‚Äî00110 - !colspan=2Total!!43!!12!!0!!0!! colspan=\\"2\\" ‚Äî!!0!!0!!43!!12 - rowspan=41860 Munich2007‚Äì08 rowspan=\\"3\\" 2.

Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, and Dwight D. Eisenhower (as well as one-time head football coach of Cumberland University's football team in their lopsided match against Georgia Tech.) ==Background== George Edward Allen was born on February 29, 1896, in Booneville, Mississippi.Who's Who in America, Volume 24, 1946-1947 (1946). Chicago: A. N. Marquis Company He earned a law degree (LLB) at Cumberland University in Tennessee. In 1939, he earned an LLD. ==CareerCoaching=== Cumberland College coach (circa 1916) In 1916, Allen served as head football coach for Cumberland College Bulldogs in Lebanon, Tennessee, for one game, during which his alma mater Cumberland University suffered the greatest loss in the history of college football to Georgia Tech by a score of 222 to 0. > A favorite is his account of the Georgia Tech-Cumberland U. football game in > 1916. Cumberland's fullback and captain, George Allen himself, made the best > run of the game for his hard pressed side: \\"I only lost six yards.\\" He would > have made one beautiful punt if his own center had not blocked it with the > back of his neck. George recalls: \\"I once dropped the ball and yelled at > another fellow: 'Pick it up.' He yelled back at me, 'Pick it up yourself, > you dropped it.'\\" The score: Tech, 222; Cumberland, 0. Cumberland had actually discontinued its football program before the season but was not allowed to cancel its game against the Engineers. Georgia Tech coach John Heisman insisted on the schools' scheduling agreement, which required Cumberland to pay $3,000 (considered a sizeable sum in 1916 and roughly equivalent to $70,000 currently) to Tech if its football team failed to show. George Allen (who was elected to serve as Cumberland's football team student manager after first serving as the baseball team student manager), also a Kappa Sigma Fraternity member, put together a scrub team of 14 men to travel to Atlanta as Cumberland's football team and were soundly beaten 222 to 0, saving the college $3,000 in the process. Cumberland would not play football again until 1920. Head coaching record (football): ===WWI=== During World War I, Allen \\"wangled himself a commission\\" in the US Army. ===Law and business=== Allen later practiced law in Mississippi and Indiana, afterwards engaging in various business ventures. In the 1920s he managed hotel properties in Washington, D.C. (including the Wardman Park Hotel) eventually drifting into politics and serving President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Democratic Party. ===Politics=== USS Williamsburg with President Truman (1946) Allen \\"wangled himself\\" onto the Board of Commissioners for the District of Columbia (1933-8, 1939‚Äì40) and treasurer and then secretary of the Democratic National Committee. In 1943, he served as chairman of the Democratic National Committee. On behalf of the Red Cross, Allen made a number of trips to England and Europe where, in the 1940s, he and Dwight D. Eisenhower developed a friendship that grew over the ensuing years. Allen also served as a director of the War Damage Corporation, a government effort to provide insurance against war-related damage.U. S. Government Manual, 1942?, p. 403 In 1944, he \\"latched onto\\" Harry S. Truman, helped him secure candidacy as vice president, drafted his convention speech, and served as manager of his vice-presidential campaign. When FDR died in April 1945, Allen flew to Washington directly and helped draft the three speeches that Truman would deliver and oversaw Truman's transition into the presidency. Allen \\"managed the ticklish task of easing\\" Secretary of State Stettinius out in favor of James Byrnes. He helped the Truman administration in liquidating government war agencies. In 1946, he accepted an appointment as a director of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, where he served through 1947. In accepting, he was carefully to avoid conflict of interest by dropping insurance directorships. Allen appeared on the cover of Time magazine on August 12, 1946, and was a subject of the cover story \\"The Regular Guys.\\" On July 2, 1948, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that Allen would undertake to ask General Eisenhower for a \\"Sherman-like pronouncement that he would not run if nominated at the Democratic convention and would serve if elected\\" in the November 1948 US presidential elections. \\"This effort will be made with the 'full knowledge and acquiescence' of the President and his so-called 'Kitchen Cabinet' of political strategists.\\" ===Business, law, and political circles=== Home Insurance Building (built 1885 in Chicago), headquarters of the Home Insurance Company, which Allen helped save from scandal Although Allen left government service with the end of the Truman administration, Allen remained in the public eye as a friend of President Eisenhower, a prominent member of \\"Ike's millionaires\\", a group of businessmen who socialized with Eisenhower in various leisure activities. Allen had a home in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania near Eisenhower's residence, and in 1959 Eisenhower stayed at Allen's home in La Quinta, California.https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/24/archives/george-allen- presidents-crony-dies.html The New York Times, \\"George Allen, Presidents' Crony Dies\\", April 24, 1973 From 1947 to his death in 1973, Allen was an executive with several business corporations including AVCO, Inc. During the Eisenhower administration, he was part of a group known as \\"Ike's millionaires.\\" By 1964, he held numerous corporate directorships. He was also an associate of the Washington, DC-based law firm of Alvord and Alvord (whose members included Jess Larson). Time attributed Allen's success to his good humor: \\"George's job was Good Relations... George was a fixer and a puller of wires.\\" He became vice president of the Home Insurance Company to help solve a fire insurance scandal. Numerous companies put him on their boards, including Victor Emanuel's Aviation Corp. and Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corp., Tom Girdler's Republic Steel, General Aniline and Film Corp. ==Personal life and death== In 1930, Allen married Mary Keane. They were living in the Wardman Park Hotel in the 1940s. The press called Allen many names in his time, including: court jester, fat man, roly-poly, and clown. \\"He never seems to run out of funny things to say‚Äîscrupulously never tells anything off-color.\\" The press referred to Truman's close advisers as his \\"gang,\\" prompters, and Kitchen Cabinet. In August 1946, Time magazine named his top four advisers as: \\"The Professor\\" John Roy Steelman, \\"The Lawyer\\" Clark McAdams Clifford, \\"The Banker\\" John Wesley Snyder, and Allen. George E. Allen died age 77 on April 23, 1973, of a heart attack in Palm Desert, California. ==Legacy== The public library in Allen's home town of Booneville, Mississippi, is named the George E. Allen Library in his honor, and a major street is named \\"George E. Allen Drive\\". According to the Eisenhower Library: > Though lawyer, businessman, and public servant, Allen was foremost known as > a raconteur. This, along with mutual interests in golf, bridge, and farming > probably formed the basis of the friendship between Allen and Eisenhower. > The relationship was largely social and according to Eisenhower associates > it was valuable to the President as an antidote to the stress of the office. > The friendship continued through Eisenhower's retirement and Allen remained > close to Mamie after Eisenhower's death. ==Works== Based on experience as a White House intimate, Allen wrote Presidents Who Have Known Me in 1950, and then wrote a revised edition in 1960. ==References * Papers of George E.

In France, where the dish originated, parfait is made by boiling cream, egg, sugar and syrup to create a custard-like puree which is sometimes served in a parfait glass. The American version includes more ingredients like granola, nuts, yogurt and liqueurs made in combination with a topping of fruits or whipped cream that are layered and served in a tall glass. The oldest known recipe dates back to 1892 c le nom de l'autre aussi. ==France== In France, parfait refers to a frozen dessert made from a base of sugar syrup, egg, and cream. A parfait contains enough fat, sugar, alcohol, and/or, to a lesser extent, air to allow it to be made by stirring infrequently while freezing, making it possible to create in a home kitchen without specialist equipment. The fat, sugar, alcohol or air interferes with the formation of water crystals, which would otherwise give the ice cream an uncomfortable texture in the mouth. The formation of ice crystals is managed in the making of regular ice cream by agitating the ice cream constantly while it freezes or chemically by adding glycerol. Neither should be necessary when making a high- quality parfait. ==United Kingdom== In the United Kingdom, parfait can refer to a very smooth meat paste (or p√¢t√©), usually made from liver (chicken or duck) and sweetened with liqueurs. ==United States and Canada== In the United States, parfait refers to either the traditional French-style dessert or to a popular variant, the American parfait, made by layering parfait cream, ice cream, and/or fruit, usually in a tall clear glass, but can be in a short and stubby glass. The clear glass displays the layers of the dessert. The topping is created with whipped cream, fresh or canned fruit, and/or liqueurs. Recent trends in the United States and Canada have introduced parfaits without cream or liqueurs. These are made by simply layering yogurt with granola, nuts, and/or fresh fruits (such as peaches, strawberries, or blueberries). This version is sometimes called a yogurt parfait or fruit parfait. Those who abstain from meat, eggs and dairy for reasons of health, animal rights, environment etc. prefer vegan parfaits. https://beplantwell.com/vegan- breakfast-parfait/ ==See also== *List of French desserts ==References * Allrecipes.com: Parfait Recipes Category:Sundaes Category:Yogurt-based dishes Category:French desserts ","title":"Parfait"},{"id":"20562050","text":"Nah und Fern (English: Near and Far) is a boxed set collecting the four albums released by Wolfgang Voigt under the Gas alias between 1996 and 2000, released on 10 June 2008.

In 1996, he reported to Co C, 3d Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment and in 1998, Castro served as a drill sergeant at Co A, 2d Battalion, 19th Infantry at Sand Hill at Fort Benning, Georgia. In 1999, he attended Special Forces Assessment and Selection and later that year began the Special Forces Qualification Course. Upon graduation in 2000, he reported to Co B, 3d Battalion, 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne) at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Castro's MOS was Special Forces Weapons Sergeant. While there, he deployed to Colombia, Belize, and Ecuador. Castro went to night school to complete a B.A. degree, before attending the Army's Officers Candidate School. He attended Officer Candidate School in 2004, earning a second lieutenant commission the same year. He then attended the Infantry Officer basic course at Fort Benning, GA. In 2005, he reported to Co D, 1st Battalion (Airborne), 325th Infantry Regiment , 82d Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, NC. While assigned to the 82d, he deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom for the first parliamentary elections. ===Deployment to Iraq=== Dr. Jill Biden joins U.S. Army Capt. Iv√°n Castro (right) and his guide Richard Kirby (left), 2014 By the time he was sent to Iraq as a scout platoon leader with the 1st Battalion (Airborne), 325th Infantry Regiment, Castro was already an experienced combat veteran. In 2006, Castro was assigned to the 1st Battalion (Airborne), 325th Infantry Regiment , 82d Airborne Division, which was in combat in Iraq at the time. In September 2006, Castro and his men had relieved other paratroopers atop a house in the town of Yusifiyah, some 20 miles southwest of Baghdad, after a night of fighting. As an officer, Castro was not required to personally provide fire support to fellow soldiers in the exposed housetop position. Nonetheless, he volunteered for the mission and was accompanied by Sergeant Ralph Porras and Private First Class Justin Dreese. A mortar round landed a few feet away from him, killing Sergeant Porras and PFC Dreese and severely wounding Castro. Shrapnel tore through his body, damaging a shoulder, breaking an arm, fracturing facial bones and collapsing his lungs. The blast also drove the frame of his protective eyewear into his face. Castro was sent to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. The top half of his right index finger was ripped off and the doctors had to amputate the remaining part of the finger. His right eye was blown out and he had a metal fragment in his left eye. The extent of his injuries was such that doctors doubted whether Castro would survive the week. When Castro regained consciousness days later, his right eye was gone, but doctors hoped to salvage the vision in his left. The surgeons later removed one last piece of shrapnel from that eye. When they took off his bandages they flashed a light for Castro to see; however, when he did not respond to the light, he was told that he would never see again. Castro remained in the hospital for two months after his injury, with no idea of what he would do next. He then overheard a doctor and a nurse discussing the next Army Ten-Miler and the Marine Corps Marathon. He asked his doctor if the courses were flat or hilly, then made running both races his goal. ===Recovery=== Castro spent 17 months in recovery before seeking a permanent assignment in the Army's Special Operations Command, at the 7th Special Forces Group's headquarters company in Fort Bragg. Through convalescence and rehabilitation, Castro struggled to regain a measure of independence and regularly worked out ‚Äì both running and in the gym. ===New assignment=== Before being appointed executive officer of the 7th Special Forces Group's headquarters company, he spent a weekend familiarizing himself with the group area where he was going to work by walking around and measuring the steps from his car to his office. He is quoted in the media as saying: Upon his appointment, Castro became the only blind officer serving in the Special Forces and one of three blind officers who serve in the active-duty Army, though his managerial tasks are not directly involved with combat. In February 2008, Castro was promoted to the rank of captain, and served as the executive officer of the 7th Special Forces Group at Fort Bragg. On December 15, 2009, Castro graduated from the Maneuver Captains Career Course at Fort Benning, Georgia. He is currently working as the Assistant Operations Officer/ Total Army Involvement Recruiting Coordinator at Fort Bragg, N.C. ==Athletic endeavors== Capt. Iv√°n Castro (#471) guided by Major Phil Young (#70321) runs the Army Ten-Miler. Castro has remained active as an athlete. At Bragg he trained with Major Phil Young, who was his team leader in the Special Forces, and has participated in several long distance road races, often being enthusiastically greeted by the audiences for his determination. He now trains with Lieutenant Colonel Fred Dummar, who is his battalion commander. Together, they have completed several marathons. Among the notable races and marathons in which Castro has participated, with a guide, as a member of the \\"Missing Parts In Action\\" team in 2007, are the Army Ten-Miler and the Marine Corps Marathon. In 2008, he participated in the Bataan Memorial Death March Marathon in New Mexico, the Boston Marathon and the U.S. Air Force Marathon. In 2008, Castro as a member and participant in Operation Peer Support, participated in the Blinded Veterans Association's 62nd National Convention. In June 2009, Castro participated in the Midnight Boogie 50 mile ultramarathon. In 2014, he visited the South Pole with other wounded veterans and soldiers from the United States and Britain after intense hiking, skiing training. ==Community service== Castro is an advocate of rehabilitation funding for the blind, visiting members of Congress in his quest. He was honored during a visit to the Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center in Augusta, Georgia with a plaque engraved in braille, which thanked him for his continued service. He also mentors, coaches, and counsels wounded service members with various injuries. Recently, Castro was invited to be the keynote speaker at the 25th International Technology and Persons with Disabilities Conference.25th International Technology and Persons with Disabilities Conference Castro currently serves on active duty at the Special Operations Recruiting Battalion as the Assistant Operations Officer /Total Army Involvement Recruiting Coordinator.

Townshend sings the lead vocal rather than normal Who lead singer Roger Daltrey. The song praises the virtues of an actual American deodorant named \\"Odo-Ro-No\\". ==Lyrics and music== The concept behind The Who Sell Out was to make the album sound like a pirate radio station, including fake commercials between the songs. \\"Odorono\\" fitted with the concept by being a phony commercial for a brand of underarm deodorant, but it is also a substantial song in its own right. The lyrics tell the story of a woman singer who has just completed a successful performance and awaits a handsome man named Mr. Davidson to come backstage to congratulate her. In the words of Townshend, \\"it looks like she's all set, not only for stardom but also for true love\\". But when Mr. Davidson bends over to kiss her, her body odor turns him off, ruining her chances at both stardom and love. The song ends with the admonishment that \\"Her deodorant had let her down / She should have used Odorono\\". The song represents the increasing importance of narrative in Townshend's songwriting. Townshend was proud of the song, stating that he \\"dug\\" it because \\"it was a little story, and although I thought it's a good song, it was about something groovy ‚Äî underarm perspiration.\\" And of the singer's hopes being disappointed, Townshend went on to say: \\"And you know, without getting too serious about it, because it's supposed to be very light, that's life. It really is. That really is life.\\" The Mr. Davidson in the song may have referred to Harold Davidson, who was a famous booking agent in London at the time the song was written. Although the song is a fake commercial, a real deodorant product named Odorono once existed. The Who recorded \\"Odorono\\" on October 11, 1967 at IBC Studios. In addition to singing, Townshend plays rhythm guitar on the song. ==Critical reception== \\"Odorono\\" has been praised for its projection of bittersweet comedy. Rolling Stone Magazine said: \\"The girl who should have used Odorono is obviously meant to be a laugh, but it is bittersweet laughter. The Who have caught the embarrassing reality of it, and reality is the essence of humor.\\" Authors Steve Grantley and Alan Parker comment on the song's \\"comical lyrics\\" while noting that it tells \\"a melancholy story\\". Author John Atkins calls the music \\"attractive\\" and the lyrics \\"amusing\\" and \\"melodramatic\\". John Dougan calls the song \\"an inciteful critique of the entertainment industry's elevation of style and appearance over talent, as well as a satire of products as salvation\\" and states that \\"the song is unexpectedly heartfelt, partly the result of the anguish expressed in Townshend's voice and the story's cinematic quality\\". Dougan also remarks on \\"Odorono\\"'s \\"narrative arc and character development\\" and notes that these qualities allow the listener to sympathize with the singer and feel a little annoyed at Mr. Davidson's \\"insensitivity and superficiality\\". ==Other versions== The mono mix of \\"Odorono\\" differs significantly from the stereo mix, including a different lead guitar part. Petra Haden covered the song on her 2005 album Petra Haden Sings: The Who Sell Out. Acme Rock Group covered the song on their 2001 album Star. ==References== Category:1967 songs Category:The Who songs Category:Songs written by Pete Townshend Category:Song recordings produced by Kit Lambert ","title":"Odorono"},{"id":"20562148","text":"The Passion is an unfinished ode by John Milton that was possibly written in 1630 and was first published in 1645 or 1646 (see 1646 in poetry). The poem connects Christ's Crucifixion with his Incarnation. It is linked to two other poems of Milton: On the Morning of Christ's Nativity and Upon the Circumcision ==Background== The exact date of composition is unknown, but it is likely that Milton wrote the ode while attending Christ's College, Cambridge,Shawcross 1993 p. 18 and it is commonly dated to 1630.Kerrigan 2007 p. 30 However, the ode, along with Upon the Circumcision and On the Morning of Christ's Nativity, were first published in 1645, and they are found within a manuscript that was not started before May 1634.Shawcross 1993 p. 71 They were composed during a time in which Milton became deeply concerned with Scripture but also one who still relies on myth. They were written during a time of experimentation in genre and subject for Milton.Shawcross 1993 p. 23 The poem was revised for the publication in the 1645 collection, but Milton found that he would be unable to finish the poem, leaving only three lines which emphasise his shortcomings at the time of writing the poem.Corns 2003 p. 219 ==Poem== \\"The Passion\\" deals with the Crucifixion of Jesus but first two stanzas discuss how the narrator can no longer discuss the happiness of Christ's nativity:Corns 2003 p. 218 :Wherewith the stage of air and earth did ring, :And joyous news of Heav'nly infant's birth :My muse with angels did divide to sing :... :For now to sorrow must I tune my song, :And set my harp to notes of saddest woe (lines 2‚Äì4, 8‚Äì9) Although he is to introduce the Crucifixion, the third stanza emphasises the nature of Christ and the Incarnation. :He sov'reign priest, stopping his regal head :That dropped with odorous oil down his fair eyes, :Poor fleshly tabernacle entered (lines 15‚Äì17) The fourth stanza continues to ignore the Crucifixion by discussing the poetic tone required for such a poem: :These latter scenes confine my roving verse, :To this horizon is my Phoebus bound, :His Godlike acts, and his temptations fierce; :... :Me softer airs befit, and softer strings :Of lute, or viol still, more apt for mournful things. (lines 22‚Äì24, 27‚Äì28) The fifth stanza continues this focus and discusses the printing of an elegy: :My sorrows are too dark for day to know: :The leaves should all be black whereon I write, :And letters where my tears have washed a wannish white. (lines 33‚Äì35) The emphasis on poetry is dropped for an emphasis on the soul of the narrator in Stanza VI: :My spirit some transporting cherub feels, :To bear me where the towers of Salem stood :... :There doth my soul in holy vision sit :In pensive trance, and anguish, and ecstatic fit. (lines 38‚Äì39, 41‚Äì42) The moment of the Crucifixion passes as the poet focuses on himself, and the poem transitions discussing to Christ's sepulchral in Stanza VIII: :Mine eye hath found that sad sepulchral rock :That was the casket of Heav'n's richest store, :And here though grief my feeble hands uplock, :Yet on the softened quarry would I score :My plaining verse as lively as before :For sure so well instructed are my tears, :That they would fitly fall in ordered characters. (lines 43‚Äì49) The final stanza ends with the poet focusing on his own sorrow: :Or Should I thence, hurried on viewless wing, :Take up a weeping on the mountains wild, :The gentle neighbourhood of grove and spring :Would soon unbosom all their echoes mild :And I (for grief is easily beguiled) :Might think th' infection of my sorrows loud :Had got a race of mourners on some pregnant cloud. Attached to the 1645 publication of the poem are three lines which Milton wrote to state that the poem is incomplete and is abandoned because the poet was unable to deal with the Crucifixion as the subject matter: :This subject the author finding to be above the :years he had when he wrote it, and nothing :satisfied with what was begun, left it unfinished. ==Themes== The Passion with On the Morning of Christ's Nativity and Upon the Circumcision form a set of poems that celebrates important Christian events: Christ's birth, the feast of the Circumcision, and Good Friday. The topic of these poems places them within a genre of Christian literature popular during the 17th century and places Milton alongside poets like John Donne, Richard Crashaw, and George Herbert. However, Milton's poetry reflects the origins of his anti-William Laud and anti-Church of England-based religious beliefs. The topic of The Passion is of Christ's Crucifixion. Although Milton was a Christian poet, he rarely discusses this event within his poetry.Corns 2003 pp. 216‚Äì217 In the poem, he ignores the suffering by diverting attention to a discussion of himself and his own understanding of poetry in a similar way to Donne's \\"Goodfriday, 1613. Riding Westward\\". Milton's emphasis is on the nature of Christian poetry, and Stanza V contains a self-referential discussion of writing elegiac poetry, which is a baroque technique similar to the work of Bernini or Herbert in \\"Good Friday\\". However, the narrator constantly focuses on himself and his own grief, and this is a common trait in the contemporary Christian poetry of the poem. Unlike many of his contemporaries' works, each aspect of the poem emphasises that the narrator is unable to actually discuss Christ's crucifixion, and the poem was left incomplete.Corns 2003 pp. 217‚Äì219 ==Critical response== Thomas Corns believes that The Passion \\"offers a unique example of Milton's poetic engagement with a scene he evidently found difficult to depict\\".Corns 2003 p. 217 Corns also believes that lines 34 and 35 of the fifth stanza contain \\"the most memorable conceit, though one that has received some censure for its self-conscious preciosity\\". ==See also== * 1645 in poetry ==NotesReferences== * Corns, Thomas. \\"'On the Morning of Christ's Nativity', 'Upon the Circumcision' and 'The Passion'\\" in A Companion to Milton.

Located in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada, the PWNHC acquires and manages objects and archival materials that represent the cultures and history of the Northwest Territories (NWT), plays a primary role in documenting and providing information about the cultures and history of the NWT, and provides a professional museum, archives and cultural resource management services to partner organizations. ==History== A group of history-minded Yellowknifers first envisioned a museum for the Northwest Territories in the early 1950s and after several years of planning, and three years of construction, the 'Museum of the North' opened in July 1963 in downtown Yellowknife. It was operated by volunteers with the Yellowknife Museum Society until 1970 when care of its artifacts was transferred to the Government of the Northwest Territories. Planning for a larger institution began due to concern over the loss of northern artifacts and collections, and the need to provide museum services and support throughout the Northwest Territories under a government mandate. In 1972, a program calling for the development of museum services in the NWT received official approval from the Government of the Northwest Territories. Construction started in 1975. On April 16, 1979, His Royal Highness, The Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, officiated at the opening of the facility that bears his name. The PWNHC holds in trust for the public a large collection of objects that represent the peoples and cultures of the NWT, and produces exhibitions that tell stories about the land, people and history of the NWT. However, the PWNHC is \\"more than a museum\\".

The company was awarded the Strictly Financing Award 2007. In 2013, Camurus was awarded CPhI Pharma Award for Best Innovation in Formulation. ==Technologies== Camurus is a company focused on the development of lipid lyotropic liquid crystal structures for pharmaceutical drug delivery applications. These structures are well-defined three-dimensional formations consisting of lipophilic and hydrophilic domains that can be either interconnected or isolated depending on the environmentally induced phase conditions. The unique crystalline structures offer a unique way of encapsulating and transporting Active pharmaceutical ingredients, such as small molecules, peptides and proteins through the body. The structures also allow for the use of controlled release and prevention of degradation of fragile short half live molecules, a serious issue for amino-acid based drugs. ===FluidCrystal technology=== Camurus' FluidCrystal are available as injectable depots and topical bioadhesive delivery technologies. By encapsulating the drug compound in the nanostructures, injectable depots are able to deliver therapeutic levels of drug substance over extended periods from a single injection. This leads to a decrease in traditional side effects associated with high initial drug release on injection (drug burst), poor drug stability, and complex processing requirements, making the system highly suitable for sustained parental delivery of peptides, proteins, and small molecule drug compounds. The topical delivery system creates a bio-adhesive film that provides local and continual release of drug compounds. The delivery system is suited for delivery of peptide, protein, and small molecule drug compounds and can be applied to dermal, buccal, ophthalmic, nasal, vaginal, and other topical surfaces. ==ProductsElyzol dental gel - parodontitis === Camurus has partnered with Colgate-Palmolive for the marketing of their Elyzol dental gel for the treatment of parodontitis. Elyzol 25% dental gel contains metronidazole in the form of metronidazole benzoate as the active substance. Metronidazole is an antibiotic active against those organisms that are predominant in the subgingival flora in adult periodontitis, but does not affect helpful aerobic bacteria. ===Episil - oral mucositis pain === Oral mucositis is a severe side-effect of chemotherapy or radiotherapy during cancer treatment, and is often a dose-limiting factor in treatment. episil is administered as a lipid-based liquid that spreads on the intra-oral mucosal surfaces and transforms to a strongly bioadhesive FluidCrystal film that mechanically protects the sensitized and sore epithelium of the oral cavity. It has been demonstrated in several clinical trials that episil gives an immediate and significant reduction of pain. This analgesic effect was maintained over at least 8 hours following administration. The treatment was reported to be safe and well tolerated. The product is registered as a medical device in a wide range of countries, including the European Union and the United States. ===CAM2029 - growth hormone disorders === CAM2029 is a product for the treatment of acromegaly and carcinoid tumours. CAM2029 was assessed in a double blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo controlled Phase I trial. CAM2029 is partnered with Novartis. ===CAM2032 - prostate cancer=== CAM2032 is a new drug being developed for long-term treatment of prostate cancer, with development also initiated for endometriosis. Camurus has completed a Phase IIa clinical trial of CAM2032 in patients with advanced metastatic prostate cancer. ===CAM2038 - drug addiction=== CAM2038 represents a new treatment concept for opiate addiction based on the well-documented anti-addiction therapeutic buprenorphine. CAM2038 is developed as a sustained release injection depot. ==References *Official site Category:1991 establishments in Sweden Category:Biotechnology companies of Sweden Category:Biotechnology companies established in 1991 Category:Lund Category:Companies listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange Category:Pharmaceutical companies of Sweden Category:Pharmaceutical companies established in 1991 ","title":"Camurus"},{"id":"20562259","text":"\\"Treetrunk\\" is a song by American rock band the Doors.

Distributed through the Chicago Tribune syndicate, it had the longest run of any strip in the screwball genre. Holman signed some strips with the pseudonym Scat H. He once described himself as \\"always inclined to humor and acting silly.\\"Goulart, Ron, editor. The Encyclopedia of American Comics, Facts on File, 1990. Born in Crawfordsville, Indiana, Holman lived as a child in Nappanee, Indiana, a town where six successful cartoonists lived when they were children. Holman's father died when he was young. He began drawing when he was 12 years old. While working part-time at Nappanee's local five and dime store, he developed an interest in art as a career and sent away for the Landon School of Illustration and Cartooning correspondence course.Trickey, Erick. \\"Quick Draw,\\" Cleveland Magazine, February 2009. Dropping out of high school, he was 15 when he moved with his mother to Chicago. There he took night courses at the Academy of Fine Arts and learned more about cartooning from Carl Ed. In 1920, he held a job as a copy boy at the Chicago Tribune for six dollars a week. The position gave him the opportunity to hang out with the top Tribune cartoonists, including Sidney Smith, Harold Gray and E. C. Segar. In Cleveland, he began working for the Newspaper Enterprise Association, which syndicated his short-lived animal strip, Billville Birds (1922). After three years with NEA and Scripps-Howard, he headed for New York, where he was a Herald Tribune staff artist and drew the child strip G. Whizz Jr. for the New York Herald Tribune Syndicate. He scored a success when he headed in a new direction, submitting his cartoons to a variety of different magazines, including Liberty, Redbook, Collier's and Life.Bill HolmanLambiek ==Smokey Stover and Spooky== Holman thought firemen were funny, \\"running around in a red wagon with sirens and bells,\\" and he began doing Smokey Stover as a Sunday strip for the Chicago Tribune Syndicate on March 10, 1935. In 1941, Bill Holman gave his blessing to the Order of Smokey Stover, a social club created by the Redmond Volunteer Firefighters Association in Redmond, Washington. The club participated in various Redmond events, such as the 1951 parade seen here. One month later (April 7, 1935), to accompany Smokey Stover, he launched a topper strip, Spooky. With a perpetually bandaged tail, the firehouse cat Spooky lived with its owner, Fenwick Flooky, who did embroidery while sitting barefoot in a rocking chair. The daily Smokey Stover was not launched until November 14, 1938. Holman loved word play, and all of his features percolated with puns. In his file cabinet, Holman kept thousands of puns. Readers of Smokey Stover often sent him puns, sometimes with accompanying illustrations.Brinkley, Bill. \\"Smokey Stover Creator Gets Rich Turning Hogs Into Gold,\\" The Washington Post, October 5, 1949. He also inserted bizarre words and phrases, such as \\"Foo,\\" \\"Notary Sojac,\\" \\"Scramgravy Ain't Wavy\\" and \\"1506 Nix Nix\\". Some of these became national catchphrases. \\"1506 Nix Nix\\" was an inside joke on Holman's friend, cartoonist Al Posen, as Holman once explained, \\"The late Al Posen, who did the Sweeney and Son comic strip, was a bachelor living in a hotel room, number 1506. I began using the phrase, a private joke between the two of us, as a warning to girls to stay away from Al's room.\\"Canemaker, John. \\"Bill Holman\\", Millimeter ==Nuts and Jolts== Bill Holman's Nuts and Jolts (July 12, 1940) Holman's gag panel, Nuts and Jolts, was syndicated by the Chicago Tribune - New York News Syndicate from the 1930s to 1970. When Gaar Williams, who drew a gag panel under a variety of titles, died in 1935, Holman stepped in as a replacement. In July 1935, Holman picked up where Williams had left off, but the Nuts and Jolts title did not appear on the series until July 3, 1939. That same month, he began a Thursday panel, Zipper, about a dog.Schneider, Walter E. \\"Holman Renews Contract; To Do New Daily Panel,\\" Editor & Publisher, July 8, 1939. Journalist Al Meyers described Holman in a 1938 feature story: By 1939, when Holman was earning $1500 a month, he gave a humorous summary of his life to Editor & Publisher: Bill Holman For the USO, Holman made many trips abroad to entertain troops in the South Pacific, Europe, Japan and Korea, in addition to his chalk talks at veteran‚Äôs hospitals. A promoter of U.S. Savings Bonds, Holman donated his time to draw booklets for local fire-safety campaigns. He was also involved in numerous children‚Äôs charities. Holman was one of the co-founders of the National Cartoonists Society, and he was the organization's president in 1961-62. He continued his close association with the Society after his 1973 retirement. Even after retiring from Smokey Stover, Holman could not stop the flow of puns and verbal/visual ideas, and he produced stack of sketches for a possible syndicated panel he titled Wall Nuts.Mike Lynch Cartoons: \\"Unseen Bill Holman Comics\\" This had no connection with Gene Ahern's The Nut Bros: Ches and Wal, but it could be a nod to Ahern's strip which mined a vein of surreal silliness somewhat similar to Smokey Stover. At age 83, Holman died February 27, 1987 in New York, survived by his wife Dolores. In Nappanee, Holman is cited on the Indiana Historical Bureau's Historical Marker, which reads: ==Bibliography== According to Holman, more than 100,000 copies of Whitman's ten-cent Smokey Stover books were sold by 1939. *Smokey Stover: Fire Fighter of Foo.

The term, frequently applied to television, film, video game, anime, manga and chronological series, often denotes an untimely or unexpected death motivated by factors beyond the storyline. In productions featuring actors, the unwillingness or inability of an actor to continue with the production for financial or other reasons (including illness, death, or producers' unwillingness to retain an actor) may lead to that character being \\"killed off\\" or removed from the storyline in another way. ==ExamplesTelevision=== Because of the episodic format of television shows, audience feedback and approval is often a factor in whether or not a character is killed off. Damon Lindelof, executive producer of Lost, has been quoted as saying that despite the widespread hate for Nikki and Paulo, \\"We had a plan when we introduced them, and we didn't get to fully execute that plan. But when the plan is executed, [they] will be iconic characters on the show.\\"Jensen, Jeff & Snierson, Dan, (February 8, 2007) \\"'Lost' and Found,\\" Entertainment Weekly. Retrieved on October 19th 2012. In an example of a character being killed off as a result of an actor leaving the show, Raymond Cruz's character Tuco Salamanca on Breaking Bad was killed off because he found the part too difficult to play. Characters may be killed off when the actors die. John Ritter's character in 8 Simple Rules was written to have died off screen after Ritter himself died during taping of the show. The Palestinian children's character Farfur (a Mickey Mouse lookalike) is an example of a character \\"killed off\\" for political reasons in 2007. After the program received criticism from some government ministers in both Palestine and Israel for espousing anti-Israeli sentiments, the Farfur character was killed off. Even his death, at the hands of an \\"Israeli agent\\", making Farfur a \\"martyr\\", was similarly politicised.BBC News: \\"Hamas 'Mickey Mouse' killed off retrieved 5 December 2008 Planters killed off its century-old mascot Mr. Peanut in an advertising campaign leading up to Super Bowl LIV, only to resurrect him as a baby during a commercial during that game. When racing driver Perry McCarthy left the television show Top Gear his character The Stig was 'killed off' in a stunt involving driving a Jaguar off of an aircraft carrier, upon which he was replaced with a similar but white-suited version of the same character.https://web.archive.org/web/20081011004112/http://www.topgear.com/uk/videos/the- stig--hms-invincible ===Comic books=== Death is a frequently used dramatic device in comic book fiction, and in particular superhero fiction. Unlike stories in television or film, character deaths are rarely by unforeseen behind-the-scenes events, as there is no analogous situation to having actors portraying characters. Instead, characters are typically killed off as part of the story or occasionally by editorial mandate to generate publicity for a title. Teasers may hint at characters' deaths for an extended period. A number of factors often mean that the changes are not permanent. Extremely long print runs make the popularity of characters (with writers and fans) and occasionally rights issues for using the character in licensed adaptations often make characters often be brought back to life by later writers. That can happen either as a depiction of their literal resurrection or by retcon, a revision that changes earlier continuity and establishes the character not to have died in the first place. This phenomenon is known as the comic book death. Killing off a main character such as Superman, Batman or Captain America can often lead to an uptick in publicity for a comic book and high sales for the story in which they are inevitably brought back to life. Some writers have also criticized the trend for killing off supporting characters, particularly when female characters are killed off brutally to elicit a strong reaction in the male protagonist. This is known as the Women in Refrigerators trope. Specifically, the Death of Gwen Stacy, long-time girlfriend of Spider- Man, caused great shock and long-lasting controversy among fans. ==See also== * Spin off ==References== Category:Television terminology Category:Film and video terminology Category:Video game terminology Category:Anime and manga terminology Category:Literary terminology Category:Death in fiction ","title":"Kill off"},{"id":"20562409","text":"Erbil may refer to: * Erbil, a city in Iraq * Erbil Governorate, Iraq ==Given name== * Erbil Eroƒülu (born 1993), Turkish basketball player ==Surnames== * Mehmet Ali Erbil (born 1957), Turkish comedian, actor and talk show host * Sinan Erbil (born 1965), Turkmen singer Category:Turkish unisex given names Category:Turkish-language surnames ","title":"Erbil (disambiguation)"},{"id":"20562418","text":"Wilhelm Kunst (2 February 1799 in Hamburg - 16 or 17 November 1859 in Vienna) was a celebrated German actor who provoked quite varied opinions.

He did better in lower-rated versions of a particular plot, for example being suited to lesser translations of Shakespeare rather than first-rate ones; but in the plays he excelled at, for example Otto von Wittelsbach, he was quite stunning.

It is a rock opera loosely based on the Mega Man video game series, and the first volume of a planned trilogy of albums on this theme. The follow-up, Act II: The Father of Death, a prequel to The Protomen, was released on September 8, 2009. ==Plot summary== While the plot of the album is adapted from the Mega Man games, it takes substantial liberties with the original storyline, functioning as a dystopic reworking of the games' narrative. The album begins with a description of a dystopia ruled by Doctor Wily and his army of robots (\\"Hope Rides Alone\\"). Doctor Light apparently works for Wily's government, but by night he builds a robot to lead a rebellion against Wily -- Proto Man. After twelve years, when Proto Man is finished, he is sent to fight Wily's forces and liberate mankind‚Äîhowever, after defeating many of Wily's robots Proto Man is weakened, and the robot army launches a final assault. The human masses, too frightened of Wily to assist Proto Man, allow him to die. Proto Man's funeral is held. In Doctor Light's grief, he sets about destroying his laboratory, instead building a new robot, Mega Man. (\\"Funeral for a Son\\"). Years later, people still talk about Proto Man, and Doctor Light knows that Mega Man will soon find out about his brother. To dissuade Mega Man from attempting to rebel against Wily, Light tells Mega Man Proto Man's story, and explains that the people have \\"chosen their own end\\" -- they will not fight to save themselves (\\"Unrest in The House of Light\\"). Mega Man angrily defies Light and sets out to defeat Wily on his own, finding Proto Man's grave-site, and amassing a crowd of people as he marches towards Wily's fortress, seeking to avenge his brother's death and to \\"finish what was started, the fight of Proto Man\\" (\\"The Will of One\\"). Mega Man is able to fight through Wily's army of robots with relative ease, reaching the commander of the robot army (\\"Vengeance\\"). However, Mega Man discovers that Proto Man never died‚Äîhe now defends Wily, who has repaired him and made him the commander of his army. Proto Man declares that mankind does not deserve to be saved if they will not stand for themselves, telling Mega Man that all men are cowardly, and will never fight for themselves (\\"The Stand\\"). The two raise their weapons against each other, and argue angrily, Mega Man slowly being convinced by his brother that humanity isn't worth saving (\\"Sons of Fate\\"). Confused and encouraged by human onlookers crying out \\"Destroy him, you can save us, you're our only hope, kill Proto Man\\", Mega Man delivers a mortal wound to his brother, who tells him before he dies that humanity may one day realize how to save itself. Distraught by the grief of killing his brother, Mega Man flees from the fortress, leaving the crowd of people that had gathered to watch the battle to be slaughtered by Wily's robots (\\"Due Vendetta\\").The Protomen (2005).The Protomen. Information not explicitly stated by the album's lyrics can be found in the album insert, which provides non-lyrical narrative context for the songs. ==Critical and press reception== While the album has yet to be reviewed by major music publications, it has received favorable press from 1UP1UP (2006). \\"Playing It Loud: Six bands inspired by video games\\" and The Escapist (in the form of an interview with the band).The Escapist (2007). \\"Hope Rides Alone: The Protomen\\" The album has gained a number of supporters from fans of the Mega Man games and music listeners in general, highlighting the storytelling, music, and dark interpretation of the game's mythology. The success of the album, bolstered by an article in the gaming magazine Nintendo Power, began a huge cult following for the band, with fans attending concerts in costumes inspired by the band's storyline and participating by way of singing along with the band's music, which was further exemplified by the group's work in Act II: The Father of Death. In 2015, Unrest In The House Of Light appeared as a cover song on Murder By Death‚Äôs As You Wish: Kickstarter Covers Vol. 2. ==Track listing== All tracks written and composed by The Protomen.The Protomen CD MyShopify (2014). ==References== Category:2005 albums Category:The Protomen albums Category:Rock operas ","title":"The Protomen (album)"},{"id":"20562656","text":"Lochhman Garhi is a village in Dehradun district of Uttarakhand, India.

He was 23 years old.http://bristolnews.mobi/final-companion- to-the-last-condemned-man Pascoe was executed at 8.00 am in Bristol's Horfield Prison on Tuesday, 17 December 1963 for his part in the murder of 64-year-old Cornish farmer William Garfield Rowe. Pascoe and Whitty had believed that Rowe kept a fortune hidden on his farm, Nanjarrow Farm, Constantine, near Falmouth. ==Background== During 1963, Whitty and 23-year-old Pascoe were living with three young women in a caravan at Kenwyn Caravan Park, on the outskirts of Truro, Cornwall. Whitty was working as a labourer at Truro Gas Works. Pascoe had previously worked as a labourer at Nanjarrow Farm near Falmouth and knew the farmer, William Rowe. Rowe was somewhat reclusive, living in the untidy sitting room of his farmhouse, the four bedrooms unoccupied after his mother and brother had died. Local rumour held that Rowe had a large sum of money concealed on the premises, and he had been the victim of a burglary in 1960, during which ¬£200 and some other items had been stolen. ==The murder== On the night of Wednesday, 14 August 1963, Whitty and Pascoe travelled to Nanjarrow Farm on Whitty's motorcycle. They were armed with a starting pistol, a knife and an iron bar. Whitty was wearing dark jeans and a dark, double-breasted blazer with silver buttons. When they knocked on Rowe's door at around 11.00 pm and the old man opened it, Whitty used this uniform-like clothing to support a story that they had crashed a helicopter nearby, and he asked to use Rowe's telephone. They then attacked Rowe; Whitty with the knife and Pascoe with the iron bar, leaving the farmer dead with six or seven wounds to the head, a fractured skull, a broken jaw, a severed finger and five chest wounds, including one knife wound to the heart. They searched the house for the money, but came away with only ¬£4 that Pascoe found in a piano, and Whitty's haul of a watch, two boxes of matches and some keys. The sum of ¬£3,000 was later found in the farmhouse. Whitty and Pascoe split the money and took ¬£2 each, returning to the caravan at Truro. The girls they lived with later testified that Whitty was \\"grinning all over his face\\", and that Pascoe was seen wiping blood from Whitty's face. The following day, Pascoe's girlfriend confronted Whitty with a copy of the evening newspaper, which contained details of Rowe's murder. She asked Whitty, \\"You went to Constantine. Did you do this?\\" Whitty replied, \\"Yes I did.\\" The girl later claimed that Whitty and Pascoe threatened to kill the girls if they told anyone what they knew. ==Arrest, trial and execution== The local police were soon tipped off about the murder by one of the three girls. On 16 August 1963, a policeman saw Pascoe riding his motorcycle in Constantine, stopped him and asked him to report for routine questioning at the murder headquarters. Pascoe claimed that he had been in the caravan in Truro at the time of the murder, but when Pascoe admitted knowing Rowe and working for him in the past, the police realised that Pascoe had worked for Rowe at the time of the burglary in 1960. Whitty was then also brought in for questioning. The following day, each man was questioned and told that they were suspected of committing the murder. Whitty and Pascoe each blamed each other, with Whitty accusing Pascoe of beating Rowe with the iron bar, and then forcing Whitty to use the knife. Whitty admitted stabbing Rowe but stated, \\"Pascoe made me stick him.\\" Pascoe told the police that Whitty had instigated the attack, admitting only to knocking Rowe out with the iron bar. He claimed that Whitty \\"went mad with the knife\\", then took the bar from Pascoe and repeatedly struck Rowe with it. When charged and cautioned, Whitty replied, \\"We are both over twenty-one, so I suppose we can hang?\\" He subsequently gave a written statement outlining the events on the night of the murder, and his claim that Pascoe had forced him into continuing the attack on Rowe. At Rowe's farmhouse, a solicitor, Jack King, found a small diary in a desk, with descriptive notes written in Esperanto, referring to the whereabouts of various sums of money. Having translated the notes, the executors of Rowe's will used them to find a number of caches of money, including in a safe set in concrete, covered by straw in a cowshed; and a large glass jar containing hundreds of banknotes, hidden elsewhere on the property. The full amount that was eventually found was not revealed, but was referred to as \\"thousands of pounds\\". At the trial at Bodmin Assizes, beginning on 29 October, the murder was described as \\"brutal and savage in the extreme\\". The jury debated for four and a half hours before returning with guilty verdicts for both Whitty and Pascoe, and they were sentenced to death by the Judge, Mr Justice Thesiger. On 2 November 1963, the two men were driven to separate prisons: Whitty to Winchester Prison and Pascoe to Horfield Prison in Bristol. The Scottish writer Robert Douglas was then a prison guard assigned to help look after Pascoe in the condemned cell at Horfield Prison during Pascoe's final days, the story of which formed part of the third volume of Douglas's autobiography (entitled At Her Majesty's Pleasure).Transcription of Robert Douglas' account in The Guardian On 23 November 1963, Whitty and Pascoe's appeals were heard and rejected by the Court of Appeal, and the executions were set for Tuesday, 17 December. Clemency was refused first by Home Secretary Henry Brooke and then by the Queen. Pascoe was hanged by Harry Allen (assisted by Royston Rickard) on 17 December, at the same time as Whitty was being hanged at Winchester Prison by Robert Leslie Stewart (assisted by Harry Robinson). A demonstration was held outside Horfield Prison at the time of the hanging; the demonstrators included Tony Benn, the Labour MP for Bristol South East, and the Bishop of Bristol, the Right Reverend Oliver Tomkins. Shortly afterwards, both men were buried in unmarked graves within the walls of the prisons where they had been executed, as was the custom. Only two more prisoners would be subsequently executed in Britain, both in August 1964. Pascoe's last moments were the subject of a BBC documentary in 2012, presented by Gethin Jones. ==References * Bristol's last hanging * Article from This Is Bristol * Article from The Falmouth Packet Category:1940 births Category:1963 deaths Category:1963 in England Category:20th-century executions by England and Wales Category:20th-century executions of British people Category:People executed for murder Category:Executed British people Category:1963 murders in the United Kingdom ","title":"Russell Pascoe"},{"id":"20562714","text":"\\"Learning to Live (Without Your Love)\\" is a song by English singer Rick Astley and English singer O'Chi Brown.

It discusses the Feast of the Circumcision of Christ and connects Christ's Incarnation with his Crucifixion. ==Background== The exact date of composition is unknown, but it is possible that Milton wrote the ode while attending Christ's College, Cambridge,Shawcross 1993 p. 18 and it is commonly dated to 1633.Kerrigan 2007 p. 60 However, the ode, along with The Passion (Milton) and On the Morning of Christ's Nativity, were first published in 1645, and they are found within a manuscript that was not started before May 1634.Shawcross 1993 p. 71 They were composed during a time in which Milton became deeply concerned with Scripture but also one who still relies on myth. They were written during a time of experimentation in genre and subject for Milton.Shawcross 1993 p. 23 ==Poem== Milton begins his poem by invoking the angels, and he claims that they too would need to cry along with mankind: :So sweetly sung your joy the clouds along :Through the soft silence of the list'ning night; :Now mourn, and if sad share with us to bear :Your fiery essence can distill no tear :Burn in your sighs, and borrow :Seas wept from our deep sorrow; (lines 4‚Äì9) The final lines connect the act of Circumcision to Christ's Passion:Corns 2003 p. 220 :And that great cov'nant which we still transgress :Entirely satisfied, :And the full wrath beside :Of vengeful Justice bore for our excess, :And seals obedience first with wounding smart :This day: but O ere long :Huge pangs and strong :Will pierce more near his heart. (lines 21‚Äì28) ==Themes== Upon the Circumcision with The Passion and On the Morning of Christ's Nativity form a set of poems that celebrates important Christian events: Christ's birth, the feast of the Circumcision, and Good Friday. The topic of these poems places them within a genre of Christian literature popular during the 17th century and places Milton alongside of poets like John Donne, Richard Crashaw, and George Herbert. However, Milton's poetry reflects the origins of his anti- William Laud and anti-Church of England based religious beliefs.Corns 2003 pp. 216‚Äì217 Although the other poems in the series tend to be commonplace in theme with Milton's contemporaries, the topic of Christ's Circumcision is rare. Of these poems, Herrick discusses the Circumcision as a somber moment during the festive Twelve Days of Christmas. Milton's poem is convention and Milton connects the Circumcision with Christ's Incarnation by describing the removal of flesh as linking Christ to his human identity. The poem's final moments, of linking the Circumcision with the Crucifixion, is a common theme within Circumcision poems, including the description in Cartwright's and Francis Quarles's poems. However, Milton's, unlike some others, fails to mention the Virgin Mary in relationship to the infant Jesus.Corns 2003 pp. 219‚Äì221 ==NotesReferences== * Corns, Thomas. \\"'On the Morning of Christ's Nativity', 'Upon the Circumcision' and 'The Passion'\\" in A Companion to Milton.

He is best remembered as the creator of the first illustrations of Sherlock Holmes in 1887, as well as his illustrations of the female vampire story Carmilla (1872). He is also remembered for his illustrations accompanying reviews of Gilbert and Sullivan operas and plays of W. S. Gilbert in The Illustrated London News and the Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News in the 1870s and 1880s. ==Biography== Friston produced illustrations and artworks from the 1850s to the late 1880s. His professional career appears to have started by 1853, when he exhibited Mazeppa at the Royal Academy of Art. Friston exhibited at the Royal Academy of Art a total of 14 times between 1853 and 1869, though he was never a member of the Academy. He also exhibited at least six examples of his work at the British Institute (between 1854 and 1867). In their critical companion to the 1858 Royal Academy of Arts exhibition, the Council of Four record the presence of Friston's work A Rising Artist, in the West Room of the galleries, noting of Friston \\"Considerable character in the boyThe Royal Academy Review: A guide to the Royal Academy of Arts, The Council of Four, 1858 By 1863 Friston had started making illustrations for various books and periodicals, including The Churchman's Family Magazine (1863), Tinsley's Magazine (1867), extensively for The Illustrated London News between 1869 and 1878, The Boys' Herald and Dark Blue (1871‚Äì73). Among his earlier published works was a frontispiece for Emma Davenport's Our Birthdays, and How to Improve Them (1864).Davenport, Emma Anne Georgina, with frontispiece by D. H.

Friston, London: Groombridge and sons Arthur Conan Doyle, A Study in Scarlet, Illustration by David Henry Friston, in Beeton's Christmas Annual), 1887 In 1887, Friston was chosen by Ward, Lock & Co. to draw the illustrations for the first edition of Arthur Conan Doyle's first Sherlock Holmes novel, A Study in Scarlet, which was also the first Sherlock Holmes adventure. Friston created four pictures for the story, which were engraved by W.M.R. Quick, and published in the 1887 issue of Beeton's Christmas Annual.Stock, Randall. \\"Beeton's Christmas Annual 1887: An Annotated Checklist and Census\\", The Best of Sherlock Holmes website, 7 October 2008 Friston's pictures are acknowledged to be the first portraits of the Holmes character.Klinefelter, Walter. \\"Sherlock Holmes in Portrait and Profile\\", Syracuse University Press (1963)Sherlock Homes at the International Superheroes site The annual was issued in November at a price of one shilling and had sold out before Christmas. The Bookman of New York noted, in 1932, that Friston's Holmes had attracted some criticism: \\"For the initial appearance of a detective whose exploits were to be recorded for nearly forty years, a veteran illustrator of that day, D. H. Friston, was called upon. This first picture of Holmes would distress the devotees.

It noted of the detail of Friston's creation: \\"His head and hands appear small, almost feminine, his sideburns are ridiculously long, and his figure is plump, dwarfed by the oversize coat. On his head appears a strange, rounded hat. This Holmes looks nothing like the detective we know\\".The Bedside, Bathtub, and Armchair Companion to Sherlock Holmes Also in the late 1880s, Friston illustrated the work of the American Mary Noailles Murfree, writing as Charles Egbert Craddock.Notice for In the Clouds (1886) available online at books.google.com, accessed 6 December 2008 ==Notes*Two works by Friston *Description of Friston's work for Boy's Herald *Illustrations from Carmilla *Illustration of Chartist Riots at Newport *Friston's oil painting \\"Sunday\\" (1862) *Illustration of a pantomime at Drury Lane for The Illustrated London News, 8 January 1876, reprinted in Daily Life in Victorian England by Sally Mitchell, p. 214 (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1996) *Illustration of Princess Ida at the Savoy Theatre, 19 January 1884, from the Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News. *Large copy of Friston's first depiction of Holmes Category:English illustrators Category:People associated with Gilbert and Sullivan Category:People of the Victorian era Category:1820 births Category:1906 deaths ","title":"David Henry Friston"},{"id":"20562765","text":"Dennis John Whitty (1941 ‚Äì 17 December 1963) was, along with his accomplice Russell Pascoe, the third-to-last prisoner to be executed by hanging in a British prison. Whitty had been convicted for his part in the murder of 64-year-old Cornish farmer William Garfield Rowe on 14 August 1963. ==Murder of William RoweBackground=== During 1963, Whitty and 23-year-old Pascoe were living with three young women in a caravan at Kenwyn Caravan Park, on the outskirts of Truro, Cornwall. Whitty was working as a labourer at Truro Gas Works. Pascoe had previously worked as a labourer at Nanjarrow Farm, at Constantine, near Falmouth, and knew the farmer, William Rowe. Rowe was somewhat reclusive, living in the untidy sitting room of his farmhouse, the four bedrooms unoccupied after his mother and brother had died. Local rumour held that Rowe had a large sum of money concealed on the premises, and he had been the victim of a burglary in 1960, during which ¬£200 and some other items had been stolen.David Mudd, \\"Double Hanging for ¬£4 at Constantine\\", Murder in the Westcountry, Bossiney Books, 1975, pp. 90‚Äì100 ===Murder=== On the night of Wednesday, 14 August 1963, Whitty and Pascoe travelled to Nanjarrow on Pascoe's motorcycle. They were armed with a starting pistol, a knife and an iron bar. Whitty was wearing dark jeans and a dark, double-breasted blazer with silver buttons. When they knocked on Rowe's door at around 11.00 pm and the old man opened it, Whitty used this uniform-like clothing to support a story that they had crashed a helicopter nearby, and he asked to use Rowe's telephone. They then attacked Rowe; Whitty with the knife and Pascoe with the iron bar, leaving the farmer dead with six or seven wounds to the head, a fractured skull, a broken jaw, a severed finger and five chest wounds, including one knife wound to the heart. They searched the house for the money, but came away with only ¬£4 that Pascoe found in a piano, and Whitty's haul of a watch, two boxes of matches and some keys. They split the money and took ¬£2 each, returning to the caravan at Truro. The girls they lived with later testified that Whitty was \\"grinning all over his face\\", and that Pascoe was seen wiping blood from Whitty's face. The following day, Pascoe's girlfriend confronted Whitty with a copy of the evening newspaper, which contained details of Rowe's murder. She asked Whitty, \\"You went to Constantine. Did you do this?\\" Whitty replied, \\"Yes I did.\\" The girl later claimed that Whitty and Pascoe threatened to kill the girls if they told anyone what they knew. ===Arrest and trial=== On 16 August, a policeman saw Pascoe riding his motorcycle in Constantine, stopped him and asked him to report for routine questioning at the murder headquarters. Pascoe claimed that he had been in the caravan in Truro at the time of the murder, but when Pascoe admitted knowing Rowe and working for him in the past, the police realised that Pascoe had worked for Rowe at the time of the burglary in 1960. Whitty was then also brought in for questioning. The following day, each man was questioned and told that they were suspected of committing the murder. Whitty and Pascoe each blamed each other, with Whitty accusing Pascoe of beating Rowe with the iron bar, and then forcing Whitty to use the knife. Whitty admitted stabbing Rowe but stated, \\"Pascoe made me stick him.\\" Pascoe told the police that Whitty had instigated the attack, admitting only to knocking Rowe out with the iron bar. He claimed that Whitty \\"went mad with the knife\\", then took the bar from Pascoe and repeatedly struck Rowe with it. When charged and cautioned, Whitty replied, \\"We are both over twenty-one, so I suppose we can hang?\\" He subsequently gave a written statement outlining the events on the night of the murder, and his claim that Pascoe had forced him into continuing the attack on Rowe. At Rowe's farmhouse, police found a small diary in a desk, with descriptive notes written in Esperanto, referring to the whereabouts of various sums of money. Having translated the notes, the executors of Rowe's will used them to find a number of caches of money, including in a safe set in concrete, covered by straw in a cowshed; and a large glass jar containing hundreds of banknotes, hidden elsewhere on the property. The full amount that was eventually found was not revealed, but was referred to as \\"thousands of pounds\\". At the trial at Bodmin Assizes, beginning on 29 October, the murder was described as \\"brutal and savage in the extreme\\". Whitty was defended by Mr Norman Skelhorn, QC, who entered a plea of 'not guilty'. Skelhorn claimed that Whitty had either been acting under the influence of Pascoe, or that Whitty's psychiatric background was such that he may be guilty of manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility. He clarified that Whitty was suffering from a hysterical condition and experienced blackouts. Whitty himself claimed that he had seen \\"strange and unnatural things\\", such as doors opening on their own and pictures changing places on walls overnight. He also said he believed in ghosts and had seen \\"a figure with wings\\" on a beach one night. A key defence witness was 19-year-old student (and future Liberal Party politician) David Penhaligon, whose father was the owner of the caravan site where Pascoe and Whitty had been living with the three girls. He testified that Whitty was prone to epileptic fits which (Whitty claimed) caused him to be violent. The jury debated for four and a half hours before returning with guilty verdicts for both Whitty and Pascoe, and they were sentenced to death by the Judge, Mr Justice Thesiger. On 2 November 1963, the two men were driven to separate prisons: Whitty to Winchester Prison and Pascoe to Horfield Prison in Bristol. ===Appeal and execution=== On 23 November, Whitty and Pascoe's appeals were heard and rejected by the Court of Appeal, and the executions were set for Tuesday, 17 December. Clemency was refused first by Home Secretary Henry Brooke and then by the Queen. Whitty was executed by Robert Leslie Stewart (assisted by Harry Robinson) at Winchester at 8.00 am on 17 December and was buried in an unmarked grave within the walls of the prison. Among the protestors outside Winchester Prison were Whitty's fianc√©e, Bridget Hamilton (who collapsed as a clock chimed the execution hour) and a group of Quakers. Pascoe was executed at Horfield by Harry Allen (assisted by Royston Rickard) at exactly the same time. Only two more prisoners were subsequently executed in Britain, in August 1964: Peter Allen (hanged by Stewart) and Gwynne Evans (hanged by Allen), for the murder of John Alan West. Pascoe's last moments were the subject of a BBC documentary in 2012, presented by Gethin Jones. ==References== Category:1941 births Category:1963 deaths Category:1963 in England Category:20th-century executions by England and Wales Category:20th-century executions of British people Category:Executed British people Category:People executed for murder Category:1963 murders in the United Kingdom ","title":"Dennis Whitty"},{"id":"20562769","text":"Paul Hamilton Hume White (26 February 1910 ‚Äì 21 December 1992) was an Australian missionary, evangelist, radio program host and author. ==Early life and missionary work== White was born in Bowral, New South Wales. After studying medicine at the University of Sydney, he married Mary Bellingham and together they travelled to Tanganyika Territory (now part of Tanzania) as Church Missionary Society (CMS) missionaries in 1938, where White established a hospital at Mvumi Mission which soon replaced Kilimatinde as the main medical centre of the CMS mission in Tanganyika. White succeeded Dr Cyril Wallace as the medical secretary of the Diocese of Central Tanganyika in 1939. In 1941 after only two years in missionary work White had to return to Australia due to his wife's illness.Church Missionary Society Archive, Section IV: Africa Missions, p23 On the way home, he developed a boil in, to use his own words, 'a place which caused me to take a pillow, cut a hole in it, and sit very carefully (!)'source not stated by original Wikipedia contributor but tallies broadly with Alias Jungle Doctor, pages 123, 124 Unable to take part in the shipboard entertainment he started to write.source not stated by original Wikipedia contributor but tallies broadly with Alias Jungle Doctor, page 127 From this came his first missionary book, Doctor of Tanganyika, which is factual and contains many photographs taken by White himself, to illustrate how missionary work was carried out under such primitive settings, with the local Chigogo people. ==Published work== Following his return to Australia, White went on to write Jungle Doctor,Alias Jungle Doctor, pages 128, 129 the first in an extensive series bearing the same name, which have been translated into more than 80 languages.source not stated by original Wikipedia contributor but tallies broadly with list of over 70 languages on page 227 of Alias Jungle Doctor At the same time he began his Jungle Doctor radio program, which continued for 25 years. His books are based in Africa and depict African folklore and missionary adventure. Many of White's stories include moral teaching. They tell of surgical operations in the wild using the most basic equipment and the very colourful people of Africa, including his friend Daudi (David) Matama, and quite often striking against the village witchdoctors who relied on black magic to gain power. Several stories are tales of good winning against evil. Although the stories are fiction, they are based on fact, based on White's own, as well as other people's experiences. Original editions were illustrated by Graham Wade, who also produced Jungle Doctor comic strips. White then authored six 'Fable' books, in the form of the traditional African 'round the fire' storytelling, incorporating Christian moral lessons. They are Jungle Doctor's Fables, Jungle Doctor's Tug of War, Jungle Doctor's Monkey Tales, Jungle Doctor's Hippo Happenings, Jungle Doctor's Rhino Rumblings and Jungle Doctor Meets Mongoose. Some of the Jungle Doctor stories were released on record in the 1960s, with White himself narrating them. ==Other work== As well as pioneering Christian media in the form of both radio and television in Australia, White was active in student evangelism and is credited with revitalising evangelical Christian student groups in Australia after World War II.Biographical Dictionary of Christian Missions, p729 He became general secretary of the Intervarsity Fellowship in 1943. White also continued to practice medicine on a part-time basis right up until his death. ==Death== White died on 21 December 1992, aged 82.

They signed with A&M; Records who eagerly sent them away to record their 1st album in Brussels, Belgium. During the recording of their CCATNB songs a change in musical direction began.

Boyer, 113 U.S. 689 (1885), was a suit in error brought in a state court of Pennsylvania for an injunction restraining the commissioners of Schuylkill County from levying a county tax for the year 1883 upon certain shares in the Pennsylvania National Bank, an association organized under the National Banking Act. The suit proceeds upon the ground that such levy violates the act of Congress prescribing conditions upon state taxation of national bank shares in this, that \\"other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens\\" of that county is exempted by the laws of Pennsylvania from such taxation. A demurrer to the bill was sustained and the suit was dismissed. Upon appeal to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, that judgment was affirmed on the ground that the laws of the state under which the defendants sought to justify the taxation were not repugnant to the act of Congress.Boyer v. Boyer, 113 U.S. 689 (1885) Justia.com ==RulingConstruction of the act=== The Court has had occasion to examine the provisions of the National Banking Act in several other cases recently determined; and from these cases may be deduced certain rules for the construction of that act: #That the words \\"at a greater rate than is assessed upon other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens\\" refer to the entire process of assessment, which, in the case of National bank shares, includes both their valuation and the rate of percentage on such valuation; consequently, that the act of Congress is violated if, in connection with a fixed percentage applicable to the valuation alike of national bank shares and of other moneyed investments or capital, the state law establishes or permits a mode of assessment by which such shares are valued higher in proportion to their real value than is other moneyed capital. #That a state law which permits individual citizens to deduct their just debts from the valuation of their personal property of every kind other than national bank shares, or which permits the taxpayer to deduct from the sum of his credits, money at interest or other demands to the extent of his bona fide indebtedness, leaving the remainder to be taxed, while it denies the same right of deduction from the cash value of bank shares operates to tax the latter at a greater rate than other moneyed capital. These decisions show that in whatever form the question has arisen, this Court has steadily kept in view the intention of Congress not to permit any substantial discrimination in favor of moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens as against capital invested in the shares of national banks. In People v. Weaver, the Court said: > As Congress was conferring a power on the states which they would not > otherwise have had, to tax these shares, it undertook to impose a > restriction on the exercise of that power, manifestly designed to prevent > taxation which should discriminate against that class of property as > compared with other moneyed capital. In permitting the states to tax these > shares, it was foreseen that the states might be disposed to tax the capital > invested in these banks oppressively. This might have been prevented by > fixing limit on the amount. But Congress, with due regard to the dignity of > the states and with a desire to interfere only so far as was necessary to > protect the banks from anything beyond their equal share of the public > burdens, said you may tax the real estate of the banks as other real estate > is bank as the personal property of the taxed, and you may tax the shares of > the bank as the personal property of the owner, to the same extent you tax > other moneyed capital invested in your state. It was conceived that by this > qualification of the power of taxation equality would be secured and > injustice prevented. ===Laws of Pennsylvania=== The court then considered whether the laws of Pennsylvania, under which defendants propose to levy a tax for county purposes upon the plaintiff's shares of stock, are open to the objection that they violate the principle of equality which the act of Congress intended to establish between capital invested in such shares and other moneyed capital. By a law of that state passed March 31, 1870‚Äîupon which the defense mainly rests‚Äîit is provided > That all the shares of national banks, located within this state, and of > banks and savings institutions incorporated by this state, shall be taxable > for state purposes at the rate of three mills [subsequently four] per annum > upon the assessed value thereof, and for county, school, municipal, and > local purposes at the same rate as now is or may hereafter be assessed and > imposed upon other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens of > this state. ===Act of June 10, 1881=== This brought the court to the Act of June 10, 1881, whereby mortgages, moneys owing by solvent debtors, whether by promissory note, penal or single bill, bond or judgment, articles of agreement and accounts bearing interest, except notes or bills for work and labor done, obligations to banks for money loaned, bank notes, shares of stock in banks, banking or saving institutions or companies, then or thereafter incorporated under any law of Pennsylvania, public loans or stocks except those issued by that state or the United States, money loaned or invested in any other state, and all other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens of that state are declared \\"to be, and are hereby, taxable for state purposes at the rate of four mills on the dollar of the value thereof annually, provided that all mortgages, judgments, and recognizances whatsoever, and all moneys due or owing upon articles of agreement for the sale of real estate, shall, after the passage of this act, be exempt from all taxation except for state purposes, provided the provisions of this act shall not apply to building and loan associations,\\" the money loaned by them being subjected to the same tax as money loaned by individuals. By the second section of the same act, all corporations paying interest on a loan or loans, taxable for state purposes, whether secured by bond, mortgage, recognizance, or otherwise, are required to report to the Auditor General annually the amount of such indebtedness owned by residents of Pennsylvania, and to pay into the state treasury four mills upon every dollar of such indebtedness, such tax to be deducted by the corporation paying it from the interest on such indebtedness, whereupon \\"such indebtedness, whether secured by bond, mortgage, judgment, or otherwise, shall be exempt from other taxation in the hands of the holders thereof.\\" Laws Penn. 1881, p. 99\\\\. According to the high court: > Unless we greatly misapprehend the effect of this legislation, a very large > amount of property, made subject by the act of 1844 to taxation for both > state and county purposes, has since been relieved from the burdens of > county taxation, while the imposition by the act of 1870 upon national bank > shares of local taxation at the same rate as was at the latter date, or has > been since, imposed upon other moneyed capital in the hands of individual > citizens of the state, leaves such shares subject to taxation as provided in > the act of 1844. The burden of county taxation imposed by the latter act has > at all events been removed from all bonds or certificates of loan issued by > any railroad company incorporated by the state, from shares of stock in the > hands of stockholders of any institution or company of the state which, in > its corporate capacity, is liable to pay a tax into the state treasury under > the act of 1859; from mortgages, judgments, and recognizances of every kind; > from moneys due or owing upon articles of agreement for the sale of real > estate; from all loans, however made, by corporations, which are taxable for > state purposes, when such corporations pay into the state treasury the > required tax on such indebtedness. As the present case comes before us upon > demurrer to the bill, we have excepting the allegations of the latter, no > means of determining the value of the capital thus exempted from the county > taxation which is imposed upon capital invested in national bank shares. > After referring to the acts of 1870 and 1881, the bill charges: \\"That for > the year 1881, as is shown by the public report and by the books of the > Auditor General of Pennsylvania, the sum of $1,692,938.66 was paid into the > state treasury as tax upon the capital stock of such corporations by them in > their corporate capacity, which sum of money was paid upon a gross capital > stock of the corporations paying the same of the value, approximately > stated, of 564 millions of dollars.\\" \\"That it appears, as is shown by the > books and published report of the Secretary of Internal Affairs for the year > 1881, that the total valuation throughout the state for that year of\\" \\"all > mortgages, money owing by solvent debtors, whether by promissory note, penal > or single bill, bond, or judgment, also all articles of agreement and > accounts bearing interest, owned or possessed by any person or persons > whatsoever (except notes or bills for work or labor done, and all > obligations given to banks for money loaned and bank notes), and all public > loans or stocks whatsoever except those issued by this state or the United > States, and all moneys loaned or invested on interest in any other state, > and all other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens of the > state,\\" \\"amounts to $74,931,765.\\" \\"That for the same year, as is shown by > the books and published reports of the Auditor General, a tax was paid into > the state treasury upon corporation and municipal loans, not probably > included in the foregoing sum, upon an aggregate valuation of > $51,404,162.50.\\" \\"That by the provisions of section 1 of the Act of June 10, > 1881 (P.L. 99), all mortgages, judgments, and recognizances whatsoever, and > all moneys due or owing upon articles of agreement for the sale of real > estate, were exempt from all taxation except for state purposes.\\" \\"That > section 2 of said act of 1881 exempts from local taxation in the hands of > the holders thereof all loans issued by corporations paying interest thereon > where such corporations pay into the state treasury the state tax of four > mills on each dollar thereof, and by Act of May 1, 1854 (P.L. 535),\\" \\"all > bonds or certificates of indebtedness of any railroad company incorporated > by this commonwealth be, and the same shall be, liable to taxation for state > purposes only.\\" \\"That the total paid-in capital of all the state banks and > savings institutions in said commonwealth, other than national banks, as > appears by the books and published reports of the Auditor General for the > year 1881, is $7,161,740.68, while the total paid-in capital of the national > banks located within said state in said year amounted to $57,452,051.\\" The > demurrer, of course, admits these allegations of fact to be true. Their > materiality is not affected by the circumstance that they are stated to > appear, also, upon the books and published reports of the Auditor General > and the Secretary of Internal Affairs of Pennsylvania. Upon such facts and > in view of the revenue laws of the state, it seems difficult to avoid the > conclusion that in respect of county taxation of national bank shares, there > has been and is such a discrimination in favor of other moneyed capital > against capital invested in such shares as is not consistent with the > legislation of Congress. The exemptions in favor of other moneyed capital > appear to be of such a substantial character in amount as to take the > present case out of the operation of the rule that it is not absolute > equality that is contemplated by the act of Congress; a rule which rests > upon the ground that exact uniformity or equality of taxation cannot, in the > nature of things, be expected or attained under any system. But as > substantial equality is attainable and is required by the supreme law of the > land in respect of state taxation of national bank shares when the > inequality is so palpable as to show that the discrimination against capital > invested in such shares is serious, the courts have no discretion but to > interfere. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, after referring to Hepburn v. > School Directors as having involved the same question that is now presented > and observing that the exemption is here as there only partial, says: \\"Not > only is some other moneyed capital of a miscellaneous character taxable for > local purposes, but all such capital of the same character as that which you > desire to exempt -- that is to say, the shares of state banks and savings > institutions.\\" Again: \\"The General Assembly has authorized the taxation of > the shares of these banks in no other manner and at no higher rate than > other capital of a similar character.\\" If by this language it is meant that > an illegal discrimination against capital invested in national bank shares > cannot exist where no higher rate or heavier burden of taxation is imposed > upon them than upon capital invested in state bank shares or in state > savings institutions, we have to say that such is not a proper construction > of the act of Congress. Capital invested in national bank shares was > intended to be placed upon the same footing of substantial equality in > respect of taxation by state authority as the state establishes for other > moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens, however invested, > whether in state bank shares or otherwise. As the act of Congress does not > fix a definite limit as to percentage of value beyond which the states may > not tax national bank shares, cases will arise in which it will be difficult > to determine whether the exemption of a particular part of moneyed capital > in individual hands is so serious or material as to infringe the rule of > substantial equality. But unless we have failed to comprehend the scope and > effect of the taxing laws of Pennsylvania, and unless the allegations of the > bill be untrue, the present case is not of that class. Our attention is > called by counsel for the defendants to the fact that Pennsylvania derives > probably her principal revenues from railroads, and therefore has good > reasons to look to her interests as a commonwealth in respect to such > improvements. To this fact he refers the legislation which makes railroad > securities liable to taxation for state purposes only, and exempts them from > local taxation. Upon like grounds, he defends the exemptions made, in > respect of local taxation, in favor of the bonds and shares of other > corporations that pay an annual tax into the state treasury. It is quite > sufficient in respect of such matters to say that this Court has no function > to deal with the considerations of public policy which control that > commonwealth in the assessment of property for purposes of revenue. We have > no duty beyond that of ascertaining the intention of Congress in its > legislation permitting the several states to tax the shares of institutions > organized under national authority for the purpose of providing a national > currency secured by United States bonds. If the principle of substantial > equality of taxation under state authority, as between capital so invested > and other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens, however > invested, operates to disturb the peculiar policy of some of the states in > respect of revenue derived from taxation, the remedy therefor is with > another department of the government, and does not belong to this Court. We > are of opinion that upon the allegations of the bill, the defendants should > have been put to their answer. The facts may then disclose a case quite > different from that made by the bill. What we have said relates to the case > as now presented. The judgment was therefore reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. ==See also== *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 113 ==References * Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Waite Court Category:1885 in United States case law Category:History of Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania Category:Legal history of Pennsylvania Category:1885 in Pennsylvania ","title":"Boyer v.

Sheldrake was raised a Roman Catholic but in 1903 he converted to Islam and changed his name to Khalid. Opening of the Fazl Mosque, London in 1926 In 1920 Sheldrake founded a journal called Britain and India. He also founded the Muslim News Journal and was editor of a monthly magazine called The Minaret. He was awarded an honorary doctorate of literature from Ecuador. Sheldrake helped to found the Fazl Mosque in Southfields, southwest London, which opened in 1926. Sheldrake then founded mosques in Peckham Rye and East Dulwich in southeast London. He founded the Western Islamic Association, which opened a branch in South Shields in 1930. Sheldrake married a woman called Sybil, who converted to Islam and changed her name to Ghazia. They had two sons. They made their family home in suburban Forest Hill, London, from which Sheldrake commuted to the family pickle factory in Denmark Hill. Sheldrake sought to convert fellow- Britons to Islam. In 1932 he conducted the conversion of Gladys Milton Palmer, wife of Bertram Willes Dayrell Brooke, aboard a chartered Imperial Airways 42-seat airliner over the English Channel. Gladys was the daughter of Huntley & Palmers biscuit magnate Walter Palmer, and Brooke was the son of Charles Vyner Brooke, the last Rajah of Sarawak. Sheldrake renamed her \\"Khair-ul- Nissa\\" (\\"Fairest of women\\"). ==King of Islamestan== Map of China with the First East Turkestan Republic marked in red In the early 1930s a series of rebellions among the mostly Muslim population of Xinjiang deprived the Republic of China of control of the region. Several short-lived Islamic states were founded, including the First East Turkestan Republic (commonly called the ETR) and the Khotan Emirate. The ETR sought international recognition but was opposed by all powers with influence in the region: China, Afghanistan, Japan, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom. In 1933 Sheldrake welcomed an ETR delegation to his home in Forest Hill and accepted their invitation to become overlord of \\"Sinkiang\\", soon after he departed for China. En route he visited Muslim communities in the Philippines, Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore. On 3 October 1933 he reached Hong Kong aboard the US ocean liner . In Hong Kong, Sheldrake gave a series of lectures on Islam. He confided to a South China Morning Post reporter that he had been offered kingship of Sinkiang, but swore the reporter to secrecy. The SCMP did not publish the story until 30 March 1934, more than a fortnight after the New York Times had revealed that Sheldrake had accepted the ETR's invitation to become king. Sheldrake travelled via Shanghai to Beijing, where he arrived in May 1934 and took a room in the CIGH H√¥tel. Despite Chinese police surveillance an ETR delegation visited Sheldrake at the h√¥tel and repeated their offer to make him their head of state. Sheldrake accepted the title of \\"His Majesty King Khalid of Islamestan\\". Sheldrake then visited Japan and Thailand to fulfil lecture engagements. [Claiming he represented the Muslim community of Chinese Turkistan as king, Dr. Bertram William Sheldrake traveled widely and gave lectures as a new monarch. Press attention faded quickly.] UK newspapers nicknamed Sheldrake \\"The Pickle King of Tartary\\", \\"The English Emir of Kashgar\\", \\"Lord of the Rooftop of the World\\" and \\"The Suburban King of Tartary\\". Ghazia travelled from London to the Far East to join Sheldrake. Together the couple left Beijing and travelled by camel train toward Kashgar, which was to be their capital. However, by June 1934 Sheldrake's prospects were being undermined by rumours. It was alleged that he wanted to steal Xinjiang's jade deposits, or that he was a UK spy, or that were he crowned king, the UK would control Xinjiang. The Soviet newspaper Izvestia alleged that were Khalid crowned, the British Empire would annex Xinjiang as Japan had done to Manchuria. China and Japan also opposed the intended coronation, and Afghan Muslims withdrew their support. In early August the Sheldrakes were approaching Xinjiang but found that the coalition of factions that created the ETR had disintegrated into violence and Soviet-backed forces led by the warlord Sheng Shicai (Áõõ‰∏ñÊâç) were restoring Chinese control. Without reaching Xinjiang the couple fled to British India with some of the leaders of what had been the ETR. The Sheldrakes stayed in Hyderabad and then returned to England. ==Later life== Sheldrake continued to give lectures on Turkestan after his return to Britain but found little interest. He continued to raise funds for new mosques and Muslim charities. He travelled in north Africa and central Europe, and served his family business by buying sour pickles in Turkey. In World War II he worked for the British Council in Ankara. He returned to the UK in 1944 and died in 1947. ==See also== *White Rajahs ==References== Category:1888 births Category:1947 deaths Category:Converts to Islam Category:Independence activists Category:People from Peckham ","title":"Khalid Sheldrake"},{"id":"20562875","text":"Kuvaputki is a multi-angle DVD by Embryoroom produced and directed by Edward Quist and co-produced by Derek Gruen aka Del Marquis, with music by Pan Sonic, the Finnish experimental electronic music duo consisting of Mika Vainio and Ilpo V√§is√§nen.

It was founded as a small sandwich shop in 1947 by brothers Robert and James Paschal, who worked together on their foodservice ventures for over 50 years until Robert's death in 1997. James Paschal continued to preside over the company until his death in 2008. Today Paschal's operates a restaurant in the Castleberry Hill section of Atlanta, a foodservice outlet at Hartsfield‚ÄìJackson Atlanta International Airport, and is a food vendor for other US airports and grocery stores. ==Early historySandwich shop=== In 1947 the Paschal brothers, Robert (1909-1997) and James (1920-2008), originally from Thomson, Georgia, opened Paschal's Sandwich Shop at 837 West Hunter Street (since renamed Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive) in Atlanta. Located in the black business district in proximity to downtown, the luncheonette had no kitchen space; Robert prepared the food at his home and sent it by taxi to the shop, as the brothers did not own a car. Only sandwiches and soda were on the menu, and the house specialty was a 52-cent fried chicken sandwich which was Robert's own recipe. The following year, the brothers acquired an adjoining property to bring seating capacity up to 75. ===Restaurant=== The sandwich shop was a success and by the late 1950s the business was in need of larger quarters. In 1959 the brothers moved the operation across the street to a larger facility at what is today 830 Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive. In 1966, Ebony magazine described Paschal's Restaurant as a \\"large attractive brick building with soda fountain and booths in front and a large dining room in the rear\\". With Robert serving as head chef and recipe developer, the restaurant became known for its soul food menu, including fried chicken, collard greens, cornbread, sweet potato pie, and peach cobbler. The restaurant was noted for being a place where whites and blacks were welcome, as were homosexuals. It was one of the first to seat black and white customers at the same tables, in an era when segregated seating was the norm. Although Paschal's had \\"colored only\\" business and liquor licenses, the brothers openly disregarded the law and served white and black clientele alike. The restaurant was the unofficial headquarters for the Civil Rights Movement during the 1960s. Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights leaders frequently convened here for strategy sessions, planning their protest marches, sit-ins, and voter registration drives. Notable patrons included Andrew Young, John Lewis, Julian Bond, Adam Clayton Powell Jr., Stokely Carmichael, Fannie Lou Hamer, Reverends Joseph Lowery and Jesse L. Jackson, Maynard H. Jackson, and Ralph Abernathy. Activists decompressed at Paschal‚Äôs after \\"arrests, death threats and beatings\\", according to Lewis. The Paschal brothers kept the restaurant open all night as a safe haven for black activists returning from jail and as a meeting point for their families. They also posted bond and served free meals for activists. Strategy meetings also took place in the restaurant among white politicians, including Ted Kennedy, Hubert Humphrey, Richard Nixon, and Bill Clinton. ===Jazz club=== In 1960 the Paschal brothers opened the La Carousel Lounge adjacent to the restaurant. The 200-seat venue attracted many top jazz performers, such as Aretha Franklin, Dizzy Gillespie, Ramsey Lewis, and Joe Williams, and was considered Atlanta's \\"jazz mecca\\" in the 1960s and early 1970s. La Carousel was the only nightclub in Atlanta open to black patrons and, like the restaurant, was fully integrated. Celebrity patrons included Muhammad Ali, Gayle Sayers, and Jayne Mansfield. ===Motel=== In 1967 the Paschal brothers erected a six-story, 125-room motel on the property, completing their vision of providing \\"food, drink, merriment, entertainment, and a place to rest up for more all within the confines of one complex\\". The $2 million motel ‚Äì the first African- American owned and operated motel in the city ‚Äì had banquet space for 350, another 160-seat dining room, and a swimming pool. Upon the motel's opening, Room 101 was permanently set aside for Martin Luther King's use. During his 1968 presidential campaign, Robert F. Kennedy maintained an office in the motel and also slept there. Jesse Jackson initiated the planning sessions for his 1984 presidential campaign at the motel. A 1975 article reported that the motel had 92 percent occupancy most of the year. The restaurant, lounge, and motel were closed in 1996. The property was sold for $3 million to Clark Atlanta University, which converted the motel into a student dormitory and conference centre named The Paschal Center. The restaurant's recipes were included in the sale, and Robert's fried chicken continued to be served in the restaurant to students and the public. The university closed the restaurant in 2003 and planned to demolish it, but public outcry led to a $100,000 congressional grant to save the historic structure. In 2004 plans were announced to open a Busy Bee Caf√© at Historic Paschal's. ==Modern day== Southern cuisine at Paschal's Atlanta airport location In 1980 a joint venture of Paschal's and Dobbs House Inc., called Dobbs-Paschal Midfield Corporation, was awarded a 15-year contract to provide foodservice at Hartsfield‚ÄìJackson Atlanta International Airport. In 1995 Paschal's partnered with Concessions International to continue to run foodservice outlets at the airport. By 2008, Paschal's and its partners were providing foodservice to a total of 18 U.S. airports. In 2002 James Paschal and Herman J. Russell opened a $6 million Paschal's Restaurant on Northside Drive in the Castleberry Hill neighborhood of Atlanta. An event space resembling the original La Carousel Lounge was installed in this restaurant. Also in 2002, Paschal's Foods Inc. began selling Paschal's World Famous Chicken Batter Mix on its website and in select stores. Paschal's Foods also sells some items to local grocery stores, including Kroger, Publix, and Harry's Farmers Market. Like the restaurant, this is primarily Southern cuisine. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * ==External links== *Paschal's Radio *Paschal's History *Paschal's Company Site *Paschal's Atlanta Restaurant Site * Paschal's OFFICIAL Facebook Page Category:Food and drink companies established in 1947 Category:History of Atlanta Category:1947 establishments in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Restaurants established in 1947 Category:Restaurants disestablished in 2003 Category:Defunct restaurants in the United States ","title":"Paschal's"},{"id":"20562945","text":"Vineland is an unincorporated community in the southeastern corner of Marengo County, Alabama, United States.

A remarkable feature of the elections was the \\"dead heat\\" in the London County Council between Labour and the Conservatives, who each won 64 seats,The Times, 9 April 1949 with the Liberals retaining one seat, that of Sir Percy Harris in Bethnal Green. Outside London, Labour lost its former control of Middlesex, Essex, Northumberland, and the West Riding of Yorkshire; retained control of Derbyshire, Durham, Glamorgan, Monmouthshire, and Nottinghamshire, but won Carmarthenshire, the only county gained by Labour. ==Background== County Councils were introduced in England and Wales on 22 September 1889 by the Local Government Act of 1888. County councils were responsible for their area's strategic services, with smaller urban district councils and rural district councils responsible for other activities. The writ of the county councils did not extend everywhere: county boroughs were independent of the council for the county in which they were geographically situated, and county borough councils exercised the functions of both county councils and district councils.Edwards, John,'County' in Chambers' Encyclopedia; George Newnes, 1955 pp189‚Äì191 ==1949 County Council election results== The England and Wales County Council elections were held the week April 4‚Äì9, 1949. Prior to 1949 local elections were held in November, so those councillors who were due to retire in November 1948 had their terms extended to April 1949. (Local elections were later moved to the first Thursday of May.) Of the total of 3,879 vacant seats in the 62 counties in which elections were held, about half (1,938) the councillors were returned unopposed, whilst 1,941 seats were contested. The table below,Keesing's Record of World Events (formerly Keesing's Contemporary Archives), Volume VII, April, 1949 United Kingdom, Page 9951 compiled by The Times newspaper, summarises the results, showing candidates returned, and individual gains and losses. ;Summary of results {  border=\\"1\\" - border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" !

All were in Labour held seats and all were retained by Labour but each one showed a movement of votes away from Labour and towards the Conservatives.C. Cook & J. Ramsden, By-elections in British politics UCL Press, 1997 p.285 Cook and Ramsden comment however that there was relatively little in these by-election results to indicate the extent to which the Tories would recover lost ground in the 1950 general election.Cook & Ramsden, op cit p152 However the first by- election to be held after the County and other local elections, in West Leeds on 21 July 1949, showed the largest swing to the Conservatives in any Parliamentary contest for the previous nine months.Cook & Ramsden, op cit p285 Despite the assessment by Cook & Ramsden that the by-elections of 1949 offered little indication that the Tories would do so well in 1950, taken together with the County and other local results, a clear pattern of dissatisfaction with the Labour government can be discerned and a willingness by the electorate to turn again towards the Conservatives. ==General election prospects== After the Second World War local elections came to be accepted increasingly as barometers of the national political mood.D. Butler & G. Butler, British Political Facts, 1900‚Äì1994; Macmillan, 1994 p443 The combined County and Borough election results offered a useful snapshot of public opinion as the Labour government elected in 1945 neared the end of its term of office. ===Conservative reaction=== The influential Conservative peer, Lord Woolton who was chairman of the Tory party between 1946 and 1955, commented that the elections had taken place on a national scale and in effect constituted a miniature general election, indicating how opinion had changed in the country since 1945. The Conservatives especially took heart from the results. Tory leader Winston Churchill told a rally at the Royal Albert Hall that the County Council contests had seen great Conservative victories and there was a prospect of more to come. He forecast that the next general election would be ‚Äòone of the most memorable‚Äô. Anthony Eden told the same meeting that the election results showed the electorate were moving towards the Conservative approaches of lower taxation, halting further nationalisations, providing incentives and the revival of the virtue of thrift.The Times, 30 April 1949 ===Labour reaction=== For Labour, Herbert Morrison told supporters that it was inevitable that Labour would be unable to hold on to the gains it had made in the exceptional years of 1945‚Äì46. He said that Labour would have to learn the lessons of the election results, particularly tactical ones about how and in which constituencies the Tories chose to fight the hardest and put the greatest resources. This was a theme taken up in The Times leader of 14 May 1949 when it was commented that the Conservative Party machine had made great strides under Lord Woolton's direction and was now capable of enthusing its supporters and getting them to the polls in great numbers.The Times, 14 May 1949, p5 However, in policy terms Morrison seemed reluctant to learn lessons, saying Labour needed more of the same and arguing for further attacks on ‚Äòpowerful vested interests‚Äô to transform great private economic interests into public concerns,The Times, 2 May 1949 a call for more nationalisation and state regulation. ===Liberal reaction=== As for the Liberals, they had read the writing on the wall. In late 1949 they persuaded Lloyd's of London to insure their candidates‚Äô deposits for the next general election. For the sum of ¬£5,000 Lloyds agreed to pay for all deposits lost after the first 50 up to 250.Liberal News, 28 October 1949 p1 This turned out to be a shrewd deal as 319 of the 475 candidates the Liberal Party put up at the 1950 general election lost their deposits, amounting to two thirds of the total number of candidates standing.J.

In 1952, it was converted into the largest passenger ship ever to operate in the Great Lakes. ==Ship History== Originally named the Marine Star, the Aquarama was built in 1945 by Sun Shipbuilding & Drydock Co., Chester, Pennsylvania as a United States Maritime Commission C4-S-B5 type of ship.Aquarama-Marine Star, Welcome to Forgotten Buffalo. 2008. Web. 3 December 2008. Designed as a transoceanic troop carrier, the ship made one trip across the Atlantic before combat ceased. The ship remained unused for a few years until it was bought in 1952 by the Sand Products Company of Detroit.The Marine Star - AKA The Aquarama , Western New York Heritage Press. 2005. Web. 3 December 2008. After being purchased, the ship was towed to Muskegon, Michigan where it was converted into a commercial passenger ship. The entire process took approximately two years to complete and cost nearly $8 million.The Aquarama, The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History. 11 Mar. 1998. Web. 4 December 2008. The president of the Sand Products Company at the time, Max Mckee, wanted the Aquarama to be an ocean liner for the Great Lakes. The Aquarama began operation in 1956 by touring various Great Lakes ports. In 1957 the Michigan-Ohio Navigation Company, began service from Detroit to Cleveland, carrying automobiles and passengers. Once in service, the ship was able to transport its passengers and their automobiles from Detroit to Cleveland in under six hours. Although the ship was immensely popular, it never generated enough revenue to be self- supporting; On September 4, 1962 the ship made its last trip before being towed to Muskegon, Michigan. Operating the ship from Muskegon, Michigan to Milwaukee as a replacement for the older Milwaukee Clipper was proposed, but $700,000 for dredging so the Aquarama could be accommodated in Milwaukee harbor was needed. As a result, the ship sat idle until 1987 when it was sold to the North Shore Farming Company for around $3 million. The Aquarama was briefly docked at Sarnia, then Windsor before returning to its original name of Marine Star and moving under tow to Buffalo. On August 3, 1995 the Marine Star berthed at the Cargill Pool Elevator where it stayed until it was towed overseas to Aliaƒüa, Turkey for scrap in September of 2007. The SS Aquarama docked in Buffalo, New York (March 2007) ==Capacity and Safety== As a cruise liner, the Aquarama was able to carry 2,500 passengers and 160 automobiles. Some of the ship's safety features included its all-steel construction, the smoke detection system, four 135-passenger lifeboats, the latest in radar, and closed circuit television for viewing the stern. ==Entertainment== On the ship there were numerous sources of entertainment for the passengers. Among many other things there was a \\"carnival room\\" that had a gift shop, games, and a photo booth. Two television theaters were available to be used for conferences or special programs.

The youngest son of painter Philipp Franck, Carl Ludwig was born in Berlin and studied jurisprudence in W√ºrzburg and Freiburg from 1922 to 1926. Continuing his studies under the architect and artist Hans Poelzig, he spent another four years, 1926‚Äì1930 at the Technical University of Berlin and, for the next two years, until 1932, worked as an assistant at the Franz Masser architectural firm. A scholarship enabled him to study in Rome during 1932‚Äì33, until opening his own architectural firm in 1936. Concern over the safety of his Jewish wife and their family in Hitler's Germany prompted the move to England in September 1937.

Brown. (2006.) Sir Philip Randle, The Lancet, 368(9548):1644. For his doctoral thesis entitled \\"Studies on the Metabolic Action of Insulin\\", he was awarded his Ph.D. in 1955 and was immediately appointed Lecturer in Biochemistry at the University. ==Career== In 1964 he was appointed founding Professor of Biochemistry at the University of Bristol where he built a strong department which carried out original research into mitochondrial transporters, molecular enzymology, protein structure, and mammalian metabolism. In 1975 he moved to be founding professor and chairman of the Department of Clinical Biochemistry at Oxford, holding the post until 1993. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1983 and was President of the Biochemical Society from 1995 to 2000. He was knighted in 1975. ==Research== Randle was a prominent diabetes mellitus researcher who described the eponymous Randle Cycle of carbohydrate and fat metabolism. This resulted from work to test the theory that cardiac and skeletal muscle can alternate between carbohydrate and fat as their energy source. The Randle Cycle describes how the products of fatty acid oxidation in muscle reduces the use of glucose, allowing individuals to switch between fuels according to their carbohydrate intake and suggests a potential mechanism for the development of hyperglaecemia and type 2 diabetes. He went on to monitor individuals on a low carbohydrate diet and those with non-insulin dependent diabetes. The results were in agreement with the mechanism he described, suggesting that the key factor in the development of diabetes could be the excessive release of fatty acids in muscle tissue. The mechanism is still the subject of debate and further research. ==Personal life== Randle was married to Elizabeth Harrison (d. 2004) and had son Peter and three daughters, Susan, Sally, and Rosalind. ==References== Category:1926 births Category:2006 deaths Category:People from Nuneaton Category:Alumni of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge Category:Alumni of the UCL Medical School Category:Academics of the University of Oxford Category:English biochemists Category:20th-century English medical doctors Category:Fellows of the Royal Society ","title":"Philip Randle"},{"id":"20563129","text":"Bachelor's Hope is a historic home located at Chaptico, St. Mary's County, Maryland.

Scott Berg, which tells the story, life, and his experiences with actress Katharine Hepburn. The book was released 12 days after Hepburn's death at 96 on June 29. The book received mixed reviews. ==Synopsis== Published within days of her death at 96, this life of Katharine Hepburn is able to take her to her final hours, following her career from her aristocratic, fresh-faced, and slightly audacious youth to her extreme old age. A. Scott Berg knew Hepburn for the last 20 years of her life, and his book is not only the biography of a beloved actress but a tribute to a friend to whom she told the truth about her life, including her great loves and pet hates, with an eye to its eventual publication. ==Friendship with Hepburn== Berg was a personal friend of Hepburn, after meeting her in 1983. He told her he wanted to write a biography about her life and she helped him, providing information about her life. Berg told Hepburn he would release the book after her death. ==Reception== Reviews were mixed after the book was released. Gossip columnist Liz Smith, a friend of Hepburn's, said that Berg's book was \\"Self-promoting fakery ‚Ä¶. Hepburn would have despised it and his betrayal of her friendship.\\" Berg later issued this written statement via his publisher, G.P.

The court did not state that all prisoners should be given voting rights. Rather, it held that if the franchise was to be removed, then the measure needed to be compatible with Article 3 of the First Protocol, thus putting the onus upon the UK to justify its departure from the principle of universal suffrage. ==Facts== John Hirst, a post-tariff prisoner then serving a sentence for manslaughter,. See also, from the same individual, a claim regarding delay in parole, [2001] ECHR 481. was prevented from voting by section 3 of the Representation of the People Act 1983, which prohibits convicted prisoners from voting during their incarceration in a penal institution. In 2001, Hirst brought a case to the High Court, but the case was dismissed. He lodged an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg later in 2001. ==Judgment== In 2004, the Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights, recorded in Hirst v UK (No 2) (2006) 42 EHRR 41, ruled unanimously that there had been a violation of Hirst's human right under Article 3 of the First Protocol. The UK lodged an appeal to the Grand Chamber and on 6 October 2005 it found in favour of Hirst by a majority of twelve to five. The Court found that the restriction of prisoners' voting rights violated Protocol 1, Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights; Once a case has been decided by the ECtHR, it falls to the Committee of Ministers to supervise execution of the Court's judgment. The British Government initially attempted to introduce legislation to give prisoners the right to vote. This was rejected by the British Parliament and the Government has repeatedly stated since then that prisoners will not be given the right to vote in spite of the ruling.BBC News, 24 October 2012 In the UK, the court was criticized for allegedly being over-intrusive in areas considered to be the domain of domestic courts and parliament; Kenneth Clarke and Dominic Grieve claimed that the court does not give sufficient margin of appreciation to states, a controversy being the court's requirement that the UK liberalize voting rights for prisoners, a decision called \\"completely unacceptable\\" by David Cameron. Cameron also claimed that the concept of human rights was being \\"distorted\\" and \\"discredited\\" by the ECtHR, because reasonable decisions made at a national level were not respected by the court. ==Significance== The starting point in the European Convention in article 1 is that \\"the High Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of this Convention\\" (emphasis added). The Court added: \\"It follows from this provision that the States Parties are answerable for any violation of the protected rights and freedoms of anyone within their ‚Äújurisdiction‚Äù ‚Äì or competence ‚Äì at the time of the violation... ...However, it must be reiterated that, for the purposes of the Convention, the sole issue of relevance is the State's international responsibility, irrespective of the national authority to which the breach of the Convention in the domestic system is imputable... ...Even though it is not inconceivable that States will encounter difficulties in securing compliance with the rights guaranteed by the Convention in all parts of their territory, each State Party to the Convention nonetheless remains responsible for events occurring anywhere within its national territory. Further, the Convention does not merely oblige the higher authorities of the Contracting States themselves to respect the rights and freedoms it embodies; it also has the consequence that, in order to secure the enjoyment of those rights and freedoms, those authorities must prevent or remedy any breach at subordinate levels...The higher authorities of the State are under a duty to require their subordinates to comply with the Convention and cannot shelter behind their inability to ensure that it is respected... ...The general duty imposed on the State by Article 1 of the Convention entails and requires the implementation of a national system capable of securing compliance with the Convention throughout the territory of the State for everyone. That is confirmed by the fact that, firstly, Article 1 does not exclude any part of the member States' ‚Äújurisdiction‚Äù from the scope of the Convention and, secondly, it is with respect to their ‚Äújurisdiction‚Äù as a whole ‚Äì which is often exercised in the first place through the Constitution ‚Äì that member States are called on to show compliance with the Convention...The authorities of a territorial entity of the State are public-law institutions which perform the functions assigned to them by the Constitution and the law. In that connection, the Court reiterates that in international law the expression ‚Äúgovernmental organisation‚Äù cannot be held to refer only to the government or the central organs of the State. Where powers are distributed along decentralised lines, it refers to any national authority exercising public functions\\".

Following the dissolution of Tecton, the project was realised by Lubetkin, Francis Skinner and Douglas Carr Bailey. The project was completed in 1954. ==Location== Located in Cruikshank Street, London WC1, the scheme is built on the site of the bomb-destroyed Holford Square in Finsbury. It incorporates the main building of Bevin Court, plus the smaller Holford House (which echoes the form of its larger neighbour) and Amwell House (itself of interest as a modernist interpretation of the bay- fronted Victorian terrace). The group of buildings as a whole reflects Lubetkin's respect for the pre-existing urban environment, a characteristic that makes his work stand out from that of many modernist architects of his generation. Post war austerity had imposed far greater budgetary constraints than in Tecton's housing showpiece Spa Green Estate, forcing Lubetkin to strip the project of the basic amenities he had planned; there were to be no balconies, community centre or nursery school. Instead Lubetkin focused his energies on the social space. Fusing his aesthetic and political concerns he created a stunning constructivist staircase ‚Äî a social condenser that forms the heart of the building. ==History== Berthold Lubetkin's staircase in Bevin Court, London, after repainting circa 2014 The building occupies the site of the 1902‚Äì03 home of Lenin, which he occupied while in exile editing the Russian socialist newspaper Iskra (Spark).Simpson, Theo. \\"Bevin Court occupies the site of Lenin's former home while he was exiled in London in 1902\\" (The Independent) In honour of the Soviet leader, the building was initially planned to be named \\"Lenin Court\\". In addition the building was to incorporate Lubetkin's memorial to Lenin, which had been located on the site of Holford Square since 1942. However the memorial proved unpopular with the public and was repeatedly vandalised, to the extent that it required a 24-hour police guard. The end of World War II marked the end of the brief thaw in Anglo- Russian relations and Finsbury Council lost their enthusiasm for both the memorial and the proposed name for the building. When it became clear that the Borough were no longer willing to keep the memorial on site Lubetkin buried its remains under the central core of the staircase. The proposed site of the monument (to the right of the main entrance) and a viewing aperture designed to allow the building's porter to oversee its wellbeing exist to this day. Before the building was completed the Cold War had intensified and as a result the scheme was renamed Bevin Court (honouring Britain's firmly anti-communist foreign secretary Ernest Bevin). On 28 September 2013, Bevin Court became the first council residential building to unveil a commemorative plaque, dedicated to the artist Cyril Mann who lived and worked there between 1956 and 1964. Notably, the building successfully made significant use of prefabricated floor and wall components.

He made his Manchester United debut on 20 August 1960, playing at centre half in a 3‚Äì1 home defeat to Blackburn Rovers.

In the motion picture industry a China Girl is a type of test film, an image of a woman accompanied by color bars that appears for a few frames (typically one to four) in the reel leader. A \\"China Girl\\" was used by the lab technician for calibration purposes when processing the film (with the still photography equivalent being a \\"Shirley Card\\").Garage Sale Cineaste: China Girls The origin of the term is a matter of some disputeOrigins of \\"China Girl\\" (archived) but is usually accepted to be a reference to the models used to create the frames - either they were actually china (porcelain) mannequins, or the make-up worn by the live models made them appear to be mannequins. Originally the \\"China Girl\\" frames were created in-house by laboratories to varying standards, but in the mid-1970s engineers from the Eastman Kodak Company developed the Laboratory Aim Density system as a means of simplifying the production of motion picture prints. Under the LAD system, Kodak created many duplicate negatives of a single China Girl and provided them to laboratories to include in their standard leaders. These LAD frames were exposed to specific guidelines and allowed a laboratory technician to quickly make a subjective evaluation of a print's exposure and colour tone by looking at the China Girl herself. If a more objective evaluation were required, a densitometer could be used to compare the density of the colour patches in the LAD frame with Kodak's published guidelines. In keeping with changes to the modern laboratory process, Kodak also provide a \\"Digital LAD\\" to be incorporated in the film-out process to check the accuracy of the film printer and processor.

She was usually called Anna. ==Early life== A young Anna. Anna was the youngest of the three children of Prince Charles of Prussia and Princess Marie of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. As a beautiful young princess, she was the object of much attention at court. In the winter of 1852, the young Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria met her in Berlin, fell in love, and wished to propose to her. His mother, Archduchess Sophie of Austria, wrote to her sister Queen Elisabeth of Prussia referring to \\"the happiness that showed itself to him like a fleeting dream and made an impression on his heart -- alas -- much stronger and deeper than I had first thought.\\"Hamann, Brigitte. Elisabeth. Kaiserin wider Willen. Munich, 1981, p. 8. However, Anna was already engaged at that time, and as an added complication, there were strong feelings against an alliance with Austria among Prussian statesmen. Franz Joseph's mother asked, \\"whether there is any hope that this sad marriage, which they are imposing on this charming Anna and which leaves her no prospect of happiness whatsoever, could be prevented,\\" but to no avail. Sophie predicted that Anna's marriage to her betrothed, Frederick William of Hesse-Kassel, would be unhappy, which turned out to be correct. ==Marriage and issue== On 26 May 1853, Anna married her second cousin Prince Frederick William of Hesse-Kassel at Charlottenburg Palace in Berlin. Anna was the second wife of her new husband, who nine years previously had experienced the traumatic death in childbirth of his beloved first wife, Grand Duchess Alexandra Nikolaevna of Russia. He never got over this loss, which took place less than a year after his wedding to Alexandra. Like Sophie correctly predicted, Frederick's relationship with Anna was polite but emotionally distant. They did however have six children, being: * Prince Frederick William III of Hesse (1854‚Äì1888); never married; died at sea on a voyage from Batavia to Singapore. * Princess Elisabeth Alexandra Charlotte of Hesse (1861‚Äì1955); married Leopold, Hereditary Prince of Anhalt and had issue. * Prince Alexander Frederick of Hesse (1863‚Äì1945); married Baroness Gisela Stockhorner von Starheim, daughter of Oto, Baron Stockhorner von Starheim and Emilie Susanne Hildegard, Baroness von Wolzogen-Neuhaus; had issue. * Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse, King of Finland (1868‚Äì1940); married Princess Margaret of Prussia and had issue. * Princess Marie-Polyxene of Hesse (1872‚Äì1882); died at age 10 of osteomyelitis. * Princess Sybille Marguerite of Hesse (1877‚Äì1925); married Friedrich Alexander Henry Robert Carl Albert, Baron von Vincke (divorced 1923). ==Assessments== Queen Victoria's daughter, Victoria, Princess Royal, who was married to Anna's cousin, the future Emperor of Germany, wrote about Anna: ::\\"...[she] is very pretty, the most splendid figure you ever saw, but I do not like her style quite, her gowns are a good deal fuller than the Empress' and so low, I cannot bear that; and I do not like to see the Princesses dancing about with everybody ...\\".Letter to Queen Victoria, 12 February 1858. However, Anna was also a highly intelligent woman who presided over a court salon of outstanding artists and musicians, including Johannes Brahms, Clara Schumann, Anton Rubinstein, and Julius Stockhausen. She herself was a classically trained pianist of great talent and ability who studied under Theodor Kullak.http://www.retrobibliothek.de Brahms dedicated his Piano Quintet to her in 1865. Unusually for a Hessian landgravine, she converted to Catholicism in 1901, which led to political complications.R√∂hl, John. Kaiser, Hof und Staat. Wilhelm II. und die deutsche Politik, Munich, 1988, p. 106. Anna was the subject of one of the most famous paintings by Franz Xaver Winterhalter, in which she is depicted wearing a sweeping dress of tulle over pink silk. ==Death and burial== Anna died on 12 June 1918, in Frankfurt at the age of 82. She is buried in Fulda Cathedral before the altar to St. Anne.

Fox Sports Oklahoma is available on cable providers throughout Oklahoma, and nationwide on satellite via DirecTV. ==Background== Fox Sports Oklahoma logo, used from 2008 to 2012. Fox Sports Oklahoma launched on October 29, 2008 as a spinoff of Fox Sports Southwest. It was created in order to serve as the cable broadcaster of the Oklahoma City Thunder, after Fox Sports Southwest acquired the broadcast rights to the NBA franchise following its relocation to Oklahoma City that year from Seattle. It initially split the rights to Thunder game telecasts with independent station KSBI (channel 52, now a MyNetworkTV affiliate), under an agreement in which Fox Sports Oklahoma would produce a limited schedule of regular season games (most of which aired on weekends) for the station; the Thunder signed a new multi-year broadcast agreement with Fox Sports Oklahoma on August 3, 2010, rendering the team's games cable-exclusive beginning with the 2010-11 season. On December 14, 2017, as part of a merger between both companies, The Walt Disney Company announced plans to acquire all 22 regional Fox Sports networks from 21st Century Fox, including Fox Sports Oklahoma. However, on June 27, 2018, the Justice Department ordered their divestment under antitrust grounds, citing Disney's ownership of ESPN. On May 3, 2019, Sinclair Broadcast Group and Entertainment Studios (through their joint venture, Diamond Holdings) bought Fox Sports Networks from The Walt Disney Company for $10.6 billion. The deal closed on August 22, 2019, thus placing Fox Sports Oklahoma in common ownership with Sinclair stations KOKH-TV/KOCB in the network's homebase of Oklahoma City, and KTUL in Tulsa. ==Programming== In addition to holding the regional television rights to Thunder's regular season and any early-round playoff games, Fox Sports Oklahoma also broadcasts sporting events from the Oklahoma Sooners and the Oklahoma State Cowboys, including football, basketball, baseball, softball, gymnastics, track-and-field, golf, tennis, wrestling, and volleyball. The channel also holds exclusive broadcast rights to state football, basketball and baseball championships held by the Oklahoma Secondary School Activities Association. Fox Sports Oklahoma has broadcast Class A-6A Football Championship games and periodically runs OSSAA Championship Spotlight, a magazine program that highlights various high school sports depending on the time of year. Fox Sports Oklahoma also broadcasts pre- game and post-game shows for the Oklahoma City Thunder (under the Thunder Live banner), and Oklahoma Sooners and Oklahoma State Cowboys-related programs (such as coaches' shows and team magazine programs). Outside of programming exclusive to Fox Sports Oklahoma, the channel runs various programs supplied by Fox Sports Southwest (including sports interview, magazine and analysis programs focusing on Texas sports) as well as some game telecasts including Texas Rangers baseball and Dallas Stars hockey. ==Other servicesFox Sports Oklahoma Plus=== Fox Sports Oklahoma Plus (also branded as \\"FOX Sports Oklahoma +\\" or FS OKLAHOMA +\\") is an alternate feed of Fox Sports Oklahoma used to broadcast select events within the designated market that cannot air on the main feed due to scheduling conflicts. Fox Sports Oklahoma Plus primarily serves an overflow feed in the event that teams whose games Fox Sports Oklahoma has the right to broadcast play conflicting games simultaneously, mainly those that are televised on Fox Sports Southwest that may otherwise also air on Fox Sports Oklahoma (such as Texas Ranger Baseball or Dallas Star Hockey) are scheduled to be held at the same time as the scheduled telecast of a Thunder, Sooners or Cowboys game, or a high school or collegiate sporting event involving an Oklahoma team. On some cable systems in Oklahoma, Fox Sports Oklahoma Plus airs St. Louis Cardinals telecasts from Fox Sports Midwest and select Kansas City Royals telecasts from Fox Sports Kansas City to the fans of those teams living in Oklahoma who otherwise cannot receive Cardinals or Royals games on Fox Sports Midwest and Fox Sports Kansas City. ==On-air staffCurrent=== * Chris Fisher ‚Äì Thunder play-by-play * Michael Cage ‚Äì Thunder color commentator * Nick Gallo - Thunder Sideline Reporter * Greg Buckner ‚Äì Thunder Live studio analyst ==References * www.foxsports.com/southwest ‚Äì Fox Sports Southwest official website Category:Oklahoma City Thunder broadcasters Category:Television channels and stations established in 2008 Category:Fox Sports Networks Category:2008 establishments in Oklahoma ","title":"Fox Sports Oklahoma"},{"id":"20563573","text":"Woodlawn is a historic home located at St. Mary's City, St. Mary's County, Maryland, United States.

Similar to an endmill but with flat-bottom plunging ability. The tool at E, a counterbore, is also often used for spotfacing in manual machining (not so much in CNC machining). A spotface or spot face is a machined feature in which a certain region of the workpiece (a spot) is faced, providing a smooth, flat, accurately located surface. This is especially relevant on workpieces cast or forged, where the spotface's smooth, flat, accurately located surface stands in distinction to the surrounding surface whose roughness, flatness, and location are subject to wider tolerances and thus not assured with a machining level of precision. The most common application of spotfacing (spot facing) is facing the area around a bolt hole where the bolt's head will sit, which is often done by cutting a shallow counterbore, just deep enough \\"to clean up\\"‚Äîthat is, only enough material is removed to get down past any irregularity and thus make the surface flat.. Other common applications of spotfacing involve facing a pad onto a boss, creating planar surfaces in known locations that can orient a casting or forging into position in the assembly; allow part marking such as stamping or nameplate riveting; or offer machine-finish visual appeal in spots, without the need for finishing all over (FAO). The cutters most often used to cut spotfaces are counterbore cutters and endmills. In manual machining especially, the former is useful because its pilot guides the cutter into the correct location (established by the bolt hole), and its cutting lips are perpendicular to the hole axis with no relief angle, meaning that a plunging cut, moving in only the Z-axis, will leave a flat surface. In contrast, most general-purpose endmills have a relief angle such that a plunging cut (Z-axis- only toolpath) will leave a very slightly convex surface. But in CNC machining this is irrelevant, because the flat spotface is left by circular interpolation of the endmill as it traces a circular toolpath in the XY plane. Zero-angle cutters obviate this, functioning similarly to the traditional counterbore cutters of manual machining but needing no pilot. Spot facing of larger planar surfaces sometimes employs face mills. Backspotfacing (back spot facing) is analogous to backboring, meaning that the tool manages to reach to the far side of the workpiece (away from the spindle side) and cut back toward the spindle. Such operations can be done with boring bars reaching through a hole while shifted off-center, then shifting onto center for the cut (for example, in the G76 fine boring cycle), or with back-deburring style tools whose cutting edges open and close in umbrella-like or check-valve-like fashion. Such back-cutting operations can obviate second operations, with their attendant setup time and part rehandling time. Sometimes the limiting factor in applying this advantage is the difficulty of chip clearance; the operator needs to intervene because chip nests prevent the tool from passing freely and opening and closing freely. In such cases, improved chipbreaking via different inserts in the main operation may help, and backspotfacing tools powered by coolant pressure and using through-tool coolant feed may succeed where others cannot (opening, cutting, and retracting despite some chips), not only obviating a second operation but also making the main operation less reliant on operator intervention and program stops (M00 or M01) than a lesser backspotfacing tool would. Some fastener designs can obviate spotfacing for some applications. For example, a self-aligning nut allows the nut to find its own perpendicularity to the thread axis by floating via a pair of spherical bearing surfaces (a ball-in-cup arrangement). Standards exist for the sizes of spotfaces, especially for fastener head seating areas. These standards can vary between corporations and between standards organizations. For example, in Boeing Design Manual BDM-1327 section 3.5, the nominal diameter of the spot- faced surface is the same as the nominal size of the cutter, and is equal to the flat seat diameter plus twice the fillet radius. This is in contrast to the ASME Y14.5-2009 definition of a spotface, which is equal to the flat seat diameter. ==See also== *Counterbore *Countersink ==NotesReferences== *.

It is the third film in the Air Buddies franchise. It was released February 3, 2009. Like Air Buddies and Snow Buddies, it was released directly on DVD and became the first one to be released on Blu-ray. ==Plot== The film starts as Buddha (Field Cate) and his owner, Sam (Nolan Gould) star-gazing. As a shooting star passes, Sam makes a wish that he can touch the moon. The next day is the day of his school field trip to Vision Enterprises to watch a test launch of the Vision 1 spacecraft. However, since no pets are allowed to go, he has to leave Buddha at home. Buddha meets up with his siblings; Rosebud (Liliana Mumy), Budderball (Josh Flitter), B-Dawg (Skyler Gisondo), and Mudbud (Henry Hodges), and invites them to come with him to go to see the test launch. They hide in the school bus which soon arrives at the Vision Enterprises. The dogs go to a space suit machine and put on space suits before following the students, who are being led by Dr. Finkel (Kevin Weisman). The dogs get aboard the space shuttle Vision 1. At Mission Control in the Vision Enterprises, Pi (Bill Fagerbakke) confirms they are ready for launch. Meanwhile, the dogs take a close look around until they are sealed in the shuttle, which prepares for launch. Astro (Ali Hillis), who will be piloting the shuttle from Earth, launches the shuttle, and it flies to space. At Mission Control, the humans realize the third tank of gas in the shuttle was never filled. With ten hours until the gas runs out, they look for solutions. They eventually decide to pilot the spacecraft to the old R.R.S.S. (Russian Research Space Station). They contact the cosmonaut living in the space station, named Yuri (Diedrich Bader), telling him to refuel the Vision 1. As Vision 1 connects to the space station, the dogs decide to explore the space station, and they meet a dog called Sputnik (Jason Earles) who is under the care of Yuri. Sputnik explains that Yuri is quite content to stay in space, yet he wishes to go home. Yuri finds the dogs and becomes happy because the buddies can keep them company. The buddies are trapped in the kitchen, and are saved later by Sputnik. After Yuri connects the fuel hose to the Vision 1, the fuel starts to leak from the hose. Meanwhile, the buddies and Sputnik rush back to Vision 1 to escape. Yuri activates lock-down to trap the dogs. They manage to get to the Vision 1. Yuri tries to stop them, banging on the control switches. However, sparks drop on the fuel, causing an explosion. The dogs escape from the R.R.S.S. as it explodes. Yuri barely escapes using the Cosmopod escape vessel. The Vision 1 travels to the moon. Soon after, the Vision 1 approaches and lands on the moon (Before this event had occurred, B-Dawg had mistaken the moon for the \\"Death Star\\"). They soon begin to get out of the Vision 1 and walk around the area within the place they had landed. Mission Control finds that the sounds from their helmets happen to be soft barks, and conclude they are golden retriever puppies, and this is broadcast on the news. The children find out through the news (\\"We're live at Vision Enterprises, where quite a furry tale is unfolding. It seems five golden retriever puppies have been accidentally launched into space.\\"). The dogs, while on the moon, meet a ferret named Gravity (Amy Sedaris) who is their mission control assistant. But since their only communication is from audio, they don't know she's a ferret. She orders them to get back on the Vision 1. When returning to Earth, the path is changed by an unworthy Dr. Finkel. The path's telemetry is reverted into a meteor shower. The \\"auto-avoidance system\\" takes control of the Vision 1, rotating and shifting heavily between every meteor in its path. However, the Vision 1's data communications antenna is busted the right when it becomes struck by a meteor. Budderball is sent to repair the antenna by doing a space walk outside of the Vision 1. At Mission Control, the adults are puzzled about the change of the telemetry course of the Vision 1 when Sam accuses Dr. Finkel of changing the path. As Dr. Finkel's denies it, Pi uses the security camera to confirm that Dr. Finkel was indeed at the desk at 7:49 pm, the time when the telemetry course was changed. As Dr. Finkel is taken away by security, Sam approaches Dr. Finkel and calls him \\"Dr. Stinkel.\\" The Mission Control center receives Yuri's distress signal in the Cosmopod before the Vision 1 enters the atmosphere through the blackout zone. They wait 4 minutes till they arrive, but they arrive early. The Vision 1 ends its mission by slowing down on the take-off strip. The dogs find out Gravity is a ferret, and so that Budderball replies he is related to skunks. Yuri crashes his pod, and is rescued by some soldiers, telling them he comes from space. Pi awards the dogs wings of true heroism, with their title as \\"Space Buddies\\". Once at home, Buddha gives Sam a moon rock he had taken from his journey, fulfilling his wish of touching the moon. The film ends with Sputnik back at home with his old owner, Sasha, saying, \\"It is the journey and friendship that matters the most.\\" ==Cast== *Bill Fagerbakke as Pi *Diedrich Bader as Yuri *Kevin Weisman as Dr. Finkel *Lochlyn Munro as Slats Bentley *Ali Hillis as Astro Spalding *Pat Finn as Bill Wolfson *Nolan Gould as Sam *Wayne Wilderson as Tad Thompson *C.

He was a member of Internal Macedono-Adrianopolean Revolutionary Organization (IMARO) and a popular teacher, journalist, translator and writer. ==Biography== Cyril Parlichev was born in Ohrid, Ottoman Empire in 1875. His father was Grigor Parlichev - a popular Bulgarian educator. On August 5, 1898, Dimitar Grdanov, a Serbian teacher in Ohrid, and pro-Serbian activist in Macedonia was murdered by Metody Patchev, after which Patchev and his fellow conspirators Hristo Uzunov, Cyril Parlichev and Ivan Grupchev were arrested. Parlichev later taught in the Bulgarian Men's High School of Thessaloniki, where he was accepted in IMARO. During the Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising he was a member of the Hristo Chernopeev's band. After the end of the unsuccessful uprising, he started studying history in Sofia University. In the meantime he worked as a secretary of the IMARO committee in Sofia. After the Young Turk Revolution, Cyril Parlichev participated in the inauguration of the Bulgarian Constitutional Clubs political party. He taught in Edessa, where he and Hristo Zaneshev contributed to the activity of Bulgarian Constitutional Clubs. In 1918 Cyril Parlichev wrote his first work - The Serbian Regime and the Revolutionary Struggle in Macedonia (in ). He was also one of the founders of the Macedonian Scientific Institute in 1923. Parlichev translated into Bulgarian works of Karl Marx, Voltaire and others. After the murder of Todor Alexandrov, Parlichev was forced by Ivan Mihailov to stop his participation in the activities of IMRO. In the period 1941-1944, when the area was under Bulgarian control, he was director of the Historical Museum in his native Ohrid. He died there on February 9, 1944. Cyril Parlichev is survived today by his grandson, Cyril, who has published his previously unknown works in Sofia, Bulgaria. ==Works== * The Serbian Regime and the Revolutionary Struggle in Macedonia (1912 - 1915) * Kjustendyl Congress of IMRO from 1908.

On September 22, 1928, two days before Yom Kippur, four-year-old Barbara Griffiths went for a walk and did not come back home. After a long search by townspeople and state police, a rumor began to circulate that the girl had been kidnapped and killed by the town's Jews for a religious ritual associated with the impending holiday. The following day, the state police questioned Morris Goldberg, a Jew with little knowledge of Jewish tradition. Goldberg left police with the impression that there might be some truth to the rumors that Jews engaged in ritual murder. At that point, the state police sought to interrogate Rabbi Berel Brennglass, leader of the town's Adath Israel synagogue. When asked about the allegations of ritual murder, Brennglass told the police and the town's mayor, who was present, that they should be ashamed for asking such questions. He expressed outrage that people believed such lies in the United States in the 20th century. Barbara Griffiths was found in the woods later that afternoon roughly a mile from her home. She told authorities she had become lost during her walk and slept in the forest. Nevertheless, some citizens of Massena continued to believe that Griffiths had been kidnapped by the Jews. They attributed her safe return to the discovery of the Jews' plot. The mayor may have led a boycott of businesses owned by Jews. The Massena blood libel drew national attention. Through the efforts of Rabbi Brennglass, the American Jewish Committee and the American Jewish Congress denounced the town's leaders, prompting apologies from the mayor and the state police to the rabbi, the town's Jews, and all Jews of the United States. In his apology, the mayor wrote: > In light of the solemn protest of my Jewish neighbors, I feel I ought to > express clearly and unequivocally ... my sincere regret that by any act of > commission or omission, I should have seemed to lend countenance ... to what > I should have known to be a cruel libel imputing human sacrifice as a > practice now or at any time in the history of the Jewish people. The Blood Lie, a novel about the incident by Shirley Reva Vernick, was published in 2011 by Cinco Puntos Press. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * * ==External links== * Category:1928 in Judaism Category:1928 in New York (state) Category:September 1928 events Category:Blood libel Category:Antisemitism in the United States Category:Jewish-American history Category:History of New York (state) Category:Antisemitic attacks and incidents in the United States ","title":"Massena blood libel"},{"id":"20563856","text":"Simon-Pierre Denys de Bonaventure (22 June 1659 - 7 February 1711) was born in Trois-Rivi√®res, Qu√©bec to Pierre Denys de La Ronde and Catherine Le Neuf.Nos gloires nationales: ou, Histoire des principales familles du Canada, Volume 1, Fran√ßois Daniel, E.

They have a long tube that is internally threaded and a plate with two clearance holes for rivets. The most popular versions have two lugs and they exist as fixed anchor nuts and as floating anchor nuts. The latter allows the nut to move slightly and so enlarges the positioning tolerances of the mounted parts. They were originally developed for the aerospace industry, but are now also common in automotive racing.Smith, pp. 108‚Äì109. These nuts are made up of variety of soft and hard materials. The choice of material depends on environment to which nut is subjected. Soft materials like copper or brass are used when nut is used in electrical application. Hard materials are used when nut is subjected to high stress environment. Sometimes stainless steel or nickel- plated nuts are used in order to increase corrosion resistance. Locknut types are available, which utilize deformed threads or a nylon locking element, much like a nyloc nut. These locking plate nuts are used when the nut is subjected to constant changes in environment or to vibration. The nylon insert expands and stops vibrations of the nut and acts as a locking arrangement. Other types have a floating nut or replaceable locking elements.

She is also the longest serving foster mother of the program, and also holds the national record of having looked after 43 children in her 32 years' as a foster mother. Nadisen is recognised as the role model and the icon of the Fostering Scheme. Nadisen was born of Chinese ethnicity, and adopted by an Indian family when she was a baby. She volunteered herself with the Fostering Scheme and began fostering children in 1976, when her own children - five boys and a girl - started going to school and she started feeling bored at home. Her love for children was strong and she cared of the children, as if they were her own, for an average period of 2 years till they return to their own biological parents or to their adoptive parents. She also showered her love equally to her children and the adopted ones. However this strong love that she felt for them, also made it emotionally difficult for her to part with them. She confessed she had to lie to the child by saying she had to go to the toilet so that the child would let go of her, to let the child leave with their adoptive parents. 'From the toilet, I would hear the child screaming for me and my heart would hurt,' she said. As a result, she preferred not to contact them after they left her care. In 2001 Nadisen was awarded the Friend of MCDS award and in 2003, the Reader's Digest Inspiring Asians Award. In July 2008, Nadisen reluctantly announced her retirement from the Fostering Scheme citing health reasons. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Singaporean Hindus Category:Singaporean people of Chinese descent Category:Singaporean social workers ","title":"Indranee Nadisen"},{"id":"20564042","text":"Alexander Alekseevich Pechursky (born 4 June 1990) is a Russian professional ice hockey goaltender.

It has gone through a variety of name changes since the early 20th century. The community had a post office at one time, but it no longer exists. Although a thriving community in its early years, it has since dwindled into obscurity. ==History== Half Acre was originally known as Beaver Creek and was settled in the 1830s. By 1870 it had a post office, three general stores, a cotton gin, a cotton seed-oil press, grist mill, saw mill, brick kiln, hotel, and livery stables. The tradition of how the Half Acre name originated holds that a half-acre piece of property in the community, at a crossroads next door to the hotel, had been overlooked in the original survey. County land records indicate that when the small piece of property was discovered to not be surveyed, it was deeded to \\"The Devil\\" and then became known as Hell's Half Acre. A saloon was eventually built there, only to later burn down. The title to the property was not clarified until the community wanted to build a church on the site of the former saloon, at which time the probate court transferred ownership from \\"The Devil\\" to the Half Acre Community Church. The \\"Hell's\\" was dropped from the name at this time and the entire community came to be known simply as Half Acre. The population of the community began to relocate elsewhere after World War II and today it is home to only the church and a few residences. ==Geography== Half Acre is situated above Beaver Creek, about east of the Tombigbee River.

It once released a plume of water into the air every 90 seconds. Because of its former regular and rapid eruption pattern, the geyser was one of Lake County's most popular tourist attractions.\\"Old Perpetual, OR\\", National Scenic Byways Program, Federal Highway Administration, United States Department of Transportation, Washington, D.C., 2007.\\"Old Perpetual Geyser\\", Oregon Tourism Commission, www.traveloregon.com, Salem, Oregon, 2008. The geyser, still heavily promoted by the local Chamber of Commerce as a \\"must see\\" destination, stopped erupting for several years after June 2009, possibly due in part to the nearby geothermal development by the Town of Lakeview to supply the Warner Creek Correctional Facility with water for heating. Proposed further development of the site for geothermal power generation purposes threaten the entire hot springs wetlands.http://www.eere.energy.gov/golden/PDFs/ReadingRoom/NEPA/Lakeview_Scoping_Letter_general- final%20signed.pdf , it seems to be regularly erupting again. == Resort == Hunter's Hot Springs are named after Harry Hunter, a land developer from Minneapolis, Minnesota who visited the site in 1919 while on a tour of the western United States. In 1923, he purchased the parcel that included the hot springs with the intention of developing a health resort. He began by organizing Hunter's Chlorine Hot Springs Club, a business established to develop the hot springs as a therapy, rest, and recuperation resort. The club's first president was H. A. Utley and the resort's general manager was Dr. H. G. Kelty. As Hunter started to develop the site in 1923, he was not satisfied with the amount of hot water the springs produced naturally so he had three wells drilled on the property. To his surprise, all three erupted as hot water geysers. Two of the geysers stopped erupting while Old Perpetual continued every 40 to 120 seconds, depending on the seasonal water table level, until 2009. The original resort building was constructed in 1925. As soon as the facility was finished, Dr. Kelty moved his medical practice to the site. A second building was added in 1926. In 1929, Kelty joined four other doctors to open a medical clinic at the site. Together the doctors purchased the hot springs, club facilities and equipment. In November 1929, a restaurant was opened to support their clinic practice. The clinic was sold in 1943. The new owners built a motel and cocktail lounge to complete the resort facilities. In the early 1990s, the outdoor pool was replaced and a racquetball court was added. New owners renovated the resort facilities again in 2000. Today, the resort operates a motel, lounge, and restaurant. The mineral pool is available to guests and the viewing area for Old Perpetual is open to the public. == Name == The springs have long been known as Hunter's Hot Springs, and locals still refer to them that way. The 2000 owner renamed the resort to Geyser Hot Springs, however the USGS only recognizes the variant name Geyser Hunters Hot Springs. == References == Category:Hot springs of Oregon Category:Bodies of water of Lake County, Oregon ","title":"Hunter's Hot Springs (Oregon)"},{"id":"20564212","text":"Araghju Araghju is an archaeological site in Corsica.

Setzler was the lead sponsor of the Living Infants Fairness & Equality Act (2019)House Bill 481 (Setzler, 2019) in the Georgia General Assembly a bill that established the legal personhood of the unborn child throughout Georgia law and banned most abortions after about six weeks into a pregnancy.Jill Nolin, Kemp signs strict anti-abortion bill, Union-Recorder (May 7, 2019).Emily Wax-Thibodeaux & Reis Thebault, Georgia legislators pass 'heartbeat bill' that would ban most abortions, Washington Post (March 29, 2019). In addition to providing tax and social services benefits to parents of an unborn child, Setzler's bill initially included no exceptions, but he later added exceptions in the House Health & Human Services Committee Video archive of the House Health & Human Services Committee (March 6, 2019); committee substitute bill LC 41 1938ERS. in order to balance the liberty interest of mothers with difficult pregnancies with the life interest of the unborn child.Maya T. Prabhu, Anti-abortion group says ‚Äòheartbeat‚Äô bill not restrictive enough, Atlanta Journal-Constitution (March 26, 2019). The legislation was opposed by abortion providers and some obstetricians and gynecologists who say that the legislation \\"would limit a physician's ability to provide medical care and advice that's in the best interest of the patient\\" and contains language that \\"could expose doctors to criminal prosecution for following what‚Äôs widely considered to be a medically acceptable standard of care.\\"Gray Chapman, Who stands to lose the most under Georgia's anti-abortion bill? These five groups of people will be disproportionately affected, Atlanta (March 20, 2019). Georgia governor Brian Kemp signed the legislation into law in May 2019, fulfilling a campaign promise to sign into law the nation's most stringent abortion ban. The ACLU of Georgia, Planned Parenthood, and others are challenging the legislation in the courts on constitutional grounds. Setzler and the other anti-abortion advocates who supported for the legislation have sought to use the law as a vehicle to overturn Roe v. Wade. ===Other legislation=== In addition to being Chairman of the House Committee on Science & Technology, Georgia House of Representatives, Standing Committees , Rep. Setzler has served the Chair of the House Judiciary Noncivil Subcommittee on General Law since 2010 where he was instrumental in Georgia's efforts on Criminal Justice Reform and passage of the Prescription Drug Monitoring Act (2011) to reduce opioid addiction statewide. Setzler has been a consistent supporter of education reform in the state and served the Chair of Education Subcommittee on Academic Innovation. As the lead sponsor of House Bill 1114 (2012), Setzler successfully led the effort to ban physician assisted suicide in Georgia. The legislation was introduced after Georgia's earlier law relating to public advertising of assisted suicide services was struck down by the Supreme Court of Georgia.Kristina Torres, Assisted suicide ban passes Senate, Atlanta Journal-Constitution (March 27, 2012). Setzler supports biomedical research that uses pluripotent adult stem cells but opposes embryonic stem cell research that destroys a human embryo. In 2015, Setzler introduced legislation to secure more revenue for transportation infrastructure by eliminating Georgia's 4 percent state sales tax on gasoline and levying a more consistent excise tax on each gallon of gasoline. The bill would have lowered the state income tax rate, created a flatter tax structure, and \\"gradually raise the excise tax on fuel over eight years.\\" Aaron Gould Sheinin, First counter-proposal to gas tax plan revealed, Atlanta Journal- Constitution (January 14, 2015). Setzler was an outspoken critic of proposals to expand access to medical marijuana in Georgia.Lisa Hagen, PTSD Back On Proposed Ga.

Eighteen football teams were represented on the grid, the same number of teams as there was at the previous three rounds. There were two driver changes before this round of the championship and one during the round: Duncan Tappy returned to the Tottenham Hotspur cockpit replacing Dominik Jackson, having missed the previous round in Portugal and Kasper Andersen was replaced by Stamatis Katsimis in the Olympiacos CFP car. Having broken a bone in his right hand in practice, Paul Meijer was replaced by Dominick Muermans in the Al Ain car - becoming their fourth driver in five races. The meeting saw a third win for championship leaders Beijing Guoan and a first win for F.C. Porto. Beijing also extended their championship lead to an almost unassailable 59 points. ==ReportQualifying=== After the random draw which split the eighteen-car field into two groups, the fastest four qualifiers from each progressed into the knockout stages to decide places 1 to 8 on the grid. Andy Soucek (Atl√©tico Madrid) missed out on the top eight, despite setting a time some 0.052 seconds faster than Group B 4th Adri√°n Vall√©s in the Liverpool F.C. car. As fastest drivers in their groups, Ant√¥nio Pizzonia (SC Corinthians) and Davide Rigon (Beijing Guoan) were expected to meet in the final, but neither made the final. Instead, Vall√©s and Robert Doornbos (A.C. Milan) battled it out, with Vall√©s coming out on top by 0.260 seconds - the fifth different polesitter in five races. ===Race 1=== Before the race even began, there was dramas - Borja Garc√≠a (Sevilla FC) started from pit lane and Alessandro Pier Guidi (Galatasaray S.K.) having gearbox troubles on the grid. At the start, Vall√©s led away from Doornbos and Rigon, with Pier Guidi passing Tuka Rocha (CR Flamengo) for fourth on the opening lap. Lap three saw the end of Enrico Toccacelo's Borussia Dortmund car with suspension failure while running towards the back. The top ten somehow stayed in order, until the pit window. Rigon pitted first followed by Rocha, Franck Perera (A.S. Roma) and Yelmer Buurman (PSV Eindhoven. Doornbos and Vall√©s pitted on lap 11, allowing Pier Guidi to lead for two laps before his pit stop. Pizzonia took the lead for a lap until he pitted, and after the cycle through, Rigon led from Doornbos, Pier Guidi, Vall√©s and Rocha. Lap 16 saw Garcia's race end with a stuck throttle. There was a somewhat crazy finish to the race, with Soucek and Perera both retiring within the last five minutes of the race with engine problems and a puncture respectively. Vall√©s suffered fuel pressure problems towards the end, falling five places in as many minutes as Rigon went on to claim his third victory of the season, opening up a 67-point lead over PSV. Following him home were Doornbos, Pier Guidi, Rocha, Ryan Dalziel (Rangers F.C., Pizzonia, Craig Dolby (R.S.C. Anderlecht), Tristan Gommendy (F.C. Porto), Vall√©s, Buurman, Duncan Tappy (Tottenham Hotspur), Max Wissel (FC Basel 1893), Stamatis Katsimis (Olympiacos CFP) and Dominick Muermans (Al Ain) - both rookies finishing a lap down. ===Race 2=== Race two began with a bang - a first corner incident taking out Pizzonia, Doornbos and Rocha at Curva Cimini, causing a long safety car period. Wissel retired the Basel car during this with engine trouble. All was cleared up for the restart on lap six with Toccacelo still leading from Soucek (up from third) and Garc√≠a. A brave move from Soucek at Campagnano moved the Spaniard into the lead with Perera passing Garc√≠a for third. Lap nine saw another accident, this time between Toccacelo and Perera again at Cimini. Toccacelo defended the inside line before moving sharply to the outside where Perera already was. Soucek pitted from the lead on lap eleven, but gremlins struck causing him to pit again, before retiring with gearbox trouble on lap 21. Katsimis led for a lap before he pitted, letting Tappy lead until his pitstop on lap 15. Perera took the lead, having pitted on lap eleven. A mistake from Buurman on lap 17 allowed Gommendy into second and after Perera. Garc√≠a retired again, with brake failure continuing Sevilla's spiral down the championship standings. The number of runners fell into single-figures on lap 27 with another three-car accident with Katsimis, Tappy and Pier Guidi crashing at Cimini. The race wasn't decided until the final lap when Perera made a slight mistake at Curva Soratte, allowing Gommendy through to win by 1.482 seconds from Perera, with Buurman, Vall√©s, Rigon, Dolby, Dalziel and Muermans completing the finishers. In the championship standings, Beijing had their lead cut to 59 points, which meant that a maximum of 42 points required for championship glory. ==ResultsQualifying=== * In each group, the top four qualify for the quarter-finals.

The title means \\"Mourning Music\\" or \\"Funeral Music\\" in English, but the work is always known by its German title. ==Background== On 19 January 1936, Paul Hindemith travelled to London, intending to play his viola concerto Der Schwanendreher, with Adrian Boult and the BBC Symphony Orchestra in Queen's Hall, on 22 January. This was to be the British premiere of the work. However, just before midnight on 20 January, King George V died. The concert was cancelled, but Boult and the BBC music producer Edward Clark still wanted Hindemith's involvement in any music that was broadcast in its place. They debated for hours what might be a suitable piece, but nothing could be found, so it was decided that Hindemith should write something new.Hindemith's letter of 23 January 1936 to Willy Strecker, in Paul Hindemith: Selected Letters The following day, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., Hindemith sat in an office made available to him by the BBC and wrote Trauermusik in homage to the late king. It was written for viola and string orchestra (Der Schwanendreher employs a larger complement that includes woodwinds). Trauermusik was performed that evening in a live broadcast from a BBC radio studio, with Boult conducting and the composer as soloist. ==The music== Trauermusik consists of four very short movements. The first movement is marked Langsam. The second movement (Ruhig bewegt) is less than a minute in length and the third is only slightly longer. The last movement is the heart of the work and in it, Hindemith quotes the chorale \\"F√ºr deinen Thron tret' ich hiermit\\" (\\"Here I stand before Thy throne\\"), well known in Germany via the harmonisation by Johann Sebastian Bach. Hindemith was unaware at the time, but the tune was very familiar in England as the \\"Old 100th\\", to the words \\"All people that on Earth do dwell\\". The piece also contains quotations from Symphony: Mathis der Maler and Der Schwanendreher. Trauermusik immediately entered the repertoire of violists, as well as cellists and even violinists.

The highway runs from VT 106 in Reading east to U.S. Route 5 (US 5) and VT 12 in Windsor. VT 44 passes through West Windsor in southern Windsor County, serving the area north of Mount Ascutney. The highway has an auxiliary route, VT 44A, which provides access to Mount Ascutney State Park and connects VT 44 with Interstate 91 (I-91) in Weathersfield. VT 44 was established in 1958 along the highway between Reading and Windsor. The three towns had previously maintained the highway with support from the state for construction and maintenance, including reconstruction along several segments in the 1940s. The state paved VT 44 in the early 1970s and early 1980s. VT 44A was established in 1987 when part of VT 44 in Windsor was returned to town maintenance. ==Route description== VT 44 begins at an intersection with VT 106 north of the hamlet of Felchville in the southeastern part of the town of Reading. The two-lane highway crosses Mill Brook, which it parallels for its entire length, and enters the town of West Windsor. VT 44 crosses Willow Brook near Best's Covered Bridge and Mill Brook again near the Bowers Covered Bridge. The highway crosses Mill Brook twice more in the town as it curves around the northern flank of Mount Ascutney. VT 44 crosses Beaver Brook while passing through the village of Brownsville. VT 44 ascends from the valley of Mill Brook and passes the entrance to Ascutney Mountain Resort shortly before entering the town of Windsor. East of the town line, VT 44 veers away from Mount Ascutney at its oblique intersection with VT 44A (Back Mountain Road), which continues southeast along the flank of the mountain and heads toward I-91. The NAMCO Block at the east end of VT 44 in Windsor VT 44 descends back into the valley of Mill Brook and crosses the stream immediately before it passes below I-91 with no access and curves north with the stream. The highway enters the urban area of Windsor along Ascutney Street. VT 44 passes the Ascutney Mill Dam Historic District before it curves east onto Union Street. The highway crosses Mill Brook twice more in the downtown area and passes by the historic residential NAMCO Block before reaching its eastern terminus at US 5 and VT 12 (Main Street) just north of the American Precision Museum at the historic Robbins and Lawrence Armory and Machine Shop. The east leg of the intersection is Bridge Street, which leads to the Cornish-Windsor Covered Bridge across the Connecticut River and into the state of New Hampshire. The Vermont Agency of Transportation maintains VT 44 west of VT 44A, and the town of Windsor maintains the route east of VT 44A. ==History== According to a 1927 report prepared by the federal Bureau of Public Roads and the Vermont State Highway Department, the unnumbered Reading‚ÄìWindsor road had a surface-treated gravel surface. The towns through which the highway passed maintained the road with financial aid from the state. The town of Windsor reconstructed the surface-treated gravel road outside the town center in 1940 and 1941. West Windsor reconstructed their gravel road in 1941 through Brownsville and in several segments outside of Brownsville between 1946 and 1952, and Reading reconstructed their short portion of the highway in 1948. In 1958, the three towns petitioned the State Highway Board to accept the portion of the highway outside the Windsor town center into the state highway system, a request the state approved. The state took over maintenance of the highway from VT 106 to the Windsor village boundary and established VT 44 through separate agreements that went into effect in December 1958 and January 1959. The first hard- surfaced stretch of what was to become VT 44 was created at an unknown time before 1950 along Ascutney Street in the Windsor town center. The town resurfaced Ascutney Street with bituminous concrete in 1950 and replaced the surface-treated gravel surface of Union Street with bituminous concrete in 1969. The state resurfaced VT 44 with bituminous concrete on most of the highway's short Reading stretch in 1964 and through Brownsville in 1965. The Vermont Department of Highways applied a chipseal surface along the remaining surface-treated gravel stretches in 1972. The state resurfaced the chipseal sections with bituminous concrete in 1983. The town of Windsor regained maintenance duties on VT 44 from the VT 44A intersection to the town center boundary in February 1987 at the same time the state took over maintenance of Back Mountain Road, which became VT 44A. ==Major intersectionsAuxiliary route== First reassurance marker on northbound VT 44A Vermont Route 44A (VT 44A) is a auxiliary route of VT 44 that runs from US 5 and VT 12 in Weathersfield north to VT 44 in Windsor. The highway heads north from its oblique intersection with the U.S. Highway and state route along Back Mountain Road, which follows the east flank of Mount Ascutney. North of the Weathersfield‚ÄìWindsor town line, VT 44A crosses over I-91 and provides access to Mount Ascutney State Park, which includes a toll road that ascends the mountain. The highway reaches its northern terminus at VT 44 between the town center of Windsor and the town of West Windsor. VT 44A connects VT 44 with I-91 via US 5 and VT 131 in Weathersfield. The 1927 Bureau of Public Roads‚ÄìVermont State Highway Department report indicated the unnumbered road along the east flank of Mount Ascutney had an untreated gravel surface. When the state constructed I-91 and Back Mountain Road's bridge across the Interstate in 1965 and 1966, Back Mountain Road was likely relocated and was paved with a bituminous concrete surface. The remainder of the highway was paved with bituminous concrete at an unknown date. The Vermont Agency of Transportation took over maintenance on Back Mountain Road from the towns of Weathersfield and Windsor and assigned VT 44A in February 1987 in exchange for the town of Windsor taking over maintenance on the part of VT 44 east of VT 44A. ==References 044 Vermont Route 044 ","title":"Vermont Route 44"},{"id":"20564725","text":"Maureen Green (born June 6, 1957) was a prominent news anchor on WTVH-TV Syracuse from 1982 until 2007.

Such a miracle is presented in various hagiographies and legends in different forms, and it occurs in connection with diverse individuals such as Saints Elizabeth of Hungary (1207‚Äì1231), Elizabeth of Portugal (1271‚Äì1336), St. Dorothy, a 4th-century virgin martyr at Caesarea in Cappadocia (died ca. 311), and Our Lady of Guadalupe (appeared in 1531). ==Symbolism of the rose== In the Latin West the symbolism of the rose is of Greco-Roman heritage but influenced by and finally transformed through Latin biblical and liturgical texts. In Greco-Roman culture the rose's symbolic qualities represented beauty, the season of spring, and love. It also spoke of the fleetness of life, and therefore of death. In Rome the feast called \\"Rosalia\\" was a feast of the dead: thus the flower referred to the next world.Koehler, S.M., Rev. Theodore A., \\"The Christian Symbolism of the Rose\\" , Roses and the Arts: A Cultural and Horticultural Engagement, Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio, May 8, 1986. This symbolism attained a deeper complexity when contrasted with the rose's thorns. This contrast inspired the Christian Latin poet Coelius Sedulius, who wrote (between 430-450) a very elaborate comparison between Eve, our first mother, and Mary, the Mother of Jesus our Savior. He illustrated the parallelism already made by Justin Martyr (around 150) and developed it in a deep poetic and doctrinal liturgical teaching in his Easter song, Carmen paschal. The rose was a privileged symbol for Mary, Queen of heaven and earth. One of her titles in Catholic Marian devotion is Rosa Mystica or Mystic Rose. During the Middle Ages, the rose became an attribute of many other holy women, including Elizabeth of Hungary, Elizabeth of Portugal and Casilda of Toledo, and of martyrs in general. The rose is even a symbol for Christ himself, as seen in the German Christmas song, \\"es ist ein 'Rose' entsprungen.\\" During the Middle Ages the rose was cultivated in monastery gardens and used for medicinal purposes. It became a symbol in religious writing and iconography in different images and settings, to invoke a variety of intellectual and emotional responses. The mystic rose appears in Dante's Divine Comedy, where it represents God's love. By the twelfth century, the red rose had come to represent Christ's passion, and the blood of the martyrs. 118. The most common association of the rose is with the Virgin Mary. The third-century Saint Ambrose believed that there were roses in the Garden of Eden, initially without thorns, but which became thorny after the fall, and came to symbolize Original Sin itself. Thus the Blessed Virgin is often referred to as the 'rose without thorns', since she was immaculately conceived. Saint Bernard of Clairvaux compared her virginity to a white rose and her charity to a red rose. With the rise of Marian devotion and the Gothic cathedral in the twelfth century, the image of the rose became even more prominent in religious life. Cathedrals built around this time usually include a rose window, dedicated to the Virgin, at the end of a transept or above the entrance. The thirteenth century Saint Dominic is credited with the institution of the Rosary, a series of prayers to the Virgin, symbolized by garlands of roses worn in Heaven. ==Saint Elizabeth of Hungary== In Western Europe, the best-known version of a miracle of the roses concerns Saint Elizabeth of Hungary (also called Elisabeth of Thuringia), the daughter of King Andrew II of Hungary, who spent most of her life living with her in-laws in Germany (a ruling family of Thuringia), who kept court at Wartburg Castle. ===Origins=== It has been suggested that the legend originated in a sermon given by Caesarius of Heisterbach in which he reflects on the occasion of the translation of the remains of Saint Elizabeth, in 1236. Caesarius speaks of a sweet aroma that emanates from the grave as soon as it is opened (a common theme in hagiography).. This metaphorical or actual aroma could have been translated into a physical event, the miracle of the roses. The first report of a miracle resembling that of the roses is by Franciscans in the mid-13th century. Their account is of spring flowers, and the event takes place in Hungary, at Elizabeth's home when she was five years old. The miracle as we know it, with roses and in Germany, is first reported in 1332, in a Franciscan book of prayers, though it has also been proposed that the miracle was \\"translated\\" from Elizabeth of Portugal to Elisabeth of Hungary in the 19th century. ===The legend=== In its most characteristic form the legend goes as follows. One day the young but pious Elizabeth, in the company of one or more serving women, descends from Wartburg Castle down to the village of Eisenach, below the castle. She is carrying meat, eggs, and bread under her mantle. Supposedly she has taken items from the family dining table to distribute to the poor in the village, against the wishes of her family, who frown upon such behavior. Halfway down, she unexpectedly meets her husband Ludwig IV of Thuringia, who asks, upon seeing her bulk, what she is carrying. Embarrassed and speechless as she is, she does not know what to say. Ludwig opens her mantle, and to his surprise (in some versions this takes place in the dead of winter) finds her carrying a bouquet of roses. Elizabeth of Portugal ===Similar versions=== Saint Elizabeth of Portugal Very much the same story is told of Elizabeth of Portugal, also known as Elizabeth of Aragon (1271‚Äì4 July 1336), who was the great-niece of Elizabeth of Hungary. Married to the profligate King Denis of Portugal, she, like her great-aunt, showed great devotion at an early age, and likewise was charitable toward the poor, against the wishes of her husband. Caught one day by her husband, while carrying bread in her apron, the food was turned into roses. Since this occurred in January, King Denis reportedly had no response and let his wife continue. The story is somewhat apocryphal; while it shows up in popular versions of the saint's life, the account is missing from more authoritative sources such as the revised 1991 edition of Alban Butler's Lives of the Saints. Santa Casilda Saint Casilda of Toledo Similar also is the legend of Casilda of Toledo (died c. 1050), a daughter of a Muslim king of Toledo, Spain during the rule of the Caliphate, who showed special kindness to Christian prisoners. She would carry bread hidden in her clothes to feed these prisoners; one day, when caught, the bread was miraculously changed into roses. In the famous painting of Saint Casilda by the 17th-century painter Francisco Zurbar√°n, roses are visible in the saint's lap; the miracle is also depicted in a painting by the 19th-century painter Jose Nogales. But while Saint Casilda supposedly died in the 11th century, predating the birth of both Elizabeth of Hungary and Elizabeth of Portugal, her hagiography was not written until three centuries after her death, and is likely influenced by the legend of one of these Elizabeths. Saint Didacus of Alcal√° Niccolo Betti San Diego de Alcal√° Descalzas Reales Of the 15th-century Franciscan St. Didacus of Alcal√°, also known as San Diego, the same miracle is told: as a lay brother of the Franciscans in Spain, he often took bread from the monastery's dining table to give to the poor. One day, leaving the convent with a cloak full of food, he was accused and challenged to open his cloak; miraculously, the loaves of bread had changed into roses. ==Our Lady of Guadalupe== Miguel Cabrera, Juan Diego The story of Our Lady of Guadalupe is of an entirely different character, although here again the miraculous presence of the roses in the middle of winter is a sign of the presence of the divinity. The account is a corollary to a Marian apparition, Our Lady of Guadalupe, found in the 1556 booklet Nican Mopohua, and supposedly taking place in 1531. It concerns a native inhabitant of Mexico named Juan Diego, whom the Virgin chooses to convey a message to an unwilling bishop, that \\"Here I will hear their weeping, their sorrow and will remedy and alleviate all their multiple sufferings, necessities and misfortunes.\\" The bishop however, does not believe Diego's story. He returns to his field, where again the Virgin appears to him, with the same message. Diego again goes to the bishop, with the same result, and the remark that he has to bring a token if he is to be believed. The fourth time the Virgin appears, she directs Diego toward \\"varied Castilian flowers\\" which he picks; she then places the flowers in his mantle. (The identification of these flowers as Castilian roses or Damask roses, is a later addition.) This time the bishop is convinced, especially when an image of the Virgin miraculously appears on Diego's cloak. ==St. Rita of Cascia== A miracle involving roses occurred to Saint Rita of Cascia. The winter before the end of her life, a cousin visited her and asked her if she desired anything from her old home at Roccaporena. Saint Rita responded by asking for a rose and a fig from the garden. It was January and her cousin did not expect to find anything due to the snowy weather. However, when her relative went to the house, a single blooming rose was found in the garden, as well as a fully ripened and edible fig. Her cousin brought the rose and fig back to Saint Rita at the convent, who thanked her and gave the rose to her sisters. The rose is thought to represent God's love for Rita and Rita's ability to intercede on behalf of lost causes or impossible cases. Rita is often depicted holding roses or with roses nearby, and on her feast day, churches and shrines of Saint Rita provide roses to the congregation that are blessed by priests during Mass. === Statement of Pope John Paul II === On the occasion of the centenary of the canonization of Saint Rita of Cascia, Pope John Paul II stated that the worldwide devotion to Saint Rita is symbolized by the rose, and said: \\"It is to be hoped that the life of everyone devoted to her will be like the rose picked in the garden of Roccaporena the winter before the saint's death. That is, let it be a life sustained by passionate love for the Lord Jesus; a life capable of responding to suffering and to thorns with forgiveness and the total gift of self, in order to spread everywhere the good odour of Christ (cf. ) through a consistently lived proclamation of the Gospel.\\" He added that Saint Rita spiritually offers her rose to each of those he addressed as an exhortation to \\"live as witnesses to a hope that never disappoints and as missionaries of a life that conquers death\\". ==Saint Faustyna Kowalska== In her Diary: Divine Mercy in My Soul, Saint Faustyna Kowalska writes of potatoes converting into roses: ==Critical theme in Heinrich B√∂ll novel== The 1971 novel Group Portrait with Lady () by Nobel Prize winning author Heinrich B√∂ll - who had grown up in a Catholic environment - includes many passages taking up Catholic themes, in a way highly critical of the Church. One of the book's themes concerns a nun who had been born a Jew, became a heretical Catholic, and died during the war under questionable circumstances, while under custody of the Church authorities who were supposed to protect her from the Nazis. In the book's present during the 1960s, there happens a manifest Miracle of the Roses, with red roses growing again and again in mid-winter from the nun's ashes. However, the Church authorities persistently refuse to take notice of this miracle, which would have obliged them to consider canonizing her, since that would have required a recognition that the Church had wronged her and caused her death. ==See also== * Hagiography * Miracle == References == Category:Christian hagiography Category:Legends Category:Roses Category:Catholic spirituality Category:Christian miracles ","title":"Miracle of the roses"},{"id":"20564779","text":"Richard Kretz (12 May 1865 - 13 May 1920) was an Austrian pathologist born in Bruck an der Mur, Styria.

San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Retrieved December 24, 2010. His father was a meteorologist. His family first tried to cross the border when David was 11, but they were caught and deported. Around 1983, his father made it across the border and went to Los Angeles, where he became a carpenter. In 1985, at age 14, with his mother and two sisters, he fled Guatemala and emigrated illegally to the United States. Campos graduated at the top of his class at Jefferson High School in South Central Los Angeles. He earned scholarships and admissions to Stanford University, from which he graduated in 1993 with a degree in political science. While attending Harvard Law School from 1993 to 1996, Campos became a permanent resident of the United States and met his partner, Phil Hwang. They married in 2014. After three years of private law practice, Campos became Deputy City Attorney for the City and County of San Francisco in 1999. During his tenure he was chief attorney for San Francisco Unified School District overseeing its school desegregation program. Campos was also appointed as a San Francisco Police Commissioner from 2005-2008. ==San Francisco Board of Supervisors== In 2008, David Campos was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, representing District 9 (Bernal Heights, Portola, and the Inner Mission), succeeding newly-elected State Assemblymember Tom Ammiano. Mayor Gavin Newsom appointed Campos to the vacant supervisorial seat on December 4, 2008, one month before the other freshman supervisors were elected in November 2008. His predecessor, Ammiano, had resigned from the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in early December to start his tenure at the California State Assembly. ===San Francisco Sanctuary City Policy=== In 1989, San Francisco passed the \\"City and County of Refuge\\" Ordinance (also known as the Sanctuary Ordinance) which prohibits City employees from helping Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) with immigration investigations or arrests unless such help is required by federal or state law or a warrant. In 2008, following the arrest of undocumented youth Edwin Ramos for a triple murder, Gavin Newsom amended the sanctuary city policy of San Francisco to allow the city to refer juvenile undocumented immigrants convicted of felonies to federal authorities for deportation. San Francisco had also been referring such youth arrested but not yet tried in court to federal authorities. Supervisor Campos introduced legislation in August 2009 that sought to protect undocumented alien youths from deportation and separation from their families by the San Francisco police. The legislation would have required local authorities to wait for a criminal conviction before turning youth over to ICE. In an editorial for the \\"San Francisco Chronicle\\", Campos stated that his proposal \\"strikes a balance between the former city policy that failed to report people who should have been reported, and the current one, which in essence violates the right of these young people to a hearing on the accusations against them and can ultimately tear them from the protection of their families\\" and that he believed \\"every person has the right to a hearing before being punished and is innocent until proven guilty.\\" ===Free Muni for Youth=== Supervisor Campos and local community activists including P.O.W.E.R. (People Organized to Win Employment Rights) and CCDC (Chinatown Community Development Center) are credited with providing free local public transportation to San Francisco youth. San Francisco residents from low-income communities were outraged after San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) decided to significantly reduce the use of school buses for transporting students to and from school. Campos argued, \\"In the midst of this affordability crisis, we know that low and moderate income families, youth, seniors and people with disabilities are struggling more than ever, and making public transportation affordable and accessible is one step towards alleviating some of the financial stress people are experiencing.\\" On March 1, 2013, the San Francisco Municipal Transit Authority (SFMTA) launched the Free MUNI for Low Income Youth Pilot Program. The 16-month pilot program waived MUNI fares for low- and moderate-income youth residents of San Francisco between the ages of 5 and 18. To qualify for free passes, families must make less than the average income in the Bay Area, which the SFMTA puts at $82,400 for a family of two and $103,000 for a family of four. The SFMTA decided to renew the program in response to the pilot program‚Äôs success. According to preliminary data by the Office of the Mayor, Free Muni for Low Income Youth had a positive impact on San Francisco‚Äôs transportation network. In addition, Clipper card data showed 266,000 more rides by youth Muni riders in May 2013 than in May 2012. Approximately 45 percent of Free Muni for Low Income Youth participants plan to ride public transportation as an adult, while 70 percent would recommend Muni to their friends, according to the San Francisco Unified School District Student Survey results. This success has also inspired Google to contribute $6.8 million and support these efforts for two years. ===Creating reproductive health care buffer zone=== Since it opened in 2011, the San Francisco Planned Parenthood sought to prevent protests by anti-abortion activists. According to proponents of the ordinance, protesters were obscuring access to the clinics with large signs, and taking pictures and video of anyone entering the clinic. At that time abortions accounted for less than 2 percent of patient visits. In May 2013, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors unanimously passed Campos‚Äôs Health Care Access Buffer Zone legislation. The legislation created a 25-foot harassment free buffer zone around all free-standing health clinics in the city. The penalty for encroaching the buffer zone is up to a $1,000 fine or three months in jail. The ordinance also expands the federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which makes it a federal offense to use physical force or intimidation to prevent a person from entering a reproductive health care facility. ===Securing CleanPowerSF=== In September 2012, San Francisco's supervisors voted 8-3 to approve Campos‚Äôs CleanPowerSF legislation. CleanPowerSF is a publicly owned clean energy program that allow residents to choose to buy electricity generated from renewable source rather than from PG&E;, the dominant utility in the city. Ultimately, the plan will use the program‚Äôs revenue stream to help construct the city‚Äôs own renewable energy infrastructure, including wind and solar generators. ===Airbnb Legislation and Lawsuit=== In April 2016, Campos introduced legislation that would fine short- term rental companies such as Airbnb $1000 a day for each listing that wasn't registered with the City of San Francisco. City law requires that all short- term rentals be registered.http://abc7news.com/realestate/sf-supes-going- after-airbnb-other-short-term-rentals/1308845/ After the Board of Supervisors approved the legislation, Airbnb sued the City, claiming that the law violated the Communications Decency Act, which prohibits the government from holding websites accountable for the content published by users.https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/29/technology/airbnb-sues-san-francisco- over-a-law-it-had-helped-pass.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone‚à£=nytcore-iphone- share&_r=1 Campos then introduced new amendments to the legislation to attempt to address the challenges in the lawsuit.http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/SF-may-revise-vacation-rental- law-to-block-Airbnb-8355442.php ==2014 run for state assembly== On August 1, 2013, Campos filed papers at San Francisco City Hall to run for the California State Assembly seat in the 17th District (eastern half of San Francisco). If he had been elected, Campos would have been the first Latino to represent San Francisco in the State Assembly. If elected, he would have been the fourth consecutive LGBT public officials to serve San Francisco in the State Assembly, starting with Carole Migden (1996-2002) and continuing with Mark Leno (2002-2008) and Tom Ammiano (2008-2014). Campos advanced to the general election with David Chiu in the primary on Tuesday, June 3, 2014, with 43 percent of the vote. Chiu won 48 percent of the vote and Republican candidate David Salaverry won 8.5 percent.http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Chiu- wins-Assembly-race-after-Campos-concedes-5877206.php Chiu beat Campos in the general election with 51 percent of the vote. ===2014 California State Assembly candidacy=Post-political career== In March of 2017 Campos was named one of seven deputy executives for Santa Clara County.

It is the deepest-living fish known; one specimen, trawled from a depth of in the Puerto Rico Trench in 1970, holds the record for the deepest fish ever captured.Ohashi, S. & Nielsen, J.G. (2016): A new species of Abyssobrotula (Ophidiiformes, Ophidiidae) from the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench. Zootaxa, 4132 (4): 559‚Äì566. Although generally recognized, some have suggested that the record-breaking individual might have been caught with a non-closing net (a net that is open on the way up and down into the deep) and therefore perhaps caught shallower.Linley, T.D.; M.E. Gerringer; P.H. Yancey; J.C. Drazen; C.L. Weinstock; and A.J. Jamieson (2016). Fishes of the hadal zone including new species, in situ observations and depth records of Liparidae. Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers 114: 99‚Äì110. The first examples of this fish were misidentified by Staiger as Bassogigas profundissimus, before being described as a new species by J√∏rgen G. Nielsen in 1977. The species name refers to the research ship Galathea, which captured the first specimens during the second Galathea expedition. ==Distribution and life history== Though uncommon, this species is known from all tropical and subtropical oceans. It occurs in the abyssal and hadal zones below a depth of . It is bottom-dwelling in nature, although one individual has been captured from the water column in the Gulf of Panama. Its diet consists of polychaete worms and crustaceans, such as isopods and amphipods. Reproduction is oviparous, possibly with pelagic eggs floating in a gelatinous mass as in other members of the family. ==Description== This species has a short head with a downward inflection, a swollen snout and an inferior mouth. The body is soft, with a tapering tail and loose, transparent skin. Both the body and the head are covered with scales. The teeth are small and pointed, arranged in irregular rows; the two median and single pair of basibranchial (on the most ventral gill arch) tooth patches are distinctive for this species. The eyes are tiny, deep-set, and hidden. They are unlikely to be functional, but there is a well-developed system of sensory pores on its head. The lateral line is visible only on the frontmost part of the body and lacks developed pores. Externally, A. galatheae can be distinguished from other deep-sea ophidioids by its long pectoral fins, which contain only 10‚Äì11 fin rays each, and its flat, weakly developed opercular spine. The long dorsal and anal fins contain 97‚Äì116 and 76‚Äì96 rays respectively. The pelvic fins and caudal fin are small and contain 2 and 8 rays respectively. The coloration is yellowish; the branchial cavity is black and the peritoneum dark brown. The skeleton is well- ossified, consistent with a benthic lifestyle; there are 18‚Äì21 precaudal vertebrae. It grows to at least long. ==See also== *Holcomycteronus profundissimus, formerly believed to be the deepest-living species of fish *Pseudoliparis swirei, the species of fish caught at the greatest depth on the seafloor, if the record of Abyssobrotula galatheae is not accepted ==References== Category:Ophidiidae Category:Deep sea fish Category:Fish described in 1977 ","title":"Abyssobrotula galatheae"},{"id":"20564909","text":"A.

Frank Baum, famous as the author of the Oz books. Baum published the novel under the pen name \\"Schuyler Staunton,\\" one of his several pseudonyms.\\"Schuyler Staunton,\\" Daughters of Destiny, Chicago, Reilly & Britton, 1906. (Baum arrived at the name by adding one letter to the name of his late maternal uncle, Schuyler Stanton.)Katharine M. Rogers, L. Frank Baum, Creator of Oz: A Biography, New York, St. Martin's Press, 2002; p. 135. The 1906 edition of the book featured eight illustrations, three by Thomas Mitchell Pierce and five by Harold DeLay. Pierce was a son-in-law of Baum's sister Harriet Alvena Baum Neal; he contributed illustrations to Baum's 1898 poetry collection By the Candelabra's Glare. Baum had originally intended to call his novel The Girl in the Harem.David Maxine, ed., Oz-story Magazine No. 4 (October 1998), p. 3. ==Adult fiction== Overall, Baum dedicated his literary career to writing for children. For a brief period in the middle of the twentieth century's first decade, though, he made a concentrated effort to write for an adult audience as well. This effort produced two other novels in addition to Daughters of Destiny ‚Äî The Fate of a Crown (1905), the first Schuyler Staunton novel, and The Last Egyptian (1908), published anonymously. Writing to entertain, Baum chose exotic locales and melodramatic elements for these books. The Fate of a Crown is set in Brazil, and deals with the revolution of 1889; Daughters of Destiny is set even farther afield, in Baluchistan. In Baum's fiction, Baluchistan is still an independent state, though the region had fallen under the sway of the British Empire in the later nineteenth century. ==Islam== Given his setting and subject, Baum's book had to involve the religion of Islam and an Islamic culture. While his text does deliver some stereotypical \\"dog of an infidel\\" dialogue, Baum for the most part takes a serious and respectful approach to Islam ‚Äì something that was far from universal among Americans and Westerners of his generation. Baum recognizes the existence of Sunni Islam (he uses the term \\"Sunnite\\"), with its Imams (\\"Imaum\\"). Significantly, he introduces a \\"Grand Mufti\\" named Salaman in Chapter 15 of his book, and portrays him as a man of real and profound spirituality and wisdom.Daughters of Destiny, pp. 14, 65, 73, 215 and ff. Baum's hero is a half-Persian, half-American Muslim who marries the Christian American heroine, with no mention of religious conversion. ==Synopsis== The American Construction Syndicate wants to build a railroad across Baluchistan, as part of their plans for global development. The company appoints a commission, headed by Colonel Piedmont Moore, to obtain the right of way from the Baluchi ruler. Moore chooses his personal friend and physician Dr. Warner as his second in command; and with commendable nepotism he selects his son Allison Moore as the commission's surveyor. Dr. Warner's ebullient daughter Bessie wants to come along, and solicits Moore's daughter Janet to come too; the young women will by chaperoned by Bessie's Aunt Lucy. (Col. Moore is secretly pleased that his daughter Janet will make the trip; she has been melancholy after an unhappy love affair, with a man the Colonel regards as a thief and scoundrel.) The Americans travel to Baluchistan, and promptly get themselves embroiled in a succession conflict. The reigning Khan of the country is dying, and two cousins vie for the crown. One, Kasam, is masquerading as their guide. What follows is a complex but tightly-woven plot that involves subterfuge and conspiracy, poisonings and attempted assassinations, sword fights and a pursuit in the desert, a scheming femme fatale, disguises and false identities ‚Äì all the ingredients of melodrama. In the end, Prince Kasam's rival Ahmed (or Hafiz) inherits the throne of Baluchistan ‚Äì but he yields it to Kasam so he can return to the United States with the heroine, Janet Moore. It is revealed that Ahmed/Hafiz is actually Howard Osborne, the man Janet had previously loved (and secretly married, seven years before). Osborne had nobly but foolishly taken the blame for an embezzlement actually committed by Allison Moore, the Colonel's son and Janet's brother. Once all the secrets are out, the difficulties are resolved; and the requisite happy ending is achieved. And Bessie stays behind to marry Prince Kasam, and become the Khanum of Baluchistan. Notably, Ahmed/Hafiz/Osborne abdicates his throne in part for personal reasons, but also because he thinks it would be bad for the country to be ruled by someone deeply influenced by American culture. It is better, he thinks, for the people of Baluchistan to maintain their traditional way of life than to be thrust into the frenetic modern world ‚Äì an interesting rejection, on the author's part, of imperialism and the idolatry of progress.Daughters of Destiny, pp. 300-7. ==Biases== Daughters of Destiny was reprinted in the 1998 issue of the annual Oz-story Magazine, with new illustrations by Eric Shanower. That publication was accompanied by a notice that the story \\"contains a number of offensive stereotypes. Fortunately, they have very little bearing on the story.\\" The comic character David the Jew, the Americans' interpreter, would be offensive to the sensibilities of many modern readers.Daughters of Destiny, p. 167 and ff., especially p. 245. In his thoughtful and deliberative frame of mind, Baum was in favor of tolerance and against bigotry of all types; this is reflected in Daughters of Destiny and in other of his books. (For pertinent examples, see Sky Island and Sam Steele's Adventures on Land and Sea.) Yet he was not, and could not have been, a man with a mindset of modern political correctness.

Rousseau, a member of Tarzan's gang, attempts to rape him soon after his entry, but Claude is not a novice at fighting and dissuades him from further attempts. Tarzan puts out a contract to assassinate him. The leader of a rival gang, Zizi Grenier, reveals the contract to Claude and offers his protection if Claude will fight for him. The two gangs hold public boxing events to avoid all-out war, with disputed territories put on the line. Claude accepts, but over the course of these duels learns of the power games playing out in the background. Claude becomes friends with Lucia (a transvestite) and Jacques (a schizophrenic). He tells them about his love for a girl named Karine and their misadventures which led to his imprisonment, including petty theft, car theft, drug use, an attempted armed robbery gone wrong, and finally involuntary manslaughter during their escape. Lucia is later found dead in her cell. Claude quits the fights, and befriends a man known as \\"the Phantom\\". After Claude is raped with the secret backing of the prison administration, the Phantom helps him escape by illicitly getting him into the prison workshop, and hiding him in a locker shipped out of the prison. Claude rejoins Karine in her drug business, but on a delivery comes across one of the gang members who aided in his rape, arranges a meeting, and murders him. He is arrested and returned to the penitentiary, to learn of Jacques' suicide. Soon after he is subdued when he learns that he has AIDS, and at the Phantom's request is transferred to a minimum-security prison. The movie ends with a letter from the Phantom to Karine informing her of his transfer. ==Cast== * Emmanuel Auger as Claude * Karyne Lemieux as Karine * David BoutinMichel Vais as Jacques le Schizo * Paul Dion as L'Fant√¥me * Dominic Darceuil as Lucia * Sylvain Beauchamps as Tarzan * Louis-David Morasse as Rousseau * Jean-Robert Bourdage as Voix du trou (voice) * Gabriel B√©langer as La Comete Blonde * Deano Clavet as Piston * Christopher Dyson as Claude (voice) * St√©phane Ouellet as Boxeur * Jean-S√©bastien Poirier as Zizi Grenier * Mich√®le P√©loquin as Agente Correctionnel - CO ==Reception== Inside has received mixed reviews from critics and audiences.
