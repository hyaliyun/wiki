Overview  Dalian Yifang experienced a roller-coaster season, starting with a rather confusing status, then constantly improved their performances throughout the season, but faced difficulties again as multiple players are called up by the National training team, and finally made a great salvation. Confusing Preseason Yifang remained low profile after the last successful season, but the team decided not to renew the contract with Juan Caro, despite that Caro himself eagerly wanted to stay. On 26 December 2017, Dalian Yifang officially announced Ma Lin, who shortly sided with the team in 2014, to be the new manager, \\"under the decision of Dalian Municipal Bureau of Sports\\", indicating that the ownership of the team was actually in hiatus. Dalian Yifang moved to Foshan, Guangdong and trained there from 3 January to 12 February, then flew to Jeju, South Korea after the Chinese New Year for further training. Wanda Group, former owner of the disbanded famous local team Dalian Wanda F.C., was widely reported to take over Dalian Yifang, though the decision was not officially announced. The company sought to emphasize back on Chinese market by selling their major overseas assets including shares in Atlético Madrid, after Chinese government put strict regulations and bans on using domestic funding to invest foreign enterprises and investigated a few companies including Wanda, Hainan airlines and Anbang Group. Yifang released Ferrari and Boli, while the two-time best scorer Nyasha Mushekwi stayed. Yifang signed Mate Maleš from HNK Rijeka before Wanda took control, but later claimed that he was medically unfit as soon as Wanda brought Fonté, Carrasco and Gaitán in, thus terminated the transfer and excluded him from the squad, because the 2018 CSL allowed up to 4 foreign players to be registered in one team only. March Yifang started the season with a catastrophic 0-8 defeat against Shanghai SIPG in the coming back match. The tactics, performance and substitutions were all chaotic. The manager Ma Lin even used six defenders after conceding 5 goals, but still too weak for SIPG's oppressing tactics. Ma Lin himself had already experienced a similar 8-1 defeat in the previous season with Liaoning FC against Shanghai Shenhua. In the following two matches, Ma Lin used conservative 5-defender formation, putting Carrasco in the central forward position and fed him with long passes, but the results were unsatisfactory, as the team was still totally suppressed by the opponents. Nicolas Gaitán suffered a minor concussion during the match against Beijing Guoan. The team made contact with Bernd Schuster to replace Ma Lin during the short break of the FIFA Calendar in late March. April On 3 April, Yifang announced that Zhou Jun, who had been working for Shanghai Shenhua since 2006, will be appointed as the chairman after his resignation at Shenhua. Schuster focused on ball possession and passing. He used more young players than the U-23 policy required, which was seldom seen in other teams. Yifang won the first match this season against Liaoning FC in the FA Cup. The team claimed that they will focus on the FA Cup, despite the fact that Yifang constantly struggled in the relegation area. May Yifang defeated Chongqing Dangdai by Sun Bo's long drive to enter the FA Cup quarter-finals on 2 May. On 5 May, Yifang surprisingly overpowered the seven-time league champion Guangzhou Evergrande by 3-0, which was also the first league victory back in the Super League. Nyasha Mushekwi proved himself during this match, scoring 2 goals and gained a penalty as the starting striker. With the limitation of 3 foreign players in the line-up, he replaced José Fonte. On 20 May, Yifang won the critical relegation match against Guizhou Hengfeng. Since Schuster's arrival, the team remain undefeated at home stadium. On 27 May, Jia Xiuquan was appointed as the club's youth training chief inspector. Summer Break The 2018 Chinese Super League came to pause longer than usual, from the end of May until July, in consider of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. José Fonte and Yannick Carrasco entered the final squad to play for their respective national teams. Schuster claimed to improve the team during this period, while the club would seek for new players, especially defensive ones, to improve the squad. Yifang U-19 youth team entered the final round of the U-19 FA Cup, but was defeated 3-4 (0-0) by Jiangsu Suning U-19 in penalty shootout on 28 June. The team moved to Madrid, Spain for summer training from 8 June until 29 June. Leung Nok Hang, Duvier Riascos and a few young players had trials with the team. Mate Maleš left to join CFR Cluj. Wang Wanpeng signed loan contract to another local team Dalian Transcendence. On 21 June, Yifang signed Duvier Riascos for one and a half years on a free transfer, as well as Qin Sheng on a half-year loan from Shanghai Shenhua, then extended the contract with Nyasha Mushekwi for two years. Upon their return to China, Yifang signed Jin Pengxiang from Beijing Guoan on a half year loan. Fonte would terminate the contract with the club, as Riascos will take his position as foreign player. July Yifang started the second half of the season with 5-0 aggregate victory against China League Two team Sichuan Jiuniu in the FA cup, to enter the semi-finals. Cui Ming'an scored a volley from outside the box in the second leg. However, the team did not gained victory in the league since their return as multiple players could not attend the match. Wang Yaopeng, Zhu Ting, Li Shuai and Zhou Ting all had muscle issues, while Carrasco did not return until 31 July.  August  Yifang lost 3 games in a row until the August 1 match against Changchun Yatai. Yang Shanping received a red card as soon as the game started. Li Shuai was called up for China U23 squad to prepare for the 2018 Asian Games, and Yifang gained advantage of using 1 less U23 player than required until 10 August. The losing streak was terminated by a successful 1-0 home revenge to Shanghai SIPG on 5 August. Carrasco scored the only goal after returning from the World Cup. Zhu Xiaogang received a severe 6-match suspension for giving the finger to Shanghai SIPG players after the match. Shortly after, Nyasha Mushekwi scored the first and only hat trick in squad this season, to beat Guangzhou R&F; by 3-0, but would miss the next match for accumulating 4 yellow cards. This victory brought Yifang out of the relegation area for the first time this season. Yifang defeated relegation opponent Henan Jianye by 2-1. Although Zhang Chong made a crucial mistake to give Ricardo Vaz Te a gift goal, Mushekwi scored twice to bring the team back to life. Much controversy appeared as Schuster used regular startups in the FA cup match against Shandong Luneng, that the team's performance would be limited by frequent fixtures. Yifang obtained a 1-1 away draw from another relegation opponent, Chongqing Dangdai, on 25 August. Noticeably, on 12 August, FIFA ordered Iraqi club Al-Shorta SC to pay a final $805,000-worth compensation to Yifang. Al-Shorta signed Nashat Akram in 2014 from Dalian Aerbin, but Akram left Aerbin without permission, and FIFA's decided the transfer had violated the rules. FIFA informed the club previously in March, but the club failed to pay the requested $790 thousand at the time. September Yifang scored 4 goals for the first time this season to claim the 4-3 victory against Shandong Luneng. Jin Qiang scored for the first time since the match against Hunan Billows on 25 July 2015. Zhou Ting broke the record of the oldest player to score in the Chinese Super League by the age of 39 years and 208 days, which he had broke before by the age 36 years and 94 days during the 2015 season for Beijing Guoan against Changchun Yatai on 10 May 2015. Carrasco would play for Belgium in the UEFA Nations League. Mushekwi returned to Zimbabwe, but would miss the 2019 AFCON qualification, because he had had a lot of pain in the pelvis area, and would go for a planned examination in South Africa. The September 15 match against Tianjin Quanjian would be played one day in advance, in consider that Quanjian's AFC championship home match against J1 League team Kashima Antlers on 18 September was moved to Macau due to multiple concerns. With Li Shuai's first goal in his professional career, Yifang won the first away 3-point from Quanjian. Yifang continued the winning streak after defeating Shanghai Shenhua by 2-1. Mushekwi scored twice, including a volley near the goal area. He and Carrasco however, were not chosen for the FA cup away match in Shandong on 25 September, as Yifang headed for exit in the FA cup semi-finals by conceding 3 goals, and was unable to break the 2013 record, when Aerbin lost both matches against Guizhou Moutai in the semi-finals. Although Yifang lost the away match in Guangdong, their points had reached a safer position through September. October Chinese Football Association called up a training squad consists of 55 players, from 8 October until 31 December, including Li Shuai, Wang Yaopeng and Wang Jinxian, after released a file previously on 30 September, indicating that Yifang was capable to neglect the U-23 policy from October. These 3 players would miss the rest league matches this season. Yifang claimed another home victory against Suning. Mushekwi scored twice again, in addition to a free-kick goal from Carrasco, who would miss the next match for accumulating 4 yellow cards. As for the 20 October lost in Guizhou, Zhang Chong achieved, as the team officially recorded, his 100th appearance under the team name of Dalian Yifang, since Yifang took actual control of Dalian Aerbin F.C. in July 2015. Qin Sheng strained his muscle in the match, bringing further difficulties to the team's defense line. Yifang lost 2-3 to Hebei CFFC, with Riascos and Cui Ming'an both scored from outside the box. Mushekwi was unable to play as the doctor recommended, and would have a surgery in Madrid to treat the problem that stalked him for the entire season some time later. On 26 October, a football forum was held in Bangchui Island Hotel, Dalian. Wang Jianlin, potential owner of Yifang, attended the forum, together with the city mayor, a few CFA officials, and owners of other football clubs in Dalian, to discuss about future development of local football. This was strongly believed to be a sign, that Wanda would officially take over the team in the 2019 season, as they did some 24 years ago. November Yifang's November started with another critical loss. Zhu Ting scored his first goal in 2018 season, but Zhang Chong made a Karius-like mistake, by throwing the ball directly to Cao Yongjing, thus ruined the match. Moreover, Yifang lost the following desperate match to Tianjin TEDA. The 4-match losing streak pushed Yifang to the brink of relegation. Mushekwi scored his 50th goal at Yifang, but had a heavy collision later with TEDA goalkeeper Yang Qipeng. He bravely volunteered to resume playing after a short faint, but was eventually substituted off. Later inspection indicated that he suffered potential cervical vertebra injury, to miss the next match. The last round of 2018 season on 11 November saw a desperate situation, as Yifang, Tianjin TEDA, Changchun Yatai and Chongqing Dangdai were identical 32 points. Any loss or draw would lead to large relegation possibilities, Yifang have to win the game to ensure safety. Yatai striker Odion Ighalo was unable to play due to injuries, while Qin Sheng returned in time. With Riascos's header and Carrasco's killer shot near the goal line, the season-highest 51,666 fans watched Yifang safely ranked 11th as the 2018 Chinese Super League reached its final moments.

FIDE. It was won by Azerbaijani grandmaster Teimour Radjabov. He and the runner-up, Ding Liren, both qualified for the Candidates Tournament for the World Chess Championship 2020. It was the 8th edition of the Chess World Cup. Levon Aronian, the winner of the Chess World Cup 2017, advanced to the quarterfinals before being eliminated by Maxime Vachier- Lagrave on tiebreaks. Vachier-Lagrave was eliminated by Radjabov in the semi- finals, but defeated Yu Yangyi to claim 3rd place. Bidding process There was only one bid received for the combined FIDE World Cup and Olympiad events, which was done by the Yugra Chess Federation. Format The tournament was a 7-round knockout event. The matches from round 1 to round 6 consisted of two classical games with a time control of 90 minutes per 40 moves plus 30 minutes for the rest of the game, with an increment of 30 seconds per move. The finals and the match for the third place consisted of four classical games. If the score is tied after the classical games, rapid and, if necessary, blitz tiebreaks are played the next day. Two games are played with a time control of 25 minutes per game plus 10 seconds increment. In the case of a tie, they are followed by two games with a time control of 10 minutes per game plus 10 seconds increment. If the score is still tied, two blitz games follow (5 minutes plus 3 seconds increment). If the score is tied 4–4 after all these games, a single \\"Armageddon\\" game is played: the player who wins the drawing of lots may choose the colour; White has 5 minutes per game and Black has 4 minutes, with an increment of 2 seconds per move starting from move 61, and White needs a win to advance to the next round; Black advances if they win or the game is drawn. The two top finishers qualified for the 2020 Candidates Tournament. The rules in fact specified that it would be the top two finishers other than Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana, because Carlsen as World Champion does not play in the Candidates, and Caruana had already qualified for the Candidates. The rule was introduced because the World Champion and the previous challenger unexpectedly signed up for the previous edition Chess World Cup 2017. This time, though, Carlsen and Caruana both declined their invitations to the World Cup, so the qualifiers are simply the two finalists. Schedule Each of the first six rounds took three days: one day each for the two regular time limit games and then a third day for tiebreaks, if required. The final round has four days of regular time limit games and then a fifth day for tiebreaks, if required. * Round 1: 10 September – 12 September * Round 2: 13 September – 15 September * Round 3: 16 September – 18 September * Rest day: 19 September * Round 4: 20 September – 22 September * Round 5: 23 September – 25 September * Round 6: 26 September – 28 September * Rest day: 29 September * Final and play-off for third place: 30 September – 4 October Prize money The total prize fund was US$1,600,000, with the first prize of US$110,000. {  - !

He would lead the first lap of the race, as Denny Hamlin would pass him just after the start finish line to take over the lead. By lap 6, the field quickly became mostly single file on the top lane. On lap 7 heading into turn 1, Kyle Larson, who was running 5th at that time, made contact with Ricky Stenhouse Jr. which resulted in Larson getting loose onto the apron and back up the track to save it, but fell all the way back to 16th. On lap 10, the field suddenly became double wide in front as Chase Elliott was able to pass Hamlin for the lead. Elliott would be challenged by Austin Dillon for the lead side by side for the next several laps, but Elliott would manage to hang on with the lead. By lap 22, Elliott would again be challenged for the lead this time with Joey Logano, who was running near the front the whole time, with Logano taking over the lead on lap 24 after a push from Martin Truex Jr. On lap 25, all but Kyle Larson, Kevin Harvick, Ricky Stenhouse Jr., Ryan Newman, and Jamie McMurray pitted for fuel and tires. Brad Keselowski was first off of pit road after only taking two tires as the competition caution came out on lap 26. The drivers who didn't pit before the caution ended up pitting for service. Jimmie Johnson was busted after driving through too many pit boxes and would restart at the tail end of the field. The race restarted with 46 to go as Keselowski the leader. On lap 33, Chase Elliott got shuffled out of line while running 2nd and would fall back to 7th. The second caution came out on lap 34 when Jamie McMurray got side drafted by Kurt Busch which caused Jamie to get loose and spin into the outside wall, causing significant damage to the right front. The race restarted with 37 to go with Keselowski leading. With 33 to go, Martin Truex Jr., came up behind Keselowski to take over the lead for a brief moment, when Keselowski passed Truex on the same lap. At the same time, Ricky Stenhouse Jr. got forced below the double yellow line and passed Kyle Busch when he was below the line. He would be assessed a drive-thru penalty that would ultimately eliminate him out of contention. The field became single file once again with 29 to go. With 8 laps to go, the field was still running single file as Brad Keselowski stayed in the lead. His car picked up a big piece of debris that covered a third of his grille, but that didn't really affect him during the race. At 2 laps to go, Austin Dillon was first to make a second lane from the 8th position as Chase Elliott joined him in the inside lane. On the white flag, Ryan Blaney attempted to make a move on the inside, but Keselowski blocked Blaney. On the back straightaway, Kyle Larson bumped Jimmie Johnson into the outside wall creating a multi-car crash collecting Kasey Kahne, Martin Truex Jr., Chase Elliott, and Kyle Busch. This brought out the final caution and Keselowski was ahead of the wreck and drove on to his first Clash victory. Race results {  style=\\"font-size:98% - ! Pos ! Grid ! ! Driver ! Team !

The band is intended to express van Giersbergen's heavy metal side, as opposed to the softer side of her solo career. They released their debut album In This Moment We Are Free – Cities on 20 October 2017.  History  Singer Marcela Bovio was initially part of the line-up. However, when the recording of the band's debut album started, Bovio and Van Giersbergen \\"wanted to take very different directions when it came to the sound and approach of the vocals\\". After failing to find a compromise that would satisfy both creatively, it was decided that Bovio would leave the band, as the two were afraid that doing otherwise would leave both regretful and hurt their friendship. Bovio made her departure official on April 11, 2017, stating \\"I’m truly devastated, because I’m a huge fan of Anneke and every single member of the band; they’re all incredibly sweet people, as well as top notch musicians. Plus, the songs are so fantastic… this is going to be a revolutionary album! But I have to follow my heart and choose for what I think in the future will bring me (and the rest of the band) happiness, no matter how hard it feels right now.

They released their debut album In This Moment We Are Free – Cities on 20 October 2017 and are expected to tour until the end of 2018.

He was accused of espionage and collaboration with Israel and sentenced to death. He has worked in several universities in Europe, among which Karolinska University of Sweden, where he had also attended his PhD program, Università degli Studi del Piemonte Orientale (Italy), Vrije Universiteit Brussel (Belgium). He also cooperated with universities in Iran and is in contact with universities worldwide, including in Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United States.  Academic work  Dr. Jalali's academic work in the field of disaster medicine has looked at issues related to emergency medicine in a range of contexts, such as Italy, Denmark, Sweden and Iran and has over 700 citations. He was a key figure in establishing the Università del Piemonte Orientale (CRIMEDIM) Research Center in Emergency and Disaster in Italy and has been part of important studies on the level of preparedness of hospitals for disasters. Published studies he co-authored have also looked at hospital preparedness for earthquakes, man-made conflicts, Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) emergencies and massive influxes of emergency patients. A 2016 study looked at the preparedness level of Emergency Departments of Italian hospitals by assessing the knowledge-base of emergency physicians on basic disaster planning and procedures. The study found a need to enhance staff disaster preparedness education, training and follow-up to ensure understanding and awareness of Emergency Plans. He has also contributed to the development of curricula for post-graduate courses on disaster medicine for undergraduates and postgraduates.  Arrest and imprisonment  In April 2016, when he was visiting Iran, following an invitation from the University of Tehran and Shiraz University, he was arrested upon order of the Ministry of Intelligence and Security, without a valid warrant or reason for arrest. Two weeks later he was faced with charges of espionage and collaboration with Israel, the proof being an alleged letter from his spouse, which allegedly contained evidence of the accusations. His family was not informed on his whereabouts for ten days, though they knew he had been arrested. After being held at an unknown location for approx. 7 days, he was transferred to section 209 of Evin prison, where he was held for 7 months. During the calls made to his family, Dr. Djalali said he had been held in solitary confinement for 3 months, and the following months in partial isolation.  Sentence  On the 31 January 2017, after nine months of detention, Dr. Djalali was taken to branch 15 of the Revolutionary Court in Teheran where he was formally charged with espionage, despite the lack of evidence, and he was told that he could face a death penalty. Reportedly, his lawyer was not allowed to be present at the hearing and he was denied access to the case files. After more months of unjustified detention, he was sentenced to death on the 21 October 2017 on the charge of “corruption on earth” (ifsad fil-arz). He was then incarcerated at Evin prison. In November 2017, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention formally requested the Iranian Government to provide detailed information about his detention, but it did not receive a response. In late 2018, an Iranian state TV presented him as a spy and showed his alleged confession which, according to Dr. Djalali, was a pre-written text that he was forced to say under threats of execution, and even of harming his loved ones. Attempts by his lawyer to submit appeals for judicial review of the sentence have been rejected, and the last one is apparently still pending. On July 29, 2019, Dr. Djalali was transferred again from Evin Prison to an unknown location. There, he was severely tortured and threatened with the execution of the death sentence in order to gain more confessions from him.  Health condition  Dr. Djalali's health conditions have been deteriorating since his arrest. In particular, blood tests run in 2018 indicated a low white blood cell count. Subsequently, he was examined by a medical doctor in early 2019 at Evin Prison; he was recommended to be seen by a specialist in haematology in hospital, but this request was denied. The recommended follow-up examinations have not been done. Reportedly, furthermore, Dr. Djalali has lost 24 kg since the time of his arrest. The World Medical Association has taken up his case and its president, Ketan Desai, has written to the Iranian authorities saying that the conditions under which Dr. Djalali is being held contravene medical ethics and human rights law.  International pressure   United Nations  In November 2017, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention formally requested the Iranian Government to provide detailed information about his detention and it did not receive a response. On 9 February 2018, United Nations human rights experts urgently called on Iran to lift the death sentence against Ahmadreza Djalali. United Nations human rights experts appealed to Iran to annul the death sentence against Djalali for the first time during 2017. The experts were Mr. José Antonio Guevara Bermúdez, Chair- Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; Mr. Nils Melzer, Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; Ms. Agnes Callamard, Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions; and Ms. Asma Jahangir, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran. They adopted the opinion No. 92/2017. On 18 September 2017, the Working Group transmitted allegations to the Government under its regular communications procedure but did not receive a response from the Iranian Government. This document explains why the deprivation of liberty of Ahmadreza Djalali is in contravention of articles 3, 5, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and of articles 7, 9, 10 and 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and it clearly states that the appropriate remedy would be to release Mr. Djalali immediately and accord him an enforceable right to compensation and other reparations, in accordance with international law. United Nations human rights experts repeated their urgent call in 2018. In the 2020 Annual report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and reports of the Office of the High Commissioner and the Secretary-General, it is stated that \\"There are persistent concerns about the situation of dual and foreign nationals who remain imprisoned in the Islamic Republic of Iran [...]. Iranian-Swedish citizen Ahmadreza Djalali, sentenced to death in October 2017 on espionage charges, was reportedly transferred on 29 July 2019 to an unknown location for approximately 10 days before being returned to Evin Prison. During that time, he was reportedly pressured to confess to further allegations. Mr. Djalali, along with other dual and foreign nationals, including Mr. Ghaderi, have been denied medical treatment, notably for life- threatening conditions.\\" In the Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran 2020, it is underlined that \\"the security and intelligence officials, including the Ministry of Intelligence and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, have in many cases prevented access to medical care for detainees and prisoners, or made medical attention or transfers to hospital conditional upon confession.\\" In addition, the Special Rapporteur is concerned about the practice of publicizing forced confession: \\"Ahmadreza Djalali, a Swedish-Iranian academic, had his confession to spying on the Islamic Republic of Iran broadcast on State television in December 2017, five days after the Supreme Court had upheld his death sentence through a hastily convened and secret process during which no submissions from the defence had been allowed\\". It is reported Mr. Djalali recorded the confession under duress, after his interrogators had said that he would be released from solitary confinement only if he recorded the confession.  Nobel Laureates  In December 2018, 121 Nobel Laureates wrote an open letter to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to provide medical assistance for professor Djalali and ask for his release.  Amnesty International  Amnesty International has been closely following and collecting the information about Djalali’s living conditions and health status, especially the inhuman conditions Djalali has experienced during his imprisonment. Since 2017, Amnesty International has launched the campaign to encourage public audiences to write a petition letter and submit to Iranian Supreme Leader Office, President of Iran, and Chief Justice of Iran (head of the Judiciary), to ask for an immediate release of Djalali, and a proper health medication, to ensure Djalali’s safety, and his accessibility to lawyer and family, including the Swedish consular to meet him. The 2020 Nowruz Action is a campaign to support prisoners of conscience in Iran on the occasion of Iranian traditional new year festival. Amnesty encourages public audiences to send supporting messages to the prisoners and their families. This year Amnesty International selected seven cases of political prisoners and academic prisoners, among which was Djalali’s case, to represent the Amnesty’s Nowruz campaign.  Scholars at Risk Network (SAR)  Scholars at Risk (SAR) is an international network of institutions and individuals to promote academic freedom and protect scholars from academic freedom threats. SAR has been engaging and pushing public campaigns to support Dr. Djalali, for example, by releasing letters to public authorities in Iran and conducting online activities via social networks. In January 2018, SAR published the campaign ‘#SaveAhmad’ through social media to exert pressures to public institutions to support Dr. Djalali’s release. In March 2020, in response to COVID-19 pandemic, SAR has issued the letter to Iranian authorities to unconditionally release Dr. Djalali because of his health conditions.  European universities  In November 2017, European University Association (EUA) put pressure on Iranian authorities for a reversal of Djalali’s capital sentence and an instant release of Djalali. The EUA wrote a letter to Iranian Supreme Leader, and expressed grave concerns about the ongoing harm to Djalali and his family. In April 2018, Flemish University Council (VLIR) decided to postpone all academic cooperation with Iranian universities and institutions in response to Iranian authorities’ decision to imprison and lay down death sentences over Dr. Djalali, one of the professors of Brussel Free University. On this occasion, the Council expressed deep concerns about the professor's imprisonment and requested the Iranian authorities to provide him medical care. The University Council posited that the Flemish universities’ cooperation with Iranian institutions would not be continued if the Iranian government did not take any actions to support Dr. Djalali. On 31 October, the Università degli studi del Piemonte, the Karolinska University and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel sent a letter to the head of the judiciary of Iran, Sadegh Larijani asking for Dr. Djalali immediate release. In the letter the universities recalled the excellent reputation of Dr. Djalali recalled the right to freedom of expression.  Case update   2020  * After the widespread of the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, Iranian authorities have released 85,000 individuals from prisons, including political prisoners.

Both nations are members of the Council of Europe, European Union and the OECD. History Viking siege of Paris  Early history  One of the first contacts between France and Sweden was in 799 during the first Viking raids of the Frankish northern coast. In March 845 Viking Danish- Swedish King Ragnar brought 120 ships up the Seine river for the Siege of Paris. The Vikings left Paris after a month of battle when Frankish King Charles the Bald paid them 7,000 lbs of silver and gold.Paris Sacked by Viking's In 911 after multiple Viking invasions, Frankish King Charles the Simple conceded the town of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte to the Vikings. In 1499, France and Sweden signed a Trade Treaty for which Sweden sent France hides, skins, furs, butter, fish oil, herrings, whales, tar, timber for the navy, iron and copper. In exchange, the French sent salt Brouage, wheat, wine, canvas, sheets, silks and spices. In 1631, during the Thirty Years' War, France and Sweden signed the Treaty of Bärwalde which obliged Sweden to maintain an army of 36,000 troops, and France to fund the Swedish army annually with 400,000 Reichsthalers. In the 1700s, French culture and the French language became a big influence on the Swedish monarchy. Swedish king Gustave III received a French education as a child. Several prominent Swedish nobles studied in France. Influenced by the French Academy of Sciences, Sweden created the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.  Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte and the Napoleonic Wars  Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte (Charles XIV John) as Crown Prince of Sweden In 1805, Sweden entered into the War of the Third Coalition and fought against France in the Franco-Swedish War in an effort to defeat France under Napoleon Bonaparte. The war lasted until January 1810 when Sweden was defeated by France's ally at the time, Russia. After the war, France and Sweden signed the Treaty of Paris (1810). That same year after the war, French Marshal Jean-Baptiste Jules Bernadotte who served under Emperor Napoleon; was elected as the heir-presumptive to King Charles XIII of Sweden who was childless. Bernadotte was elected partly because a large part of the Swedish Army, in view of future complications with Russia, were in favor of electing a soldier, and because he was also popular with the Swedish army, owing to the kindness he had shown to the Swedish prisoners in Lübeck. Bernadotte accepted the offer. In 1813, Bernadotte successfully led Swedish troops against Napoleon during the War of the Sixth Coalition which resulted in Napoleon being exiled to the Island of Elba in 1814. In 1818 Bernadotte was crowned King of Sweden and King of Norway after defeating Norway in the war of 1814 after demanded Denmark to cede Norway to Sweden after the Napoleonic Wars as compensation for the loss of Finland in the Finnish War's to which the allies agreed, mainly to prevent further conflict. The Danish king ceded Norway shortly after the demands in fear of Sweden declaring war on Denmark. After the defeat of Norway in 1814 the creation of the union between Sweden and Norway came through. The union lasted for almost a century until being peacefully dissolved in 1905. https://www.thelocal.se/20140815/sweden- celebrates-200-years-of-peace After this he became Charles XIV John of Sweden, and simultaneously founded the House of Bernadotte from which the current Swedish royal family hails from. Sweden declared itself officially neutral in 1818 from future conflicts.  World Wars  During World War I and World War II Sweden remained officially neutral during both conflicts, however, unofficially sympathized more with the allies and provided military training to allied soldiers. During World War II, French born Swedish diplomat Raoul Nordling secretly met with German General Dietrich von Choltitz to try to limit the bloodshed and damage to the city of Paris during the Liberation of Paris.  Post World Wars  Since the end of the world wars, both France and Sweden have joined the European Union. Both nations have had numerous high-level visits and cooperate jointly in several multilateral organizations. There are approximately 15,000 Swedish nationals living in France and 3,500 French nationals living in Sweden. Military cooperation Military cooperation between France and Sweden is modest as the Swedish focus on exchanges with their Nordic neighbors. Cooperation is primarily operational and has, during the Libyan crisis, enabled Swedish Gripen fighters to take part in NATO air operations.Diplomatie:Military and police cooperation The Swedish armed forces have cooperated with French forces in Africa on several occasions, particularly during the Operation Artemis, UNIFIL Maritime Task Force, and EUFOR Chad. Trade In 2015, trade between France and Sweden totaled €10 billion Euros.Diplomatie: France and Sweden In 2014, Sweden was France's 16th-largest customer and 18th-largest supplier.

It is endemic to New Zealand. Specimens of this moth were first collected by Frederick Giles Gibbs. Adults frequent alpine areas at about 4,500 feet and are on the wing in December. The species was first described by Edward Meyrick in 1913. Meyrick in an article published in 1914 stated that the original name was misprinted as Aletia fibriata and the correct spelling was Aletia fibrata. George Hudson, in The Moths and Butterflies of New Zealand, used the species name Alentia fibrata when discussing the species, however more recent publications use the original name of Alentia fibriata. Taxonomy The genus level classification of New Zealand endemic moths within the genus Aletia is regarded as unsatisfactory and is under revision. It is likely that this species will be removed from the genus Aletia and be placed within one of the following genera: Physetica, Graphania, Tmetolophota or Ichneutica. As such the species is currently also known as Aletia (s.l.) fibriata. Description Meyrick described the species as having a 44-46mm wingspan.

It was the eighth final of the FIFA Women's World Cup, a quadrennial tournament contested by the women's national teams of the member associations of FIFA. The match was played on 7 July 2019 at the Parc Olympique Lyonnais in Décines-Charpieu, a suburb of Lyon, France. The final was contested by the United States, the defending champion, and the Netherlands, in their first final. The United States won 2–0, earning their second consecutive and fourth overall Women's World Cup title, with second-half goals scored by co-captain Megan Rapinoe from the penalty spot and Rose Lavelle. With their victory, the U.S. joined Germany as the second team to win consecutive titles. The team's coach, Jill Ellis, became the first manager to win two Women's World Cup titles. Each finalist was the reigning champion of their own respective confederation, with the United States having won the 2018 CONCACAF Women's Championship and the Netherlands having won UEFA Women's Euro 2017. Venue The Parc Olympique Lyonnais in Décines-Charpieu hosted the final. The final was held at the Parc Olympique Lyonnais in Décines-Charpieu, a suburb of Lyon. During the tournament, the stadium was referred to as the Stade de Lyon by FIFA. The venue has a seating capacity of 57,900, and hosted both semi-final matches. The stadium was announced as the final venue when France was confirmed as host on 19 March 2015, with the stadium officially confirmed to host the semi- finals and final in September 2017. The stadium is home venue of Ligue 1 club Lyon, opening in January 2016 to replace their previous stadium, the Stade de Gerland. It has also hosted several UEFA Women's Champions League matches for the club's women's side, which is the most successful in European history. In 2008, the project for the new stadium was agreed upon by the government and commune of Décines. Stadium construction started in mid 2013, and finished in late 2015 at a cost of €450 million. The stadium was chosen as a venue for UEFA Euro 2016, where it hosted six matches. The stadium also hosted the 2017 Coupe de la Ligue Final and 2018 UEFA Europa League Final. Outside of football, the Parc Olympique Lyonnais has hosted several musical performances, as well as ice hockey and rugby union matches, including the Rugby Champions Cup and Rugby Challenge Cup finals of 2016. The stadium is planned to host matches for the 2023 Rugby World Cup and the men and women's football tournaments at the 2024 Summer Olympics.

For the first time since 2007, and fifth time overall (along with 1991, 1995 and 2003), the final featured a European team, as the continent took seven of the eight places in the quarter-finals. The previous two finals were contested by Japan and the United States. The match was the first final since 1991 to feature a North American side against a European side. The match was also the first final of a women's or men's World Cup to feature the defending champions against the reigning European champions. The match was a record-extending fifth Women's World Cup final for the United States, who were the defending champions and record winners of the competition with three titles. They won the inaugural final in 1991 against Norway, before winning their second title in 1999 as hosts via a penalty shoot-out victory against China PR. They made their next appearance in the 2011 final, losing on penalties to Japan, before securing their third title in the 2015 rematch against Japan. In the previous seven editions of the tournament, the U.S. never finished outside of the top three. The fixture was the third consecutive appearance in the final for the United States, setting a competition record. Jill Ellis became the third manager to reach two Women's World Cup finals, after Even Pellerud for Norway (in 1991 and 1995) and Norio Sasaki for Japan (in 2011 and 2015), both with one win and one loss in the final. With her counterpart Sarina Wiegman, the match was the second final in which both teams have a female coach, after the 2003 matchup between Tina Theune of Germany and Marika Domanski-Lyfors of Sweden. The match was the first Women's World Cup final for the Netherlands in their second tournament appearance. They were the fourth European country (after Germany, Norway and Sweden) and eighth overall to reach a Women's World Cup final, and the first new finalist since Japan in 2011. In the Netherlands only prior tournament appearance, in 2015, they were eliminated in the round of 16 by defending champions and eventual runners-up Japan. The match is the eighth meeting between the United States and the Netherlands, and the first competitive fixture as all prior matches were friendlies. The sides first met in 1991, which the Netherlands won 4–3, but the U.S. have won all six subsequent meetings, most recently a 3–1 win in September 2016.

The United States is the most successful team in women's football, having won three Women's World Cups in four previous final appearances and four Olympic gold medals. The team had never finished below third place in all eight editions of the World Cup. Jill Ellis was appointed as interim head coach of the team in 2014, following the firing of Tom Sermanni between major tournaments, and oversaw qualification for the 2015 World Cup using a core inherited from earlier cycles. The United States had reached their second consecutive final in 2015, playing in a rematch of the 2011 final in which they had lost to Japan. The Americans won 5–2, including a first-half hat-trick by Carli Lloyd, to secure their third Women's World Cup title—their first since 1999. Following an early quarter-final exit at the 2016 Olympics, Ellis adjusted the team's usual formation and adopted a 4–3–3 with an emphasis on faster play under the direction of new call-ups. The United States qualified for the 2019 Women's World Cup by winning the 2018 CONCACAF Women's Championship, outscoring their opponents 26–0 and defeating Canada in the final. The U.S. team, entering the tournament ranked first in the FIFA World Rankings, were drawn into Group F and opened their title defence with a 13–0 victory against Thailand, setting a new tournament record for largest margin of victory and goals in a match. Alex Morgan scored five goals, equalling a one-match record set by compatriot Michelle Akers in 1991, and several of her teammates earned their first World Cup goals in their debuts. The U.S. team were later criticised for celebrating their later goals during the match, with some media commentators and former players calling it disrespectful, but the celebrations were defended by other media commentators, the team's players and members of the opposing Thai bench. Ellis then fielded a squad of reserve players in a 3–0 win over debutants Chile, which included Carli Lloyd's pair of goals and a missed penalty kick. The U.S. closed out its group by winning 2–0 against Sweden, advancing with three shutout victories and outscoring opponents 18–0, a group stage record in the Women's World Cup. In the round of 16, the U.S. played Group B runners-up Spain, who conceded an early penalty in the seventh minute that was converted by captain Megan Rapinoe. Spanish forward Jennifer Hermoso found an equaliser within three minutes after capitalising on a defensive error near the top of the box, shooting from distance to beat goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher and end her shutout streak. The U.S. were awarded a second penalty kick after a foul in the box on Rose Lavelle and won the match 2–1 on another conversion by Rapinoe in the 75th minute per instruction from Ellis, after Morgan initially looked set to take the kick. The Americans were then matched against hosts France, winners of Group A and a tournament favourite, in the quarter-finals. This was the first time the U.S. had faced the tournament hosts of the Women's World Cup. Rapinoe opened the scoring in the fifth minute, with a free kick that was driven low and through several players, and added a second in the 65th minute by finishing a cut-back cross from Tobin Heath in the box. French defender Wendie Renard scored a consolation goal in the 81st minute on a headed corner kick, but the U.S. held on to win 2–1 and eliminate the hosts. The U.S. played England in the semi-finals, but were without Rapinoe due to a hamstring injury that kept her out of the starting line-up. Her replacement, Christen Press, scored the opening goal in the tenth minute on a header in the box; English forward Ellen White then volleyed a shot from inside the box in the 19th minute to earn her team an equaliser. Alex Morgan restored the U.S. lead in the 31st minute, the first player in Women's World Cup history to score on her birthday, finishing a cross by Lindsey Horan with a header that she celebrated with a controversial tea-sipping gesture. White scored an apparent second equaliser in the 67th minute, but was ruled offside by a video assistant referee (VAR) decision. A VAR decision in the 82nd minute determined that White was fouled in the penalty area by defender Becky Sauerbrunn and awarded a penalty to England. The resulting penalty was struck by captain Steph Houghton and saved by Alyssa Naeher, the first penalty save by a U.S. goalkeeper in the Women's World Cup outside of a shoot-out, ensuring a 2–1 victory for the United States. The U.S. reached their third consecutive Women's World Cup final by winning all six matches without trailing. Their semi-final win set a new tournament record for longest winning streak with eleven wins since 2015, as well as a record sixteen World Cup matches undefeated. They scored 24 goals en route to the final, including one in the opening twelve minutes of each match, coming close to the single-tournament record of 25. Netherlands Dutch winger alt=Footballer Lieke Martens prepares to kick the ball with her outstretched left foot. The Netherlands, nicknamed the Oranje, first qualified for a major women's tournament in 2009, reaching the semi-finals of their first UEFA European Championship, and qualified for their first FIFA Women's World Cup in 2015. The team's rapid improvement in international competition was credited to the establishment of a professional club league in 2007 with investment from the Royal Dutch Football Association; the league later merged to form a combined Belgian–Dutch competition in 2012 and split again in 2015. In the 2015 Women's World Cup, the Dutch side finished third in their group with a 1–1–1 record and advanced to the round of 16, where they lost 2–1 to eventual runners-up Japan. The Netherlands hosted and won the 2017 European Championship, earning their first major international title with a dominating style implemented by interim manager Sarina Wiegman. The Dutch earned the last remaining European berth in the 2019 Women's World Cup by finishing second to Norway in its qualification group and winning the play-offs, defeating Denmark over two legs in the semi- finals and Switzerland in the finals. The Dutch, ranked eighth in the FIFA World Rankings, were drawn into Group E with two of their 2015 group stage opponents, Canada and New Zealand, alongside Cameroon. Their opening match against New Zealand was scoreless until a last-minute header by substitute Jill Roord in stoppage time won it 1–0 for the Dutch. The Netherlands secured a knockout stage berth by defeating Cameroon 3–1 on the second matchday, with two goals by Vivianne Miedema to make her the nation's all-time top goalscorer. The Dutch finished with a three-win record and topped the group after winning 2–1 against Canada. An early penalty was rescinded by the VAR and the opening goal was scored by Dutch defender Anouk Dekker in the 54th minute. Christine Sinclair scored an equaliser six minutes later, but the Netherlands restored their lead in the 75th minute through a short-range finish by substitute Lineth Beerensteyn. The round of 16 fixture for the Oranje was also a rematch against Japan, which manager Wiegman expected to end with a different result. Lieke Martens scored in the 17th minute with a backheel flick off a corner kick, but Japanese midfielder Yui Hasegawa equalised before half-time. The second half saw Japan creating more chances, with Dutch goalkeeper Sari van Veenendaal crucially saving a shot from Yuka Momiki in the 80th minute to keep the scores level. In second-half stoppage time, the Dutch were awarded a controversial penalty kick by the VAR for a handball in the box by captain Saki Kumagai, which was then scored by Martens to win the match 2–1. The Netherlands defeated Italy 2–0 in the quarter- finals, also qualifying for the 2020 Olympics, through second-half headers scored by Miedema in the 70th minute and Stefanie van der Gragt ten minutes later. The match was played in heat and required several cooling breaks, which slowed the tempo of play. The Netherlands reached their first Women's World Cup final by winning 1–0 in extra time against Sweden in the semi-finals. The match was scoreless in regulation time, due to the performances of both defences and goalkeepers, who made saves to keep several chances from breaking the deadlock. Jackie Groenen scored the lone goal of the match in the 99th minute, striking from to beat goalkeeper Hedvig Lindahl, with her first shot on target during the tournament. The Dutch were the third reigning European champions to reach the final, following Germany in 2003 and 2007, and the first to play a non-European country in the final. The Netherlands also managed to reach the final without trailing in their six victories, conceding only once in the knockout stage but not leading at half-time in any of their matches. The success of the Dutch side has brought national attention to the women's football program, including thousands of fans who travelled to France to attend matches and record television ratings reaching 5 million viewers for the semi-final. Pre-match Scheduling The final's scheduling on 7 July led to a degree of criticism among supporters of women's football, as two continental men's tournament finals were held on the same day—the Copa América in Rio de Janeiro and the CONCACAF Gold Cup in Chicago. The latter final also featured the men's team of the United States. However, FIFA confirmed the Women's World Cup dates in September 2017, prior to the dates announced by CONMEBOL and CONCACAF. While FIFA called the scheduling a \\"rare and exciting occurrence\\", U.S. co-captain Megan Rapinoe criticised it as \\"ridiculous and disappointing\\". CONCACAF president Victor Montagliani said that the scheduling of the Gold Cup final had been the result of a \\"clerical error\\" and that the conflict was not realised until it was too late. Match ball Tricolore 19, the match ball of the final. The official match ball for the final was the Adidas Tricolore 19, introduced for the knockout stage as a red-coloured variant of the Conext 19. The ball featured a blue-and-red glitch graphic, and pays homage to the original Adidas Tricolore, which was introduced for the men's 1998 FIFA World Cup, in which France were victorious for the first time while on home soil. Officials Stéphanie Frappart, the referee for the final. On 5 July 2019, FIFA named French official Stéphanie Frappart as the referee for the final. Frappart had been a FIFA referee since 2009, and previously officiated at the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, 2016 Summer Olympics and UEFA Women's Euro 2017. In April 2019, she became the first woman to referee in Ligue 1, the top men's professional league in France. The final was Frappart's fourth match as referee during the tournament, having officiated two group stage matches and a quarter-final fixture. Her compatriot Manuela Nicolosi was chosen as one of the assistant referees, along with Irish official Michelle O'Neill. Claudia Umpiérrez of Uruguay was chosen as the fourth official, with her compatriot Luciana Mascaraña serving as the reserve assistant referee. Spaniard Carlos del Cerro Grande was named the video assistant referee, presiding over the first use of the technology in the final of the Women's World Cup. His fellow countryman José María Sánchez Martínez was named as one of the assistant video assistant referees for the match, along with Mariana de Almeida of Argentina. Team selection American co- captain Megan Rapinoe, who scored five goals and had three assists during the tournament, was left out of the semi-final line-up against England due to a pulled hamstring. However, she said that she expected to return ahead of the final. U.S. midfielder Rose Lavelle also had to be substituted out in the semi-final due to a hamstring injury, though she also said that she was fit to play in the final. Dutch winger Lieke Martens, winner of The Best FIFA Women's Player in 2017, was also listed as questionable due to a toe injury. She started in the semi-final against Sweden, previously a doubt for the match, though she was unable to make an impact and was substituted out at half-time. The team's goalkeeper, Sari van Veenendaal, finished the semi-final with a swollen hand, but returned to the starting line-up for the final. Match Summary The United States fielded their unusual 4–3–3 that was used by Jill Ellis during the tournament, including Megan Rapinoe, the U.S. captain for the match, after her injury that kept her from starting in the semi-final. Lieke Martens returned for the Netherlands side, while Shanice van de Sanden was placed on the bench. The match kicked off at 17:00 in heat, which was lower than the earlier forecasts for the ongoing continental heat wave. The match was attended by 57,900 spectators, including a large number of American fans and a stand of Dutch fans organised behind one of the goals. French president Emmanuel Macron, Dutch monarch Willem-Alexander, and several professional male and female footballers were also among those in attendance. The United States started several attacks early in the match, but failed to score within the opening twelve minutes as they had in their previous six matches. The two sides traded fouls, including one that earned Sherida Spitse a yellow card in the tenth minute, but the U.S. remained in control of possession and had several chances towards goal. Dutch goalkeeper and captain Sari van Veenendaal made several saves to keep her shutout, including two shots before half-time from Sam Mewis and Alex Morgan. A foul on Rose Lavelle at the top of the penalty area was left uncalled, allowing the Dutch to spring a counterattack that ended with a foul on forward Lineth Beerensteyn by U.S. defender Abby Dahlkemper, who earned a yellow card. In first half stoppage time, U.S. defender Kelley O'Hara and Dutch winger Lieke Martens collided heads during an aerial challenge, resulting in O'Hara being substituted at half-time for Ali Krieger. Another physical challenge, resulting in a bloody facial cut for U.S. defender Becky Sauerbrunn, began the second half as the U.S. continued to have the majority of attacking chances. Dutch defender Stefanie van der Gragt kicked U.S. attacker Alex Morgan in the shoulder while attempting to control the ball in the penalty area, which was left uncalled until a VAR review by referee Stéphanie Frappart awarded a penalty to the United States. Van der Gragt earned a yellow card and the penalty was scored in the 61st minute by U.S. captain Megan Rapinoe, who left Van Veenendaal standing on her line; the penalty was Rapinoe's sixth goal of the tournament, winning her the Golden Boot and making her the oldest player to score in a Women's World Cup final. Eight minutes later, Rose Lavelle scored the second goal of the final for the U.S. on a solo run through the Dutch defence that ended with a left-footed strike from . Down 2–0 and still conceding attacking chances to the U.S., the Netherlands substituted defender Anouk Dekker for forward Shanice van de Sanden and forced a save out of U.S. goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher. Van Veenendaal made several saves to deny a third goal for the United States after shots on target by Morgan, Tobin Heath, and Crystal Dunn. Rapinoe was substituted by Christen Press in the 79th minute, while Carli Lloyd was brought on in the last minutes of regulation time. After the end of the match, the U.S. bench spilled onto the field to celebrate the team's fourth Women's World Cup title.

The United States won a record-extending fourth title, and became the second team to win consecutive editions of the Women's World Cup, following Germany in 2003 and 2007. The victory was also the first World Cup title on European soil for the U.S. During the 2019 tournament, the U.S. scored 26 goals to set a new record for most goals in a single Women's World Cup, surpassing the record of 25 shared by the U.S. in 1991 and Germany in 2003. The team's goal difference of +23 also set a new tournament record. Their World Cup unbeaten streak was also extended to 17 matches, including 12 consecutive wins. Jill Ellis became the first manager to win two Women's World Cup titles, amid criticism from fans over her style of management. On 10 July, the team were honoured with a ticker tape parade down the Canyon of Heroes in New York City and received their third Outstanding Team ESPY Award in Los Angeles. Megan Rapinoe was named the player of the match, and was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament. She also won the Golden Boot as the top scorer of the tournament with six goals and three assists, while Alex Morgan won the Silver Boot with the same tallies; Rapinoe won the award on the second tie-breaker, having played fewer minutes. At the age of 34, Rapinoe became the oldest player to win the Golden Ball and Golden Boot awards. Rose Lavelle won the Bronze Ball award, while Dutch goalkeeper Sari van Veenendaal won the Golden Glove award as the best goalkeeper of the tournament; her eight saves in the final were the most during any knockout stage match in the 2019 tournament. Rapinoe became the second player to start in three Women's World Cup finals, after Birgit Prinz of Germany (1995, 2003 and 2007). Additionally, Tobin Heath, Ali Krieger, Carli Lloyd and Alex Morgan joined them as the only players to make an appearance in three finals. Rapinoe's goal made her the first player to convert a penalty outside of a shoot-out in a Women's World Cup final, as German goalkeeper Nadine Angerer saved the only previous final penalty taken by Marta of Brazil in 2007. The goal also meant that Rapinoe became the oldest player to score in a final, surpassing teammate Carli Lloyd who scored a hat-trick in the 2015 final at the age of 32 years and 354 days. The United States will receive $4 million (3.5 million euros) in prize money as the winners of the tournament, while the Netherlands will receive $2.6 million (2.3 million euros) as runners-up. The U.S. team will also play a four-match victory tour that will entitle them to a share of profits, totalling approximately $250,000 per player. The monetary prizes, along with small bonuses from the United States Soccer Federation, were criticised as being unfair and discriminatory compared to those offered to men's teams; fans in the stadium chanted \\"Equal pay!\\" during FIFA president Gianni Infantino's appearance at the trophy ceremony alongside French president Emmanuel Macron. Several media personalities and sportspeople from the U.S. also mentioned the issue while congratulating the team on their victory. In response, Senator Joe Manchin introduced a bill in the U.S. Senate that would make equal pay for the women's team a requirement for federal funding for the 2026 men's World Cup, which is planned to be partially hosted by the United States. U.S. President Donald Trump, who had criticised Rapinoe's anthem protest and comments about rejecting a White House visit, also congratulated the team alongside former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. On 30 July 2019, the United States Soccer Federation announced that head coach Jill Ellis would step down upon completion of the team's U.S. victory tour in October 2019. Following her departure, she will continue to work as an ambassador for U.S. Soccer. The U.S. team was named the Athlete of the Year by Time magazine, while Rapinoe was awarded the Ballon d'Or Féminin and named the Sports Illustrated Sportsperson of the Year. Broadcasting The international broadcast of the match garnered an average of 82.18 million live viewers and 260 million total viewers, setting a new tournament record. The U.S. broadcast of the match on terrestrial television station Fox drew an average of 14.3 million, outranking the 2018 men's final (which did not feature the U.S.) but falling short of the 2015 Women's World Cup broadcast that was broadcast during U.S. prime time rather than late morning. An additional 1.6 million Americans watched the match on Telemundo in Spanish, and streaming audiences for Fox averaged 289,000 viewers. In the Netherlands, the final was watched by 5.5 million people, an estimated 88 percent of people with television access. The Brazilian broadcast on TV Globo and its partners was watched by 19.9 million people (a 41.7 percent share), setting a new women's football record. Large audiences were also reported in France (5.9 million), Germany (5.1 million), Sweden (1.5 million) and the United Kingdom (3.2 million).

It was intended to carry a rocket-propelled torpedo that used a single rocket motor for both airborne and underwater propulsion; due to technical issues encountered in the development of the torpedo, no missiles were built before the program was cancelled. Design history As part of Project Kingfisher, a program for the development of air-launched missiles for use in attacking enemy ships and surfaced submarines with torpedoes from stand-off range, development of the \\"Kingfisher D\\" missile was proposed in 1946 by the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Ordnance.Friedman 1982, p. 203. The Kingfisher D was similar in concept to the Kingfisher C, which became the AUM-N-2 Petrel,Friedman 1982, p. 82. but differed in that the torpedo the Kingfisher D carried was intended to have a dual-mode rocket engine, providing propulsion both to the missile in flight and to the torpedo itself underwater, following the release of the torpedo from the missile to allow it to make its terminal run to the target. Under contract to the National Bureau of Standards, work on Kingfisher D, given the designation AUM-4 in September 1947 and the definitive designation AUM-N-4 in 1948, continued through the late 1940s.Parsch 2003 The torpedo was defined as a weapon;Ordway and Wakeford 1960, p. 118. however, the difficulties encountered in its development meant that a feasible weapon could not be produced. Without the intended torpedo for it to carry, the Diver missile was no longer required, and the program was cancelled prior to 1950.

It is considered to be a member of the proton pump inhibitor class of medications. Medical uses Azeloprazole is an acid suppressing drug being studied for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Pharmacology Mechanism of action Azeloprazole, like other drugs of the proton pump inhibitor class, works by inhibiting the hydrogen potassium adenosine triphosphatase (H+/K+ ATPase) acid pump. The term \\"proton pump inhibitor\\" comes from the recognition of hydrogen as a single proton. H+/K+ ATPase pumps, found in parietal cells in the stomach, are ultimately responsible for secreting acid into the lumen of the stomach. By inhibiting the secretion of acid, proton pump inhibitors are considered to be useful in the treatment of \\"acid-related diseases\\" (e.g. gastroesophageal reflux disease). Chemistry Azeloprazole is soluble in DMSO. History Azeloprazole was designed in Japan with pharmacogenomics in mind. Some drugs in the proton pump inhibitor class are metabolized by the hepatic enzyme CYP2C19. Some individuals, such as people of Japanese ancestry, are more likely to be poor CYP2C19 metabolizers; that is, their ability to metabolize certain drugs through CYP2C19 is compromised by a genetic mutation in one or both copies of the CYP2C19 gene that renders the enzyme nonfunctional or less functional. Azeloprazole was designed to avoid CYP2C19 metabolism entirely, thereby avoiding pharmacogenomic issues with poor CYP2C19 metabolizers. Azeloprazole was designed by the Japanese pharmaceutical company Eisai Co Ltd. Society and culture Legal status In the United States, proton pump inhibitors are found both over the counter and by prescription. However, azeloprazole is not FDA approved in the United States. Research Azeloprazole completed phase II clinical trials for erosive esophagitis in Japan in 2017, and phase II clinical trials for GERD in the United States in 2016.

Benefits to using CTP over other methods are lowpolydispersity and control over number average molecular weight in the resulting polymers. Very few monomers have been demonstrated to undergo CTP. History The first reports of CTP came simultaneously from the labs of Yokozawa and McCullough in 2004, with the recognition that polythiophene can be synthesized with low dispersity and with control over molecular weight. This recognition sparked interest in polymerization mechanism so that it could be expanded to other monomers. Few polymers can be synthesized via CTP, so most conjugated polymers are synthesized via step-growth using palladium catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. Characteristics CTP is exclusively performed on arene monomers to give conjugated polymers. The polymers obtained from CTP are often low dispersity due to its living, chain growth nature. Mass spectrometry can be used to identify end-groups on the polymer to determine if the polymer was synthesized via chain growth. Types CTP utilizes cross coupling reactions (see Mechanism below) with monomers containing magnesium-, zinc-, boron-, and tin-based transmetallating groups, giving rise to Kumada CTP, Negishi CTP, Suzuki CTP, and Stille CTP reactions. Mechanism The mechanism of CTP has been debated. The living chain-growth nature of CTP can be explained by the existence of a π-complex (as described in this section) but can also be explained via polymer reactivity. Initiation 640px Initiation from a metal(II) species (either Ni or Pd) involves two monomers transmetalating onto the metal center to form a complex that can undergo reductive elimination. The complex formed after reductive elimination is referred to as a π-complex because the catalyst bound to the π system of the monomer. The catalyst can isomerize to other π-complexes via a process known as \\"ring-walking\\" to the π-bond adjacent to a C-X bond at the end of the chain allowing oxidative addition to occur. The product of oxidative addition is an active polymer-metal(II)-halide, and it can react with monomers in the propagation reaction. Propagation 700px The propagation steps of CTP occurs through a cycle of transmetalation, reductive elimination, ring walking, and oxidative addition. The existence of a π-complex allows for the polymerization to be controlled as it ensures that the catalyst cannot dissociate from the polymer chain (and start new chains). This means that the number of polymer chains at the end of the polymerization should be equal to the number of catalysts in solution, and that the average degree of polymerization of the sample at the end of polymerization should be equal to the ratio of monomers to catalysts in solution. Termination A characteristic of CTP is living chain-growth character, meaning that the catalyst will have a reactive chain end for the entirety of the polymerization. Therefore, to terminate the polymerization, a quenching agent must be added, such as a strong acid to protonate the polymer, or a nucleophile to add an end cap the polymer. If the π-complex is too weakly bound, termination of polymer chains can occur before a quenching agent is added, causing lower molecular weight polymers to form. Current research into CTP focuses on finding catalysts that form strong catalyst-polymer π-complexes such that the polymerization remains living. Analysis Success of CTP is often evaluated using gel permeation chromatography, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. GPC characterization enables determination of average molecular weight. MALDI and NMR allow for identification of end groups of the polymer chain. Polymer Reactivity versus π-complex The chain growth nature of CTP can also be described without invoking a catalyst-polymer π-complex. If we assume that no π-complex forms and instead every time a monomer was added to a polymer, the polymer becomes more reactive, we would also see chain growth since the largest polymers in the reaction would be the most reactive and would react with monomers preferentially. The presence of this mechanism and one mediated by a π-complex can be elucidated by studying the end groups of the polymers using mass spectrometry.

Rural education for the benefit of civilians December 3, 1926 China Education Improvement Association released the Declaration on the Reform of the National Rural Education \\"Our rural education policy requires that rural schools be centers of rural life reform and rural teachers do the soul of rural life reform. We advocate the production of rural center schools from the actual rural life and rural teachers from rural center schools. The main purpose of rural teachers is to create a teacher with a farmer's skill, a scientific mind and a spirit of social transformation. Such teachers will be able to run the best schools with the least amount of money. We are convinced that they can implement the principle of unity of teaching to lead students to learn the skills to conquer nature and transform society. But to achieve this universal realization of education, we must have the talents of testing, researching, investigating, popularizing and guiding people, organizations, plans, funds, and repeated attempts to succeed. The association has a very wide range of businesses, but one of its major missions in the future is to implement the rural education policy and serve our three million four hundred million peasants. We have already made up our mind to raise one million yuan fund, collect one million comrades, promote one million schools and transform one million villages. This is a great undertaking for construction and all nationals bear the utmost responsibility for it December 1, 1927, Republic Daily published, Chinese rural education movement spot which is edited by Tao Xingzhi and translated by Zhang Zonglin. This is a report sent by the Chinese representative to the World Education Conference in Canada. The editorial emphasizes that rural education in China is a major event for one-fifth of the world's population, but the situation of rural education in China is not satisfactory.

Plot In a future where robots are commonplace, Sam is a lowly theme park mechanic in a robot theme park called RoboWorld in New York. He is in love with his girlfriend and childhood sweetheart Sue Widdington (who works as a reporter for channel six news) and wants to propose to her in a spectacular way with a bling ring on the upcoming Valentine's Day. He lives with 3 robots he built namely Kit, Okra and Wilmer who all want to be popular superheroes. After buying an expensive engagement ring for Sue, Sam and the trio witness the robbery of another expensive ring by famous supervillain Oscar and his robot henchman Victor. Apparently Oscar is madly in love with the mayor Catherine who is Sue's aunt who doesn't love him. He forces her to accept his proposal in her office but when it doesn't work he escapes with the help of Victor. Sam makes another spectacular plan to propose to Sue during the Valentine's Day parade. Oscar makes plans to force Catherine to accept his proposal by creating a giant robot (that has a head that resembles his) made from smaller robots disguised as ATMs that would destroy the city if she doesn't accept his proposal. He remakes the ring he stole into a remote control for all his robots including Victor. After planting the robots as ATMs in RoboWorld, he and Oscar bump into Sam and Sam mistakes Oscar's ring as his and tries to take it not knowing that his own ring is in his pocket. Victor takes the ring and the two supervillains drive off. Sam and his friends chase after them still convinced that Oscar took Sue's ring. The chase leads into a dangerous confrontation with Victor and ends with the robot henchman endangering a school bus in a Cloud Road and running off with the ring. Sam and friends save the bus and get praised as heroes. They track Victor to Oscar's lair and steal the ring only for them to face Victor and Oscar's robots in a deadly confrontation. During the fight, Sam's friends realize that the ring belongs to Oscar but decides to help Sam escape so that he could propose to Sue. Sam escapes to propose to sue only to find out the ring is Oscar's. He stops and Sue becomes disappointed in him for not being able to propose and walks off. Dejected, Sam walks off sadly. meanwhile, Victor finds Sam's ring and gives it to Oscar and they both head off to the Valentine's Day parade with an army of robots. En route, Victor discovers that Oscar never really cared about him and only became a villain because of Catherine, so he rebels against him only to be fired and kicked out by Oscar. Feeling betrayed, Victor pledges revenge and meets Sam who gives him Oscar's ring sadly. At the Parade, Catherine is interviewed by Sue and Oscar appears and assembles his giant robot and discovers that the ring given to him by Victor is Sam's. Victor appears and declares he will destroy the city and that he no longer works for Oscar. He ascends into the giant robot and uses Oscar's ring to control it. Sue inspires Sam on TV to save the city and he and his friends rush off to defeat Victor. After a great battle, Sam tells Sue how much he loves her and creates a large plan to defeat Victor and the giant robot. With the help of the robots at RoboWorld and his friends Victor and the giant robot are finally defeated. Oscar is sent to jail but not before he tells Catherine he became a villain to impress her.

His career was interrupted by injury, limiting his racecourse appearances when he was in his prime.  Background  Gay Spartan's sire Spartan General finished second in the 1965 running of the Champion Hurdle. He was a successful National Hunt sire for many years. The dam of Gay Spartan, Copper Lace, won over hurdles and fences.  Early career  Gay Spartan ran twice over hurdles during the 1974/75 season when trained in Ireland. On the first occasion he was unplaced in a juvenile hurdle at Fairyhouse in December. On the second run he unseated his rider after the start in a similar race at Leopardstown in February.Raceform Up-To-Date National Hunt Annual 1974/75 Sporting Chronicle Publications Ltd and Raceform Ltd 1975 He later won a bumper race before moving to Tony Dickinson's yard in England.  1975/1976 season  Gay Spartan ran twice over hurdles during this season, winning on both starts. These came at Leicester in January over 3 miles, and at Wolverhampton in March over 2 miles 7 furlongs. He won comfortably on each occasion.  1976/1977 season  Gay Spartan was switched to fences and ran six times. He started the season by unseating his rider at the fifth fence at Uttoxeter, then was undefeated in his remaining five starts. He won novice chases at Catterick , Wolverhampton and Haydock Park, then was raised in class when running in the Sun Alliance Chase at the Cheltenham festival in March. Run over 3 miles, the Sun Alliance Chase is recognised as the most important event for staying novice chasers. With the trainer's son Michael Dickinson in the saddle, Gay Spartan made all the running and galloped on relentlessly in the heavy ground to defeat Billycan by four lengths. The runner up would win the Irish Grand National on his next start. On his final outing of the season Gay Spartan won a competitive novice chase at Newbury. He ended the season with a Timeform rating of 137. Although Timeform were of the opinion that \\" he should be a difficult nut to crack where staying power and resolution are necessary for success\\", they made note of his appearance, stating that Gay Spartan was, \\"lightly made for a chaser,rather lacking in substance and scope \\".Chasers & Hurdlers 1976/77 A Timeform Publication Portway Press Ltd  1977/1978 season  Gay Spartan ran seven times during this season, winning on five occasions. After winning events at Hexham and Warwick, he faced a stiffer task in the Tote Northern Handicap Chase at Haydock Park, where he beat Master H, despite racing on ground that was considered unsuitably fast for him. He then followed up with another victory in heavy ground at Wetherby, then appeared again at the same venue in March for what would be his final outing of the season. He put up a worthy performance to beat Tamalin and Rambling Jack, giving weight away to both who were useful performers in their own right. On the strength of this show Gay Spartan was scheduled to take his chance in the Cheltenham Gold Cup, which was staged in April this year due to the original fixture being abandoned because of snow. He was eventually withdrawn the day before the race as Tony Dickinson was not happy with his well being. Gay Spartan ended the season with a Timeform rating of 153.Chasers & Hurdlers 1977/78 A Timeform Publication Portway Press Ltd  1978/1979 season  Gay Spartan won two of his four outings during this season and reached his career high point in winning the King George VI Chase at Kempton Park on Boxing Day. He was beaten on his two starts prior to Kempton but put up a notable performance on the second occasion in a handicap chase at Leicester, where he failed by only a length and a half to concede 39 lb to Modesty Forbids. Gay Spartan faced fifteen rivals at Kempton. Ridden by Tommy Carmody, the race was run at a fast pace in soft ground, bringing Gay Spartan's stamina reservations in to play. He went to the front after the third last when the leader Royal Mail fell and kept on stoutly to pass the post five lengths ahead of Jack Of Trumps, with Chumson a further fifteen lengths back in third. Reflecting on the performance in relation to his Cheltenham Gold Cup prospects, Tommy Carmody said, \\" The further he goes the better he is. I wouldn't be afraid of Royal Mail again. I hope the ground is soft because my fellow will be staying on strongly up the hill\\".'Carmody and the Dickinsons' Pacemaker International February 1979 Pacemaker Publications Ltd Gay Spartan next appeared in what would be his final start in the Jim Ford Challenge Cup at Wincanton. In a small field, he put up a battling performance to beat Gaffer by two lengths. Gay Spartan was ante-post favourite for the Cheltenham Gold Cup but was unable to run having pulled up lame on the gallops the weekend before the race. He was Timeform's best staying chaser of the season with a rating of 166, 13 lb higher than the Cheltenham Gold Cup winner, Alverton.Chasers & Hurdlers 1978/79 A Timeform Publication Portway Press Ltd  1979/1980 season  Gay Spartan made just one appearance in the 3 mile Sunderland Handicap Chase at Stockton in November. Carrying top weight, he was in the lead most of the way and beat Eborneezersdouble by one length. He was conceding 32 lb to the runner up. Gay Spartan was thought to have incurred a suspensory ligament injury during the race and did not run again during the season. He ended the season with a Timeform rating of 166 ?, the question mark indicating the organisation did not have enough evidence to be confident that the rating was reasonably accurate.Chasers & Hurdlers 1979/80 A Timeform Publication Portway Press Ltd  1982/1983 season  With Michael Dickinson now holding the trainer's licence, Gay Spartan returned to the track as a 12-year-old in March 1983 following an absence of over three years. He won an amateur riders' handicap at Worcester and followed up in another minor handicap at Catterick, beating future Grand National winner Hallo Dandy. He then ran at Cheltenham but the race chosen was the Ritz Club Handicap Chase. Carrying top weight he unseated his rider at the sixth fence. Gay Spartan was also beaten on his remaining two starts, when third in a conditional jockeys chase at Aintree, and when unplaced in the Whitbread Gold Cup at Sandown Park.

Publication history  The first issue of Mahatma was published in March 1895. There was a gap in publication of 28 months between issues 8 and 9 of volume 1. During this time, the publishers put out 2 other magazines that followed the numbering of Mahatma: Vaudeville and Artist Era. Vaudeville claimed to be a continuation of Mahatma with a change in name and format, and ran for two issues (Volume 1 Numbers 9 & 10). Only two issues of Artist Era are known to exist (Volume 1 Numbers 11 & 13). When it continued publication of volume 1, Mahatma ignored the numbering of Vaudeville and Artist Era and continued with volume 1 number 9. in 1902, Mahatma began publishing the meeting notes of the Society of American Magicians. It became the society's official magazine starting with the September 1902 issue. A complete set comprises nine volumes, all containing 12 issues except for volume 9, which contains only 8. Vaudeville and Artist Era are sometimes considered necessary to complete a collection.

He was one of the founders of one of the Philippines' leading peasant groups, the Kalipunang Pambansa ng Magbubukid sa Pilipinas (National Confederation of Peasants in the Philippines) and a top-ranking member of the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas. He was also involved in the HUKBALAHAP, and his death sparked the subsequent Huk Rebellion. Biography Early life Feleo was born on May 1, 1896, in Santa Rosa, Nueva Ecija and was the son of a small landowner who had to mortgage his land. In the early 1920s, Feleo worked as a school teacher in his own town, eventually devoting his time defending tenants in Santa Rosa against landlords who threatened to evict them. Feleo was described as a man who was too busy defending peasants to have any real job, and lived on stipends from the KPMP. Feleo, at the time, was disgusted with early peasant organizations in that he felt that they were being taken over \\"by men who were basically trying to get publicity for themselves and hoping to work their way onto a ticket of a major political party and get elected to office, and then forget about the peasants completely.\\" Involvement in the PKP In 1919, Jacinto Manahan founded the Union de Aparceros de Filipinas, which expanded in the next decade before becoming the Kalipunang Pambansa ng Magbubukid sa Pilipinas. Feleo is noted as one of its early founders and worked tirelessly with it, partly due to his conviction that it should be a union for peasants. Initially a so-called \\"apolitical\\" peasant union, the KPMP had ties to Manuel Quezon and the Nacionalista Party. By 1928, however, the KPMP was more militant and aligned itself fully with the Left. This change was largely orchestrated by both Manahan and Feleo, who was the President and First Vice President of the KPMP, respectively. His involvement in the KPMP eventually led him to be a central member of the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas during its initial founding, heading the PKP Peasant Department. Feleo at this time also assumed the role of KPMP General Secretary. He also served as Executive Secretary in the government's National Commission of Peasants. Feleo was noted as an impassioned orator and a notorious agitator who was detained multiple times by the Philippine Constabulary. His longest stint in jail was in October 1933, when he was sentenced for four years, nine months, and eleven days in jail. His release coincided with the PKP's direction of creating a Popular Front party, to act as a united front against imperialism. In 1939, Feleo organized the United Peasant Center in Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija, uniting peasants from Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Tarlac, and Pampanga. Second World War By December 1941, with the Second World War looming, Feleo began organizing the peasantry of Nueva Ecija for guerrilla war. By March of the following year, he and other elements of the PKP, most notably Luis Taruc, met in Cabiao, Nueva Ecija to form the Hukbalahap, a guerrilla movement aimed at defending against the Japanese. Feleo was part of the military commissariat formed to ensure PKP control of the Huks. The Huks were successful in wresting control from the Japanese in Central Luzon, forming local government units called Barrio United Defense Corps to maintain the peace and to act as a support structure for the Huk guerrillas. By 1945, the Huks have created provisional governments in the areas they controlled, and elected Feleo as the provisional governor of Nueva Ecija. Post War and Death After the war, the KPMP and the Pampanga-based Aguman ding Maldang Talapagobra were reformed into the Pambansang Kaisahan ng mga Magbubukid. Feleo was appointed vice-president of the PKM. During this time, there was an impetus to have Feleo elected as governor of Nueva Ecija in the 1946 elections. However, there were no gubernatorial elections in 1946, and President Sergio Osmena did not appoint him as governor. Feleo also involved himself the Democratic Alliance and as a spokesperson for Huk veterans during the post-war period, in addition to his PKM duties. His activities and activism, however, earned the ire of the land-owning elite. In September 1945, his house in Nueva Ecija was reportedly raided by military police. This, and other repressive practices by both the land-owning elites and the government in Central Luzon, contributed to growing unrest. A turning point was after the 1946 elections, when six Democratic Alliance candidates, including Luis Taruc, won seats in Congress but were not allowed to sit in session. The Roxas administration decided to send the six DA candidates, along with peasant leaders such as Feleo and Mateo del Castillo to try and talk to peasant groups and pacify unrest, to little avail. Feleo claimed that civilian guards and government officials were \\"sabotaging the peace process\\". On August 24, 1946, Feleo, on his way back to Manila after a pacification sortie in Cabiao, was stopped by a large band of \\"armed men in fatigue uniforms\\" in Gapan, Nueva Ecija. Feleo was accompanied by his bodyguards and four barrio lieutenants, and he had planned to present them to the Secretary of the Interior Jose Zulueta to testify that their barrios were shelled by government forces for no reason at all, forcing them to evacuate. Feleo and the four barrio officials were taken by the men and killed. Thousands of Huk veterans and PKM members were sure that Feleo was murdered by landlords, or possibly the Roxas administration itself. As a direct result of Feleo's death, Luis Taruc issued the government an ultimatum before joining the Hukbalahp in rebellion against the government.

Geography & history  Potzberg summit The Potzberg is one of the \\"Palatine Domes\\" (Pfälzer Kuppeln) and is located in the western part of the Northern Palatine Uplands in the county of Kusel. Not only its relative height, but also its massive appearance make the hill a conspicuous high point in West Palatinate. Although the Stolzberg (572 m) and Königsberg (567 m) are somewhat higher, the Potzberg has been given the epithet of \\"King of the Westrich\\", the name of the local region. In 1964/65, the road was extended up to top of the Potzberg. Its summit belongs to the municipality of Föckelberg and is home to the Potzberg Wildlife Park, Potzberg Tower, a Bundeswehr military tower and a hotel. Potzberg was a mining centre in the Palatinate in the 18th and 19th centuries. From the first decades of the 18th century until 1866, tin mining was evidently carried out at Potzberg. The mining district in this second Palatine mining period mainly covered the municipalities of Gimsbach, Rutsweiler, Mühlbach and Föckelberg. The government of the Electorate of the Palatinate promised itself new sources of income with the production of mercury. This began on the southern Potzberg (\\"Alter Potzberg\\"), but from 1771 the focus shifted to the much richer northern Potzberg. Its zenith was probably in the 1780s. An old mining map by Electoral Palatine master miner (Bergmeister), Adolph E. Ludolph, dates to this time The names of the mine bear witness to the Christian faith of the miners. Numerous test pits, prospecting tunnels and other prospecting marks indicate this period of the mining boom. Unfortunately, however, many projects were unsuccessful and closed down after a short period. Very few mines were able to survive for any length of time and operate more or less profitably. After its expectant beginning and years of hope, mining gradually declined on the Potzberg. In 1795, there were only 5 mines still in operation; in 1850 only 3 mines were left, and, in 1866, mining ended at the Dreikönigszug (\\"Epiphany Shaft\\"). The Dreikönigszug, which had been in operation for almost 9 decades, was one of the most profitable mercury mines in the Palatinate and Germany. Even today, numerous surface remnants in the Potzberg forest such as portals (Mundlöcher), collapsed tunnels (pingen), spoil tips, the gallery spring (Stollen Quelle, \\"Yellow Water\\") as well as the former mining administrator's house in the miners' settlement of Dreikönigszug and the housing estate of Kellerhäuschen are still reminiscent of the history of mining on the Potzberg.  Sights   Wildlife park & falconry   Potzberg Tower  The present Potzberg Tower, which has several predecessors, was built in only 39 working days. The foundation stone was laid on 13 October 1951, on 2 December 1951 the last stone on the 35-metre-high structure was cemented into placed. After the construction of 165 wooden steps and a pedestal to the platform of the tower, it was opened on 13 July 1952 with about 3,000 guests present. Originally an 18.5-metre-high broadcasting aerial was erected on the platform. From here, Südwestfunk broadcast its radio programmes until 30 November 1993 and the then private radio station RPR1 until 24 March 1993. Due to the dilapidation of the tower, however, the transmission antenna was dismantled. Its successor is the telecommunication tower on the Bornberg (520 m) at Schneeweiderhof near Eßweiler; it is used today by Südwestrundfunk.

The British army of the period was mainly recruited through volunteer enlistment. Most recruits were young men from the lowest social classes who could not find a livelihood on the civilian labour market. The non-commissioned officers were promoted soldiers sharing the social background of the rank and file. Literacy was a basic requirement for promotion to non-commissioned rank; writing and basic mathematical skills were compulsory for ranks above corporal. About ten percent of the commissioned officers were former sergeants, but the majority came from higher social strata. Aristocracy and gentry were over-represented in the higher ranks, but most officers came from a background of landowners, or were the sons of clergymen, lawyers, doctors or successful merchants. The purchase system was the mechanism through which the officer corps was structured according to social class. Organisational overview The early modern British Army consisted of two distinct components that were kept separate in peacetime and at home. \\"The Army\\" in a limited sense, included infantry and cavalry, and was politically subordinate to the War Office, and under the military command of the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces at the Horse Guards. The \\"Ordnance Corps\\" on the other hand, included the Royal Artillery and the Royal Engineers, and was subordinate to the Board of Ordnance at the Tower with the Master-General of the Ordnance as its senior political and military commander. The two components differed not only by uniform colors, but also by organisation, military ranks, promotion system, training, supply services, medical services, transportation, procurement, and budget.Ward 1957, pp. 8-9. It was only in the field that a joint command was established.Oman 1968, pp. 113, 157-158. Until the Union of Ireland with Britain in 1801, \\"the Army\\" was divided into a British and an Irish establishment. The British Establishment was funded by British taxes and had a budget fixed by the British Parliament; the Irish Establishment was funded by Irish taxes, with a budget set by the British government. The Irish Establishment was subordinate to the Viceroy of Ireland and his military staff, not the War Officer or the Horse Guards. The viceroy also had his own ordnance master, and a separate Irish artillery, the Royal Irish Artillery, until 1801.Guy 1985, pp. 9-10; Holm 2002, pp. 87, 128. The Irish Establishment was not a separate Irish army, although the units on the Irish Establishment usually were stationed in Ireland; regiments were freely moved between the establishments, and the regiments of foot were numbered consecutively through both establishments.Guy 1985, pp. 10, 35. In the early nineteenth century, there were 13,140 officers in \\"the Army\\", 992 in the Royal Artillery, and 202 in the Royal Engineers. \\"The army\\" had 181,000 other ranks, while the Royal Artillery had 12,500.Colquhoun 1814, p. 127. Rank and file The cost of a British soldier's uniform was deducted from his pay. The British Army was recruited through voluntary enlistment; the enlistment period was for life, or in actual fact 25 years, unless killed or wounded before that. Shorter enlistment periods could be offered during war to entice more recruits. There was a constant lack of men that wanted to enlist. Forced recruitment of vagrants was often resorted to in wartime. During the Napoleonic wars, the militia was mobilised, but it could not serve outside England, and the government tried to induce the militiamen to enlist in the regular army. From 1803, men were also drafted to an Army of Reserve, the real purpose of which was to form a recruitment basis for the regular army, but it was politically very unpopular and the system was abolished after three years. Foreigners, especially the King's foreign subjects, but also other Germans, as well as Swiss and Royalist French, were recruited to special foreign regiments.Holm 2002, pp. 49-53, 135-139. Since 1701, the recruitment of both Catholic and Protestant Irish was prohibited for the regiments on the Irish Establishment. Yet, this exclusion did not encompass the officer corps, and at the end of the eighteenth century, a third of the officers of the Irish regiments were Irish Protestants. The British Establishment was formally prohibited from recruiting Catholics, but the ban was abolished in practice in 1771, and in 1775 the Irish Establishment was allowed to recruit both Protestant and Catholic Irish.Guy 1996, pp. 217, 219, 229, Neither apprentices, or indentured servants nor coal miners were allowed to enlist. Seamen were reserved for the need of the Royal Navy.Reid 1996, p. 5. The hardship of military life, low pay, and the low social standing of the soldiery filled the ranks with men driven by impoverishment or drinking to enlist as a last resort. Contemporary social analysts placed the soldiery at the bottom of society, below common labourers, but above paupers and vagrants.Holm 2002, pp. 149-153. Most enlistees were young and almost always unmarried. Elder and married men had hope for some stability in life, but young rural day labourers had a very unsecure labour market. The best they could hope for was an employment as a farm hand for a full year, or for the summer season.Reid 1996, pp. 3-4. A social analysis of British troops in North America during the French and Indian War shows that Scots and Irish were overrepresented among the rank and file. About a third of the soldiers had been common labourers in civilian life, while almost a fifth had been handweavers, a tenth cobblers, and a twentieth tailors.Brumwell 2002, pp. 58, 78-79, 320. Another analysis, this time of British soldiers stationed in North America during American Revolutionary War, founds that there was a consistent link between recruitment and regional economic conditions in Britain. Areas that were particularly vulnerable to cyclical fluctuations of the economy had a high proportion of recruits than areas with a stable economy. Most of the army recruits were permanently or temporarily outside the labour market because of the structural changes of the British economy that came with the industrial revolution. A fifth of the recruits had been textile workers, or had had some other connection with the textile industry. Among recruits with a background as craftsmen, the trades that were mainly affected negatively by industrialisation, such as shoemakers, dominated. Trades with marked seasonal fluctuations in employment, such as bricklayers and stone masons also provided the army with many recruits. Socially and economically stable working class occupations, such as miners, ironworks workers, or nailors supplied very few soldiers.Frey 1981, pp. 10-16. Non-commissioned officers British infantry in combat. To the left a colour sergeant with a spontoon. Non-commissioned officers in the infantry were sergeants and corporals. In addition to the direct leadership of the rank and file entrusted them, the commissioned officers happily surrendered the routine administration of the companies and regiments to the sergeants.Guy 1994, p. 100. Senior non- commissioned posts, such as colour sergeant, introduced in 1813, and sergeant major, were strictly speaking not ranks, but appointments. Appointment as sergeant major was the capstone of a successful career as non-commissioned officer, symbolised by an officer like uniform. Selection for this post was based on capability as a drill instructor, but to the same extent also of skills at writing and counting.Holm 2002, pp. 121-122, 125. No special pattern for promotion to non-commissioned officer has been found. Literacy was a basic requirement and surprisingly many were promoted to sergeants after just one year of service.Reid 1997, p. 16. In the cavalry, the circumstances were somewhat different. Until 1810, when it was replaced by rank of troop sergeant major, each troop of horse had a troop quartermaster, a rank between commissioned and non-commissioned officer. During the eighteenth century, this rank began to be increasingly seen as suitable for promoted sergeants. Nevertheless, the rank was attractive enough for poor young gentlemen who could not afford to purchase a proper officer's commission. Warrants as troop quartermaster could sometimes be purchased, although George II did not like to commission troop quartermasters.Guy 1985, pp. 14-15, 18 (note 76); Holmes 2002, pp. 127. The social ambitions of the non-commissioned corps were reflected in the fact that it was often senior non-commissioned officers who were the leaders in the Masonic lodges who took a prominent place in the social life of many regiments. Later in the nineteenth century, however, membership in military Masonic lodges was restricted to those who were Freemasons previous to enlistment.Clayton 2007, p. 56. Rankers About ten percent of the officers had first served in the ranks before being commissioned. This was a substantially larger proportion than during the rest of the nineteenth century, when the officer corps obtained the character of a closed caste. The background of the rankers can be summarised into three different categories. # Old and experienced sergeants, commissioned in order to get competent disciplinarians or administrators. Adjutants were often promoted from the ranks. At the end of the eighteenth century, quartermasters were exclusively recruited among the sergeants, with accompanying social stigma. Very skilled sergeants could also be commissioned, not rarely directly as lieutenants, skipping the rank of ensign. This category probably included the majority of the rankers. Most of them had many years of service behind them and it was very difficult for them to be promoted to higher ranks. # Another category was other ranks receiving battlefield commissions for exceptional bravery. # A third category was the volunteers; young gentlemen with the same background as the majority of the officer corps, but lacking the money or the connections necessary to purchase a commission. They enlisted as volunteers with the hope of being commissioned without purchase.Guy 1985, p. 15; Reid 1996, pp. 18-19; Reid 1997, pp. 17-18; Brumwell 2002, pp. 91-93, 95; Holmes 2002, pp. 113, 167. Officers Arthur Wellesley – later the Duke of Wellington – became a full colonel at the age of 27. He is a prime example of how the aristocracy gained precedence to the senior ranks. The basic prerequisites for receiving a commission in \\"the Army\\" were very simple in theory. The prospective officer must have reached the age of 16 but not yet 21 years, be able to read and write, and show a letter of recommendation from an officer with the rank of major or above. Rankers were excepted from the age requirement.Reid 1997, p. 17. In real life, a commission required being of \\"good family\\", having access to money or patronage. No formal military training was mandated. Sandhurst was founded in 1801, but passing out from it was not a precondition for a commission. Two thirds of the officers in the infantry and the cavalry had purchased their commissions. One third of the commissions were non-purchase, issued as a reward for long service and good conduct in the next rank below, through patronage, or when a ranker was commissioned.Guy 1985, p. 89; Holm 2002, pp. 157, 165. The purchase system was intimately linked to the political system, and the political leadership of the Whigs. It was seen as a guarantee that the officer corps would identify itself with social elite, and not act as an independent force in the interest of the King or itself.Bruce 1980, pp. 65-66. The system had been reinstated after the Restoration and was maintained until 1871 when it was abolished by the Cardwell reforms. During the eighteenth century the Crown attempted to regulate the system, and by the middle of the century the purchase of colonels' commissions was abolished, and promotion to colonel and above put strictly in the hands of the Crown. Less successful were different endeavors to regulate the costs of commissions, or to introduce a regulated promotion system. A young man with access to money and with the right connections could still become a lieutenant colonel within a few months after his first commission. Only when George III favorite son, the Duke of York, became commander in chief of the forces in 1795, a strict set of rules could be enforced. Two years as a subaltern was required before a captain's commission could be bought; the approval of the colonel of the regiment was also imperative. An officer had the right of promotion within his regiment according to seniority, and could not be bypassed unless he was unable to pay for the commission. If no one in the regiment could afford the commission, an officer from another regiment could buy it and be transferred to the regiment, something that favored men with money and contacts at the Horse Guards.Bruce 1980, sid. 13, 27-28, 35, 37-38, 42, 47. If an officer was killed in action or died in the service, the commission was forfeited, and someone could be promoted without purchase. Casualties during a war therefore gave better chances for advancement for skilled officers without means. Such promotions were strictly based on seniority. Hence it was difficult, but not impossible, to advance solely through seniority.Holm 2002, p. 163. Officers in the infantry and cavalry came from a fairly broad social spectrum, although socially dominated by the aristocracy and the gentry; albeit holding only about a quarter of all commissions in the eighteenth century, half of the colonels and generals belonged to these classes. Many sons of officers, including many Huguenots, also become officers; lacking the social status, economic security and connections enjoyed by the sons of the aristocracy and the gentry, their advancement was slower and needed the patronage of superiors from the social elite. Rankers rarely reached beyond subaltern ranks. The majority of the officers were competent professionals with long time in service, without private means, living on their pay.Houlding 1981, pp. 104-107, 111, 115. The lifestyle required of an officer with the King's commission meant, however, that the living costs often exceeded the income, with permanent money problems and indebtedness as a result.Guy 1985, pp. 94-99. Commissions in the Royal Artillery and the Royal Engineers required passing out from Woolwich. The time of study at the Academy was not precisely established, but after 18–24 months of study the officer cadet took his final exam, and if he passed, and there was a vacant post, he would be commissioned in the most junior rank. Officers with the best grades at Woolwich became engineers, the other gunners. The \\"Ordnance corps\\" did not have a purchase system, and promotion was by strict seniority. Advancement was therefore very slow, and as there were no pensions, or commissions to sell, gunners and engineers remained in the service for a very long time, even as superannuated and unfit for combat. This in its turn affected the prospects of the junior officers negatively.Glover 1977, pp. 90-91; Holmes 2002, p. 128, 176; Clayton 2007, pp. 57-58.

The Scottish League Cup is a knockout cup competition in Scottish football, organised by the Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL). It is considered to be the second most important domestic cup competition in Scottish football, after the Scottish Cup. The competition is open to all 42 members of the SPFL, as well as invited sides from the Highland League and Lowland League. The competition was established in 1947, under a format used by the Southern League Cup which operated as a regional tournament (national for its last season) during World War II. The Scottish League Cup was formed, operated by and named after the Scottish Football League (SFL), who continued to operate it after the top division clubs formed the Scottish Premier League (SPL) in 1998. The competition is now organised by the SPFL, the body formed by the merger of the SPL and SFL in 2013. Bill Struth, with Rangers in 1946-47, was the first team manager to win the competition. This list gives details of the winning club and their manager in each season since then. Scot Symon, Jock Stein and Walter Smith are the most successful managers in the history of the competition, having each won 6 Scottish League Cups during their careers.

She also had lessons with Ulysses Dow Tenney, with whom she collaborated on a number of works. She moved to Washington, D.C. sometime around 1900 and opened a studio at The Dewey. During her career she painted portraits of many notables, among them Edward Everett Hale, William Dean Howells, John D. Long and Frank Jones; she also painted portraits of at least ten mayors of Portsmouth. A portrait by Horne of Belva Ann Lockwood is currently owned by the National Portrait Gallery, while the portrait of Frank Jones is currently in the collection of the Portsmouth Athenæum. The Naval Historical Center owns a portrait of David Henshaw ascribed to Ulysses Dow in whose creation she may have assisted. Horne lived in Portsmouth for a number of years; in that city, on August 5, 1891, she married William H. Horne. She also had a studio in Boston for some time.

She was appointed in 2013, becoming the first woman to serve in the role; prior to this, she had held various other policing roles. She retired in 2017, having served thirty years as a police officer. Life and career Suzette Louise Davenport was born in January 1963. Though Davenport is from North Yorkshire, she started her policing career with West Mercia Police. She went on to work in several police roles for different forces; by 2002, she was working for Staffordshire Police. She moved to work for the Home Office briefly in 2005; she then returned to Staffordshire Police, to the role of assistant chief constable. At one point during her career with the Staffordshire force, she held the \\"crime and diversity\\" portfolio. In 2007, Davenport moved to West Midlands Police, where she was responsible for \\"intelligence and neighbourhood policing\\". In 2011, while Davenport was deputy chief constable with Northamptonshire Police, the Independent Police Complaints Commission launched an enquiry into the conduct of four Staffordshire officers in 2002, including Davenport, in connection with the murder of amateur footballer, Kevin Nunes. Five people were convicted of the murder of Nunes in 2008; the convicted individuals lodged an appeal with the Court of Appeal, and their convictions were quashed in 2012. The IPCC cleared the officers, including Davenport, of misconduct in 2016; Davenport said she was \\"pleased and relieved\\" that the case into her had concluded. Prior to 2013, Davenport was the vice-president of the British Association for Women in Policing for eight years. In addition, she was appointed as the national lead for roads policing for the Association of Chief Police Officers in 2011, a role she held until retirement. In 2013, she became the first female chief constable of Gloucestershire Constabulary. As of 2016, Davenport sat on the board of the College of Policing. While in the role, it was reported that she had ordered officers in her force to trim or cover beards, along with a ban on visible tattoos and inappropriate makeup, with the BBC's Newsbeat reporting that beard nets would be permitted as an alternative. Davenport retired in 2017, after thirty years as a police officer. Recognition Davenport was ranked at number 79 in The Independent on Sunday's 2014 Rainbow List of influential LGBT people, having come out as a lesbian at Pride in Gloucestershire earlier in that year. She was awarded the Queen's Police Medal in 2016, as well as an honorary doctorate by the University of Gloucestershire.

Migrant Schools () are a type of schools for migrant students in China. The teachers and managers of these schools usually come from countryside, just as the migrant students in these schools. In China, if a student want to be accepted by a primary school or secondary school, he/she must have a local household registration record (\\"Hukou\\"). However, for those migrant workers (Mingong), they and their children usually don't have local household registration record. That means their children will not be accepted by schools in the city they work in. Thus they have to send their children to \\"Migrant Schools\\" run privately. These \\"Migrant Schools\\" are usually low-cost. Nevertheless, these schools have many problems: Most teachers in these schools are poor-educated; The classrooms are usually crowded; Many Migrant Schools don't hold a permission issued by the authorities. A research suggested that the education quality of these schools are far below the average.

Its main office is located in Sapporo, Hokkaido. It has over 21 stores in Japan, with international presence in North America and Southeast Asia with 32 stores in 9 countries. History The founder Hitoshi Hatanaka, after seeing Tampopo (a movie about ramen), was disappointed in the ramen he ate with his family in a restaurant, and decided to do something about it. He said he was going to make ramen for his family, and developed his own tonkotsu soup for ramen. The first Ramen Santouka restaurant was established in Asahikawa on March 10, 1988, with only nine seats and with only one item on the menu, the shio (salt) ramen. It soon became known as \\"the ramen restaurant with the odd name and consistently full seats\\". In 1994, Ramen Santouka opened its first store in Tokyo, starting its rapid expansion not just in Japan but also abroad. In 1995 the \\"April Foods\\" corporation began to increase the number of franchises.

Born in New York City, she studied voice at the National Conservatory of Music of America and then the Institute of Musical Art (now the Juilliard School) where she earned a diploma in 1909 and was a voice student of Adrian Freni, George Henschel, and Milka Ternina. She became a resident artist at the Paris Opera where she continued training with Alfred Giraudet. She pursued further studies with Lilli Lehmann in Salzburg and at the University of California, Berkeley where she also taught as a member of the voice faculty prior to her post at Juilliard. At Berkeley she collaborated closely with musicologist Charles Seeger, and gave recitals of folk songs that were collected and/or arranged by him. She left California after the death of her husband in 1921 to live close to her remaining family in New York City. She also taught voice part time at Columbia University in addition to teaching full time at the Juilliard School. As a performer Dunham was mainly active in recitals and concerts in the United States and Europe, but did appear in operas in France, Austria, and California. She was particularly active as a soloist with the San Francisco Symphony and the New York Symphony Orchestra under Walter Damrosch. In her earlier career when she was more active she performed as a soprano, but in later years she performed as a mezzo-soprano. A founding member of the National Association of Teachers of Singing, many of her pupils had successful performance careers both in the United States and abroad, including Charles Bressler, Anne Brown, Ruby Elzy, Nanette Fabray, Elia Kazan, Rosemary Kuhlmann, and Graciela Rivera among others. She wrote several published monographs on the art of singing and on diction for singers. She died in hospital in Paramus, New Jersey on April 3, 1959.

The first opened on November 22, 1914 and by the end of the war there was 700 similar establishments. In 1916 she partnered with the Federal Department of Military Affairs and the Swiss Red Cross to create a soldier's welfare service. The following year they started to employ sick soldiers which increased the benefit of their work. She worked with The Salvation Army and gave talks about the need for action rather than pity.

Despite this, several remains can still be seen, such as its taula monument. The site is located near the road that connects Alayor and Cala en Porter. At km point 5,5 there is the rural road of Cotaina to the right and after 400 meters the site can be found. View of the taula of Torrellisar The taula enclosure is also quite altered, since it has a modern dry stone wall built with small-sized stones whose function is indeterminate. However, it is an interesting element on site as it is a good example of Minorcan ethnological architecture. This wall has six original pilasters embedded into it and an entrance followed by a corridor which is covered by stone slabs, measuring 3 x 1,20 meters. The precinct formed by this wall has a circular layout measuring 8,7 meters in diameter. The taula is in a good state of preservation and its visible part is 2,59 meters high.http://www.menorcatalayotica.info/Contingut.aspx?IdPub=8672 Archaeological excavations have determined that taula enclosures were religious buildings where rituals including the consumption of meat and wine were carried out during the Late Talayotic period, roughly between 500 BC and Roman times. There is no information about this taula enclosure since it has never been excavated. The settlement also has the remains of two talayots, one of them with a possible inner chamber, which are hidden behind modern constructions. The function of talayos, which are the large truncate cone- shaped constructions that give the name to the Talayotic culture, is still unclear. The site also has other structures scattered throughout the archaeological area. Chronology: from the Early Talayotic period (Late Bronze Age) to the Late Talayotic Period (Iron Age).

The waterfall is part of the Wainui River and cascades over granite bedrock into a deep pool at its base. It is the largest and most accessible waterfall in the Abel Tasman National Park and the Nelson-Golden Bay area, and can be reached via the short Wainui Falls Track. The track is popular as a day walk among tourists, and while the waters of the Wainui River can be too cold for swimming much of the year, the plunge pool is a favoured swimming hole in the summer months. Location The falls are located up the valley from Wainui Bay, within the Abel Tasman National Park. The nearest town is Takaka, a drive away, and the nearest city is Nelson, around a 2.5 hours' drive. Wainui Falls Track The waterfall can be reached via the Wainui Falls Track, a round-trip bush walk that follows the Wainui River up to the waterfall. The track is accessed via a carpark at the end of Wainui Falls Rd, from the main road (Abel Tasman Drive). A cafe and toilets are available at the carpark area. The track takes about 1 to 1.5 hours round-trip. The track meanders through a native forest of ferns, nikau palms, and rata trees. Giant carnivorous land snails of the genus Powelliphanta, among the largest land snails in the world, can sometimes be found on the forest floor near the track. The waterfall has been a popular sightseeing destination since at least the early 20th century. Older locals report that \\"in the early days\\" when people used to drive out to the track in Model Ts, the track was very steep and that it was common for trampers to fall in the river. The track was closed for maintenance in 2015 for several months while the track was re-engineered and a new 10-person-capacity suspension bridge was built to replace the old suspension bridge, which was a one-at-a-time crossing and could result in significant queues during summer months. The bridge crosses the Wainui River above large granite blocks and tumbled logs that pile up after winter floods. While some locals lamented that the track had lost a bit of its charm and feeling of danger (with regards to the old bridge), they also commented that it was a huge benefit that the track was now more accessible to everyone. The track is maintained by the New Zealand Department of Conservation. In Māori mythology In the mythology of the local Takaka Māori, a taniwha (water guardian) called Ngarara Huarau terrorises a local village, who eventually retaliate by killing the monster. Upon the taniwha's death, its severed tail lands in the pool at the base of Wainui Falls. The rocks downstream from the falls have rusty red-brown staining that the story attributes to the seepage of blood from the tail.

History  Since the emergence of the modern Romance based Sicilian language in the early 1st millennium, several orthographic systems have existed. With the gradual increase in the power of Italian, the Sicilian language had become increasingly decentralised and informal in its orthography. Furthermore, its orthography has taken more elements from Italian orthography, even in places where it is not well suited. During the period of the Norman Kingdom of Sicily the Sicilian Latin of the time developed specific elements which reflected local innovations in speech and orthography. Frederick II and his Sicilian School used written Sicilian extensively which is some of the earliest literature and poetry to be produced in an Italo-Romance language. These forms created the basis of the orthographies which evolved substantially over the following thousand years. After the 15th century Sicilian lost its status as an administrative language. After the decline of administrative written Sicilian began to become limited to the genres of folklore, theatre and poetry. Most examples of orthography we have from these times are in the personal style of various authors, such as Giovanni Meli, who created substantial works in Sicilian. His Poesi siciliani in five volumes was published in 1787, and an edition in six volumes was published in 1814. Furthermore, Giuseppe Pitrè's stories, grammars and vocabulary still serve as very useful for sicilianists. Researchers at the Centro di studi filologici e linguistici siciliani have developed an extensive descriptivist orthography which aims to represent every sound in the natural range of Sicilian accurately. This system has been published in several papers and is also used extensively in the Vocabolario siciliano. In 2016 the non- profit Cadèmia Siciliana began to build on the work of the CSFLS and other researchers to develop a unified orthography which considers etymological, contemporary usage and usability factors. The orthography is continuously evolving with yearly releases.  Alphabet  There exist several traditional as well as contemporary alphabet proposals. The Sicilian alphabet approximately consists of the following: {  - +  left;\\"  Base and extended alphabet !Letter ! Name ! IPA ! Diacritics !

He himself belonged to the ʿAdī tribe, which was part of the Ribāb confederation, and therefore probably lived in Al-Yamāma and its vicinity. He had three brothers, who also composed poetry: Hishām, Masʿūd, and Jirfās. He seems to have spent part of his life in the cities of Iraq, notably Basra and Kufa, where it seems he spent time with such poets as al-Farazdaq (d. c. 728 CE), Jarīr ibn 'Atiya (d. 728×29 CE), Ruʾba (d. 762 CE), and al-Kumayt (d. 743 CE), and the scholars Abū ʿAmr b. al-ʿAlāʾ (c. 770×72 CE), ʿĪsā b. ʿUmar al- Thaqafī (d. 766 CE), and Ḥammād al-Rāwiya (d. 772×73 CE).

Today it is owned and manufactured by the Krasnodar Tobacco Factory, a Russian subsidiary of Altria. History To honor the joint Soviet-American flight of the Soyuz-Apollo, a series of postage stamps and envelopes with the stamp first day covers, postcards, photo albums, as well as cigarettes under the name \\"Apollo-Soyuz\\" with the famous Virginia tobacco from the American company Philip Morris were issued to be made. The brand was introduced for the occasion of the joint Soviet-American Apollo–Soyuz Test Project mission in July 1975.«Кто лучше держит марку» // Журнал «Деньги» № 36 (289) от 13.09.2000 The cigarettes went on sale in the Soviet Union on July 15, 1975, the day the Soyuz was launched, and later in the United States. The cigarettes were manufactured for 5 years, during this time the Moscow factory released an order of 500 million cigarettes, although it was difficult to actually acquire a pack due to a trade deficit in the USSR. In the astronauts city Leninsk (nowadays called Baikonur) the cigarettes could be bought freely at 1.5 Soviet rubles per pack (at the time this was considered quite expensive). In other cities of the USSR, the cigarettes were instantly bought and resold by speculators.«Проект „Союз—Аполлон“: Из „русского“ и „американца“ сделали космических гермафродитов» // Segodnya.ua The cigarettes were popular in the Soviet Union, a total of 3 billion were exported there. In the United States however, the brand found little appeal, mainly because the brand was expensive. Manufacturing of the brand was discontinued in 1980 upon expiry of the term of the license agreement between Philip Morris and Glavtabakom. Resumption of production Cigarette manufacturing resumed in 1995 by the Krasnodar Tobacco Factory, owned by Philip Morris. In 1996 the factory was arranged in a full technological cycle of production, and since then the cigarettes are manufactured there. On July 17, 1998 the production of a new cigarette called \\"Apollo Alliance Special\\", which were more expensive than the original, was started. On April 1 of 2000, production began of the \\"Apollo Alliance Special Lights Bookstore\\" cigarettes (retail price per pack 9-10 Russian rubles«„Союз Аполлон Лайтс“ от Philip Morris» // Деловая Пресса, № 7 (24) от 03.04.2000), who were claimed to be a low-tar and nicotine cigarettes (8 mg tar and 0.6 mg nicotine per cigarette). Packaging The cigarette pack features a blue circle with a rendering of the docked Apollo-Soyuz spacecraft inside it, and bears English writing in blue and Russian in red. On one side it says: \\"Apollo Soyuz commemorative brand,\\" and on the other \\"Soyuz Apollo\\". On one edge of the pack are the words, \\"Developed by Philip Morris Inc. U.S.A. and Glavtabak, U.S.S.R. in commemoration of U.S./Soviet space cooperation\\" in English and Russian, along with the English words, \\"Made in U.S.S.R., Tava Factory, Moscow.\\" Glavtabak was the Soviet State Tobacco Agency.

Ortiz, Lewis Pyenson: José Babini: Matemático e historiador de la ciencia, Llull, vol. 7, 1984, pp. 77–98Joseph W. Dauben, Christoph J. Scriba (eds.): Writing the history of mathematics, Birkhäuser 2002, pp. 252–253 Babini worked for a construction company, where the owners recognized his mathematical talent and made it possible for him to pursue academic study. From 1918 he studied in Buenos Aires. In 1921 he graduated with a qualification to teach natural science and mathematics. In 1922 he received his degree as a civil engineer. Already in 1917 he contacted the well-known Spanish mathematician Julio Rey Pastor. Instead of working as a civil engineer, Babini taught mathematics at the Faculty for Industrial Chemistry of the Universidad Nacional del Litoral in Rosario. There he introduced new methods of numerical analysis and was considered a leading Argentine expert in this field. He then taught at the Faculty of Sciences of Education (Facultad de Ciencias de la Educación) in Paraná, Entre Ríos and at the Colegio Nacional y la Escuela Industrial. When Aldo Mieli in 1938 came from Paris to Argentina, he and Babini founded at the Universidad Nacional del Litoral in Rosario the Instituto de Historia y Filosofía de la Ciencia (with the support of Rey Pastor). The Instituto existed until 1943. Babini was an editor for the journal Archeion (founded by Mieli in 1919 with the name Archivio di Storia della Scienza) and with Mieli edited the series Panorama general de historia del ciencia in 12 volumes. In this series, Babini wrote, with Desiderio Papp, El siglo de iluminismo on the exact sciences in the 19th century (volume number 8 of the series). He was a major organizer of science in Argentina and a member of the national research council CONICET. From 1955 to 1966 he was the dean of the Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales of the National University in Buenos Aires. In 1957 he was the rector and interim director of the newly founded Universidad Nacional del Nordeste. He also presided over Argentina's newly founded university publishing house EUDEBA (Editorial Universitaria de Buenos Aires). Babini was a member of the editorial board of Historical Studies in the Physical Sciences and was a co- founder of the journal Quipu: Revista Latinoamericana de Historia de las Ciencias y la Tecnología (based in Mexico City). He was Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1928 in Bologna. He was the author, co-author, or editor of numerous books (at least 70) and essays as well as translations. In particular, he also published the first books on the history of science as it developed in Argentina. Selected publications *with J.

It is part of Protestant and Catholic hymnals, has inspired musical settings, and has been translated. The title is also known as \\"Lobt Gott, ihr Christen allzugleich\\".  History  The song is traditionally dated 1560, because it appeared then in eight stanzas with the melody, Zahn No. 198, in Wittenberg. The melody was connected before in 1554 with the text \\"Kommt her, ihr lieben Schwesterlein\\". An early version of text and melody appeared already around 1550 on a leaf (\\"Liedblatt\\") Drey geistliche Weyhnacht/ lieder, vom Newgebornen kindlin Jesu / für die kinder im Joachimstal (Three sacred Christmas songs, of the newborn little child Jesus / for the children in the Joachimstal). Puer natus est nobis in the codex Don Silvestro dei Gherarducci Herman based the melody on the Gregorian introit antiphon for Christmas \\"Puer natus est nobis\\" (A boy is born for us\\"). The first line was often rendered as \\"Lobt Gott, ihr Christen allzugleich\\" from the beginning of the 17th century, which became the title of musical settings of the period. The hymn was translated by August Cruller as \\"Praise God the Lord, ye sons of men\\". In the German Protestant hymnal Evangelisches Gesangbuch, the hymn was adopted as EG 27, with six stanzas (1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 8), and in the Catholic hymnal Gotteslob as GL 247, with four stanzas (1, 2, 3 and 8).

It is a Bronze Age funerary hypogeum, which was used as a collective tomb by a family or a small community. Even though it was emptied in later centuries to be reused as a cattle shelter, causing the loss of all information regarding the interred population, grave goods and chronology, its resemblance with other prehistoric tombs of Menorca dates it to between 1700 and 1400 BC. A stepped corridor leads to the tomb's rectangular chamber, which has a stone bench that surrounds its internal perimeter. Part of the stone gallery, which used to cover the corridor and the entrance, is still preserved; this was built using the cyclopean technique. The corridor is 2.60 m long, while the dimensions of the chamber are: 8.80 m long, 2.50 m wide, and 1.95 m high. The walls of the internal chamber present several engravings representing three sailing ships and other undetermined figures. Some authors claim the importance of these elements, since they can date them back to the Bronze Age. However, the date of these engraving has not been determined and could have been made in any other subsequent period.

The safety of underwater diving depends on four factors: the environment, the equipment, behaviour of the individual diver and performance of the dive team. The underwater environment can impose severe physical and psychological stress on a diver, and is mostly beyond the diver's control. Equipment is used to operate underwater for anything beyond very short periods, and the reliable function of some of the equipment is critical to even short term survival. Other equipment allows the diver to operate in relative comfort and efficiency. The performance of the individual diver depends on learned skills, many of which are not intuitive, and the performance of the team depends on competence, communication and common goals. There is a large range of hazards to which the diver may be exposed. These each have associated consequences and risks, which should be taken into account during dive planning. Where risks are marginally acceptable it may be possible to mitigate the consequences by setting contingency and emergency plans in place, so that damage can be minimised where reasonably practicable. The acceptable level of risk varies depending on legislation, codes of practice, company policy, and personal choice, with recreational divers having a greater freedom of choice. In professional diving, the diving supervisor for the operation is legally responsible for the safety of the diving team. A diving contractor may have a diving superintendent or a diving safety officer tasked with ensuring the organisation has, and uses, a suitable operations manual to guide their practices. In recreational diving, the dive leader may be partly responsible for diver safety to the extent that the dive briefing is reasonably accurate and does not omit any known hazards that divers in the group can reasonably be expected to be unaware of, and not to lead the group into a known area of unacceptable risk. A certified recreational diver is generally responsible for their own safety, and to a lesser, variable, and poorly defined extent, for the safety of their dive buddy. Environmental factors The underwater environment is alien to humans. When not actively hostile, it is unforgiving of errors, and some errors can escalate rapidly to a fatal conclusion. Many aspects of the underwater environment are static or predictable, others vary and may not be easily or reliably predictable, and must be managed as and when they occur. The reasonably predictable factors can be allowed for in the dive planning. Suitable equipment can be selected, personnel can be trained in its use and support provided to manage the foreseeable contingencies. When conditions are found to be other than predicted, plans may have to be changed. Sometimes conditions are better than expected, but other times they may be worse, and may deteriorate during the course of a dive to the extent that recovery becomes an emergency. *Predictable/static environmental factors - conditions which should be considered in the dive plan. These include geographic factors, like depth, topography, access, tides and currents, normal temperature range and the local ecology. *Variable environmental factors - conditions can change during a dive - dive contingency plans should take into account the reasonably foreseeable variations based on forecasts and local knowledge. When there is no reliable local knowledge, a wider range of contingencies should be considered. Equipment safety Two basic classes of equipment are used by divers: Equipment necessary to do the planned dive, and equipment required to do the task for which the dive is necessary. Recreational divers may not require equipment for a task, but it is quite common for them to use a camera, and some will survey a dive site, or use a small lift bag to recover an anchor or diving shot. There are no particularly significant risks associated with tools commonly used by recreational divers. Commercial divers usually use tools of some kind while diving, and some of these tools can be very dangerous if used incorrectly, such as high-pressure water-jets, explosive bolts, oxy- arc cutting and welding and heavy lifting equipment and rigging. Scuba Sidemount scuba is useful in tight restrictions Open circuit scuba is mechanically robust and reliable, but can malfunction when damaged, misused, poorly maintained, or occasionally due to unplanned circumstances. Provision of a completely independent emergency supply capable of providing sufficient breathing gas to allow the diver to surface safely from any point on the planned dive profile reduces the risk of a non-survivable out of gas incident to an extremely low level. This remains valid only as long as the emergency gas supply is within immediate reach of the diver, which is more reliably achieved by the diver carrying a bailout cylinder than by relying on a buddy or standby diver, who may not be where needed in an emergency. Rebreathers have an intrinsically much higher riskin the order of 25 times higher of mechanical failure than open circuit scuba because of their structural and functional complexity, but this can be mitigated by good design which provides redundancy of critical items and by carrying sufficient alternative breathing gas supplies for bailout including any required decompression in case of failure. Designs that minimize risk of human-machine interface errors, and adequate training in procedures that deal with this area may help reduce the fatality rate. Two thirds of fatalities were associated with high risk behaviour of a high risk dive profile. Surface-supplied equipment alt= Two divers wearing lightweight demand helmets stand back-to-back on an underwater platform holding on to the railings. The photo also shows the support vessel above the surface in the background. The essential aspect of surface-supplied diving is that breathing gas is supplied from the surface, either from a specialized diving compressor, high-pressure cylinders, or both. In commercial and military surface-supplied diving, a backup source of breathing gas should always be present in case the primary supply fails. The diver may also wear a cylinder called a \\"bail-out bottle,\\" which can provide self-contained breathing gas in an emergency. Thus, the surface-supplied diver is much less likely to have an \\"out-of-air\\" emergency than a scuba diver as there are normally two alternative air sources available. Surface-supplied diving equipment usually includes communication capability with the surface, which adds to the safety and efficiency of the working diver. Surface-supplied equipment is required under the US Navy operational guidance for diving in harsh contaminated environments which was drawn up by the Navy Experimental Diving Unit. Surface-supplied diving equipment is required for a large proportion of the commercial diving operations conducted in many countries, either by direct legislation, or by authorised codes of practice, as in the case of IMCA operations. Human factors Human factors are the physical or cognitive properties of individuals, or social behavior which is specific to humans, and influence functioning of technological systems as well as human- environment equilibria. The safety of underwater diving operations can be improved by reducing the frequency of human error and the consequences when it does occur. Human error can be defined as an individual's deviation from acceptable or desirable practice which culminates in undesirable or unexpected results. Human error is inevitable and everyone makes mistakes at some time. The consequences of these errors are varied and depend on many factors. Most errors are minor and do not cause significant harm, but others can have catastrophic consequences. Examples of human error leading to accidents are available in vast numbers, as it is the direct cause of 60% to 80% of all accidents. In a high risk environment, as is the case in diving, human error is more likely to have catastrophic consequences. A study by William P. Morgan indicates that over half of all divers in the survey had experienced panic underwater at some time during their diving career. These findings were independently corroborated by a survey that suggested 65% of recreational divers have panicked under water. Panic frequently leads to errors in a diver's judgment or performance, and may result in an accident. Human error and panic are considered to be the leading causes of dive accidents and fatalities. Only 4.46% of the recreational diving fatalities in a 1997 study were attributable to a single contributory cause. The remaining fatalities probably arose as a result of a progressive sequence of events involving two or more procedural errors or equipment failures, and since procedural errors are generally avoidable by a well-trained, intelligent and alert diver, working in an organised structure, and not under excessive stress, it was concluded that the low accident rate in commercial scuba diving is due to this factor. The study also concluded that it would be impossible to eliminate absolutely all minor contraindications of scuba diving, as this would result in overwhelming bureaucracy and would bring all diving to a halt. Humans function underwater by virtue of technology, as our physiology is poorly adapted to the environment. Human factors are significant in diving because of this harsh and alien environment, and because diver life support systems and other equipment that may be required to perform specific tasks depend on technology that is designed, operated and maintained by humans, and because human factors are cited as significant contributors to diving accidents in most accident investigations Professional diving is a means to accomplish a wide range of activities underwater in a normally inaccessible and potentially hazardous environment. While working underwater, divers are subjected to high levels of physical and psychological stress due to environmental conditions and the limitations of the life support systems, as well as the rigours of the task at hand. Recreational, or sport divers, including technical divers, dive for entertainment, and are usually motivated by a desire to explore and witness, though there is no distinct division between the underwater activities of recreational and professional divers. The primary distinction is that legal obligations and protection are significantly different, and this is reflected in organisational structure and procedures. Recreational diving has been rated more risky than snow skiing, but less risky than other adventure sports such as rock climbing, bungee jumping, motorcycle racing and sky diving. Improvements in training standards and equipment design and configuration, and increased awareness of the risks of diving, have not eliminated fatal incidents, which occur every year in what is generally a reasonably safe recreational activity. Both categories of diver are usually trained and certified, but recreational diving equipment is typically limited to freediving and scuba, whereas professional divers may be trained to use a greater variety of diving systems, from scuba to surface supplied mixed gas, saturation systems and atmospheric diving suits. A recreational diver may use some ancillary equipment to enhance the diving experience, but the professional will almost always use tools to perform a specific task. Since the goal of recreational diving is personal enjoyment, a decision to abort a dive, for whatever reason, normally only affects the diver and his companions. A working diver faced with the same decision, must disappoint a client who needs and expects the diver's services, often with significant financial consequences. Therefore, the working diver often faces greater pressure to provide the service at the cost of reduced personal safety. An understanding of the human factors associated with diving may help the diving team to strike an appropriate balance between service delivery and safety. Human factors are the influences on human behavior, and the resulting effects of human performance on a process or system. Safety can be improved by reducing the frequency of human error and the consequences when it does occur. Human error can be defined as an individual's deviation from acceptable or desirable practice which culminates in undesirable or unexpected results. Situational awareness Situational awareness is the perception of environmental elements and events with respect to time or space, the comprehension of their meaning, and the projection of their future status. It has been recognized as a critical, yet often elusive, foundation for successful decision-making across a broad range of situations. Lacking or inadequate situation awareness has been identified as one of the primary factors in accidents attributed to human error. The formal definition of situational awareness breaks it down into three components: perception of the elements in the environment, comprehension of the situation, and projection of future status. Situational awareness is recognised as necessary for diving safety as a member of the dive team who is not aware of changing circumstances may fail to react appropriately in time to avoid serious difficulties. Diver performance Safety of underwater diving operations can be improved by reducing the frequency of human error and the consequences when it does occur. Human error can be defined as an individual's deviation from acceptable or desirable practice which culminates in undesirable or unexpected results. Human error is inevitable and everyone makes mistakes at some time. The consequences of these errors are varied and depend on many factors. Most errors are minor and do not cause significant harm, but others can have catastrophic consequences. Human error and panic are considered to be the leading causes of dive accidents and fatalities. *Inadequate learning or practice of critical safety skills may result in the inability to deal with minor incidents, which consequently may develop into major incidents. *Overconfidence can result in diving in conditions beyond the diver's competence, with high risk of accident due to inability to deal with known environmental hazards. *Inadequate strength or fitness for the conditions can result in inability to compensate for difficult conditions even though the diver may be well versed at the required skills, and could lead to over-exertion, overtiredness, stress injuries or exhaustion. *Peer pressure can cause a diver to dive in conditions where they may be unable to deal with reasonably predictable incidents. *Diving with an incompetent buddy can result in injury or death while attempting to deal with a problem caused by the buddy. *Overweighting can cause difficulty in neutralising and controlling buoyancy, and this can lead to uncontrolled descent, inability to establish neutral buoyancy, inefficient swimming, high gas consumption, poor trim, kicking up silt, difficulty in ascent and inability to control depth accurately for decompression. *Underweighting can cause difficulty in neutralising and controlling buoyancy, and consequent inability to achieve neutral buoyancy, particularly at decompression stops. *Diving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or with a hangover may result in inappropriate or delayed response to contingencies, reduced ability to deal timeously with problems, leading to greater risk of developing into an accident, increased risk of hypothermia and increased risk of decompression sickness. *Use of inappropriate equipment and/or configuration can lead to a whole range of complications, depending on the details. *High task loading due to a combination of these factors can result in a dive that goes well enough until something goes wrong, and the diver's residual capacity is not enough to cope with the changed circumstances. This can be followed by a cascade of failures, as each problem loads the diver more and triggers the next. In such cases the diver is lucky to survive, even with the assistance of a buddy or team, and there is a significant risk of others becoming part of the accident. Diving team performance A dive team can vary from a recreational buddy pair to a professional saturation diving team working 24 hours per day with dive and habitat support personnel on a dynamically positioned vessel. The primary purpose of a professional diving team is to improve safety for the working diver by providing backup and support, and to manage the surface equipment required for the operation. A buddy pair is a team intended to improve the safety of recreational divers, and in some circumstances succeeds in this aim, depending on the skills, situational awareness and compliance with procedures of the divers. Technical diving teams can vary between the recreational buddy pair at its worst to expedition teams with structure, competence and planning similar to professional teams. For many applications, the minimum personnel requirement for a professional diving operation is a working diver, to do the job, a diver's tender to assist the diver and manage the umbilical or airline, a standby diver, competent and ready to go to the assistance of the working diver, and a supervisor, to co-ordinate the team, ensure that the plan is acceptably safe in terms of the organisational policies coded of practice and applicable legislation, ensure that the operation follows the plan as far as possible, and to manage any contingencies or emergencies that may come up during the operation. The primary responsibility of the supervisor of a professional diving team is the health and safety of the diving team. The minimum personnel requirement for a recreational dive in most places, is the diver. There are a few countries where further support is obligatory, generally a requirement to dive with a buddy, but in most places a recreational diver is responsible for their own safety and is legally free to dive without any support personnel. Recreational service providers may impose their own terms and conditions on customers, but this is generally a contractual option. Hazards Divers operate in an environment for which the human body is not well suited. They face special physical and health risks when they go underwater or use high pressure breathing gas. The consequences of diving incidents range from merely annoying to rapidly fatal, and the result often depends on the equipment, skill, response and fitness of the diver and diving team. The hazards include the aquatic environment, the use of breathing equipment in an underwater environment, exposure to a pressurised environment and pressure changes, particularly pressure changes during descent and ascent, and breathing gases at high ambient pressure. Diving equipment other than breathing apparatus is usually reliable, but has been known to fail, and loss of buoyancy control or thermal protection can be a major burden which may lead to more serious problems. There are also hazards of the specific diving environment, and hazards related to access to and egress from the water, which vary from place to place, and may also vary with time. Hazards inherent in the diver include pre-existing physiological and psychological conditions and the personal behaviour and competence of the individual. For those pursuing other activities while diving, there are additional hazards of task loading, of the dive task and of special equipment associated with the task. Professional divers may be exposed to a wider range of hazards, some of which are inherent in the equipment used to reduce the risk of other hazards. Saturation diving is intended to reduce a relatively high risk of decompression sickness, but introduces other health and safety hazards of living at a high ambient pressure for extended periods, and transfer between pressurised spaces. Failure of a saturation system can be catastrophic and fatal to the occupants and bystanders. Such failures are seldom engineering failures, they are more often ergonomic design and operation failures, and usually systems are corrected after analysis of such failures. Consequences Mask squeeze barotrauma of descent Diving related medical conditions, are conditions associated with underwater diving, and include both conditions unique to underwater diving, and those that also occur during other activities. This second group further divides into conditions caused by exposure to ambient pressures significantly different from surface atmospheric pressure, and a range of conditions caused by general environment and equipment associated with diving activities. Disorders particularly associated with diving include those caused by variations in ambient pressure, such as barotraumas of descent and ascent, decompression sickness and those caused by exposure to elevated ambient pressure, such as some types of gas toxicity and excessive work of breathing. There are also non-dysbaric disorders associated with diving, which include the effects of the aquatic environment, such as drowning, which also are common to other water users, and disorders caused by the equipment or associated factors, such as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide poisoning. General environmental conditions can lead to another group of disorders, which include hypothermia and motion sickness, injuries by marine and aquatic organisms, contaminated waters, man- made hazards, and ergonomic problems with equipment. Finally there are pre- existing medical and psychological conditions which increase the risk of being affected by a diving disorder, which may be aggravated by adverse side effects of medications and other drug use. Treatment depends on the specific disorder, but often includes oxygen therapy, which is standard first aid for most diving accidents, and is hardly ever contra-indicated for a person medically fit to dive, and hyperbaric therapy is the definitive treatment for decompression sickness. Screening for medical fitness to dive can reduce some of the risk for some of the disorders. Risk The labels used to classify dives are not sufficiently precise for analysing risk. Terms like \\"recreational\\", \\"technical\\", \\"commercial\\", \\"military\\", \\"scientific\\" and \\"professional\\" are used but are not precisely defined, particularly for risk analysis as they do not identify specific contributors to diving risk. Categorisation by depth and obligation for decompression stops is also insufficient to classify risk. The diving mode has a large influence on risk, and choice of diving mode is commonly based on the outcome of a risk assessment for the diving operation. *Hazard identification and risk assessment: HIRA is a procedure applied to a project, and the results would be used to inform the planners on safety related issues such as choosing the appropriate diving mode, selection of equipment and dive team members, specialised training that may be required, and contingency and emergency planning. *Job safety analysis: A JSA is a procedure which helps integrate accepted safety and health principles and practices into a particular task or job operation. In a JSA, each basic step of the analysis is to identify potential hazards and to recommend the safest way to do the job. In professional diving a JSA would be done for the planned task for a specific dive, and the result would be included in the dive briefing. Risk management Risk management has three major aspects besides equipment and training: Risk assessment, emergency management and insurance cover. The risk assessment for a dive is primarily a planning activity, and may range in formality from a part of the pre-dive buddy check for recreational divers, to a safety file with professional risk assessment and detailed emergency plans for professional diving projects. Some form of pre-dive briefing is customary with organised recreational dives, and this generally includes a recitation by the divemaster of the known and predicted hazards, the risk associated with the significant ones, and the procedures to be followed in case of the reasonably foreseeable emergencies associated with them. Insurance cover for diving accidents may not be included in standard policies. There are a few organisations which focus specifically on diver safety and insurance cover, such as the international Divers Alert Network Hazard control The classic methods of hazard control are applied when reasonably practicable: The modes of diving can be considered levels of hazard control. An alternative mode of diving may include hazard elimination or substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls and personal protective equipment to reduce risk for a given activity, usually at considerable logistical cost, and often reducing operational flexibility. Hazards to divers can be completely eliminated when a machine can do the job. There are a growing number of commercial, military and scientific applications where a remotely operated or autonomous underwater vehicle can produce satisfactory results. To a lesser extent this applies to atmospheric pressure diving, where the diver is not exposed to the environment as long as the suit integrity is maintained, but some of the hazards and risks remain. Saturation diving is a technique that allows divers to reduce the risk of decompression sickness (\\"the bends\\") when they work at great depths for long periods of time. Freediving freediving in the Red SeaCompetition freediving with safety divers Freediving, or breath-hold diving, is the original mode of diving, and was used for centuries in spite of limitations as it was the only option available. It is simple and inexpensive, but severely limited in the time available to do useful work at depth. The risk of drowning is relatively high, as the diver is limited to the oxygen supplied by a single breath, and the risk of hypoxic blackout underwater, followed by drowning, is significant. Hypoxic blackout during freediving is a loss of consciousness caused by cerebral hypoxia towards the end of a breath-hold dive, when the swimmer does not necessarily experience an urgent need to breathe and has no other obvious medical condition that might have caused it. It can be provoked by hyperventilating just before a dive, or as a consequence of the pressure reduction on ascent, or a combination of these. Victims are often established practitioners of breath-hold diving, are fit, strong swimmers and have not experienced problems before. Divers and swimmers who blackout or grey out underwater during a dive will usually drown unless rescued and resuscitated within a short time. Freediving blackout has a high fatality rate but is generally avoidable. The risk cannot be quantified, but is clearly increased by any level of hyperventilation. Freediving blackout can occur on any dive profile: at constant depth, on an ascent from depth, or at the surface following ascent from depth and may be described by a number of terms depending on the dive profile and depth at which consciousness is lost. Blackout during a shallow dive differs from blackout during ascent from a deep dive in that deep water blackout is precipitated by depressurisation on ascent from depth while shallow water blackout is a consequence of hypocapnia following hyperventilation. Trained freedivers are well aware of this and the competition rules require competitions to be held under strict supervision and with competent first-aiders on standby. However this does not eliminate the risk of blackout. Freedivers are recommended to only dive with a 'buddy' who accompanies them, observing from in the water at the surface, and is ready and able to dive to the rescue if the diver loses consciousness during the ascent. This recommendation has an obvious point of failure when the visibility does not allow the buddy to observe the diver throughout the dive. Scuba diving Diving using self-contained underwater breathing apparatus was developed after surface supplied diving, and was intended as a method of improving the mobility and horizontal range of the diver who is not restricted by a physical connection to a surface gas supply. The diver has a larger gas supply than the freediver, and this allows a greatly extended underwater endurance, and lower risk of drowning, but at the cost of higher risk from decompression sickness, lung over-pressure barotrauma, nitrogen narcosis, oxygen toxicity and hypothermia, all of which must be limited by procedural and engineering controls, and personal protective equipment. For acceptable safety the diver must be able to survive any reasonably foreseeable single point of failure. For scuba equipment this implies that the failure of any single item of equipment should not put the diver out of reach of a breathing gas supply. Open circuit In the case of a single cylinder scuba set with a single first stage, and a single second stage, each of these items has a low but non-zero probability of failure. The components work in series - if any one of them fails, the system fails. It is equivalent to a single chain in which if any link fails, the chain breaks. When the dive is very shallow, the diver can safely escape to the surface, and when there is another diver right there with spare gas at the time of failure, they can share gas. At other times, a failure of a single item can kill the diver. Assuming independence of failure events, each item that can cause failure of the combined system is a critical point of failure and increases the probability of system failure. For the system not to fail, all items must not fail according to the formula: {p}= 1- \\\\prod_{i=1}^{n} (1-p_{i}) where: * n – number of components * p_{i} – probability of component i failing * p – the probability of all components failing (system failure) As a purely illustrative example, if there is a 1 in 100 probability of a regulator failure, and a 1 in 1000 probability of a scuba cylinder failure then : p_{reg}=0.01, and p_{cyl}=0.001 Therefore: : P_{fail}= 1-(1-p_{reg}) \\\\times (1-p_{cyl}) Substituting values: : P_{fail}= 1-(1-0.01) \\\\times (1-0.001) :: = 1-0.99 \\\\times 0.999 :: = 1-0.98901 :: = 0.01099 which is close to the sum of the two probabilities. The example shows that each critical point of failure increases the probability of system failure by approximately that item's probability of failure. If there are two completely independent scuba sets at the diver's disposal, either one of which is sufficient to allow the diver a safe return, then both sets must fail during the same dive to cause a fatal outcome. These items work in parallel - all must fail for the system to fail. The probability of this happening is extremely low for reliable equipment. Assuming independence of failure events, each duplicate redundant item added to the system decreases the probability of system failure according to the formula:- {p}= \\\\prod_{i=1}^{n} p_{i} where: * n – number of components * p_{i} – probability of component i failing * p – the probability of all components failing (system failure) Taking two independent sets with the same probability of failure calculated in the example above: : p_{left}=0.01099, and p_{right}=0.01099 Therefore: : P_{fail}= (p_{left}) \\\\times (p_{right}) Substituting values: : P_{fail}= 0.01099 \\\\times 0.01099 :: = 0.00012078 It is clear from the example that redundancy reduces the risk of system failure very rapidly, and conversely, that disregarding a failure of a redundant item increases the probability of system failure equally rapidly. Closed circuit Open circuit scuba has a small number of fairly rugged and reliable components, each with a small number of failure modes and a low probability of failure. Most of these components remain present in closed circuit scuba, but there are also a number of additional items which could fail. Therefore, the rebreather architecture is inherently more likely to fail, and it is necessary to provide redundancy of critical components to provide reliability even approaching that of open circuit scuba. It is also more important to provide full redundancy of breathing gas supply as some rebreather failure modes do not allow safe ascent. Bailout to open circuit is the simplest and most robust option, but for dives where a long return under an overhead, or long decompression are necessary, open circuit can be impractically bulky. There is a point at which closed circuit bailout becomes a more manageable option, and the requirement for ability to return safely from any point on the planned dive profile makes it necessary for the breathing loop and gas supplies to be fully independent, though the ability to make use of the primary gas supply in the bailout rebreather can considerably extend the range for a small added complexity, using highly reliable components, but adding to the task loading of the diver. A hazard specific to closed circuit rebreathers is failure of the oxygen partial pressure control system. The breathing gas mixture in a diving rebreather loop is usually measured using electro-galvanic oxygen sensors, and the output of the cells is used by either the diver or an electronic control system to control addition of oxygen to increase partial pressure when it is below the chosen lower set- point, or to flush with diluent gas when it is above the upper set-point. When the partial pressure is between the upper and lower set-points, it is suitable for breathing at that depth and is left until it changes as a result of consumption by the diver, or a change in ambient pressure as a result of a depth change. Accuracy and reliability of measurement is important in this application for two basic reasons. Firstly, if the oxygen content is too low, the diver will lose consciousness due to hypoxia and probably die, or if the oxygen content is too high, the risk of central nervous system oxygen toxicity causing convulsions and loss of consciousness, with a high risk of drowning becomes unacceptable. Secondly, decompression obligations cannot be accurately or reliably calculated if the breathing gas composition is not known. Pre-dive calibration of the cells can only check response to partial pressures up to 100% at atmospheric pressure, or 1 bar. As the set points are commonly in the range of 1.2 to 1.6 bar, special hyperbaric calibration equipment would be required to reliably test the response at the set-points. This equipment is available, but is expensive and not in common use, and requires the cells to be removed from the rebreather and installed in the test unit. To compensate for the possibility of a cell failure during a dive, three cells are generally fitted, on the principle that failure of one cell at a time is most likely, and that if two cells indicate the same PO2, they are more likely to be correct than the single cell with a different reading. Voting logic allows the control system to control the circuit for the rest of the dive according to the two cells assumed to be correct. This is not entirely reliable, as it is possible for two cells to fail on the same dive. Surface oriented surface supplied diving Surface-supplied diving is diving using equipment supplied with breathing gas using a diver's umbilical from the surface, either from the shore or from a diving support vessel, sometimes indirectly via a diving bell. The copper helmeted free-flow standard diving dress is the version which made commercial diving a viable occupation, and although still used in some regions, this heavy equipment has been superseded by lighter free-flow helmets, and to a large extent, lightweight demand helmets, band masks and full-face diving masks. Breathing gases used include air, heliox, nitrox, oxygen and trimix. Gases with raised oxygen fraction are used to reduce decompression obligation and accelerate decompression, and gases containing helium are used to reduce nitrogen narcosis. Both applications reduce the risk to the diver when applicable. The primary advantages of conventional surface- supplied diving over scuba are lower risk of drowning and considerably larger breathing gas supply than scuba, allowing longer working periods and safer decompression. Surface-supplied diving systems also improve safety by virtually eliminating the risk of a lost diver, as the diver is physically connected to the surface control point by the breathing gas supply hose, and other components of the umbilical cable system. They also significantly reduce the risk of running out of breathing gas during the dive, and allow multiple redundancy of gas supply, with main and secondary surface supply, and a scuba bailout emergency gas system. Use of helmets and full-face masks help protect the diver's airway in case of loss of consciousness. These can be considered engineering controls of the hazards. Saturation diving Saturation divers are transferred under pressure between the living quarters and the work site in a closed bell Decompression sickness occurs when a diver with a large amount of inert gas dissolved in the body tissues is decompressed to a pressure where the gas forms bubbles which may block blood vessels or physically damage surrounding cells. This is a risk on every decompression, and limiting the number of decompressions can reduce the risk. \\"Saturation\\" refers to the fact that the diver's tissues have absorbed the maximum partial pressure of gas possible for that depth due to the diver being exposed to breathing gas at that pressure for prolonged periods. This is significant because once the tissues become saturated, the time to ascend from depth, to decompress safely, will not increase with further exposure. In saturation diving, the divers live in a pressurized environment, which can be a saturation system - a hyperbaric environment on the surface - or an ambient pressure underwater habitat. This may continue for up to several weeks, usually with the divers living at the same or very similar ambient pressure to the work site, and they are decompressed to surface pressure only once, at the end of their tour of duty. By limiting the number of decompressions in this way, the risk of decompression sickness is significantly reduced at the cost of exposing the diver to other hazards associated with living under high pressure for prolonged periods. Saturation diving is an example of substitution of a hazard expected to present a lower risk than surface oriented diving for the same set of operations. Atmospheric pressure diving The Newtsuit has fully articulated, rotary joints in the arms and legs. These provide great mobility, while remaining largely unaffected by high pressures. Atmospheric pressure diving isolates the diver from the ambient pressure of the environment by using an atmospheric diving suit (ADS), which is a small one-person articulated submersible of anthropomorphic form which resembles a suit of armour, with elaborate pressure joints to allow articulation while maintaining an internal pressure of one atmosphere. The ADS can be used for very deep dives of up to for many hours, and eliminates the majority of physiological dangers associated with deep diving; the occupant need not decompress, there is no need for special gas mixtures, and there is no danger of decompression sickness or nitrogen narcosis, and a drastically reduced risk of oxygen toxicity. Hard suit divers do not even need to be skilled swimmers, as swimming is not yet possible in atmospheric suits. The current generation of atmospheric suits are more ergonomically flexible than earlier versions, but are still very limited in personal mobility and dexterity compared to an ambient pressure diver. Use of an atmospheric suit may be considered as substituting a relatively low risk of crushing for a higher risk of decompression sickness and barotrauma, by using the suit as an engineered barrier between the diver and the hazards. Remotely operated underwater vehicles ROV at work in an underwater oil and gas field. The ROV is operating a subsea torque tool (wrench) on a valve on the subsea structure. A remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) is an unoccupied, highly maneuverable, tethered mobile underwater device operated by a crew aboard a base platform. They are linked to the base platform by a neutrally buoyant tether or, often when working in rough conditions or in deeper water, a load- carrying umbilical cable is used along with a tether management system (TMS). The purpose of the TMS is to lengthen and shorten the tether so the effect of cable drag where there are underwater currents is minimized. The umbilical cable is an armored cable that contains a group of electrical conductors and fiber optics that carry electric power, video, and data signals between the operator and the TMS. Where used, the TMS then relays the signals and power for the ROV down the tether cable. Most ROVs are equipped with at least a video camera and lights. Additional equipment is commonly added to expand the vehicle's capabilities. These may include sonars, magnetometers, a still camera, a manipulator or cutting arm, water samplers, and instruments that measure water clarity, water temperature, water density, sound velocity, light penetration, and temperature. ROVs are commonly used in deep water industries such as offshore hydrocarbon extraction, where they can carry out many tasks previously requiring diver intervention. ROVs may be used together with divers, or without a diver in the water, in which case the risk to the diver associated with the dive is eliminated altogether. Administrative controls Administrative controls include medical screening, planning and preparation for diving and training in essential skills. These requirements may be specified by regulation, code of practice, operations manual or terms or conditions of a contract. Legislation, codes of practice and organisational procedures Professional diving is generally regulated by occupational safety and health legislation, which can vary between jurisdictions, but tends to have some common features. *Some form of statutory law protecting persons at work. *Regulations empowered by the statutory law referring specifically to occupational diving activities and defining their scope. *Codes of practice for diving activities approved or recommended in terms of the regulations. *A requirement for employers of occupational divers to provide a safe working environment to the extent reasonably practicable, and to provide specific guidance for them in the procedures and equipment to be used by way of an operations manual. *Training standards specifying the minimum competences required for occupational diving in various circumstances, generally associated with diving mode and depth range, and for the minimum competences of other specified members of a dive team. *Medical standards of fitness to dive, and persons authorised to perform medical examinations on divers to assess their fitness to dive. *Formal registration of personnel assessed as competent to perform in specified roles as members of a professional diving team, and their legal responsibilities in terms of occupational health and safety. In most jurisdictions, recreational diving is unregulated, and an entirely untrained person is not legally hindered from scuba or freediving at their own risk in public access bodies of water. There is to some extent industry self-regulation, and most service providers will require customers to show evidence of competence appropriate to the service requested. This is usually a matter of presenting a recognised C-card, and is intended mainly to limit liability. The other instrument commonly used to limit liability is a waiver signed by the customer as part of the conditions of service. =Exemptions= In special cases exemptions may be granted for specific classes of diving operations, or for specific diving projects. USA – Depending on state legislation, public safety diving in the USA may fall under state or federal occupational safety and health legislation. Federal legislation applies where there is no relevant state legislation and the divers are employees diving as part of their occupation. If they fall under federal legislation they are exempt (excluded) from specific requirements of 29 CFR Part 1910, Subpart T, Commercial Diving Operations, only during diving activities incidental to police and public-safety functions the purpose of which is to provide search, rescue, or public-safety diving services. The exemption was written to include the ability to deviate from safe diving practices under limited conditions where compliance would be impracticable due to time constraints or the possible consequences of failing to perform the task overwhelm the risks taken using available facilities. This exclusion does not apply during training, recovery operations, searches where there is no reasonable probability of rescue of a living person or there is no real and immediate public safety hazard. The specific federal legislation does not apply to volunteers where there is no employer/employee relationship. Scientific diving in the US is also exempt from 29 CFR Part 1910, Subpart T, Commercial Diving Operations provided that such diving is under the auspices of the American Academy of Underwater Sciences, and complies with all requirements for the exemption, which are tied to the AAUS Standards for Scientific Diving Certification and Operation of Scientific Diving Programs. Medical screening Hand held spirometer used to test lung function, one of the standard medical screening tests for divers. PC based spirometer output Fitness to dive, (also medical fitness to dive), is the medical and physical suitability of a diver to function safely in the underwater environment using underwater diving equipment and procedures. Depending on the circumstances it may be established by a signed statement by the diver that he or she does not suffer from any of the listed disqualifying conditions and is able to manage the ordinary physical requirements of diving, to a detailed medical examination by a physician registered as a medical examiner of divers following a procedural checklist, and a legal document of fitness to dive issued by the medical examiner. The most important medical is the one before starting diving, as the diver can be screened to prevent exposure when a dangerous condition exists. The other important medicals are after some significant illness, where medical intervention is needed, and has to be done by a doctor who is competent in diving medicine, and in these cases fitness can not always be established by prescriptive rules. Psychological factors can affect fitness to dive, particularly where they affect response to emergencies, or risk taking behaviour. Overconfidence and trait anxiety are both undesirable characteristics in a diver. The use of medical and recreational drugs, can also influence fitness to dive, both for physiological and behavioural reasons. In some cases prescription drug use may have a net positive effect, when effectively treating an underlying condition, but frequently the side effects of effective medication may have undesirable influences on the fitness of diver, and most cases of recreational drug use result in an impaired fitness to dive, and a significantly increased risk of sub-optimal or inappropriate response to emergencies. Fitness to dive can be modified to some extent by training. Physical fitness can be improved to give the diver better capacity to deal with physical challenges, and properly conducted stress exposure training can improve situational awareness and the ability to focus on relevant responses under stress. Pre-dive preparation and planning Dive planning is the process of planning an underwater diving operation. The purpose of dive planning is to increase the probability that a dive will be completed safely and the goals achieved. Some form of planning is done for most underwater dives, but the complexity and detail considered may vary enormously. Professional diving operations are usually formally planned and the plan documented as a legal record that due diligence has been done for health and safety purposes. Recreational dive planning may be less formal, but for complex technical dives, can be as formal, detailed and extensive as most professional dive plans. A professional diving contractor will be constrained by the code of practice, standing orders or regulatory legislation covering a project or specific operations within a project, and is responsible for ensuring that the scope of work to be done is within the scope of the rules relevant to that work. A recreational (including technical) diver or dive group is generally less constrained, but nevertheless is almost always restricted by some legislation, and often also the rules of the organisations to which the divers are affiliated. The planning of a diving operation may be simple or complex. In some cases the processes may have to be repeated several times before a satisfactory plan is achieved, and even then the plan may have to be modified on site to suit changed circumstances. The final product of the planning process may be formally documented or, in the case of recreational divers, an agreement on how the dive will be conducted. A diving project may consist of a number of related diving operations. A hazard identification and risk assessment procedure is the basis of a large part of dive planning. The hazards to which the divers will be exposed are identified, and the level of risk associated with each is evaluated. If the risk is deemed to be excessive, control methods will be applied to reduce the risk to an acceptable level, and where appropriate, further controls will be set in place to mitigate the effects if an incident does occur. A documented dive plan may contain elements from the following list: *Overview of diving activities *Schedule of diving operations *Specific dive plan information *Budget Following the plan A basic strategy of risk management is to plan an operation and then conduct it, as far as reasonably practicable, according to the plan. If this is done, the risks will have been assessed and the equipment chosen will be suitable. Deviation from the plan brings in unassessed factors. In professional diving where a diving operation plan must be drawn up, variation from the plan generally requires reassessment of risk and recording of the deviation and any measures that were found necessary to manage the changed circumstances. In recreational diving, the diver is free to plan or not, and to change the plan on whim, but technical diving certification agencies generally encourage divers to \\"plan the dive and dive the plan\\", as this is considered good practice for safety, and is the same strategy used by professionals. Standard operating procedures and codes of practice are used to reduce the amount of detail required in dive planning. These documents provide much of the necessary detail of how frequently encountered tasks should be performed, using methods which have been tested and found to be effective, efficient and acceptably safe. When standard procedures are used, it is not necessary to detail those procedures in the dive plan, as the team members should be familiar with them already. Standard operating procedures are the procedures identified by the diving contractor as the recommended or required way of performing a range of routine activities and codified in a document. Following SOPs is generally a condition of employment for the diving team, and the provision of SOPs may be a requirement of health and safety regulations. The document is often called the operations manual, diving manual or something similar. For example, the U.S. Navy Diving Manual, and NOAA Diving Manual, Codes of practice are procedures identified by a larger population as preferred methods for a similar range of activities. They may be a set of industry best practice recommendations, such as the IMCA Code of Practice for offshore diving, a government regulated set of recommendations, or a regulated set of requirements which must be followed. In recreational diving there are also some procedures that are widely recognised and common to most training agencies, but there are some procedures than differ between agencies, and divers may therefore differ in their expectations in some contingencies. Ideally any two divers intending to dive together in the buddy system, should use the same or compatible responses to emergencies where prompt and effective response could be a matter of life or death. This ideal does not always map well onto the common practice of buddy pairs being allocated more or less arbitrarily by the divemaster or charter boat skipper. The consequence is that some divers accept that the buddy system is degraded by this practice, and they amend their expectations by assuming that the buddy may not be of any practical assistance, and plan to be self-sufficient. Other divers refuse to dive with anyone who is not trained to the same system. Many divers simply accept the status quo and do not even question the safety implications. Use of checklists Studies have shown that the use of written checklists can significantly reduce the number of critical human errors in occupations and procedures where a small number of critical checks can make a proportionately large effect on the risk of the operation. These are reminders to make critical checks for people who are well aware of the need, and highly skilled and responsible posts such as airline cockpit crew and operating theatre staff, who nevertheless occasionally fail to complete the necessary preparations in the absence of a checklist. The concept has been tested on a group of recreational divers and the reduction in undesirable incidents was highly significant. Checklist systems are more common in professional diving, where the code of practice or operations manual may mandate recording that each checklist has been applied. The checklist is effective when all critical checks are listed. Additional detail may be counterproductive as distraction. More detailed checklists may be appropriate where equipment is set up and tested. The pre-dive check mnemonics advocated by diver training agencies are less reliable, as they rely on memory, vary considerably, using different terms to refer to the same or similar set of checks and the order of checks is highly variable and can cause divers trained by different agencies to become confused when diving together. In some cases the same initial has been used for several groups of checks. A written checklist covering the safety-critical checks in a logical order avoids the distraction of trying to remember what the next item to be checked should be, and ensures that all the checks are covered, even if the checks are interrupted. There are several stages at which the use of a checklist is appropriate. These include during dive planning, risk assessment, equipment setup (particularly assembly and function testing of rebreathers), preparing the diver for the water, and in emergencies for which there is a planned response. A commonly used special case of a checklist in scuba diving is the decompression schedule for a planned dive profile.  Training, practice and experience  To make effective use of standard procedures, the diving team must be competent in the procedures, particularly the diving and emergency skills. These skill sets are the basis of the standard operating procedures, and have themselves been standardised to a degree where they are largely internationally accepted, and are portable between organisations without requiring much re-learning. A large part of the variation is connected to different equipment and equipment configurations, and operators need to become familiar with new equipment under controlled conditions before operating in the field. This is the realm of formal training for diving certification, which is normally done by registered diving schools and instructors, and equipment rating and familiarisation, which may be done by the employer or by diver training schools, depending on the risks and complexity of the training, and how much unfamiliar equipment is involved. For example, basic operation of an unfamiliar mode of life support equipment like surface supplied diving or a rebreather is likely to be learned at a school, while the details of operating a different model of non-diving equipment, like a hydraulic bolt-tensioner is likely to be learned from a skilled operator of that equipment, or at a manufacturer's familiarisation workshop. It is common practice to record such training and the associated assessment in the diver's logbook, as well as any certificate which may be issued. Appropriate response to minor life-support equipment malfunctions which can be corrected by the diver is very important for diving safety. The diver is expected to deal with a number of small problems promptly and correctly before the situation escalates. Dealing with such problems as a dislodged or flooded mask, or free- flowing regulator, or correctable buoyancy fault should be done before the situation deteriorates to an emergency. A basic understanding of the physics and physiology of diving should give the diver the ability to predict the consequences of possible responses to unfamiliar contingencies. A diver with inadequate understanding may respond inappropriately to an emergency outside of their training and experience, which though unlikely remains possible. Repeated practice beyond initial competence of standard responses to the more likely contingencies develops a \\"muscle memory\\" response, which helps the diver perform the correct response under stress, and when more than one problem occurs simultaneously. It is possible to never experience one of these problems, and some divers may never need the skills in practice, but divers who do not practice the skills are more likely to be overtaken by circumstances if something does go wrong. The practice of stress exposure training in controlled conditions, where the diver is task loaded with an increasing level of simulated problems and must deal with them, is thought to develop the diver's confidence in their ability to manage an emergency effectively, which may give them the ability to avoid panic and continue to respond usefully to the situation, giving a better chance of survival. Continued occasional practice of emergency procedures after initial training ensures that the skills are not lost due to lack of use. Divers who have not practiced their skills for several months or years are at higher risk of accidents when first returning to the water, and refresher courses and checkout dives in benign conditions are available to get the skills back to standard and thereby reduce risk of an accident. Personal protective equipment Surface-supplied commercial diving equipment on display at a trade show A shark bite resistant chain mail suit A large part of personal diving equipment can be classified as personal protective equipment. *Breathing apparatus *Exposure suits - Wetsuits, Dry suits, and hot-water suits provide thermal protection to the diver. Where thermal protection is not necessary, divers may wear overalls as protection against stings, cuts and abrasions which could be caused by contact with the environment. *Diving helmets provide thermal protection and impact protection for the diver's head. Neoprene hoods provide protection against high volume sound, often produced by the breathing apparatus, but also from other sources. *Gloves and boots serve similar functions underwater to those they provide at the surface. *Other more exotic personal protective equipment such as chain mail suits for protection against shark bites are occasionally used. Mitigation It is not usually possible to entirely eliminate risk to a diver, and where there is sufficient residual risk it is necessary to provide mitigation for the foreseeable consequences of an incident occurring. Emergency planning Professional divers may be legally obliged to make plans and provide equipment and personnel to manage reasonably foreseeable accidents. This can include a requirement for the contractor's operations manual to include instructions for the members of a dive team in the event of any of several classes of emergency, which may include managing an injured or unconscious diver underwater or at the surface, recovery of such diver from the water, provision of first aid, provision of recompression therapy in the case of decompression illness, communication with emergency services and the contracted diving medical practitioner on standby, decontaminating divers and emergency evacuation of the worksite. Specific checklists or flowcharts may be provided with emergency plans where they may be useful to ensure correct sequencing and that no critical stage is omitted. Recreational dive leaders such as divemasters and instructors may also be required to produce emergency plans for a dive site or area The contents may vary depending on location and access to assistance, and would contain the information necessary to handle reasonably foreseeable emergencies. Content may include contact details for local emergency medical care, a casualty evacuation plan, how to arrange emergency recompression and other diving specific emergencies, and what assistance can be expected from the local emergency services. Recreational, and particularly technical divers are recommended by certification agencies to have some form of emergency plan in case something goes wrong. The international organisation Divers Alert Network provides a hotline service giving advice on diving emergencies, and in the case of members, authorising and arranging emergency medical assistance and evacuation. Training to manage foreseeable incidents A large part of diver training is in the emergency procedures known to be effective at managing the most common incidents which could be life-threatening if not manages promptly and appropriately. The amount of overlearning and the level of skill required for certification varies considerably with the training standard for different certifications, but minimum standards for recreational diver and instructors have been established by the International Standards Organisation (ISO), and national and international standards for professional divers have been published by various controlling bodies. All of these standards include management of the most frequent diving emergencies by application of well established techniques, though not always by identical procedures. Emergency and rescue: procedures, personnel and equipment The diver should be able to manage a reasonably foreseeable and immediately life- threatening emergency unaided as there can be no guarantee that someone else will be near enough to help, will notice and will respond appropriately in time. Lower priority threats can be managed by teamwork and resource sharing. Since most of the critical safety skills for diving are not intuitive, nor associated with activities the diver is likely to have learned for other purposes, diver safety is enhanced by comprehensive training and frequent exercise of safety critical skills. One of the standard ways to help the diver to manage an emergency is to provide another diver ready to assist. In professional diving this is known as the stand-by diver, and in the case of bell diving, the bellman. In recreational diving, buddy diving and team diving procedures are intended to provide similar benefits, where each diver in a pair or team is stand-by diver to the other or others. This system can be effective when the divers are all adequately skilled, fit and dedicated to the task, as has been shown in many deep dives and cave penetrations. The buddy diver is less effective when insufficiently skilled, inattentive, or unfit. Buddy and team diving procedures impose a significant additional task loading on the divers, particularly in adverse conditions, such as darkness, low visibility, confined spaces, strong currents, cold water and unfamiliarity with each other's equipment and habits. Nevertheless, many recreational training agencies maintain that buddy diving is intrinsically safer than solo diving. Stand-by diver The stand by diver's job is to wait until something goes wrong, and then be sent in to sort it out. For this reason a stand by diver should be one of the best divers on the team regarding diving skills and strength, but does not have to be expert at the work skills for the specific job. The standby diver is usually required to remain ready for deployment at very short notice during the entire working dive, and will usually be fully dressed ready to deploy, except for helmet or mask. When deployed, the standby diver will normally follow the umbilical of the diver who is in trouble, as unless it has been severed, it will reliably lead to the correct diver. The standby diver must maintain communications with the supervisor throughout the dive and is expected to give a running commentary of progress so that the supervisor and surface crew know as much as possible what is happening and can plan accordingly, and must take the necessary steps to resolve incidents, which may involve supply of emergency air or locating and rescuing an injured or unconscious diver. In bell diving, the bellman is the standby diver, and may have to recover a distressed diver to the bell and give first aid if necessary and possible. The standby diver and working diver are generally interchangeable, unless specialised skills are required for the task of the specific dive, and professional divers are trained in rescue procedures appropriate to the equipment they are qualified to use. Rescue skills are not included in the minimum training standards for entry level recreational divers according to RSTC and ISO publications. Incident management In professional diving, the incident manager will be the supervisor, who should be trained and competent to handle procedures for the reasonably foreseeable incidents that may occur during diving operations for the range of diving operations they are licensed to control. The supervisor will advise and coordinate efforts by other participants until the affected diver or divers are handed over to a competent agency, or the casualty is assumed dead. The master of the vessel will be advised by the supervisor regarding safety of diving personnel, but remains responsible for the overall safety of the vessel and occupants. In recreational diving, the skipper of the dive boat is likely to be responsible for the safety of the divers on or near the boat, and to ensure that everyone who left the boat to dive is back on the boat before it leaves the site. Unless there is another person specifically appointed as responsible for incident management, the skipper will generally have this responsibility by default. Competence requirements for dive boat skippers will vary depending on the jurisdiction. There is no international standard. There is no specific post for incident management for recreational shore dives. If a diving instructor is involved they will have a duty of care for their learners, and may be the best qualified person to advise emergency services, but it is likely that any emergency services contacted will have to do their best according to their code of practice. Divers Alert Network will be available to advise on best practice if one of their clients is involved, and have been known to do so even when they have no direct involvement as a pro bono service. Buddy or team divers A Navy buddy diver team checking their gauges together A buddy or team diver is simultaneously the diver and the standby diver for the buddy or other members of the team. Since it is increasingly difficult to keep track of a larger number of divers, and the benefits of larger groups are small, teams are usually of three divers. Larger groups are generally split up into three diver teams and pairs. When using the buddy system, members of the group dive together and co-operate with each other, so that they can help or rescue each other in the event of an emergency. This is most effective if the divers are both competent in all the relevant skills and are sufficiently aware of the situation to be able to respond in time, which is a matter of both attitude and competence. In recreational diving, a pair of divers is usually the best combination in buddy diving; with threesomes, one of the divers can easily lose the attention of the other two. The system is likely to be effective in mitigating out-of-air emergencies, non-diving medical emergencies and entrapment in ropes or nets. When used with the buddy check it can help avoid the omission, misuse and failure of diving equipment. In technical diving activities such as cave diving, threesomes are considered an acceptable practice. This is usually referred to as team diving to distinguish it from buddy diving in pairs. When professional divers dive as buddy pairs their responsibility to each other is specified as part of the standard operating procedures, code of practice or governing legislation. Responsibility In professional diving the responsibilities of the participants are distributed according to their role in a project, and may be formally defined by legislation. The client is obliged to divulge any information they are aware of regarding hazards inherent in the site the work, or the equipment and materials they specify. The contractor is responsible for risk assessment, specifying the mode of diving and safe practices to be followed during the diving operations, and the supervisor is responsible for job safety, following the specified procedures and managing contingencies and incidents. The diver and other members of the dive team are responsible for carrying out the operations according to the prescribed procedures and for notifying the supervisor of any changes in circumstances that could affect team safety. The stand-by diver may be required to assist or rescue the working diver in the event of an emergency. The contracted diving medical practitioner will advise on occupational health issues during the planning, and will be available through live telecommunications to advise on treatment in the event of an injury. Recreational diving: *Recreational diving professionals - Instructors and professional dive leaders. As professional service providers diving instructors have a duty of care to their clients and contractual obligations to both the agency and the client, related to the training standards and their terms of registration with the diver certification agency with which they are registered. *Recreational divers are generally not members of the agency which issues their certification, and their responsibility for safety is often not specifically different from that of a non-diver citizen or tourist. There are a few countries where there are laws specifically relating to recreational diving, such as Israel and the Maldives. Analysis of incidents The incidents that are documented and analysed are usually those which lead to serious injury or death. Valuable understanding of the risks of diving can be derived from analysis of such incidents, but they are a small fraction of the potential learning opportunities because for each documented accident there are estimated to be possibly hundreds of undocumented near-misses. Cardiac events account for approximately 28% of diving fatalities. Approximately 60% of these had signs or symptoms that could later be identified as cardiac related before or during the dive, but chose to continue to dive. DAN data suggest that limited experience is associated with diving fatalities, with entry level divers and divers and divers certified for less than a year or with limited experience at the highest risk. Divers with very few dives in the previous year, and divers with a very large number of dives (>300) in the previous year are also high risk groups. In the first case due to lack of practice, and in the second case due to overconfidence in their proficiency. A high body mass index may correlate to the risk of a diving emergency becoming a fatality, which may indicate a lack of exercise tolerance that may reduce the ability to successfully manage an emergency. Root cause analysis of incidents shows four phases commonly present during the sequence of events leading to a fatality. These are: the trigger, the disabling agent, the disabling injury and the cause of death. Triggering events in decreasing order of frequency include running out of breathing gas, entrapment, equipment problems, rough conditions, trauma, buoyancy problems and breathing an inappropriate gas. Very few out-of gas incidents are a consequence of equipment malfunctions. Most divers might have survived if they managed their gas supply correctly. Ineffective gas management puts the divers, their buddies and any other diver in the vicinity at risk. Most entrapment fatalities involved an overhead environment, where the diver was unable to make a direct ascent to the surface. While in some circumstances it is possible to enter an overhead environment by accident, it is almost always intentional or due to lack of attention to the surroundings. The majority of the equipment failures leading to fatalities were not due to faults inherent in the equipment, but to improper use, incorrect configuration, poor maintenance or unfamiliarity with the equipment. It is more often the diver's response to equipment malfunction than the malfunction itself which results in injury or death. The triggering event, if not managed effectively, leads to a harmful action that exacerbates the situation, and the most commonly identified harmful action is an emergency ascent, which shows that most of the divers chose to try to escape to the surface instead of dealing with the problem underwater. The next stage of the cascade/sequence is an incapacitating injury, which prevents the diver from further efforts to control the incident, most commonly asphyxia, followed by the official cause of death as the final stage. In freediving and scuba diving this is usually found to be drowning. In an analysis of recreational closed circuit rebreather deaths between 1998 and 2010, a somewhat arbitrary risk rating for each dive was allocated: * low risk, for open water dives to depths not exceeding , where all checks and tests were done * moderate risk, for penetration dives to depths not exceeding , where all checks and tests were done, * intermediate risk, open water dives to depths between and , where all checks and tests were done * high risk, for penetration dives to depths between and , where all checks and tests were done, * extreme risk, for all dives to depths exceeding , or where checks and tests were not done, or alarms were ignored. When applied to the database this indicated that about two thirds of the deaths appear to be associated with high risk behaviour. The annual rebreather death rate of approximately 4 per 10 000 dives is approximately 10 times the rate for non-technical recreational scuba diving. Some deep diving problems have been associated with excessive work of breathing, which can reduce the capacity of the diver to deal with problems where physical exertion is required, and in extreme cases can be overwhelming even at low exertion levels.  Recreational diver and service provider perceptions  A survey on the perceptions of recreational divers and recreational diving service providers in 2018 showed that both groups considered the personal surface marker buoy and the dive computer to be the most important safety accessories. Dive centres also considered a backup mask, cutting tool, whistle and reel important, whereas divers generally did not. The most important safety aspect that should be provided by a diving service provider was considered to be breathing gas quality, followed by staff competence training provision ans availability of oxygen for first aid. Local availability of a recompression chamber was considered of lower importance, possibly because it is beyond the control of the diver or the service provider. Dive centres considered that recommendations of the instructors was an important factor in allocating buddy pairs. an opinion not shared by most divers. Both groups agreed that gender, age, family connection or existing friendship were not significant factors, and divers and service providers both considered experience, buoyancy skills and emergency skills important. Abour 30% of the dive centres had experience with scuba incidents and accidents, about 60% of them with decompression illness. Drowning and equipment failure each accounted for 11%, followed by boat accidents at 9%, and staff perceived these to be the highest risks. About 30% of divers had experience with a diving accident or incident, and about 60% had witnessed an accident or incident, including equipment failures and buddy separation, but also changes in weather conditions and interactions with dangerous animals. Divers considered the greatest risks as being lost at sea, decompression illness and equipment failure, and did not consider drowning or hazardous animals to be a high risk. The population sample was considered representative of the actual members of DAN Europe, being characterised by mostly middle aged males. The study focused on perceived risk, which does not necessarily correspond to actual risk, and the correlation between diver experience and risk perception was not investigated.

In the United States, it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use as a monotherapy and as a fixed dose combination with either sitagliptin or with metformin. In Europe, it was approved in March 2018, for use as a monotherapy or combination therapy. In September 2020, The New England Journal of Medicine reported that ertugliflozin was shown to be essentially non-inferior to placebo. The most common side effects are fungal infections of the vagina and other infections of the female reproductive system. Ertugliflozin is a sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor and is in the class of drugs known as gliflozins. A combination with metformin is marketed as Segluromet and a combination with sitagliptin is marketed as Steglujan. Contraindications Under the US approval, ertugliflozin is contraindicated for patients with severe kidney failure, end-stage renal disease, and dialysis. The European Union approval does not list any contraindications apart from hypersensitivity to the drug, which is standard for all drug approvals. Adverse effects Adverse effects in studies that were significantly more common under ertugliflozin than under placebo included mycosis of the genitals in both men and women, vaginal itch, increased urination, thirst, hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar), and weight loss under the higher dosing scheme. A rare but life-threatening side effect of gliflozins is ketoacidosis; it occurred in three patients (0.1%) in ertugliflozin studies. To lessen the risk of developing ketoacidosis (a serious condition in which the body produces high levels of blood acids called ketones) after surgery, the FDA has approved changes to the prescribing information for SGLT2 inhibitor diabetes medicines to recommend they be stopped temporarily before scheduled surgery. Ertugliflozin should be stopped at least four days before scheduled surgery. Symptoms of ketoacidosis include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tiredness, and trouble breathing. Overdose Up to sixfold clinical doses over two weeks, or 20-fold single doses, are tolerated by patients without any toxic effects. Interactions As with many diabetes drugs, combining ertugliflozin with insulin or insulin secretagogues (such as sulfonylureas) may result in an increased risk for low blood sugar. Combination with diuretics may result in a higher risk for dehydration and low blood pressure. No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions have been found in studies. Pharmacology Mechanism of action Pharmacokinetics After oral intake, ertugliflozin is practically completely absorbed from the gut and undergoes no relevant first-pass effect. Highest blood plasma concentrations are reached after one hour. When in circulation, 93.6% of the substance are bound to plasma proteins. Ertugliflocin is metabolised mainly to glucuronides by the enzymes UGT1A9 and UGT2B7. Cytochrome P450 enzymes play only a minor role in its metabolism. The elimination half-life is estimated to be 17 hours. 40.9% are eliminated via the feces (33.8% in unchanged form and 7.1% as metabolites) and 50.2% via the urine (1.5% unchanged and 48.7% as metabolites). The high proportion of unchanged substance in the feces is probably due to hydrolysis of the metabolites back to the parent substance.  Society and culture   Legal status  Ertugliflozin, ertugliflozin/metformin, and ertugliflozin/sitagliptin were approved for medical use in the United States in December 2019, and in European Union in March 2018.

Lieutenant Hector Munro, 8th laird of Novar who was a commissioned officer in the 34th (Cumberland) Regiment of Foot led the raid to capture the Jacobite rebel John Dubh Cameron who was later executed. Background In June 1753 another more important member of the Clan Cameron, Archibald Cameron of Lochiel, who was the clan chief's brother, had been captured and executed for having supported the Jacobite rising. John Dubh Cameron having no fixed abode and facing the consequences of having served in the French army and also of having supported the Jacobite rising, formed a party of freebooters, and took up his residence in the mountains between the counties of Perth, Inverness and Argyll. He carried on a system of spoliation by carrying off cattle that belonged to people he called his enemies, and also blackmailing people. In the aftermath of the Jacobite rising the district of Rannoch was described as being in a sad state with people starving and with the returning warriors having no option but to resort to thieving. There were soldiers who had been established at the Rannoch Barracks who were everywhere searching for the rebel leaders and trying to curb and capture the thieves. Lieutenant Hector Munro of Novar received special instructions to apprehend the rebel John Dubh Cameron who was better known as Sergeant Mor. Raid on Rannoch Lieutenant Munro marched a strong force of soldiers through Rannoch. Cameron had for a long time slept in a barn on the farm of Dunan in Rannoch, but he was betrayed one night while he was asleep in the barn, in the year 1753, although historian Alexander Mackenzie gives the year of 1754. Cameron was apprehended by a party of men led by Lieutenant Hector Munro. Cameron was a powerful man and shook off all of the soldiers who had hold of him and attempted to escape. However, he was overpowered by the remainder of the party who had stayed outside. Cameron was held at Rannoch Barracks, before being carried to Perth where he was tried for murder as well as for various acts of theft and cattle stealing. He was found guilty and executed at Perth on 23 November 1753. It was generally believed locally that Cameron had been betrayed by the man whose barn he had been sleeping in. Aftermath The man who had betrayed Cameron apparently had to flee the country. By 1754 peace was beginning to reign in Rannoch. Lieutenant Munro was also tasked with the apprehension of the Jacobite Ewen MacPherson of Cluny. However, in 1755, after nine years of playing hide and seek in the mountains of Badenoch, MacPherson managed to elude Munro's grasp and escaped to France.

Indigenous Australian literature is the fiction, plays, poems, essays and other works authored by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of Australia. While a letter written by Bennelong to Governor Arthur Phillip in 1796 is the first known work written in English by an Aboriginal person, David Unaipon was the first Aboriginal author to be published, in 1924–5. Since then, the number of published and recognised Indigenous authors has grown enormously; , AustLit's BlackWords lists 23,481 works, and 6,949 authors and organisations. Nearly all are in English, as Indigenous Australians had not written their languages before the colonisation of Australia. Few works have thus far been written in Aboriginal Australian languages, but with recent efforts at language revival, this is expected to grow. History At the point of the first colonisation, Indigenous Australians had not developed a system of writing, so the first literary accounts of Aboriginal people come from the journals of early European explorers, which contain descriptions of first contact. A letter to Governor Arthur Phillip written by Bennelong in 1796 is the first known work written in English by an Aboriginal person. While his father, James Unaipon (c.1835-1907), contributed to accounts of Ngarrindjeri mythology written by the missionary George Taplin in South Australia, David Unaipon (1872–1967) provided the first accounts of Aboriginal mythology written by an Aboriginal person, Legendary Tales of the Australian Aborigines (1924–5), and was the first Aboriginal author to be published. The Yirrkala bark petitions of 1963 are the first traditional Aboriginal document recognised by the Australian Parliament. Oodgeroo Noonuccal (1920–1993) was a famous Aboriginal poet, writer and rights activist credited with publishing the first Aboriginal book of verse: We Are Going (1964). Sally Morgan's 1987 memoir My Place brought Indigenous stories to wider notice. Contemporary literature Noel Pearson is an Aboriginal lawyer, rights activist and essayist. Wiradjuri writer and academic Anita Heiss has edited a collection of Aboriginal literature that spans from 1796 until 2008Macquarie PEN Anthology of Aboriginal Literature as well as a guide for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander writers.Dhuuluu- Yala: To Talk Straight Leading Aboriginal activists Marcia Langton (First Australians documentary TV series, 2008) and Noel Pearson (Up from the Mission, 2009) are contemporary contributors to Australian non-fiction. Other voices of Indigenous Australians include the playwright Jack Davis and Kevin Gilbert. Writers coming to prominence in the 21st century include Kim Scott, Alexis Wright, Kate Howarth, Tara June Winch, Yvette Holt and Anita Heiss. Indigenous authors who have won Australia's Miles Franklin Award include Kim Scott, who was joint winner (with Thea Astley) in 2000 for Benang and again in 2011 for That Deadman Dance. Alexis Wright won the award in 2007 for her novel Carpentaria. Melissa Lucashenko won the Miles Franklin Award in 2019 for her novel Too Much Lip. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women writers have also been well represented in the Stella Prize for writing by Australian women: the 2018 prize was awarded to Alexis Wright for her collective memoir, Tracker;Tracker and the shortlist has included Melissa Lucashenko’s Too Much Lip in 2019; Claire G. Coleman’s Terra Nullius in 2018; Ellen van Neerven’s Heat and Light in 2015; and Alexis Wright's The Swan Book in 2014.

It contains meropenem, a β-lactam antibiotic, and vaborbactam, a β-lactamase inhibitor. It is given by injection into a vein. Common side effects include headache, inflammation at the site of injection, nausea, diarrhea, liver inflammation, and low blood potassium. Severe side effects may include anaphylaxis, seizures, and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. It is unclear if use during pregnancy is safe. Meropenem works by blocking the construction of the bacterial cell wall while vaborbactam blocks the breakdown of meropenem by some β-lactamases. The combination was approved for medical use in the United States in 2017 and Europe in 2018. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Medical uses It is used to treat complicated urinary tract infections, complicated abdominal infections, and hospital- acquired pneumonia. In a study of 545 adults with complicated urinary tract infections, 98 percent of adults treated with Vabomere compared with about 94 percent of adults treated with piperacillin/tazobactam were cured defined as improvement in symptoms and a negative urine culture. About seven days after completing treatment, roughly 77 percent of adults treated with Vabomere compared with about 73 percent of those treated with piperacillin/tazobactam had resolved symptoms and a negative urine culture. Children Successful bacteremia clearance in a child has been reported using a meropenem- vaborbactam dose of 40 mg/kg every 6 hours given over 3 hours. It attained 100% of meropenem serum concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration for at least 40% of the dosing interval. Side effects The most common adverse reactions were headache, infusion site reactions and diarrhea. Serious risks include allergic reactions and seizures and Meropenem/vaborbactam should not be used in people with severe allergic reactions to penicillins. History Rempex Pharmaceuticals developed the drug. It was designated as a \\"qualified infectious disease product\\" under the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) title of the FDA Safety and Innovation Act and therefore received priority review. In August 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration approved it to treat complicated urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis.

History The Belmont brand is widespread throughout the world, being manufactured by various companies in numerous markets. It is especially popular in South and Central America. In Venezuela, it was introduced in the mid-1960s by \\"Cigarrera Biggott Sucre CA\\", where it became the most popular brand smoked in the early 1980s, holding some 62.4% of the market in 1982. Belmont is also produced in Guatemala (by \\"Tabacalera Nacional\\"), Panama (by \\"Tabacalera Istmena\\"), Honduras (by \\"Hondurena\\"), Nicaragua, and Costa Rica (where it was introduced by \\"Republic Tobacco\\" in 1982). It was also introduced in Finland by Amer-Tupakka circa 1975. In Finland, the cigarettes were manufactured by Philip Morris up to 2004 under an exclusive license from Amer tobacco Ltd., until the company gave up its tobacco business and began to concentrate on sports equipment under the name of Amer Sports. In Canada, Belmont was introduced in the early 1960s with a charcoal filter tip by \\"Benson & Hedges (Canada) Ltd.\\" (which became \\"Rothmans Benson & Hedges Ltd.\\" in 1986). The brand was renamed Belmont Milds in 1975, and remained so until 2007, when such terms on tobacco packaging were discontinued. An extra light version (known as Belmont Silver) was introduced around that time. In 2009, a slim version of Belmonts were introduced, called Belmont Edge. This brand has rarely (if ever) been promoted in traditional advertising. They are sold today as a premium brand. It was also produced in the United States briefly in the 1960s by Philip Morris USA. In 1990, before the implementation of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act, Philip Morris Australia launched a new brand, Belmont, to compete with Rothmans' Winfield, \\"to ensure a balanced aggressive portfolio entering the print ban era\\". Belmont’s launch plan was classic integrated marketing, combining press inserts, point-of-sale, distribution, and aggressive direct marketing by mail to Winfield smokers, as well as premiums in convenience stores and retail outlets as incentives for both retailers and customers. Thirty hostesses in hotels and clubs offered samples and trade-ups (a free pack of Belmont cigarettes for smokers in exchange for the pack of competitor brand being smoked), playing \\"a critical role within the tactical mix in gaining trial amongst targeted opposition smokers, building awareness and creating word of mouth communication\\". Reports on the brand’s launch were faxed directly to British American Tobacco (UK and Exports) and to Biggott, the Venezuela-based manufacturer of Belmont cigarettes, the main smuggled brand. As well, Belmonts were spotted in several stores in Serbia in June, 2009, with all English packaging. Advertising In Canada, Benson & Hedges (Canada) Ltd. created various poster advertisements in English and French to promote the Belmont brand. In the 1970s and 1980s, Franco Rubartelli produced various TV ads to promote Belmont cigarettes in Venezuela. The commercials focused on various young adults having fun at the beach, playing Cowboys and Indians and smoking Belmonts. The commercials mainly focused on the \\"mildness\\" of the cigarette. A TV ad was also made in the 1980s to promote Belmont in Brazil. Cigarette cards were included in Chilenian Belmont packs to announce a new pack design. Markets Belmont is sold in the following countries: Canada, Honduras, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Paraguay, Finland, Spain, Egypt, South Africa and Israel.

History The Broadsman was introduced by the British Rail in 1950. It provided a service between London Liverpool Street and Cromer, with through coaches for Sheringham. Initially the service was relatively leisurely, departing Cromer at 6.28am, travelling via Norwich with an arrival in London at 10.16am. The return was from London Liverpool Street at 3.40pm, arriving in Cromer at 7.15pm. In 1951, the service was improved by the introduction of Britannia class locomotives, and 26 minutes was cut from the schedule. In 1952, the service was further improved with speed increases on the section between Norwich and London, running Ipswich to Norwich, , in 45 minutes. On 4 December 1957 a car crashed into the level crossing gate at Salhouse railway station. The owner managed to remove the vehicle from the line, but the Broadsman hit the level crossing gate at 45 to 50 mph and uprooted a five-ton concrete post. The train was undamaged. The Great Eastern Main Line was upgraded in the 1960s with continuous welded rail, and diesel hauled services, and the named trains on this route lost their titles in 1962.

Sold as a yearling for 1.7 million guineas he showed very good form as a two-year-old in 2000 when he won two of his three races including the Group 1 National Stakes. He was sidelined for a year by injury, but returned in the autumn of 2001 to take a strong edition of the Joel Stakes. He was retired at the end of the year to become a breeding stallion and stood in Ireland and Australia but made little impact as a sire of winners. Background Beckett was a bay horse with no white markings bred in Ireland by the County Kilkenny- based Ballygallon Stud. As a yearling in September 1999 the colt was consigned to the Tattersalls Houghton sale where he was bought for 1.7 million guineas by Dermot \\"Demi\\" O'Byrne acting on behalf of John Magnier's Coolmore Stud organisation. He was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. During his track career he was officially owned in partnership by Magnier's wife Susan and Michael Tabor. His sire Fairy King, who was full-brother to Sadler's Wells, failed to win a race after being injured on his debut, but sired the winners of over five-hundred races, including Helissio, Falbrav, Turtle Island and Oath. Beckett's dam Groom Order wan unraced but came from a good family, being closely related to Exclusive and Entrepreneur. Racing career 2000: two-year-old season On 14 June Beckett began his racing career in a maiden race over six furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse in which he started the 2/5 favourite and won \\"comfortably\\" by one and a half lengths from America Calling after leading from the start. The colt was moved up in class for the Group 3 Futurity Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh in August in which he was made the 6/1 fourth choice in the betting in a seven- runner field headed by his more fancied stablemate Bonnard. Ridden by Seamie Heffernan, he tracked the leaders before taking the lead a furlong out but was overtaken in the final tride and finished third, beate half a length and a short head by Lady Lahar and Bonnard. On 17 September the colt was ridden by Heffernan again when he stepped up to Group 1 level for the National Stakes on yielding ground over the same course and distance. His stablemate Darwin started the 4/9 favourite ahead of Down To The Woods and Bonnard with Beckett next in the betting on 10/1. The other five runners included King's County (yet another O'Brien trainee), Berlin (third in the Anglesey Stakes) and the Dermot Weld-trained Elbader. Heffernan positioned the colt just behind the leaders as Down To The Woods set the early pace from King's County, but began to make progress two furlongs from the finish. Beckett went to the front approaching the final furlong and drew away in the closing stages to win by three lengths from King's County with the outsider March King staying on to take third. After the race Aidan O'Brien said \\"I think Beckett is a potential 2,000 Guineas horse. He's a lovely mover but he was able to handle the ground this time. He's got a great pedigree... You can't beat blood\\", while Heffernan commented \\"Beckett loved the ground. He relaxed very well for me and then picked up nicely when I said go\\". 2001: three-year-old season Training problems kept Beckett off the racecourse for the spring and summer of 2001. After an absence of a year he returned in the Listed Solonaway Stakes over one mile at the Curragh on 15 September. Starting the 7/4 favourite he took the lead approaching the last quarter mile but was overtaken inside the final furlong and beaten a head by Magic Cove. On 4 October the colt was sent to England and was made 3/1 favourite for the Joel Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse where his opponents included Malhub, Swallow Flight (Royal Windsor Stakes),Priors Lodge (City of York Stakes) and Lincoln Dancer (Sandy Lane Stakes). Ridden by Mick Kinane, he took the lead from the start and was ever headed, staying on well in the closing stages to win by three quarters of a length from Priors Lodge. Aidan O'Brien commented \\"the plan was to come here and then return for the Champion Stakes. That remains the same. He gets a mile really well and I think a lot of him\\". Sixteen days later at the same track, Beckett returned to Group 1 level for the Champion Stakes, as O'Brien had predicted. He led for the first seven furlongs before dropping out of contention and finishing tenth of the twelve runners in a race won by Nayef. Stud record At the end of his racing career, Beckett was retired to become a breeding stallion in Ireland. In 2004 he was relocated to Independent Stallions Victoria near Echuca in Australia. He sired numerous minor winners both on the flat and over jumps but no top-class performers.

This included soldiers located at Signal Hill, Fort William, and Fort Townshend. It was suspected that as many as eighty soldiers planned to meet and mutiny against the British Army. Outcome The British Army captured all of the members of the uprising except the two ring leaders leading to capital punishment for some of them. Aftermath The uprising left several implications for the Irish and for British governance of Newfoundland. It was the first time such an uprising had occurred in Newfoundland and the British feared it would not be the last occurrence. The British officials in the Colonial Office considered Newfoundland to have a reputation as a \\"Transatlantic Tipperary\\", a distant but semi-Irish colony with the potential for political turbulence.

Born into a family with origins in the French district of Tarascon,Marco Taddia, La crisi dell'università, come la vedeva Pascal (Ernesto), Scienza in Rete, November 2010 Mario Pascal was the son of the mathematician Ernesto Pascal, brother of the mathematician Alberto Pascal, and nephew of the Latinist Carlo Pascal. Mario Pascal studied mathematics at the University of Naples, where he received his laurea in 1919. He was an assistant in rational mechanics to Roberto Marcolongo and then became at the Istituto Superiore Navale a libero docente in rational mechanics and then a professore incaricato. He then became a professore incaricato at the Accademia Aeronautica of Caserta and there shortly before his death in 1949 was appointed a full professor. His death was due to an illness contracted during WW I. He dealt almost exclusively with mechanics, especially fluid mechanics, attempting with very limited success to extend the Kutta-Joukowski theorem to three dimensions of space.Necr.: Atti Acc.

It leads from Parkstraße in the east to Trappentreustraße in the west. It was named after the Munich patrician family Tulbeck in 1878. From this family came the Freising Prince-Bishop Johann IV Tulbeck (term: 1453-1473).  Location  The Tulbeckstraße is located in the district Schwanthalerhöhe and is lies in the Westend of the district. This is a classic working-class district with cooperative buildings from around 1900. The Tulbeckstraße is centrally located in the district and runs in the west–east direction over a length of more than 700 meters. The northern parallel road is the Schwanthalerstraße and the Westendstraße, the southern parallel road is the Gollierstraße with the Gollierplatz.  Route  The Tulbeckstraße branches off to the east from Parkstraße and unlike the Gollierstraße, has no connection to the Theresienhöhe. It flows into the west at the height of the Trappentreutunnel on the Trappentreustraße. The Tulbeckstraße is dominated by rental houses, which are numbered from east to west from 1 to 57 and 2 to 52. The eastern of the street, the rental houses are dominated by a Neo-Renaissance style (1882–1889) and in the West mainly by German Renaissance and Art Nouveau style (1901–1924).  History  In 1862, the Drexler barrel factory settled on the site and held the address of Westendstraße 95. A road formed at its southern end, named Tulbeckstraße since 1878, and was gradually built from east to west.  Cartography  The street is completely depicted in the 14th edition, from 1891, of the Brockhaus Konversations-Lexikon and already shown to be built past the Bergmannstraße.  Road access  There is no direct connection of Tulbeckstraße to public transportation. The nearest underground stations are Schwanthalerhöhe and Heimeranplatz. The Heimeranplatz station is connected to the S-Bahn network next to the nearby Munich Donnersbergerbrücke station. The bus line 134/53 can be reached via the Schwanthalerhöhe stop, the 133/53 bus line via the Gollierplatz stop and the tram line 18/19 via the Schrenkstraße stop.  Historical buildings  Between 1880 and 1890, four-storey apartment buildings of medium to low standard were built along Tulbeckstraße. These had open courtyards and low surrounding buildings, which were mostly occupied by commercial businesses. These buildings include, among others, the five houses built by the Catholic Workers 'Association Munich-West, founded in 1888, in Ganghofer- / Tulbeckstraße as a workers' home. In 1911/12, the housing complexes were built with the house numbers 41 to 51, which had been commissioned by the construction cooperative Munich-West. Since the late 1970s, the Tulbeckstraße was extensively integrated into the urban renewal of the Westend. A total of 23 built historical buildings between 1882 and 1924, are located directly on the Tulbeckstraße, and mainly in the style of the Neo- Renaissance, German Renaissance and Art Nouveau.

In the oil & gas industry, the term walnut shell filter is common since black walnuts are most often used. Typically nut shell filters are designed for loadings under 100 mg/L oil and 100 mg/L suspended solids and operate with 90–95% removal efficiency.Howdeshell, Mike, Chris Catalanotto, and Eric Lorge. \\"Walnut Shell Fitler Reuse Potential.\\" 2011 Saudi Arabian Water Environment Association (SAWEA). http://www.sawea.org/pdf/Mike_Howdeshell.pdf High oil and solids loadings reduce run times between backwashes and results in reduced effluent quality.  Design  A bed of nut shell media is contained in a vessel. Vessels are typically vertical, but may also be horizontal. Particles are captured as flow penetrates through the media bed. Although it is possible to use other medias for this purpose, walnut and pecan shells are most commonly used since they have several desirable properties making them well suited for oil removal. First, nut shells are hard with a high modulus of elasticity, resulting in a low attrition rate and minimal media replacement, typically <5% per year. Nut shells also have an equal affinity for water and oil, allowing oil to be adsorbed during normal operation, but also enable oil removed from the bed during agitation allowing for media reuse.Felch, Chad, et al. \\"Water treatment apparatus incorporating walnut shell filter media and a draft tube system.\\" US Patent 9,580,335. During normal operation, water typically flows down through the media bed where oil is coalesced and attracted to the nut shells and accumulates in the interstitial spaces between the media.Kashaev, Slava and Douglas Lee. \\"Deep Bed Nutshell Filter Evolution.\\" 20th Annual Produced Water Seminar. 2010. Typical nut shell media is 12/20 (0.8 to 1.7 mm) and 12/16 mesh (1.2 to 1.7 mm). Although not designed for solids removal, an added benefit is that solids accumulate in the bed. As solids are collected, the differential pressure across the bed increases. Walnut shell media Periodical backwashes are initiated to regenerate the media. Typically, backwash is triggered by one of the following: * Differential pressure * Timer (often 24 hours) * Operator initiated (often due to exceeding limit for effluent quality) Backwash occurs through mechanical agitation such as * Backwash through draft tube * Backwash through external media scrubber * Mechanical mixer If backwash is not sufficient, oil can cause media to agglomerate, known as mudballing. Typical flux of nut shell filters is 7 to 27 gpm/ft2.Catalanotto, Chris. \\"Walnut Shell Filter Raises Flux for On-shore and Off-shore Produced Water Treatment.\\" Industrial Water Treatment. January/February 2012. Commercial vessels are sized to accommodate the flow rate of water and range up to 14 feet in diameter. For continuous operation, multiple vessels are frequently used so flow can continue to be treated while backwash occurs in one vessel. For large flows, several vessels may be used. Unlike some oil / water separators, no chemicals are required for oil removal in nut shell filters.  Uses  Nut shell filters were designed to separate crude oil from oilfield produced water in the 1970s, which remains the principal use. Nut shell filters can be used onshore and offshore, but are more common onshore where the treatment requirements are typically more stringent and footprint is not limited. Nut shell filters are used for tertiary treatment following primary and secondary treatment which removes the bulk of the oil and suspended solids. Typically, effluent is reinjected for reuse or disposal or discharged to a surface body of water.

His work has appeared in Wired, Atlantic, Scientific American, the Guardian, the Washington Post, and Time. He is author of the book Not a Scientist: How Politicians Mistake, Misrepresent, and Utterly Mangle Science.  Life  Levitan graduated with a degree in Journalism from Haverford College in 2003. He attained his MA Journalism from NYU's Science, Health and Environmental Reporting Program (class of 2008-2009). He has been an active contributor to the \\"William E Burrows Science, Health and Environmental Reporting Scholarship Fund\\" at NYU since 2012. Levitan worked as a freelance science writer with FactCheck.org in 2015, and was hired to track the errors made by politicians discussing science. Since 2009 he has been active on Twitter as @davelevitan, where he describes himself as a \\"Journalist, mostly science and politics\\". He is married and lives with his wife, Jamie, outside Philadelphia.  Work  Levitan has written for more than 50 mainstream press outlets and medical trade publications and has had his work republished by USA Today and Huffington Post, among others. His work in journalism has been both prolific and far-ranging within the intersections of science, health, the environment and politics. In 2010 he wrote an article for Technology Review on sustainable energy and smart grids. In 2018 he wrote an article for Cancer Network entitled \\"Can Surgery Type Predict Opioid Abuse in SCLC?\\" In 2012, he wrote a piece discussing the Red Sea–Dead Sea water conveyance system, a plan to pipe water from the Red Sea to the dead sea in an effort to save the Dead Sea. This approach was opposed by conservationists. In the same year he wrote an article for Gizmodo entitled: \\"After extensive mathematical modeling, scientist declares \\"Earth is F**ked\\"\\" In 2013, he wrote an article for Scientific American on the stagnation in primary scientific funding within the NIH. This had led to severe financial crises within organisations such as the Marine Biological Laboratory, Massachusetts, where Levitan had spent time as a teenager involved in research on squid. Several of his articles focused on the governmental position of science advisor to the president of the United States. In 2017, he wrote an article for \\"The Atlantic\\" in which he presented the origin and history of the position of science adviser, dating back to President Truman. In late 2016 he interviewed John Holdren for Wired. Holdren had served as senior science and technology advisor to President Barack Obama. The interview touched on the attitudes towards science held by several presidents, including George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Donald Trump..

Thomas was sentenced to death for a 1992 murder in Torrance, California, and for the 1993 murders of Kevin Michael Burrell and James Wayne MacDonald, two officers in the Compton Police Department, who were shot dead during a traffic stop in the City of Compton. They were the only Compton police officers killed in the line of duty in the department's 65-year history. Background Thomas was born on June 16, 1970. He was the oldest of four children and grew up in South-Central Los Angeles. He was a member of the Bounty Hunter Bloods street gang, a Bloods subset based out of Watts, Los Angeles, California. Thomas was convicted of perjury in 1990. He had once worked at a liquor store as a security guard, but the building was burned down during the 1992 Los Angeles riots, resulting in Thomas being out of work for a year. Murders On January 31, 1992, Thomas murdered Carlos Adkins in an apartment in Torrance by shooting him. Over a year later, on the night of February 22, 1993, at about 11 p.m., Compton Police Officer Kevin Michael Burrell, 29, and Reserve Officer James Wayne MacDonald, 24, made a routine traffic stop in Compton, at the intersection of Rosecrans Avenue and Dwight Avenue, on a red 1992 Chevrolet 454 pickup truck being driven by Thomas. As the officers exited their patrol car and approached the pickup truck, Thomas exited his vehicle and opened fire on both officers. Both officers were knocked down to the ground by bullet wounds to their limbs. According to trial testimony, Thomas shot at their heads execution-style. Both officers were wearing bulletproof vests and were found lying face down near their patrol car with their guns holstered. There were nine spent nine- millimeter shell casings in front of the patrol car. Burrell died of multiple gunshot wounds to the arm, face, left foot, and head. MacDonald was also shot four times, in his left armpit, middle back, upper back, and behind the right ear, and died of a gunshot wound to the chest. After the shootings Thomas returned to his truck and drove away. Trial Neither officer had notified dispatchers to report the traffic stop or request a background check on the truck's license plates. Detectives initially worked under the assumption that there were at least two assailants in the truck. Both Burrell and MacDonald were armed, but neither had even been given a chance to draw their gun. MacDonald, a Compton native, and Burrell, a 5-year police veteran, were the first police officers killed on duty in the history of the Compton police force. MacDonald was killed during his last ever shift as a volunteer reserve officer on the Compton force. A massive manhunt ensued after the officers' deaths, which led to five arrests in other cases, solving three murders and two attempted killings. Compton police officers Timothy M. Brennan and Robert Ladd were a part of the task force that was formed in the wake of the murders that ultimately led to the arrest and conviction of Thomas. Thomas was captured on April 6, 1993, when he surrendered to a broadcast news reporter. He was found guilty of the murders and was sentenced to death on August 15, 1995. He is currently on death row awaiting execution and is imprisoned at San Quentin State Prison. His CDCR number is J76200.

Anne de Graville or Anne Malet de Graville (c.1490–c.1540) was a French Renaissance poet, translator, book collector, and lady-in-waiting to Queen Claude of France. She hailed from one of the most prominent families in the country, and overcame scandal to become a well respected literary figure at the royal court. In addition to authoring two texts, she was an avid collector of books and manuscripts.  Early life  Anne was born around 1490 into the Malet de Graville family, one of the most wealthy and prestigious families in France. She was the youngest daughter of three surviving girls Louise, Jeanne and Anne. Both of her brothers died early. Her father, the admiral who served three kings in his lifetime, and her mother Marie de Balsac raised her at the family estate not far from Paris, the Chateau of Marcoussis.Notice SIEFAR estate where the future king Francis 1 enjoyed hunting: 49\\\\. There Anne received a classical education and learned to read and write in French, Italian, and Latin. She had access to her father's expansive library for her studies and would become an avid bibliophile and book collector herself. It is said that she was very beautiful with blond hair and dark eyes. She had a beautiful singing voice for which she was celebrated at court.:54-56. The Château of Marcoussy (or Montagu) where Anne was raised.  Marriage  Around 1507, Pierre de Balsac d'Entragues, the son of and cousin to Anne on her mother's side, fell in love with her. He arranged a kidnapping (apparently with her consent) from the Chateau de Marcoussis. They married secretly, around 1508. Because of her marriage, Anne incurred her father’s disappointment and wrath; he sued the couple, leading to lengthy lawsuits and disinheritance. The chaplain of Louis de Graville intervened to reconcile Anne with her father in return for a renunciation of her inheritance, a fixed sum of money and an annual pension. At her father’s death in 1516 she sued the estate and regained her third of the inheritance after her father’s death. After 1518 Anne and Pierre were awarded their part of her father’s possessions, including domains in Normandy and central France, a grand house in Paris, and most importantly, a large portion of Louis Malet de Graville’s extensive library, which she would further develop with her own acquisitions.  Life at Court  Not long after her marriage, Anne de Graville served at the court of Queen Claude of France, eldest daughter of Louis XII and Anne of Brittany; Claude became the wife of the future Francis I in 1514, the year before he ascended the throne. Anne was likely as her maid of honor. Queen Claude's court was notable for its austere and respectable modes of life which contrasted with the promiscuous ways of her husband. She created and dedicated several texts to the queen during her tenure there, from 1515-1524. After the death of the Queen Claude in 1524, Anne moved to her husband's estates to raise her family. During this time she became a confidant of Francis I's sister, princess and poet Marguerite de Navarre.ARLIMA Like the princess, Anne became interested in religious reform and even sheltered several Reformation exiles.  Mottos  *Musas natura, lacrymas fortuna (From Nature, Muses, but from Fortune tears), formulated from the circumstances of her life in which she was blessed by Nature with the literary inspiration of the Muses, but cursed by Fortune and her father to hardship and tears. *J'en garde un leal (I keep a loyal one), an anagram of her name, that probably refers to her beloved husband.  Literary works  La belle dame sans mercy This work, produced probably before 1525, is the major reason for Anne de Graville's inclusion in the history of French literature. The collection of seventy-one rondeaux were revised from the poem originally written by Alain Chartier in 1425, updating the narrative and neutral octosyllabic form of Alain’s poem to a lyrical and courtly form of rondeaux.leftThe text of the poems are preserved in a single manuscript housed at the French National Library (Bibliothèque nationale de France) in Paris with the shelf mark of français 2253. The dialogue between Lover and Lady reflects a softening of the attitude of the Lady toward her pleading courtier, rendering it more acceptable to a Renaissance audience. A modern edition was published by Carl Wahlund in 1897. Le beau roman des deux amans Palamon & Arcita et de la belle et sage Emilia \\"translaté de vieil langaige et prose en nouveau et rime par madamoiselle Anne de Graville la Mallet, dame du Boys Maslesherbes, du commandement de la Royne\\" (1521). This \\"translated\\" tale was adapted from the Teseida délie Nozze d'Emilia of Italian author Giovanni Boccaccio. This Italian work also inspired Chaucer's \\"Knight's Tale\\". Anne's story tells of the amorous rivalry between Palamon and Arcite, former best friends, who both wish to earn the hand of Emily. The younger sister of Hippolyta, queen of the Amazons. Emily has accompanied her sister and the victorious Theseus to Athens where they witness the dueling between the two rivals. Arcite wins the duel, but then dies tragically from his wounds before the couple can marry. Theseus advises Emily to wed Palamon in order the make the best of the tragic situation.Anne de Graville, Histoire de Palamon et Archita, France, circa 1518-24, inv. 513. Bibliothèque Condé.

It is dedicated to the history of Hungarian civil aviation, featuring almost all aircraft types used by the now-defunct national airline Malév. Aeropark also has a flight simulator for visitors and a gift shop with plane models and various Malév-memorabilia. Most of the planes of Aeropark are accessible for visitors with wheelchairs. Aeropark is a regular participant in the annual event Long Night of Museums. History The history of Aeropark (originally Ferihegy Aircraft Park; Ferenc Liszt Airport was named Ferihegy International Airport then) goes back to February 23, 1988 when Hungary received an Ilyushin Il-14T aircraft from the Soviet army, to be exhibited. István Veress, director general of the Hungarian Technical and Transportation Museum and Tamás Erdei, head of Aviation and Airport Directorate (LRI), announced the foundation of an aircraft museum. The three planes of the museum, the Il-14, an Ilyushin Il-18 and a Tupolev Tu-134 were originally placed in the airport proper, next to Malév's hangar. Ferihegy Aircraft Park opened in 1991 in a new place, between runway 31L and the 2B terminal building; the three planes were towed to their new places in October, and a Tesla landing radar was added to the collection. The planes and other equipment became property of the Transportation Museum, while preserving and exhibiting them was done by LRI. The latter was divided into two companies (Budapest Airport and HungaroControl) in 2002. Neither LRI nor its successor Budapest Airport was able to expand the collection. In 2003 Budapest Airport got rid of all its divisions which were not essential to running the airport itself, including the museum. It supported the creation of a foundation which took over the management of the museum. The Cultural Foundation for Ferihegy Aircraft Park managed the museum between 2004 and 2014, when it was taken over by a nonprofit organization named Aviation Cultural Center. The organization, founded in 2010, aims to preserve and exhibit aircraft and other mementoes of Hungarian aviation. The museum uses its current name, Aeropark since June 19, 2014. In early 2017 the museum temporarily closed down while it was relocated to a nearby site. The move was necessitated by the expansion of the parking lot. Relocation started on March 23, the museum opened again in the beginning of June. The exhibition Li-2 HA-LIQ ;Lisunov Li-2 (HA-LIQ) Lisunov Li-2 played an important role in Hungarian aviation, as it was the first type of passenger aircraft operated by Maszovlet and then its successor Malév. HA-LIQ arrived in Hungary on March 27, 1952 where it was first owned by the Hungarian Air Force (1954-1957) then by Malév where it received a civilian registration mark but continued to use its green military livery. After 1958 Malév used it as a cargo aircraft. In 1964 Malév returned it to the army where it got its military registration number (206) back, and was used until 1974. Its total flight time is 3829 hours. After being written off, it was donated to the Transport Museum. It was restored in 1980 and stood in storage at Farkashegy Airport. It was moved to the aircraft museum in 1993. Its interior is completely restored, and can be visited during events. Il-14T HA-MAL ;Ilyushin Il-14T (HA-MAL) This Il-14 originally belonged to the 226th Independent Mixed Aviation Regiment, of the Southern Army Group of the Soviet Red Army. In 1981 it was withdrawn from service and stored for six years in Mirhorod (today in Ukraine), then in Tököl Airport, Hungary. In late 1987 it was flown to Ferihegy where it became the first plane of the newly founded aviation museum. Since then it was moved twice, in 1991 and in 2017, when the museum moved to a new place. Its total flight time is 5928 hours. In 2009-2010 it has been restored. Originally it was only planned to be repainted in period Malév livery (while this specific plane has never been owned by Malév, the airline had Il-14 planes in its fleet), but since the plane was in a very good condition even after 25 years of disuse, repairs were done on both engines and visitors can watch them being started once a month. Il-18-V HA-MOA ;Ilyushin Il-18V (HA-MOA) This Il-18 plane arrived in Hungary in 1960, and soon started to fly regular Malév routes, the first one to Moscow. It was subject to several overhauls which converted it into the more modern Il-18V variant. In 1964 it received a TG-16 auxiliary power unit, in 1968 its original engines were replaced by Ivchenko AI-20 engines, later this year it was reconfigured from an 89-seat plane into a 105-seat one. Its last flight as a passenger plane was from Prague to Budapest on April 1, 1977, exactly 17 years after its arrival in the fleet. It was converted into a cargo aircraft, was withdrawn from service in 1987 and given to the museum in October 1991, as one of the first three planes in its collection. Its total flight time is 37,197 hours. Its interior, including the cockpit, is open to visitors. Il–18V HA-MOG ;Ilyushin Il-18V (HA-MOG) This Il-18V arrived in Hungary in 1964. Unlike the previous one, it was not an overhauled Il-18 but a newly built Il-18V. Its first passenger flight was to Moscow. In 1967 its original engines were replaced with AI-20K engines. Its last passenger flight was in late 1978 between Sofia and Budapest, then it was converted into a cargo aircraft. Its last cargo flight was in October 1988 between Constantine, Algeria and Budapest. The next day one of its engines was damaged by a fire and the plane, which was planned to be written off in December, was written off after the fire. Between 1993 and 2006 it was used by Malév for training. In 2006 a petition was started against the demolition of the plane, and it was moved to the aviation museum. Its exterior was restored in June 2014, but the interior continues to be in a bad condition. Its total flight time is 36,558 hours. ;Tupolev Tu-134 (HA-LBE) This Tupolev Tu-134 arrived in Malév's fleet in 1969. Its first flight as a passenger plane was to Prague. In 1983, with the addition of a Comfort class the 72-seater plane was reconfigured as a 68-seater. Its last flight was from Warsaw-Okęcie Airport in 1987. In 1988 it was the first Tu-134 of Malév to be withdrawn from service; the next year it became one of the first three planes of the aviation museum. It is the oldest extant Tu-134 in Hungary, as the three older ones all perished in accidents. Its total flight time is 24,167 hours. Its interior, including the cockpit, can be visited. Tu-154B-2 HA-LCG ;Tupolev Tu-154B-2 (HA-LCG) This Tupolev Tu-154B arrived in Malév's fleet in late 1975. In 1980 it went through an overhaul, and was converted into a CAT-II category aircraft (154B-2). In 1983, with the addition of a Comfort class it was reconfigured as a 143-seater. Its last flight was from Heraklion International Airport. It was towed to the aviation museum in 1994. Its total flight time is 21,554 hours. Its interior, including the cockpit, can be visited. Yak-40 HA-YLR ;Yakovlev Yak–40E (HA- YLR) This Yakovlev Yak-40 plane arrived in Hungary in late 1975. It was ordered by LRI and was used to test and authenticate navigation equipment both in Hungary and abroad. It has never flown as a passenger aircraft. In 1987 it was repainted in the same livery as the Tu-134; it was painted in its current livery in 1993. In 2001 it was towed to the aviation museum. The plane is airworthy, in an excellent condition. Its interior can be visited during events. ;Antonov An-2M (HA-MHI) This Antonov An-2 arrived in Hungary in late 1967 and was used as an agricultural aircraft. It was withdrawn from service and given to the aviation museum in 1994 where it was restored in 2005. ;Mil Mi–2 (HA-BCB) This Mil Mi-2 helicopter was used by the Hungarian Air Ambulance from January 1980. Until 1994 it was stationed in Székesfehérvár; in August 1994 it was flown to Ferihegy for repairs, but due to a lack of funds it was withdrawn from service. Its total flight time is 2841. It was towed to the aviation museum in 1999. ;Tesla PAR A Tesla precision approach radar was placed next to taxiway B of runway 13R/31L in January 1975. In the same month it was severely damaged by Malév's Ilyushin Il-18 (HA-MOH), arriving from Berlin and crashing next to the taxiway. The PAR was repaired and used until the early 1990s, then given to the aviation museum in 1991.

It depicts his first use of Sensory Percussion, a set of sensors created by drummer Tlacael Esparza where drum hits send MIDI data to virtual instruments. Fox used Sensory Percussion as a way to become flexible with his drumming skills and combine his interests in electronic music with drumming. The album was recorded in Brooklyn in six days and also features instrumental performances from Curtis Santiago, Michael Beharie, Maria Kim Grand, and Justin Frye. The LP garnered favorable reviews from music journalists upon its release. Production and composition The press release from RVNG Intl. explains The Gradual Progression \\"focuses less on [Greg Fox's] drumming and more on its untapped potential as one element in a polyphonic unity\\" and is intended to \\"externaliz[e] his polyrhythmic virtuosity into non-physical realms\\" and \\"activate spiritual states through physical means.\\" To do this as well as have other sounds perform with the same \\"intensity and vibrancy\\" as Fox's drumming, all of the tracks were produced in what RVNG Intl. labeled as the musical form of action painting. The Gradual Progression is the first album where Fox recorded with Sensory Percussion, a set of sensors created by drummer Tlacael Esparza. He used the beta version of the device that was given to him by Esparza before its official build was released for public consumption. He placed the sensors on his drum kit for it to serve as a MIDI controller triggering sounds on modular synthesizers and virtual instruments he programmed on Ableton.Joyce, Collin (September 14, 2017). \\"Greg Fox’s Cyborg Drum Compositions Feel Impossible\\". Noisey. Vice Media. Retrieved December 26, 2017. On \\"By Virtue of Emptiness,\\" each drum was responsible for the note performance of six virtual instruments, including a drum loop being played via the hits of the snare and kick drums, low-frequency bass sounds being triggered by the kick drum, and a high-pitched note being played when the \\"middle of the snare\\" is hit. The virtual instrument sounds he used on the album includes material he recorded on his own, such as his friends playing the note of an instrument or street field recordings, and sound effects and foley he pirated off the internet.Stousy, Brandon (October 2, 2017). \\"Greg Fox on doing things on your own\\".

He wanted to use the sensor device as a way to combine his love for drumming with electronic music, as well as have complete flexibility in his craft and not worry about copying the skill of other drummers. He noticed that using Sensory Percussion \\"started to take on an architectural quality and an environmental quality,\\" and the drums served as a \\"blanket\\" to reveal the \\"invisible sculpture[s]\\" that was being made by the virtual instruments.\\" Despite the free-style-esque performance on the album, the songs were not improvised, but rather composed via what Fox labeled \\"virtual scaffolding,\\" a technique that departed from the \\"liner\\" method of writing compositions and was like composing in \\"virtual reality.\\" Composition of the tracks took place at the non-profit place Pioneer Works for weeks.

One or two players traverse procedurally generated levels using several characters, including Sam \\"Serious\\" Stone, the protagonist of the Serious Sam series. The screen scrolls vertically as the player character runs backwards and shoots at enemies approaching from the bottom of the screen. The player can use two weapons, a melee attack, and an \\"ultimate\\" ability. The weapons can be exchanged through collectables, the melee attack destroys parts of the destructible environment and deflect projectiles, and the ultimate ability requires the prior defeat of several enemies. Binx Interactive initially developed a mobile driving game and presented a prototype of it to Croteam. After receiving and quickly implementing suggested changes, the studio began communicating with Croteam frequently and later joined the Croteam Incubator programme. Croteam offered Binx Interactive to use the Serious Sam franchise for the project, which was soon renamed Serious Sam: I Hate Running Backwards and then simply I Hate Running Backwards. A publishing deal with Devolver Digital was reached in 2017, and the game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in May 2018 as the first Croteam Incubator game. The release was followed by a Linux version in June 2018 and a Nintendo Switch port that October. I Hate Running Backwards was met with a mixed reception. The game's control interface and arsenal were well received, while the visual style and character unlock system raised conflicting opinions. The game's slow pace, repetitiveness, and inconsistencies in difficulty between runs were criticised, although some of these issues were resolved through later patches.  Gameplay  I Hate Running Backwards is a shoot 'em up game, although the developers use the term \\"shoot 'em down\\". The player chooses from one of several player characters, some of whom were taken from the Serious Sam, Broforce, Hotline Miami, Enter the Gungeon, Nuclear Throne and Shadow Warrior franchises, including Serious Sams protagonist, Sam \\"Serious\\" Stone. The initial roster consists of three characters, while further are unlocked through in-game progress. All characters have varying weapon loadouts, health, speed, and \\"ultimate\\" abilities. The player character traverses procedurally generated levels of five thematic environments, occasionally using vehicles. The screen continuously scrolls vertically, as the character runs backwards. The player can move the character freely on the screen, although the downward aim is static. The character wields two ranged weapons that can be switched between at any time. Running out of ammunition for the primary weapon reverts it to a pistol with unlimited ammunition. Further weapons and special abilities can be obtained through collectables. Using a melee attack, the character can deflect enemies' projectiles, as well as destroy nearby enemies and elements of the destructible environment. The attack can be used again after a cooldown. The ultimate ability requires filling a meter by killing enemies. Enemies, most of them from the Serious Sam series, approach from the bottom of the screen. A boss appears at the end of each environment, of which the final one, Ugh-Zan, has two phases. Defeating a boss unlocks a shortcut to the environment thereafter. After each boss and before the start of a run, the initial weapon loadout can be chosen, where later selection stages provide stronger weapons. I Hate Running Backwards can also be played cooperatively with a second local player. In this mode, more enemies spawn and bosses have more health. If either player character dies, they respawn after 30 seconds if the other stays alive.

When the studio was founded in 2014, its employees had little knowledge of game development and no funding, wherefore many worked second jobs at other local developers and provided quality assurance to other studios, which often made for 15-hour workdays. Binx Interactive initially created mobile games, although titles such as Follow the Leader and Point the Way, Josh! were cancelled due to a lack of resources. The studio's debut game was Monster Loops, which it co- developed with the Serbian studio Mad Head Games for iOS. In April 2016, while exhibiting Monster Loops at the Reboot Develop conference in Split, members of Binx Interactive approached Damjan Mravunac, the composer from Croteam, with a prototype of a mobile driving game. This prototype, created by two Binx Interactive employees in their free time, involved tapping the touchscreen to make a car turn 45°, as well as drifting and spinning actions. Mravunac suggested several changes, which the team delivered three days later. Stemming from this encounter, Binx Interactive and Croteam communicated weekly and, after approximately a month, Croteam suggested that Binx Interactive build a game in the Serious Sam universe. Within a month, the team reworked the game with elements from the Serious Sam franchise and presented a prototype to Croteam, which greenlit the project. In 2017, Croteam arranged a publishing deal for the game with Devolver Digital, which had published several of Croteam's previous games, including Serious Sam titles. This partnership was announced with a trailer in August that year. Around this time, the project was named Serious Sam: I Hate Running Backwards, later shortened to I Hate Running Backwards. The name was taken from the quote \\"Oh man, I hate running backwards\\", issued by Sam \\"Serious\\" Stone–the protagonist of the series–after travelling long distances in reverse. Croteam and Devolver Digital lent Binx Interactive creative control in the development, only sometimes giving advice. I Hate Running Backwards was created using the Unity engine by six full-time employees and one part-time worker. Among them were chief executive officer Bernard Bachrach, visual effects artist and designer Filip Kovač, 2D/3D artist and designer Matko Šimecki, programmer Nikola Đurinec, and programmer and studio co-director Denis Mraović, as well as Luka Mihaldinec, who created promotional artwork. In March 2018, Croteam announced that its business incubator programme would be known as Croteam Incubator, with I Hate Running Backwards to be the first release under that banner. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on 22 May 2018. A trailer announcing this date had been released earlier that month. A Linux version was postponed for additional testing before being released on 28 June 2018. A port for Nintendo Switch was initially scheduled for \\"late summer\\" 2018 and was released on 19 October. The developers also considered bringing the game to iOS. Following the initial release, Binx Interactive released multiple patches for I Hate Running Backwards. In a February 2019 questions-and-answers session, the team stated that development had concluded so that Binx Interactive could focus on future projects.  Reception  I Hate Running Backwards was named among the best games exhibited at the PAX East trade show by GamesRadar+ in April 2018. Upon release, the game received \\"mixed or average reviews\\", according to review aggregator website Metacritic. Peter Glagowski of Destructoid commended the simple control interface and fixed line of fire, which he found made the game more navigable. However, he and Julia Gomez of Nintendo World Report faulted the procedural generation, including inconsistent placements of collectables and enemies, for causing difficulty imbalances between runs. Furthermore, Glagowski lamented that the progress required to unlock characters was unclear, while Gomez considered them a good reward system. Robert Purchese of Eurogamer and David Hollingworth of PC PowerPlay enjoyed the \\"bright\\" graphical style of I Hate Running Backwards. Conversely, Ángel Llamas of IGNs Spanish outlet found the visuals \\"chaotic\\" with many enemies on-screen. Llamas liked the expansiveness of the available arsenal, and Purchese labelled the weapons as \\"imaginative\\". While Hollingworth and Gomez lauded the ease of repeatedly commencing a run in the game, Llamas considered the game repetitive in longer sessions and regarded it better suited for mobile platforms. Glagowski deemed the game's slow pace as its biggest problem and criticised that the shortcuts were not saved between restarts of the game. He later said that several of his complaints, in particular those regarding the pace and shortcuts, were resolved by a patch.

Her father was a Justice of the Peace and when he found her reading a book that he thought lightweight he encouraged her to learn by reading books about the law. She married James Docwra and he died in 1672. She was a Quaker minister and the local Quakers met at her house from 1672. In 1680 she gave the Quakers a 1,000 year lease on a yard in Jesus Lane in Cambridge. There is still (2017) a meeting house there which traces its foundation back to 1650. However the current building dates, in part, to 1777 as the meeting house has been rebuilt several times. The Quakers in the 1680s were having discussions about the right way to conduct their church. For instance there were separate meetings for men and women. This was an idea that she objected to and she had some (financial) influence. In 1682 she published A looking-glass for the recorder and justices of the peace and grand juries for the town and county of Cambridge which appealed for tolerance.Mullett, M. (2004-09-23).

At 21:50 Flight 4 was instructed to maintain flight at an altitude of . After flying en route, the flight encountered towering cumulus clouds with tops too high to safely fly above them. After receiving permission from the controller the crew avoided the clouds before changing altitude as directed by the air traffic controller. While at an altitude of , the crew requested permission to increase altitude to avoid more cumulus clouds. The air traffic controller gave the flight permission to fly at until passing Arkhara where it was to decrease altitude to . At the clouds were still present so the flight was given permission to climb to . At 22:12 the flight reported passing an altitude of and that stars were visible. At 22:14 the captain reported reaching the altitude of . The flight crew stated they saw intense cumulus clouds ahead and would return to Khabarovsk if they could not avoid the clouds. At 22:18 the controller contacted Flight 4 but an agitated voice only replied \\"one minute, one minute\\". The second attempt at communications at 22:19 was met with the same response, but Flight 4 did not respond to any later calls. Sometime between 22:20 and 22:25 the aircraft crashed into a dense forest northwest of Khabarovsk airport, impacting the ground at an angle of 60°, leaving a wide debris field. All 64 people on board were killed in the crash.  Investigation  Investigation showed that the aircraft remained intact until it crashed into the forest, ruling out a decompression. Two Tupolev Tu-16 bombers flying approximately north of the route of flight 4 between reported the presence of strong updrafts within cumulonimbus clouds. The weight of the Tu-104 at takeoff was 66 tons, which limited the maximum safe altitude for flight to be at standard engine power; altitudes of could only be safely achieved by the Tu-104 in calm weather. Weather conditions in the Birobidzhan - Arkhara - Magdagachi region were more complex than the description received by the crew described, with cumulonimbus clouds reaching altitudes of over . In attempts to avoid the clouds the airliner increased altitude to levels unsafe for the aircraft at the current weight, and combined with the updrafts present in the clouds, the aircraft stalled, during which the engines flamed out and the landing gear was extended. The failure of the engines and disorientation of the crew, from accompanied failure of the artificial horizons, rendered recovery nearly impossible. Secondary causes of the accident were cited as follows: # Failure of the air traffic controllers and the pilot in command to thoroughly analyse weather conditions at the time, causing the flight to fly into dangerous weather in violation of the flight manual. # The three hour and 35 minutes delay of the departure of the flight from Khabarovsk, during which weather conditions deteriorated considerably. # Insufficient preparation for departure on part of the navigators. # The weather forecast provided to the flight crew did not specify the maximum altitude of the clouds. # There were no clear indicators for the maximum safe altitude of the Tu-104 with the given takeoff weight. # There were no defined procedures in place in the event of a stall. Later accidents demonstrated that when a Tu-104 flew in certain atmospheric conditions, both clear weather and near thunderstorms, the aircraft was prone to losing longitudinal stability, that could be followed by the landing gear dropping, engine failure, and artificial horizon failure. At the time, the issues with the Tu-104's low stall speed facilitated by weak mechanization of the wing and the other mechanical issues mentioned were not well known.

It refers to a range of different levels of dialects: local, national, cultured and formal.  Arabic language  There are different forms of Arabic: * Classical Arabic, the language of the Quran and of all the literature of the first centuries of Hegira (from 622 AD) * Modern Standard Arabic (the fuṣḥah, in Arabic: فصحى), the contemporary standard language taught in schools and used in journalistic prose, in written administrative texts, in mass media and in universities. * Dialectal Arabic, the set of dialects used in everyday communication, outside the written and formal situations that varies not only from one Arabic country to another but also from one region to another within the individual states.  Diglossia and dialectal variety  Due to the coexistence of the Modern Standard Arabic (high language) and the dialect (low language), we can speak about diglossia of the Arabic language. The United Arab Emirates, extending over a total area of about 83,000 km² and hosting more than 200 different nationalities, represent one of the nations with the largest aggregation of ethnic groups in the world. Archaeological excavations have shown that in this area several Semitic races were established. It follows that the spoken language, the emirate dialect, includes some different dialectal shades. It represents the communication tool used by the overwhelming majority of the population, although people of good cultural level are able to express themselves in official Arabic. Notwithstanding the recent filling up of urban areas to the detriment of rural ones has led to a growing decrease in local dialectal variations, we can still identify three main areas of different shades of the Emirate dialect: Abu Dhabi (including Al-'Ayn, the western region and islands), the Northern Emirates (including Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm al- Quwain and part of Ras al-Khaimah) and the East Coast (including Fujairah, Khawr Fakkan, and the remainder of Ras al-Khaimah). To give a practical example, the \\"mob\\" negation should be mentioned with its variations: \\"mesh\\" in Abu Dhabi, \\"mob\\" in the Northern Emirates and \\"ma\\" in the East Coast. Furthermore, the unification of the United Arab Emirates has contributed to making changes to the locally spoken dialect. The Emirates have in fact become residence for expats (not just Arabs) who often make up the majority of \\"operating\\" workers. Therefore, it has been necessary to identify a more standard method of communication. As a result, the Emirate dialect has received influences from other Arabic dialects and foreign languages. For example, words from the technical language have often an English origin and have arrived in the Persian Gulf through interchanges with the Indian population, and then have been adapted to an Arabic pronunciation. For example, \\"draywel\\" is the local declination of the English word \\"driver\\" and \\"motar\\" derives from the English word \\"motor\\" and means \\"car\\". Moreover, in the spoken emiratate language it is common to substitute some letters with others of similar sound: the \\"j\\" can become \\"y\\"; the \\"k\\" can become \\"ch\\"; the \\"q\\" can become \\"g\\" or \\"j\\". {  English Standard Modern Arabic Emirate dialect - Chicken da-jaaj di-yaay - Fish sa-mak si- mach - Coffee qah-wa gah-wa - Near qa-rib jirib } There is also a guide book for the Arabic dialect of the Emirates, Spoken Emirati, and an Italian version, Dialetto Emiratino, edited by Nico de Corato together with Hanan Al Fardan and Abdulla Al Kaabi, authors of the original English version.

It premiered on 9 January 2018, replacing Pega Pega, and ended on 30 July 2018. Created by Daniel Adjafre, it has artistic direction by Fabrício Mamberti, with the intention to capitalize on the success of Game of Thrones. It stars Marina Ruy Barbosa, Bruna Marquezine, Rômulo Estrela, Ricardo Pereira, Johnny Massaro, Caio Blat, José Fidalgo, Tatá Werneck, and Special Participations Rosamaria Murtinho, Marco Nanini. Production Casting Agatha Moreira had been chosen as Amália's interpreter but was replaced by Marina Ruy Barbosa after Rede Globo reassigned actors scaled initially to O Sétimo Guardião by Aguinaldo Silva, which was later cancelled after controversy over plagiarism. Renato Góes was initially cast as Afonso, but left during the production stage and was replaced by Rômulo Estrela. Set design The Alhambra castle inspired the castles designed in the telenovela. Originally planned that part of the cast would be sent to Europe to begin principal photography, the Globo management judged that, with the inflated high value of the euro, together with all the expenses that come with it in all the sectors in Brazil, it would exceed the estimated budget. Only the recording and effects team was sent out of the country to capture aerial scenes of the woods and mountains to be superimposed on scenes recorded in the Projac studios in Brazil. In March 2017, the recording crew traveled to Spain, Scotland and Iceland to capture the external scenes, as in ancient castles and historically preserved villages. The scenographic city was set up in the Globo Studios, in Rio de Janeiro, with a total of 1,8 thousand square meters. Scenes that were supposed to look external were actually filmed by chroma keying the images taken in Europe were digitally added, including forests, villages and pastures. Plot The medieval plot presents the fictional kingdoms of Montemor and Artena. The kingdoms have an agreement to supply water, which is scarce in Montemor but is abundant in Artena. In return, Montemor supplies ore to Artena. This agreement lasts until the death of the queen of Montemor, Crisélia (Rosamaria Murtinho), that will shake the peace between the kingdoms. Afonso (Rômulo Estrela) is the crown prince of Montemor and, from a child, was created to assume the throne; honoured and fair, he is the opposite of his younger brother—the irresponsible and inconsequential Rodolfo (Johnny Massaro), who only thinks about stewardship. After falling in love with a plebeian Amália (Marina Ruy Barbosa), of Artena, Afonso abdicates the throne, giving it to his unprepared brother. This makes relations with the neighbouring kingdom even more fragile. This will open the opportunity for Catarina (Bruna Marquezine) to expand her ambitious plans in Montemor. She is the spoiled and ambitious princess and daughter of the wise and benevolent King Augusto (Marco Nanini), of Artena. Cast { class=\\" !Actor !!

The surface of the lake extends into the townships of Roy, McKenzie, and Obalski. Recreational tourism activities are the main economic activities of the sector; the mining industry, second. The hydrographic slope of \\"Lac aux Dorés\\" is accessible on the west side by the forest road route 167 (linking Chibougamau to Saint-Félicien, Quebec), coming from the South, and connecting with route 113 (connecting Lebel-sur-Quévillon via Chapais.

The surface of \\"Lac aux Dorés\\" is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however, safe ice circulation is generally from mid-November to mid- April.  Geography  Toponymy During the passage in this sector in 1870, a mining prospecting team, James Richardson then makes a summary description of this lake, without designating it toponymically. At the beginning of the 20th century, gangs of the Cree community began to settle in the area. In 1901, surveyor Henry O'Sullivan wrote that this picturesque, gently sloping watercourse is surrounded by high mountains to the north and east. A few years later, several deposits of ore, copper, silver and gold were identified. As early as 1914, a publication reporting \\"Lac Doré\\" pointed out that its denomination is associated with the main species of fish that was fished there. Especially since the 1930s and 1940s, the town of Chibougamau has developed a few kilometers to the northwest. Several mining sites have been exploited around the lake.

In addition to the appeal, Wu Gan petitioned the Chinese judiciary to ask that the National People's Congress either amend or nullify subversion-related charges and punishments as stipulated by article 105 of the nation's Criminal Law. On 8 November 2018, while he was in prison, all of the 30,277 tweets made by Wu Gan between November 2009 and May 2015 (up to when he was arrested and so stopped tweeting) were deleted by a bot. Wu's father, Xu Xiaoshun (), visited his son at Qingliu Prison in Fujian in early March 2019, and reported that Wu Gan was suffering from poor health and a possible spinal injury due to the mistreatment and torture he had suffered while in pre-trial detention.

It was released on 20 October 2017, via Inside Out Music. Apart from the regular edition, the album was released on special editions including a CD digipak and a gatefold 2LP + CD (including etching on side D). Band leader and vocalist Anneke van Giersbergen viewed past collaborator Devin Townsend as an influence on the album. Marcela Bovio was initially going to act as secondary vocalist for the album, but left the band mid-production due to divergences about the direction the vocals should take.  Song information  All songs on the album are inspired by cities visited by van Giersbergen during her years of touring. The cities involved are: Berlin, Rotterdam, Beirut, San Francisco, Rio, London, Santiago, Mexico City, Helsinki, Istanbul and Paris. According to van Giersbergen: On 8 September 2017, a video for the opening track \\"My Champion – Berlin\\" was released. Commenting on this particular track, van Giersbergen said that it \\"serves as a kind of master of ceremonies. It's both heavy and melodic, it showcases the technical abilities of the band, but you can still sing along to it. [...] This song is about Berlin after World War II. The goddess on the Berlin Victory Column was raised to commemorate military victories, but in the song the city speaks to her and is asking her for help to overcome troubled times\\". The song was composed by guitarist Jord Otto. \\"The Fire – San Francisco\\" talks about people's lives before, during and after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The track \\"Days Go By – London\\" talks about the Great Fire of London from the perspective of the fire itself, although it is also a song about hope. It was the first song to be written for the album.  Critical reception  The album received mixed to positive reviews by critics, with most reviewers praising van Giersbergen's performance, but some criticizing the songwriting. Angry Metal Guy's GardensTale pointed some problems like an underrepresented bass and an \\"attempt at a wall of sound during the episodes of triumphant grandeur [that] limit the dynamics\\", but ended up calling the album \\"truly excellent\\" and considered it perhaps \\"the heaviest music she has put out to date\\". In a review for The Prog Report, Craig Ellis Bacon praised the album's heaviness and the individual performances of van Giersbergen and drummer Ed Warby, as well as the album's production. He concluded by saying the album is \\"a wonderful debut that finds a \\"new\\" band in full swing right from the get-go\\". Writing for Echoes and Dust, Michael Baker was less enthusiastic about the release. Although he praised van Giersbergen's performance, he felt \\"the songs themselves don't quite make it to those heights. Throughout VUUR you can hear moments of Devin Townsend and Arjen Lucassen of Ayreon, but there is a feeling of a lack of confidence that means Vuur often take the safer well trod path that ultimately means the songs never hit their stride. They are never heavy or progressive enough to stand out or melodic and catchy enough to work as arena filling power ballads\\". He ultimately called the band's debut \\"competent but frustrating\\". On Prog, Alex Lynham commented that \\"for all the talent here, ultimately the record drags. Several album tracks are overlong and similar, and despite the vocal hooks and deft musicianship, there's a lack of 'wow' moments. The LP is at its best when it veers closest to the kind of cinematic metal that the Devin Townsend Project ply their trade in [...]. Overall, this is a promising start, but one that hopefully will see the band developing in a unique direction on future releases\\".

It is marked by two 120’ high silos, built in 1950 as part of the Brazos Valley Cotton Oil Company. The Brazos Valley Cotton Oil Mill Company closed in 1958, and the silos ceased to serve as storage in the 1990s. The grounds opened to the public in October, 2015. The complex is owned by Chip and Joanna Gaines, TV personalities best known for HGTV's Fixer Upper TV series. The Gaineses completely transformed the Waco landmark, which helped to change the city as well as many surrounding areas. The success of the “Silos”, as the site is affectionately called, has had a positive effect on the city of Waco. The Dolton area has begun to blossom, and the restaurant scene has exploded. Combine that with the fact that tour buses are now seen daily, and it is easy to see the effect that the Silos are having on the entire city. The Silos, Waco, TX The grounds include a 12,000 sq. ft. retail store located in the historic grain barn and office building, a food truck park with picnic tables, a garden store, bakery, and lawn area. Admission to the grounds is free except during special events. In 2016, its first full year of operation, Magnolia Market reported an estimated 1.9 million visitors. Special events are held regularly at the complex, including Spring at the Silos (March), Silobration (October) , and Christmas at the Silos. Events include concerts, vendor booths, and other activities. In 2019, it was announced that Magnolia Market is undergoing a $10.4 million expansion. The expansion plans include adding new shops and public spaces to the two-block area anchored by the Silos. Attractions include a whiffle ball field, more shops, and gardens, as well as the relocation of the historic Waco Church to the 4.9 acre site.

Formal definition  Let C be a category with finite products and a terminal object 1. A list object over an object of C is: # an object , # a morphism : 1 → , and # a morphism : × → such that for any object of ' with maps : 1 → and : × → , there exists a unique : → such that the following diagram commutes: A commutative diagram expressing the equations in the definition of a list object where〈id, 〉denotes the arrow induced by the universal property of the product when applied to id (the identity on ) and . The notation * (à la Kleene star) is sometimes used to denote lists over .  Equivalent definitions  In a category with a terminal object 1, binary coproducts (denoted by +), and binary products (denoted by ×), a list object over can be defined as the initial algebra of the endofunctor that acts on objects by ↦ 1 + ( × ) and on arrows by ↦ [id1,〈id, 〉].Philip Wadler: Recursive types for free! University of Glasgow, July 1998. Draft.  Examples  * In Set, the category of sets, list objects over a set are simply finite lists with elements drawn from . In this case, picks out the empty list and corresponds to appending an element to the head of the list. * In the calculus of inductive constructions or similar type theories with inductive types (or heuristically, even strongly typed functional languages such as Haskell), lists are types defined by two constructors, nil and cons, which correspond to and , respectively. The recursion principle for lists guarantees they have the expected universal property.  Properties  Like all constructions defined by a universal property, lists over an object are unique up to canonical isomorphism. The object 1 (lists over the terminal object) has the universal property of a natural number object. In any category with lists, one can define the length of a list to be the unique morphism : → 1 which makes the following diagram commute: A commutative diagram expressing the equations in the definition of the length of a list object  References  *  See also  * Natural number object * F-algebra * Initial algebra Category:Objects (category theory) Category:Topos theory ","title":"List object"},{"id":"56140149","text":"Ubergsmoen is a village in Vegårshei municipality in Aust-Agder county, Norway.

It was based in part on a short story called The Silver Mask by Hugh Walpole. It was produced frequently on the summer theater circuit. The play has been adapted for film twice by MGM: as the December 1935 film Kind Lady and the 1951 film Kind Lady.  Characters and plot  An elderly, aristocratic woman living in London is victimized by a team of diabolically clever con artists. They initially play on her sympathy to gain her trust, then manage to alienate her family and friends, nearly convincing them that she has lost her mind. They manage to then lock her in her bedroom, selling off her furniture and paintings all the while from the rest of her apartment. The protagonist nearly loses both her property and her sanity, but exerts a supreme effort of courage and skill in this intense battle of wits.Roberts, Jerry (2003). \\"The Great American Playwrights on the Screen: A Critical Guide\\" Hal Leonard Corporation. 2003.

In Terraforming Mars, players take the role of corporations working together to terraform the planet Mars by raising the temperature, adding oxygen to the atmosphere, covering the planet's surface with water and creating plant and animal life. Players compete to earn the most victory points, which are measured by their contribution to terraforming and to human infrastructure. Players accomplish these goals by collecting income and resources which allow them to play various projects, represented by cards (drawn from a deck of over 200 unique cards), which increase their income or resources or directly contribute to terraforming the planet or building infrastructure. The game has been well received by fans and critics, winning or being nominated for multiple awards and accolades. Gameplay A game of Terraforming Mars that has just been completed Players represent competing corporations who all have a stake in terraforming Mars. The game board depicts the planet's surface, which is represented by an array of 61 contiguous hexes. Each hex represents about 1% of Mars' surface area. Onto these hexes, players can place oceans, greenery, cities and other special features. The object of the game is for players to complete three terraforming conditions: raise the atmosphere's oxygen level to 14%; raise the temperature from -30 to +8 degrees Celsius; and cover 9% of Mars' surface by ocean (represented in-game as having 9 ocean tiles placed on Mars). Players accomplish these goals by playing cards that represent various technologies or buildings used to terraform Mars. The game is played over a number of generations, each represented as one game round. A generation begins with players drawing cards, then players take turns performing actions (which can be playing cards, using the ability of a card already in play or paying for one of the several actions depicted on the board). Once all players have finished taking actions, players collect income and resources according to their production of the different resources, then the next generation begins. One of the unique aspects in Terraforming Mars is the Terraforming Rating (TR) system. Whenever a player performs an action that advances one of the terraforming conditions, the player's TR increases. A player's TR not only represents the victory points they have earned during the game, but is also added to a player's money income when collecting income and resources at the end of each generation. The game ends at the end of any generation when the three terraforming conditions have been met. Then, players count up their points, which come from their TR at the end of the game, cities and greeneries that they have placed on Mars, achievements they have claimed during the game and cards they have played, and the player with the highest score wins. Expansions Five expansions have been released: * Hellas and Elysium (2017), which adds a new double-sided board representing two new regions of Mars, with each region having its own terrain layout and end-game achievements * Venus Next (2017), which adds a new side-board representing Venus as a new terraforming opportunity and new Venus-related cards for the deck * Prelude (2018), which adds Prelude cards that players take during setup to jump-start their production and terraforming * Colonies (2018), which adds areas around the solar system for players to colonize and travel to, providing alternative ways of getting resources without having to play cards * Turmoil (2019), which adds a Martian government with several political factions, each with their own agendas, which players can influence to gain various bonuses A legacy variant and a dice game are being developed and are expected to be released in 2020 or 2021. Video game adaptation A video game adaptation of Terraforming Mars, developed by Asmodee Digital, was released in October 2018. Matt Thrower of Strategy Gamer considered the adaptation to have \\"too many rough edges to recommend\\". However, in a list of Best Board Games On PC from the same site he later revised this opinion, saying \\"developer Asmodee Digital has stepped up the plate with a host of updates. And while the interface remains a bit obtuse, the game itself is shining as it should.\\" Reception Popular Mechanics named Terraforming Mars as one of its 50 best games of the year. Polygon named Terraforming Mars its runner up for best game of 2016 and best strategy game of 2016, Ars Technica listed the game as one of its 20 best games of 2016, and Vulture called it \\"the best high strategy game of 2016.\\" The game was nominated for the 2017 Kennerspiel des Jahres award for best strategy game of the year. As of 2019, Terraforming Mars is ranked 3rd among all board games on BoardGameGeek. Hellas and Elysium and Venus Next were the two runners-up for the Golden Geek award for the best expansion to a game in 2017. Prelude has been received very well by critics for speeding up the beginning phase of the game, by giving each player extra abilities at the start of the game.

Early Life  Her parents were the Major General Heinrich Wilhelm Kurt von Knobelsdorff (born April 13, 1850) and Marie Elizabeth Fancis Gertrud Dyhrenfurth (born September 17, 1856).  Education  In 1906, Elisabeth von Knobelsdorff graduated from the Munich Realgymnasium. In 1907, she began studying architecture at the TH Charlottenburg, first as a guest student, after the admission of women at the universities in the Kingdom of Prussia in 1909. She finished her studies in 1911, as the first woman in Germany with the diploma in engineering.  Career  In 1912, she became the first female member of the Association of Architects and Engineers in Berlin (AIV) and took part in the exhibition \\"The Woman in Home and Work\\", a showcase of the women's movement. The organizers of this exhibition included her aunt Gertrud Dyrenfurth (1862-1946), who lived on the estate of the family in Jakobsdorf near Wroclaw. Elisabeth von Knobelsdorff designed a community center for the Silesian village, which was built in 1915. It remained until 1946, the social center of Jakobsdorf. In World War I, she worked as a \\"field architect in the rank of lieutenant\\" in the military building administration in Doberitz near Potsdam, and at the German Army High Command in occupied Belgium. After World War I, she worked as an architect at the provincial government in Potsdam. In 1921, she passed the state examination for the building authority, and was again appointed as the first woman in Germany, master builder for the government. In 1922, she married Kurt Wilhelm Viktor von Tippelskirch, Legation manager in the Foreign Office, and was then released in 1923 (as married) from the civil service. She then worked freelance as an architect in Berlin-Charlottenburg, until she accompanied her husband to the United States in 1927. After returning in 1938, the couple lived in Jakobsdorf, from where she was expelled at the end of World War II. Elisabeth von Knobelsdorff lived in Bassum near Bremen from 1946 until her death in 1959.

It is located in the village of Myra. It is the church for the Vegårshei parish which is part of the Aust-Nedenes prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Agder og Telemark. The white, wooden, cruciform church was built in a Louis XVI style in 1808 by the architect Knud Torkildsen Skjerkholt. The church seats about 350 people. It was consecrated on 19 August 1810 and it replaced an older church that was built during the 1600s. History There has been a church in Vegårshei for centuries. It was first mentioned in existing historical records in the 1400s and again in 1505. In 1667, a new church was built. During this time, the church was an annex church to the parish of Gjerstad. The peasants in the parish purchased the church from the King in 1723 and during the next 40-50 years they made many improvements to the building. Despite this, by the early 1800s, the church was in poor shape. A new church was commissioned to replace it and Knud Skjerkholt was hired to lead the construction. The Dean Krogh from Arendal came to the church on 19 August 1810 to consecrate the new building. The tower originally stood in the centre of the cross-shaped roof, but in 1863 the cross was moved to the top of the western cross-arm over the main entrance to the building. A major interior renovation happened in 1902 where the floors and benches were replaced and paneling covered the interior walls. The changes were considered quite drastic and after about 30 years, they were all undone and the interior was restored to the original look.

It has a single tubular, green leaf and up to fifty brownish and white or greenish and white flowers crowded in a cylinder-shaped spike. Description Prasophyllum spicatum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single tube-shaped leaf, long and wide at its purplish base. Between ten and fifty flowers are crowded along a cylindrical flowering spike long, reaching to a height of . The flowers are brownish and white or greenish and white, wide and wide. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The ovary is oval-shaped and long. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped to lance-shaped, long and wide. The lateral sepals are a similar length to the dorsal sepal but slightly narrower and are free from each other. The petals are white, long, about wide and have crinkled edges. The labellum is white, long, wide, turns upwards and has a very wavy and crinkled edge. There is a thin, yellow, channelled callus in the centre of the labellum and extending just past the bend. Flowering occurs from October to December. Taxonomy and naming Prasophyllum spicatum was first formally described in 1991 by Robert Bates and David Jones from a specimen collected near Dergholm State Park and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (spicatum) is a Latin word meaning \\"in a spike\\" referring the dense flower spike of this species. Distribution and habitat The dense leek orchid grows in near-coastal heath between Mount Gambier in eastern South Australia and Wilsons Promontory in south-eastern Victoria, although it is absent from the Otway district. Conservation Only eight populations of P. spicatum are known, with a total population of about 80 plants. Accurate determination of population size is difficult because of the sometimes dense heath where the orchid grows and its tendency to flower more often after fire. The species is listed as \\"Vulnerable\\" under the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act and the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988. It is listed as \\"Endangered\\" under the South Australian National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972.

The invitation to sing at the \\"Junior Golden Stag Festival\\" contest followed, also in 2010. \\"In front of the audience, Mihai Trăistariu, who was president of the judging panel, admitted that he was impressed by the way Teodora sang and awarded her the \\"Revelation of the Festival\\" prize. Also, composer Dan Dimitriu invited her to perform a few songs at this year's (2010) Junior Golden Stag competition\\", according to Mihaela Sava, the singer's mother.  Musical and vocal performances  Her cover songs performed at a very young age at the TV show for kids Next Star 2013 (Listen and One Moment in Time) had many positive reactions from people that were watching her for the first time. One of the judges, the hip hop and pop singer Connect-R, even invited her to sing at his own wedding. Right after that show, she took the offer of recording an original song, called \\"Belief\\". For years, while still a child, her songs reached a mature audience. The songs she performs are shown on her YouTube channel. Various Romanian musicians define Teodora Sava as having a constancy in the accurate and seemingly effortless performance of difficult songs with a powerful and well-controlled voice, a native ease of employing melodious melismas and high notes, a pleasant vibrato and a noteworthy vocal range. Thus, singer Pepe, judge of the Next Star show, said in a show that Teodora Sava was the best voice in all the Next Star seasons, Florin Ristei (winner of Season 3 of X Factor Romania) said that Teodora Sava was \\"the best guest of the 15 Te cunosc de undeva! gala shows so far\\" and artist Ozana Barabancea told her after her duet in the previously mentioned show: \\"I applaud Teodora with all my heart. I know your record. You have an extraordinary and very well launched voice, very well supported, because you are flutist at Piatra-Neamţ High School of Arts, so you are a professional musician. That matters a lot, and for those who do not know, breathing for a flute player is what matters most and, even more, it has helped you support your entire musical phrase and approach such a difficult repertoire, because you have acquired very good skills.\\" In season 7 of X Factor Romania 2017, the judges (well-known singers in Romania themselves) repeatedly expressed words (related to her performances) such as \\"wall\\",\\"panzer\\",\\"robot\\",\\"little robot\\", \\"a fifteen-year-old girl who sings her heart out\\", \\"you were impeccable\\", \\"the best voice by far\\", \\"you are the nuisance that motivates all the contestants from behind\\", \\"a German battle tank that does its job relentlessly\\", to emphasize her accurate performance constancy at high artistic standards in each stage of the contest, regardless of the obstacles and ever present stage fright when taking the stage.

Adapted by Heidi Thomas, the miniseries was directed by Vanessa Caswill. The three one-hour episodes were first broadcast on BBC One on Boxing Day 2017 and the following two days. The cast includes Emily Watson, Michael Gambon and Angela Lansbury. Production was supported by PBS and the miniseries was shown as part of its Masterpiece anthology. Cast Production Little Women was commissioned by BBC Drama in May 2017, along with 10 other television dramas. The three-part series was adapted by Heidi Thomas, who created Call the Midwife, and directed by Vanessa Caswill. It was produced by Playground Television UK with PBS Masterpiece. Little Women is set in Concord, Massachusetts, but was filmed in County Wicklow, Ireland. Filming took place in the coastal town of Bray and at the Ardmore Studios from July 2017. Irish costume designer Eimer Ní Mhaoldomhnaigh created the clothing for the miniseries. Episodes Reception The UK media reception for the programme was very positive. Euan Ferguson in The Observer said: \\"The grit and pain of the girls' struggles to define themselves, in that fast-changing age, in that still young country, rang wholly fresh and credible... all in all, a triumph\\". Ben Lawrence of The Daily Telegraph described it as: \\"the single best thing on television over Christmas... a delight from start to finish – a poignant, funny version of Louisa May Alcott's 1869 novel which made the four March sisters seem like both exciting new creations and old friends,\\" while Alex O'Connell in The Times said: \\"writer Heidi Thomas (Call the Midwife, Cranford) reminds us why we love it and shows us the classic in a bright new light.\\" Ben Allen of the Radio Times felt the online reception amongst the public to be more mixed, with some viewers preferring the interpretation of earlier filmed adaptations, while others were left moved but conflicted by the accurate depiction of the novel's conclusion. Episode 1 was seen by 5.17 million viewers and Episode 3 by 4.38 million according to BARB's consolidated viewing data; whereas Episode 2 was watched by fewer than 4.31 million viewers and thus did not feature in BBC1's top 30 most viewed programmes for week ending 31 December 2017.http://www.barb.co.uk/viewing-data/weekly-top-30/ References External links * * Category:2017 British television series debuts Category:2017 British television series endings Category:2010s British drama television series Category:English-language television shows Category:BBC television dramas Category:2010s British television miniseries Category:Television series about the American Civil War Category:Works based on Little Women ","title":"Little Women (2017 TV series)"},{"id":"56140519","text":"MEXX–Watersley International Women's Cycling Team is a cycling team based in the Netherlands, founded in 2016, which attained UCI status for the 2019 season.https://cqranking.com/women/asp/gen/team.asp?year=2019&teamcode;=WAT The team announced on their facebook page the intention to fold the team at the end of the 2019 season, however their support staff and a few riders would be moving to Andy Schleck Cycles - Immo Losch.

Otter Tail County's first county seat was Ottertail City. After the decline of that city, it was moved to Fergus Falls in 1872. with The previous courthouse was completed in 1881, and it was damaged by a tornado in June 1919. A bond issue was defeated by county voters in August of the same year because of confusion over whether the county was going to build a new courthouse, repair the old building, or wait for building costs to decrease. Another storm took off part of the courthouse's temporary roof a short time later. In November 1920, Judge William L. Parsons ruled that Otter Tail County no longer had a courthouse. That allowed the county commissioners to issue bonds and levy a 1% property tax to build a new building. The present courthouse was designed by the St. Paul architectural firm of Buechner & Orth, and it was completed in 1922 by L.P. Jorgenson for $322,000. The three-story brick and Bedford stone structure is an excellent example of the Beaux Arts style, although it is similar to other courthouses of the same style in the state. The law enforcement center was built behind the courthouse in 1962. Designed by Glenn W. Cording Associates, the same light color brick was used so it blends in with the older courthouse.

He would eventually achieve his wish of becoming Chief Signals Officer. Randewick was involved in the design of radio components of the V-2 rocket, specifically researching remote control via wireless steering, remote detonation and remote jamming. At the start of World War II, Randewig was already a veteran of Soviet Wireless telegraphy traffic and a supporter of decentralisation. Life Randewig was the Son of a professional Army officer. While following his father from base to base, his schooling became fragmented. He attended school in Potsdam, Magdeburg, Kuestrin and finally Graulenz, where he took his Abiturium Military career He originally intended to study architecture, but owing to a strain on his fathers financial resources, he entered the Army as a Subaltern in July 1914, and was posted to the regiment, Garde Telegraphie in Berlin. During World War I, Randewig was posted to the Western Front where he successively worked on the Telephone department of VII Corps, High Command of the GKDO, and then subordinated to the Adjutant of Officers Training Course. Interwar period In 1918, Randewick joined the Freikorps volunteer unit, and at the end of 1919 moved to the Borders Guard East (). On 1 October 1920, Randewig was taken into the Reichswehr Army of 100,000 men and became an Adjutant of the Reiterabteilung III at Potsdam. Between 1922 and 1923, Randewig was placed in the wireless training academy at the army base in Jüterbog. Between 1923 and 1925 he was the adjutant of Regimental Commander of Signal Troops in Group Kdo 2, (Army Group) in Kassel. Promoted to Oberleutnant Lieutenant and between 1925 and 1927 became Zugführer, Platoon leader of Signals department 5 in Stuttgart. Between 1927 and 29, he held the same appointment in Signals Department 1 in Königsberg. Between 1929 and 33 Randewig was part of the staff of 1st Division as Commanding Officer of Wireless Telegraphy (abbr. W/T) interception in Königsberg, and promoted to Hauptmann (Captain). On 1 April 1933 Randewig was Staff Captain at Signals Abteilung 4 in Dresden and then promoted Company commander of the W/T company. In November 1934 he was Chief Signal Officer of General Kommando 9 (Corps Area) in Kassel. On 19 April 1938, he became Commanding Officer of Signals Training, but later took part in the Anschluss. World War II In 1939, Randewig was responsible for three signal intercept companies posted to the West Wall. It was feared by Germany that France would invade Germany, and Randewig's job was to use his intercept companies to detect any movement in the French forces. In August 1939, Randewig was mobilised into the O.C. Signals Operational Abteilung (department) of the Army Advanced Guard. At the time, there were two fixed intercept stations in the west-Stuttgart and Münster. Randewig's next posting was the Signals Interception unit in Zeppelin bunker in Wünsdorf near Zossen, Brandenburg, to intercept signals from Poland. In mid September 1939, he became Commanding Officer Intercept Troops, West and helped to build up the new Army H.Q in Giesen. During this period, his commitments were against France, Belgium and Holland inclusively. In April 1940, the Intercept unit that Randewig was commanding was split into three separate units, to cover Army Group A, B and C. Each had a Commanding Officer (O.C.) of Signals Interception and Randewig was made Commanding Officer of Signal Interception of Army Group A, with General Gerd von Rundstedt as his G.O.C. Working until the end of June, Randewig was working with three intercept companies monitoring French radio communications exclusively. On 1 April 1940, Randewig started studying message interception from radio communications from Great Britain. Facilities available were the fixed intercept station at Husum, the Münster and Euskirchen. They were also two mobile intercept companies together with Direction finding (abbr. D/F) sections. This went on until April 1941. General Rundstedt was then posted to the Eastern Front and Randewig's unit was posted as well. The Army Group became Army Group South. Randewig was promoted to () Lt. Colonel and to () Colonel in 1942. There were three companies engaged in Signals Interception against the Soviets, KONA 1, KONA 2 and KONA 3. In October 1942, Randewig was to become Commander of Signals of the 3rd Romania Army but fell ill. In February–March 1943, he was posted to Führerreserve at Halle. In April Randewig became C.S.C. of Armeeoberkommando 15, in the Netherlands area. In July, Randewig was again posted to the Führerreserve, as a result of indiscreet criticism of the regime. In October 1943, proceedings against him stopped as he was given a warning. In December 1943, he was posted as C.S.C of Armeeoberkommando, located between Romania and Kiev where he stayed until August 1944. In August 1944, Randewig was ordered by OKH to be responsible for all questions concerning W/T in connection with rockets. He stayed at H.W.A. Berlin until the end of August 1944. V-2 rockets On 1 September 1944, Randewig was subordinated to Major-General Dr. Walter Dornberger. It was on this date that the use of V-2 rockets was ordered by SS Obergruppenführer Hans Kammler, and Randewig was ordered to the town of Kleve to join Kammler's staff. He was posted to Division 2 z b.V 1191 Signal Abteilung and dealt with signals communications within the Division as well as the special job of W/T interception within the Division. Randewig explained while under interrogation to Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre, that it was feared at the time that similar weapons would be used by the Allies against Germany. The special job consisted of keeping a watch on all signals which might be found to be control beams or signals for such weapons. In November 1944, Randewig was appointed Army Chief Signals Intelligence Officer (Abbr. CSO) () Z.b.V 700 (Army CSO). His headquarters was in Potsdam which was operated for the Wehrmacht (as distinct from the Army alone). He was only concerned with impulse traffic beams, jamming and remote detonation. By February 1945, this type of particular work became impossible, as bombing and allied advanced made any form of liaison impracticable. During that month, Randewig became responsible for the reorganization of Decimetre communications and W/T teleprinters (Siemens and Halske T52) of the Army. This lasted until the end of March or the middle of April. This commission had two main tasks: # The establishment of Decimetre communications with the cut-off Army Group Courland. # The establishment of Decimetre communications between Berchtesgaden and Plön after the Allied breakthrough. This was working on 12 April 1945 and continued to do so until German capitulation. Between April and May 1945, Randewig was promoted to Commander of Signals North (). Subsequently, he was promoted to Chief of Signals for Army Group Blumentritt, a unit that formed on 8 April 1945, and which was an ad-hoc collection of depleted units on the Weser river from Hameln to the Baltic Sea. The unit, created by Infantry General Günther Blumentritt, was operational right up until the end of the war. General Randewig was a technician who was very keen on intercept problems. From 1940-1942, he bombarded the Chief Signal Officer of the Wehrmacht, Erich Fellgiebel with memoranda on the necessity for a centralised control of intercept and on the need for setting up a centralised intercept unit staffed by at least, 3000 technicians. As a result of this agitation, he was pushed out of the intercept service until August 1944, when he was recalled to advise on certain problems of V2 operations.

Its main objective was the defense of the \\"Valencian personality\\" and the Valencian symbols, such as the Real Senyera and the denomination of the Kingdom of Valencia, opposing the adoption of symbols that they considered \\"Catalan\\" (plain senyera and the name \\"Valencian Country\\").UNIÓN REGIONAL VALENCIANA – UNIÓN VALENCIANA. Francisco Moreno Sáez, University of Alicante.Vicent Flor: Noves glòries a Espanya : Anticatalanisme i identitat valenciana. Catarroja, editorial Afers, 2011, page 379. URV also defended that the Valencian Community should achieve autonomy through the Article 143 of the Spanish Constitution of 1978 (like Catalonia, Galiza and the Basque Country), and not by Article 151. URV had a strong influence in the city of València itself, but was very weak in the rest of the Valencian Community. In the local elections of 1979 URV gained one city councillor in València and played a key role in the so-called \\"Battle of Valencia\\". In October 1979 the left-wing faction of the party decided to refound it as Valencian Nationalist Left, after decision the right-wing faction (led by Miguel Ramón Izquierdo, Vicente González Lizondo and Vicente Ramos Pérez) left the organization and founded Valencian Union.Anselm Bodoque Arribas: Unió Valenciana (1982–2008).

During her lifetime she was famed for her beauty, but as Ronald Syme writes, her \\"fame and follies have been all but extinguished by her homonymous daughter\\", Poppaea Sabina the Younger.Syme, The Augustan Aristocracy (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1986), p. 178 She met her end as a victim of the empress Valeria Messalina, wife of Claudius. Poppaea Sabina was the daughter of Gaius Poppaeus Sabinus, homo novus and consul of AD 9. She had been the wife of Titus Ollius, who was a friend of the prefect of the Praetorian Guard Sejanus and committed suicide following Sejanus' downfall. With Ollius she had a daughter who would be the future empress to Nero. After Ollius' death she married Publius Cornelius Lentulus Scipio, consul in AD 24. Scipio had a son by a previous marriage Publius Cornelius Lentulus Scipio the Younger (consul in AD 56). With Poppaea Sabina the Elder they had a son, Publius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus, suffect consul in 68.Syme, Augustan Aristocracy, p. 299 Her downfall came during the reign of the emperor Claudius. His wife, Messalina, desired to possess the Gardens of Lucullus which was owned by Decimus Valerius Asiaticus, consul in the years 35 and again in 46. Based on the gossip that Poppaea Sabina and Asiaticus had been lovers, she directed her servant Suilius to accuse Asiaticus of treason and the pair of adultery. Asiaticus was tried in the emperor's private chambers, but instead of a guilty plea was allowed to commit suicide. Meanwhile, Messalina had agents harass Poppaea Sabina with threats of prison which led to her own suicide.Tacitus, Annales, XI.1-3  References  Category:47 deaths Category:1st-century Romans Category:1st-century Roman women Category:Poppaei Category:Poppaea Sabina ","title":"Poppaea Sabina the Elder"},{"id":"56141260","text":"Japanese singer Shizuka Kudo has released eighteen studio albums, fourteen compilation albums, one EP, two cover albums, six video albums, twelve live video albums, two box sets, and forty-three singles (including one as a featured artist and one novelty single). Her career began in 1985 when she debuted as one of the three vocalists of the girl group Seventeen Club. The short-lived group disbanded after two unsuccessful singles. In 1986, she joined the idol girl group Onyanko Club as member number 38, which led to Kudo forming the subgroup Ushirogami Hikaretai the following year. She released her first solo single, \\"Kindan no Telepathy\\", on the same day as the last broadcast of the variety show Yūyake Nyan Nyan, from which the Onyanko Club members originated. It debuted at number one on the Oricon Singles Chart and became the first of eleven total number-one singles released in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including \\"Koi Hitoyo\\", \\"Arashi no Sugao\\", \\"Kuchibiru Kara Biyaku\\", \\"Senryū no Shizuku\\" and \\"Please\\". Miyuki Nakajima penned the following singles released by Kudo during this era: \\"Fu-ji-tsu\\", \\"Mugon... Iroppoi\\", \\"Kōsa ni Fukarete\\", \\"Watashi ni Tsuite\\" and Dōkoku\\". All five singles debuted at number one and, with total sales exceeding a million, \\"Dōkoku\\" became the best-selling single of Kudo's career. In 1994, Kudo parted ways with record producer Tsugutoshi Gotō, who had been responsible for writing and producing her songs since her solo debut, and began producing and co-writing her own material. That year, she released the album Expose, which produced the two top-ten singles \\"Blue Rose\\" and \\"Jaguar Line\\", and branched out into different musical genres and a more mature sound with the subsequent self-produced albums, Purple, Doing and Dress. She teamed up with Nakajima on the single, \\"Gekijō\\", the first of Kudo's songs to be written entirely by Nakajima, which became her best-selling single not produced by Gotō. In 1998, she released I'm Not, entirely written and produced by Sharam Q guitarist Hatake, which yielded the Dragon Ball GT ending theme \\"Blue Velvet\\". The same year she released \\"Kirara\\", which ranked at number six on the Oricon Singles Chart, becoming her last single to peak in the top-ten. In 2000, Kudo signed with Extasy Japan, founded by Yoshiki, who produced her first single released under the label, \\"Shinku no Hana\\". Two years later, after the birth of her first child, she went on to release her only studio album for the label, Jewelry Box. Kudo rejoined Pony Canyon, her former label, in 2005, for which she released her first album in three years, Tsukikage. She released a slew of singles, compilation albums and a cover album in the following years. In 2017, in celebration of her 30th anniversary, Kudo released Rin, her first studio album in twelve years. It debuted at number 21 on the Oricon Albums Chart, becoming her highest-charting album in nineteen years. As of August 2013, Kudo has sold 15 million records as a solo artist in Japan alone, making her one of the best-selling Japanese music artists of all time.

After working as a portrait painter in the Netherlands, he specialized in Australia as a livestock and landscape painter, making the livestock genre, particularly the foreground cattle genre, popular there. In Australia, he painted mainly in Victoria and was long living in Melbourne where he also practiced as a painting and drawing teacher. Education Scheltema had drawing and painting lessons from the painter J. J. Bertelman (1821-1899) of Gouda for about a year starting in 1879. He then studied during 1880-1882 at the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague, now known as University of the Arts. Then he went to Antwerp to study at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of Antwerp, Belgium.Manuscript held at the academy: Registre d'Inscriptions 1880-1885 d'Academie Royale des Beaux Arts d'Anvers - 'Winterkoers' 1883-84, page 146, entry 11 where Charles Verlat was the Director. The development of Scheltema's defining ability to paint animals, may have been influenced by Verlat, who from 1866 to 1875 had been the docent responsible for animal painting classes at the Weimar Saxon-Grand Ducal Art School. Scheltema won a scholarship from King William III of the Netherlands from 1880 to 1884 of resp. 350, 450, 500, 500 and 300 guilders.Dr. C.A.W Jeekel, \\"With marten hair brush and pallet knife; the life of Dutch-Australian painter Jan Hendrik Scheltema (1861-1941)\\" (translated title), transcribed manuscript letters (to 1898) held in the RKD in The Hague and at the NGV's library in Melbourne. Works Portrait of Nicolaas Scheltema Both in the Netherlands and in Antwerp, Belgium Scheltema had been a figure painter and portrait painter. His best known portraits are the half body depiction of Johannes van 't Lindenhout (1837-1918), founder of a large educational and employment providing orphanage at Neerbosch, near Nijmegen, Netherlands,F.L. van ‘t Hoofd, \\"Lindenhout, Johannes van ‘t\\" in 'Biografisch Lexicon voor Geschiedenis van het Nederlandse Protestantism' Part I, Prof. Dr. D Nauta, et al. (eds), Publ J.H.Kok, Kampen 1978, p.124. two works of the Rev. Carel Steven Adema van Scheltema (1815-1897), activist in campaigning against alcohol abuse and a portrait of Hendrika Jacoba Stokhuijzen (1816-1872), the spouse of the latter. Her image was painted using a monochrome photograph, some years after her death by accidental drowning. All five of these are held by public museums in the Netherlands and thought to have been painted in the 1880s. The Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam holds an etching by him called \\"sitting woman in an interior\\" (RT-P-1913-2831). Soon after arrival in Australia in 1888 he decided that portrait painting could not provide him with a living in Melbourne and successfully specialized in rural landscapes with foreground livestock being the focus rather than staffage. Showing delicate atmospheric and light effects, and including visible brush strokes, he fits the style of the impressionists. Almost a thousand paintings in this type are known of him. Yet he painted some portraits there too. For example, the collection of the State Library of Victoria includes his portrait of the soprano Daisy Muriel Pickering. Activities and collaborations  Scheltema arrived in Melbourne, Australia 7 July 1888 aboard on the French ship S.S. Oceanien. He joined the Victorian Artists' Society. In Australia his work was soon displayed in the same exhibitions as artists like Charles Conder, Arthur Streeton, Tom Roberts and Frederick McCubbin. For some years he lived at 586 Drummond Street, North Carlton, Victoria and had his first studio in Sydney Terrace in Wellington Parade, Melbourne, where he lived the first year.Black, Sylvia, 'Sydney Terrace' in East Melbourne Historical Society Newsletter Vol 15 -No 2-June 2014 p 5-7, ACN A00 390 26Z He did however have some 20 different home addresses during the half century he lived in Australia. From 1889 he had a contractual arrangement with the Florence-educated Italian landscape painter Charles Rolando (1844–1893) with Rolando in the role of employer as Rolando's deteriorating health required him to hire expert assistance with his painting and teaching of his art classes, while Scheltema needed a steady income.Suzanne G. Mellor, 'Rolando, Charles (1844–1893)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/rolando-charles-4500/text7357, published first in hard copy 1976. The wealthy Rolando had similarly been assisted earlier by George A. J. Webb (1861 – 1949), his brother in law, later a portraitist and landscape painter in Melbourne and Adelaide. They often collaborated on the same painting. Scheltema inserted the staffage, mainly animals, but also vegetation, into Rolando's landscapes settings. They also exhibited together, such as at the premises of art dealers Gemmell, Tuckett and Co of Collins Street, Melbourne in 1891.http://digital.slv.vic.gov.au/view/action/singleViewer.do?dvs=1577321855545~490&locale;=en_US&metadata;_object_ratio=10&show;_metadata=true&VIEWER;_URL=/view/action/singleViewer.do?&preferred;_usage_type=VIEW_MAIN&DELIVERY;_RULE_ID=10&frameId;=1&usePid1;=true&usePid2;=true They would repeatedly take their students into the quite distant Victorian countryside to paint there. Some art sale advertisements later listed works as by 'Scheltema and Rolando'. Both artists signed those paintings. After Rolando's death in 1893 Scheltema continued to teach Rolando's students together with Webb for Rolando's wife Frances until early 1895. He would later very occasionally collaborate with other painters under different terms. According to his letters he was a friend of landscape and figure painter J. A. Turner(1850–1908), of teacher and painter T.F Levick, the frame maker John Thellon and of school principal and painter Robert Camm. With any of the latter three he would repeatedly go bush to paint, with or without some of his students. Travels Scheltema traveled and painted in Europe again, twice. In 1898-1899 he visited his native Holland, and visited Italy, Belgium, Switzerland and Tunisia. Paintings from this trip were exhibited on his return at his studio in the Cromwell Buildings on Bourke St, opposite the General Post Office.'Art Notes', The Age, 8 Apr 1899, p.13, https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/189688019 In 1910, he also spent some time in France, Scotland, England and the Netherlands. Upon his return from this second voyage, he presented a one artist exhibition from 1 to 24 September 1911 with 88 of his paintings in Tuckett Chambers, 359 Collins Street, Melbourne, including many works painted on his last journey. The exhibition was opened by Sir John Madden, the fourth Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Victoria, addressing about 50 guests. Its 4 page catalogue entitled \\"J.H.Scheltema's Exhibition of English, Scottish and Australian Paintings\\", showing descriptions/titles and prices, can be sighted in the National Library of Australia today. The press covered the 1911 exhibition well.e.g.'Mr J.H.Scheltema's Exhibition of Pictures', The Age, 1 Sept 1911, p.9, https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/196222270,The Age 2 Sept 2011, p12, http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article196208856 and Jean Sibi, 'Mr Scheltema's Pictures', in Punch, Sept 2011 p431, http://nla.gov.au/nla.news- article177532857 71 of the 88 paintings were sold at the exhibition where no auction was held. His works currently Paintings by Scheltema still sell at auction from time to time. In December 2018 a total of 18 works by J.H.Scheltema, previously not known to exist by the art world but held by his family, were discovered in the legacy of the recently deceased widow of the artist's great nephew Dr C.A.W. Jeekel and came to Australia. Most are now part of the collection of the Gippsland Art Gallery, in the town of Sale, Australia, which displayed them and others in the first Scheltema-only exhibition sinds 1911, held from 21 March to 9 August 2020, under the title \\"The Lost Impressionist\\". It includes a portrait of his father. The landscape shown below, painted at Alphington, near Melbourne, Scheltema had sent home explaining that the old eucalypts that had survived the ring-barking, the fires and the clearing are 'momuments' from before white settlement. Recognition Australian Landscape In art history Scheltema is an 'important artist in Australia'.Tony Elwood, Director of the National Gallery of Victoria in formal hard copy NGV letter dated 13 August 2018 He gained a reputation as a masterly painter of pastoral scenes, particularly as a specialist of foreground livestock in the landscape, a genre developed by Paulus Potter in 17th century Holland with Potter's \\"Young Bull\\" hanging in the Mauritshuis Museum in Scheltema's birthplace where he lived untill the age of 5. His skills in that genre were often publicly acknowledged in Australian newspapers. His treatment of livestock was not limited to making them a focal landscape element in the painting, but he often showed them in action, such as drinking, running, breaking away being chased, being shorn or fed, showing what they were watching, depicting their interaction with humans as well as the landscape. He produced several equine works some with the movement of full gallop. His paintings were not just pleasant pictures, but tended to tell a story in a well captured typical Australian bush settings, sometimes with fog or haze. Although he had been educated in Europe he immediately developed a sharp eye for the colours and textures of the Australian landscape, as he did not only paint outdoors all over rural Victoria, but studied individual tree and shrub species up close. Many of his rural works focus on one large gum tree, as a uniting feature. He would explain the rural life in paintings which others of the period, such as Banjo Patterson and Henry Lawson, had explained in writing indeed poetry. In 1895 one of his paintings, Driving in the Cows was purchased by the National Gallery of Victoria. Since then all Australian State Galleries and the National Gallery of Australia would own at least one of his paintings, as do the larger regional galleries in Victoria, such as those at Ballarat, Benalla, Sale, Hamilton and Bendigo. The latter gallery (then called Sandhurst Art Gallery) was the first public gallery to have a work of Scheltema in its collection, inside two years from his arrival in 1888, called 'Going to Camp' a great sunset with a foreground of 12 oxen pulling a cart with a load of wool bales. The Hamilton Gallery keeps five livestock-in-landscape pieces by Scheltema in their collection. His exceptional chiaroscuro work \\"The Sundowners\\", showing three men at night lit on just one side by a fire in the bush, shows he could paint an almost physically felt suggestion of different temperatures in different parts of the painting. In the chapter about the contribution of the Dutch to pre-war Australia in the 1927 book \\"Non-Britishers in Australia\\" by J. Ling, just two names of Dutch immigrants are mentioned: Guillaume Delprat, the general manager of BHP, and Jan Hendrik Scheltema. His became a familiar name around Melbourne and in the Australian art world. He has been compared favorably with Louis Buvelot. another migrant painter. His reputation as a teacher was such that some of his former students would advertise their work or their classes with the message that they had been taught by him. The painter Robert Camm (1847-1933), though considerably older and a former student at the art school of the National Gallery of Victoria for three years, was long one of his students. Family J.H.Scheltema was the youngest son of Lieutenant-Colonel Nicolaas Scheltema (1810-1901) and his second wife Anna Maria Scharp (1819-1887) of The Hague, Netherlands, who had six children together, four surviving to adulthood, two girls and two boys. The family also lived in Haarlem and Rotterdam and moved to Gouda when Jan Hendrik was fifteen years old. His elder brother Petrus Herman first became an Architect, then Editor and Director of an architectural magazine and then Chief-overseer of palaces in the Hague. He was married to Anna Arendsen Hein. The family names Scheltema, Scharp and Arendsen Hein are listed on the List of Dutch patrician families, but his was not a wealthy branch of such family. Only on 16 February 1917 Scheltema married a long term friend, Edith Bailey Smith (1876-1947) of Melbourne, after which they lived in Brisbane for almost one year before returning to Melbourne. The full length portrait of Edith (as an Italian fruit vendor), painted about two decades before they married, is now in the Art Gallery of Western Australia. Their son, Nicholas Herbert was born on 22 June 1918. Edith, a musician, composed and published an Australian patriotic song, Loyalty, in 1939. Nicholas Scheltema purchased a sawmill at Palmwoods, Queensland in 1938, shortly after his parents moved to Brisbane again, when JHS retired from painting. Some secondary sources still use 1938 erroneously as the year of his death, but J.H.Scheltema died at Brisbane General Hospital late in 1941 and his remains were buried at the Toowong Cemetery. Edith died in March 1947 and was also buried there. Nicholas lived for some time in Rabaul, New Guineasee death certificate of Edith Scheltema; he died in May 1952 and was buried in the Brisbane Lutwyche Cemetery.Lutwyche Cemetery records  Confusion  Although there are many contemporary indicators that art critics studied his work closely, some appear not to have acquainted themselves with the painter himself. For instance, in Table Talk, the Melbourne weekly from 1885 to 1939 (9 January 1891. p 8), a ‘masterful cattle piece’ is elaborately praised and described in detail, but the painter is three times referred to as ‘Herr J.H.Scheltema’. Its writer may have been assumed he was German, perhaps from his Dutch accent. A decade later an Adelaide art writer would still introduce him as a 'Belgian artist'.The South Australian Register, 1 July 1898 p.5. Fairly soon after his death, the combination of so many of his works in the community, mainly in Victoria, and his retirement to far away Queensland gave rise to the peculiar rumour, reported in the press, that he never existed: his signature \\"J.H.Scheltema\\" would have been a pseudonym of another artist.F.F.,'Styles in art changing - better or worse\\" in The Argus, 21 June 1947, p.41 Also, some puzzling texts appeared in the second half on the 20th century in Australian art reference works then considered reliable and hence from writers who use these routinely as gospel, e.g. suggesting without evidence, and erroneously that Scheltema was colorblind.

The course of the river flows entirely in the canton of Roy. The hydrographic slope of the Blondeau River is accessible by the junction of a forest road (east-west direction) serving the north side of Chibougamau Lake; the latter is connected to route 167 which also serves the south side of Waconichi Lake and the Waconichi River. This last road comes from Chibougamau , going north- east to the south-eastern part of Mistassini Lake. The surface of the Blondeau River is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however, safe ice circulation is generally from mid-November to mid-April.  Geography  The main hydrographic slopes near the \\"Blondeau River\\" are: *North side: Natevier river, Waconichi Lake, Mistassini Lake (\\"Baie de Poste\\"), Barlow River (Chibougamau River); *East side: Nepton River, Nepton River North, France River, Boisvert River, Chief River, Chonard River; *South side: Chibougamau Lake, Armitage River, Énard River; *West side: Natevier River, Chibougamau River, Chevrillon Lake. The Blondeau River has its source at the mouth of lake Blondeau (length: ; altitude: ) in the township of Roy. This source is located at: * northwest of the mouth of the Blondeau River (confluence with Chibougamau Lake); * south-east of Waconichi Lake; * south of Mistassini Lake; * north-east of downtown Chibougamau; * north-east of the mouth of the Chibougamau River (confluence with the Opawica River); From the mouth of Blondeau Lake, the Blondeau River flows over , according to the following segments: * northeasterly in Roy Township, to the confluence of the Oreille River; * East, then South, to its mouth.Distances measured from the Atlas of Canada (published on the Internet) of the Department of Natural Resources Canada. The Blondeau River flows onto the north shore of McKenzie Bay (facing Marina Island) which is an extension to the northeast of Chibougamau Lake. From this mouth, the current crosses this bay to the south, borrows the McKenzie Passage which is crossed by a road bridge, before crossing it to the Southwest Chibougamau Lake bypassing the Portage Island which bound to the north-east the Dorés Lake (Chibougamau River). Chibougamau Lake is the main head lake of Chibougamau River. From the mouth of Chibougamau Lake, the current crosses Dorés Lake (Chibougamau River), then generally descends to the Southwest (except the large S of the upper part of the river) along the Chibougamau River to its confluence with the Opawica River. From this confluence, the current flows generally southwesterly through the Waswanipi River to the east shore of Goéland Lake (Waswanipi River). The latter is crossed to the northwest by the Waswanipi River which is a tributary of Matagami Lake. Finally, the current flows along the Nottaway River and empties into Rupert Bay, south of the James Bay. The mouth of the Blondeau River located at: * south-east of Waconichi Lake; * south-west of Mistassini Lake; * North of the mouth of Chibougamau Lake; * north-east of the mouth of the Chibougamau River (confluence with the Opawica River); * south-east of the mouth of the Nottaway River; * north-east of the village center of Chapais, Quebec; * north-east of downtown Chibougamau.

Plot Set in Belmont-Gonzales, Texas in 1901. After a misunderstanding, a Mexican-American farmer kills a sheriff. He eludes capture and becomes a folk hero. When eventually he is caught, he is tried seven times before finally being released, after twelve years in prison. Cast Reception The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating with an average rating of 7.67/10 based on 6 reviews. Janet Maslin of The New York Times said, \\"[The film] tells what sounds like a stirring story, and its plainness would seem to be an asset. But something more was needed here, if not in the way of fireworks then maybe just in verisimilitude. The events may be real, and even the settings are authentic; the courthouse in which Mr. Young filmed the trial scene is the one in which Mr. Cortez's trial actually took place. That's not the sort of authenticity that the film lacks. What it's missing is the spark, surprise and immediacy that might have made its principals feel like people, rather than key figures in a well-meaning historical pageant.\\" Accolades Rosanna DeSoto won the Golden Eagle Award for Best Actress for her performance in the film.page 133 Preservation The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez was preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2016.

It was the first convent of the order founded outside of Sweden, and the second convent of the order altogether. History In 1373, the relics of Saint Bridget was brought home to Sweden from Rome by way of Gdańsk, after which the mother convent Vadstena Abbey was founded in Sweden. In 1391, there was a community of monks of the Bridgettine order in Gdańsk, and in 1397, the Marienbrunn Abbey was formally founded. It was the first founded after the mother convent in Sweden, and one of two in Poland (the other being active in Lublin in 1416 – 18th-century). The Marienbrunn Abbey was a double monastery with both monks and nuns. The monks were the original founders, and the female members were initially reformed prostitutes, who entered the convent in a wish to leave their old life, a fact which initially gave the convent a bad name. In 1429, when complaints were made that female prostitutes were allowed to visit the abbey as guests, the abbess founded a separate guest house specially for women prostitutes. In 1595, Vadstena Abbey was finally closed in Sweden, over half a century after the Swedish Reformation, and in the spring of 1596, the last nuns from the mother convent emigrated to Marienbrunn Abbey lead by their abbess, Katarina Olofsdotter. Katarina Olofsdotter died here in 1625, and the last of the Swedish nuns, Anna Larsdotter, died in 1638. Marienbrunn Abbey, as well as Gdańsk, became a part of the Kingdom of Prussia after the Partition of Poland in the 18th-century. In 1833, the abbey was ordered closed down by the Prussian authorities.

He also played for the Long Island Knights in 1988 of the USBL and then went to veteran training camp with the Columbus Horizon of the CBA and traveled to Russia in 1989 with the Harlem Globetrotters and Washington Generals Tour. From 1995 to 2010, Robinson was a member of the Harlem Road Kings. In 2010, Robison founded the Harlem Clowns where he continues to serve as the owner/player. In addition to playing with Harlem Globetrotters’ great Meadowlark Lemon (“Clown Prince of Basketball”) in the late 1980s and 1990s, he has played in every state, traveled to over 50 countries and has scored over 10,000 points in over 5,000 games.

On November 1, 2001 Robinson sent his Harlem Road Kings uniform to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame to be displayed as an exhibit. Music In 2010, Robinson decided to pursue the idea of building a Rhythm & Blues Museum that would include everything from radio personalities and owners of record companies to Hip-Hop and Gospel music. In 2014, Robinson copyrighted the name, Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame. When he was a child, Robinson's parents and grandparents took him to see the great acts of the 1960s and 1970s. It was this background that fostered his love for all types of music but, when he saw James Brown, Robinson instantly knew he wanted to be in entertainment himself. Although he chose sports, his love for music has been a lifelong passion. The musicians he looked up to the most were James Brown, the Temptations and Berry Gordy as well as regularly watching television shows such as Soul Train, Ed Sullivan and Upbeat. Gus Hawkins, Robinson's uncle, played saxophone for Edwin Starr, The O'Jays and many other acts at a club called Leo's Casino, which is where Robinson got his first glimpse of what the entertainment industry was really like. And he was hooked. As a professional basketball player, Robinson met many entertainers and began collecting music memorabilia. His family had always collected so it was a natural continuation of a strong and enthusiastic family tradition. Since 2013, Robinson has held induction ceremonies every year that have included The Temptations, The O’Jays, The Four Tops, The Chi- Lites, Gene \\"The Duke of Earl” Chandler, Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, Chubby Checker, Berry Gordy, Ray Charles, Cathy Hughes, Morgan Freeman, Rev. Al Sharpton, and the Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin. Ties with inductees and their families have been strong and artifacts for the museum have been gladly and generously donated. The Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame has over 170 artists honored and inducted since 2013.

Ragusa (born February 25, 1966) is an American writer and documentary filmmaker based in Brooklyn, New York.  Early life and education  Ragusa was born in Manhattan, New York, to an Italian-American father and an African- American mother. Her paternal grandparents were immigrants from Messina; her maternal ancestors were brought to the United States as slaves. She spent much of her childhood living alternately with her maternal grandparents in Harlem and her paternal grandparents in Maplewood, New Jersey. After attending public schools, Ragusa earned an M.A. in Media from the New School for Social Research. She also studied creative writing at Hunter College, where she was a student of Louise DeSalvo.  Career  Ragusa directed two award-winning short documentary films, Passing (1995) and Fuori/Outside (1997). Her other films include Demarcations, Threads of Memory, and Remembering the Triangle Fire. Her memoir, The Skin Between Us: A Memoir of Race, Beauty, and Belonging (W. W. Norton & Co., 2006), was a finalist for the 2007 Hurston-Wright Legacy Award for nonfiction, and has been well received by critics. An Italian- language edition, La pelle che ci separa, was published in 2008. Her writing has also appeared in anthologies, such as The Milk of Almonds: Italian American Women Writers on Food and Culture (2003), Personal Effects: Essays on Memoir, Teaching, and Culture in the Work of Louise DeSalvo (2014), and Are Italians White?

In the Foreword to Olive Grrrls: Italian North American Women & The Search For Identity (2013), Ragusa describes her uneasiness with pat answers to the question, \\"What are you?\\" and concludes that \\"No identity is singular, clear-cut, fixed; each is situated in histories and in daily lives that are endlessly complex.\\" Ragusa has taught Writing and Film Studies at Eugene Lang College and the City University of New York.

Pecking is the action of a bird using their beak to search for food or otherwise investigate an object or area by tapping it. Pecking can also be used by a bird to attack or fight another bird. Pecking is frequently observed in chickens and other poultry, and in pigeons.Harris Philip Zeigler, Ralf Jäger, and Adrian G. Palacios, \\"Sensorimotor mechanisms and pecking in the pigeon\\", in Harris Philip Zeigler and Hans-Joachim Bischof, Vision, Brain, and Behavior in Birds (1993), p. 265. Pecking is typically accomplished by movement of the neck. Certain birds, particularly woodpeckers, engage in a specialized kind of pecking, using their beak to drill holes in trees in order to find insects under the bark. Woodpeckers also engage in a kind of pecking called drumming, a less-forceful type of pecking that serves to establish territory and attract mates. Woodpeckers drum on various reverberatory structures on buildings such as gutters, downspouts, chimneys, vents and aluminium sheeting. The phrase, pecking order, referring to the hierarchical system of social organization was coined by Thorleif Schjelderup-Ebbe in 1921,Perrin, P.G., (1955). Pecking order 1927-54. American Speech, 30(4): 265-268 in reference to the expression of dominance in chickens by behaviors including pecking. Schjelderup-Ebbe noted in his 1924 German-language article that \\"defense and aggression in the hen is accomplished with the beak\\".Schjelderup-Ebbe, 1975 p. 36 cited in Rajecki, D.W. (1988) This emphasis on pecking led many subsequent studies on fowl behaviour to use it as a primary observation, however, it has been noted that roosters tend to leap and use their claws in conflicts.Rajecki, D.W. (1988). Formation of leap orders in pairs of male domestic chickens.

He made less than 15 appearances for Real de Banjul and score two goals before departing the club in 2016. In his brief spelled with Real de Banjul, he won the GFF Super Cup. Olympique de Ngor After spending less than a full season with Real de Banjul, Muhammed moved to Senegal Premier League club, Olympique de Ngor on a season loan from Real de Banjul. He may not have had the opportunity to get the goals rolling at the back of the net in the GFA League First Division, but he made use of his time in Senegal as he became one of the best finishers in Senegalese football. Just in his first year, he registered seven goals in thirteen appearances as he became the target of several top clubs. Fath Union SportFUS Rabat After a season with Olympique de Ngor, Muhammed would go on to be the target of many clubs in Senegal and other top African countries. Following negotiations with several to top clubs, he made a permanent switch to Morocco Botola club, FUS Rabat. He joined the club on a four-year deal. He made his debut against Raja Casablanca on September 26, 2017 in the Moroccan Throne Cup match which played to a goalless draw. He scored his first Botola goal in FUS Rabat 2–0 win of Racing de Casablanca on October 28, 2017. Gambia U20 After some brilliant performances in the GFA League First Division, Muhammed was invited by GambiaU-20 coach, Omar Sise in 2016 to attend a trial for the GambiaU-20 ahead of a crucial match against the GuineaU-20 national team in the 2017 Africa U-20 Cup of Nations qualifiershttp://www.foroyaa.gm/archives/7223 Out of the 35 players invited, he made the final list of players for the match against Guinea. His GambiaU-20 debut ended not in the best way as Gambia lost to Guinea 2–1 in Conakry to exit the 2017 Africa U-20 Cup of Nations qualifiers.

Applications of paraphrasing are varied including information retrieval, question answering, text summarization, and plagiarism detection. Paraphrasing is also useful in the evaluation of machine translation, as well as semantic parsingBerant, Jonathan, and Percy Liang. \\"Semantic parsing via paraphrasing.\\" Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers). Vol. 1. 2014. and generation of new samples to expand existing corpora.  Paraphrase generation   Multiple sequence alignment  Barzilay and Lee proposed a method to generate paraphrases through the usage of monolingual parallel corpora, namely news articles covering the same event on the same day. Training consists of using multi-sequence alignment to generate sentence-level paraphrases from an unannotated corpus. This is done by * finding recurring patterns in each individual corpus, i.e. \\" (injured/wounded) people, seriously\\" where are variables * finding pairings between such patterns the represent paraphrases, i.e. \\" (injured/wounded) people, seriously\\" and \\" were (wounded/hurt) by , among them were in serious condition\\" This is achieved by first clustering similar sentences together using n-gram overlap. Recurring patterns are found within clusters by using multi-sequence alignment. Then the position of argument words are determined by finding areas of high variability within each clusters, aka between words shared by more than 50% of a cluster's sentences. Pairings between patterns are then found by comparing similar variable words between different corpora. Finally new paraphrases can be generated by choosing a matching cluster for a source sentence, then substituting the source sentence's argument into any number of patterns in the cluster.  Phrase-based Machine Translation  Paraphrase can also be generated through the use of phrase-based translation as proposed by Bannard and Callison-Burch. The chief concept consists of aligning phrases in a pivot language to produce potential paraphrases in the original language. For example, the phrase \\"under control\\" in an English sentence is aligned with the phrase \\"unter kontrolle\\" in its German counterpart. The phrase \\"unter kontrolle\\" is then found in another German sentence with the aligned English phrase being \\"in check\\", a paraphrase of \\"under control\\". The probability distribution can be modeled as \\\\Pr(e_2  e_1), the probability phrase e_2 is a paraphrase of e_1, which is equivalent to \\\\Pr(e_2f) \\\\Pr(fe_1) summed over all f, a potential phrase translation in the pivot language. Additionally, the sentence e_1 is added as a prior to add context to the paraphrase. Thus the optimal paraphrase, \\\\hat{e_2} can be modeled as: : \\\\hat{e_2} = \\\\text{arg} \\\\max_{e_2 eq e_1} \\\\Pr(e_2  e_1, S) = \\\\text{arg} \\\\max_{e_2 eq e_1} \\\\sum_f \\\\Pr(e_2  f, S) \\\\Pr(f  e_1, S) \\\\Pr(e_2f) and \\\\Pr(fe_1) can be approximated by simply taking their frequencies. Adding S as a prior is modeled by calculating the probability of forming the S when e_1 is substituted with  Long short-term memory  There has been success in using long short-term memory (LSTM) models to generate paraphrases. In short, the model consists of an encoder and decoder component, both implemented using variations of a stacked residual LSTM. First, the encoding LSTM takes a one-hot encoding of all the words in a sentence as input and produces a final hidden vector, which can be viewed as a representation of the input sentence. The decoding LSTM then takes the hidden vector as input and generates new sentence, terminating in an end-of-sentence token. The encoder and decoder are trained to take a phrase and reproduce the one-hot distribution of a corresponding paraphrase by minimizing perplexity using simple stochastic gradient descent. New paraphrases are generated by inputting a new phrase to the encoder and passing the output to the decoder.  Paraphrase recognition   Recursive Autoencoders  Paraphrase recognition has been attempted by Socher et al through the use of recursive autoencoders. The main concept is to produce a vector representation of a sentence along with its components through recursively using an autoencoder. The vector representations of paraphrases should have similar vector representations; they are processed, then fed as input into a neural network for classification. Given a sentence W with m words, the autoencoder is designed to take 2 n-dimensional word embeddings as input and produce an n-dimensional vector as output. The same autoencoder is applied to every pair of words in S to produce \\\\lfloor m/2 \\\\rfloor vectors. The autoencoder is then applied recursively with the new vectors as inputs until a single vector is produced. Given an odd number of inputs, the first vector is forwarded as is to the next level of recursion. The autoencoder is then trained to reproduce every vector in the full recursion tree including the initial word embeddings. Given two sentences W_1 and W_2 of length 4 and 3 respectively, the autoencoders would produce 7 and 5 vector representations including the initial word embeddings. The euclidean distance is then taken between every combination of vectors in W_1 and W_2 to produce a similarity matrix S \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{7 \\\\times 5}. S is then subject to a dynamic min-pooling layer to produce a fixed size n_p \\\\times n_p matrix. Since S are not uniform in size among all potential sentences, S is split into n_p roughly even sections. The output is then normalized to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1 and is fed into a fully connected layer with a softmax output. The dynamic pooling to softmax model is trained using pairs of known paraphrases.  Skip-thought vectors  Skip-thought vectors are an attempt to create a vector representation of the semantic meaning of a sentence in a similar fashion as the skip gram model. Skip-thought vectors are produced through the use of a skip-thought model which consists of three key components, an encoder and two decoders. Given a corpus of documents, the skip-thought model is trained to take a sentence as input and encode it into a skip-thought vector. The skip- thought vector is used as input for both decoders, one of which attempts to reproduce the previous sentence and the other the following sentence in its entirety. The encoder and decoder can be implemented through the use of a recursive neural network (RNN) or an LSTM. Since paraphrases carry the same semantic meaning between one another, they should have similar skip-thought vectors. Thus a simple logistic regression can be trained to a good performance with the absolute difference and component-wise product of two skip-thought vectors as input.  Evaluation  There are multiple methods that can be used to evaluate paraphrases. Since paraphrase recognition can be posed as a classification problem, most standard evaluations metrics such as accuracy, f1 score, or an ROC curve do relatively well. However, there is difficulty calculating f1-scores due to trouble produce a complete list of paraphrases for a given phrase along with the fact that good paraphrases are dependent upon context. A metric designed to counter these problems is ParaMetric. ParaMetric aims to calculate the precision and recall of an automatic paraphrase system by comparing the automatic alignment of paraphrases to a manual alignment of similar phrases. Since ParaMetric is simply rating the quality of phrase alignment, it can be used to rate paraphrase generation systems as well assuming it uses phrase alignment as part of its generation process. A noted drawback to ParaMetric is the large and exhaustive set of manual alignments that must be initially created before a rating can be produced. The evaluation of paraphrase generation has similar difficulties as the evaluation of machine translation. Often the quality of a paraphrase is dependent upon its context, whether it is being used as a summary, and how it is generated among other factors. Additionally, a good paraphrase usually is lexically dissimilar from its source phrase. The simplest method used to evaluate paraphrase generation would be through the use of human judges. Unfortunately, evaluation through human judges tends to be time consuming. Automated approaches to evaluation prove to be challenging as it is essentially a problem as difficult as paraphrase recognition. While originally used to evaluate machine translations, bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) has been used successfully to evaluate paraphrase generation models as well. However, paraphrases often have several lexically different but equally valid solutions which hurts BLEU and other similar evaluation metrics. Metrics specifically designed to evaluate paraphrase generation include paraphrase in n-gram change (PINC) and paraphrase evaluation metric (PEM) along with the aforementioned ParaMetric. PINC is designed to be used in conjunction with BLEU and help cover its inadequacies. Since BLEU has difficulty measuring lexical dissimilarity, PINC is a measurement of the lack of n-gram overlap between a source sentence and a candidate paraphrase. It is essentially the Jaccard distance between the sentence excluding n-grams that appear in the source sentence to maintain some semantic equivalence. PEM, on the other hand, attempts to evaluate the \\"adequacy, fluency, and lexical dissimilarity\\" of paraphrases by returning a single value heuristic calculated using N-grams overlap in a pivot language. However, a large drawback to PEM is that must be trained using a large, in-domain parallel corpora as well as human judges. In other words, it is tantamount to training a paraphrase recognition system in order to evaluate a paraphrase generation system.

Born Persis Weaver in Des Moines, Iowa, Robertson was the daughter of attorney James B. Weaver and sculptor and woodcarver Fayette Atkins Weaver. She studied at Wells College, from which she graduated in 1917; her interests there included French, theater, and literature. In 1932 and 1933 she attended both sessions of the Stone City Art Colony, and it was two other members of the colony, Lowell Houser and Adrian Dornbush, who taught her lithography at the Art Students Workshop in Des Moines later in the decade. She married Albert J. Robertson in 1918, and with him lived in Minneapolis until 1924, when the couple relocated to Des Moines. There they remained until 1953, when Albert received a position in the Eisenhower administration and the couple moved to Washington, D.C. Persis at this time gradually left lithography behind, but she continued in creative pursuits, taking up paper cutting later in life. After her husband's death, she relocated once again, this time to Bridgeport, Connecticut, where she was living at her death. Robertson participated in numerous group shows during her career, including at the Art Institute of Chicago, the Library of Congress, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the Philadelphia Print Club, the Brooklyn Museum, and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. She presented work in solo exhibitions as well, and often won prizes at the art salon of the Iowa State Fair. She was also active with her husband in artistic circles in Des Moines; the two sat on the planning committee for the Des Moines Art Center, and she started the Art Students Workshop at the public library with Florence Cowles Kruidenier. An undated lithograph, Front Door, is owned by the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Robertson is buried beside her husband at Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis. The couple were the parents of two daughters, Persis and Madeline.

It has a single tubular, dark green leaf and up to twenty greenish-brown to brownish flowers with a white labellum. It is only known from two disjunct populations, at Ben Lomond and near Deloraine. Description Prasophyllum stellatum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single dark green, tube-shaped leaf which is long and wide near its dark red to purple base. Between ten and twenty greenish-brown to brownish flowers are loosely arranged along a flowering spike which is long, reaching to a height of . The flowers are wide and as with other leek orchids, are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is lance-shaped to narrow egg-shaped, about long, about wide with three to five darker lines. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, long, about wide and spread widely apart from each other. The petals are narrow linear, long, about wide and brown with white edges. The labellum is white, oblong to narrow elliptic in shape, long, about wide and turns sharply backwards on itself near its middle. The edges of the upturned part of the labellum have crinkled edges and there is a greenish-yellow, fleshy, raised callus in its centre extending just past the bend. Flowering occurs from January to March. Taxonomy and naming Prasophyllum stellatum was first formally described in 1998 by David Jones from a specimen collected on Ben Lomond and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (stellatum) is a Latin word meaning \\"starry\\" or \\"starred\\" referring to the widely spreading petals and sepals. Distribution and habitat The Ben Lomond leek orchid is only known from two disjunct populations, one from private property near Storys Creek on Ben Lomond and the other in state forest at Cluan Tiers near Deloraine. It grows in forest with a shrub or grassy understorey. Conservation The population of P. stellatum has been estimated as about 70 in 2011. It is classed as \\"Endangered\\" under the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995 and as Critically Endangered under the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act. The main threats to the population are forestry activities, inappropriate disturbance and inappropriate fire regimes.

Summary William Davies begins his work by analyzing the philosophy of 19th century Utilitarian theorist Jeremy Bentham, who famously asserted that humanity can objectively determine ethical decisions by measuring the pleasure or pain that results as a consequence. This begins the rise of what Davies regards as \\"The Anti- Philosophical Agnosticism\\" in the psychological community, wherein happiness as a concept is warped from being a personal subjective experience to an objective quantifiable phenomenon. This \\"Anti-Philosophical Agnosticism\\" is further reflected in the works of economist William Stanley Jevons, behaviorist John Watson, and The Chicago School of Economics. The main problem of quantifying pleasure and happiness is there is no one factor that may be objectively observed, since emotions are by their natures subjective experiences; so, according to Davies, psychologists have used other units to measure happiness such as money, dopamine, and body language. Using quantifiable physical phenomenon to measure happiness ultimately reduces happiness to a simple utility. The promotion of this psychological perspective is leading to greater amounts of mental health problems, alienation and manipulation by political and economic elites. Davies warns that the continued expansion of mass surveillance, targeted advertising and psychological profiling is leading to a society in which individuals' emotions are constantly being manipulated by state and corporate forces to be politically docile and economically efficient. Reception The Happiness Industry was reviewed in magazines and newspapers, including The Guardian, The Independent, and Kirkus Reviews. The book has received mostly positive reviews from critics, especially those of the political left. Literary critic Terry Eagleton praised Davies in a review published by The Guardian.

The series consists of 15 games to date, with the latest being released in February 2020.  Plot  The games follow the adventures of female detective Carol Reed.  Gameplay  Carol Reed is a graphical adventure game series that has the player navigating photographs of backgrounds and people. They interact with characters and manipulate items to progress through the stories.  Development   Conception  The games are written by Mikael Nyqvist, who founded MDNA Games. The company is named after the singer Madonna; Nyqvist had previously run the largest Madonna- themed fan site and has an affinity for her. The name of the female protagonist, Carol Reed, was chosen by Mikael's wife Eleen, despite reservations from him that the name was already associated with a male English director. Aspects of the production for each game would include: scripting, planning, location scouting, photographing, and sound recording, while Photoshop photo retouching (about 40% of the process) and game programming would become the most time consuming, nonetheless, over the years Mikael has received some outside help to do tasks such as building the game's interface which is used as a template for each title. The couple made the first three games together, and since then Eleen has taken on more of a consulting role due to other commitments. Mikael acknowledges that his series and Her Interactive's Nancy Drew video game series share common themes, and are the two longest adventure game series, but explained that he was not inspired by the series when creating Carol Reed Mysteries.  Casting and characters  The couple decided to set the games in Sweden, but to have a main character from England; this meant that the Swedish characters would be forced to speak to Carol Reed in English with a Swedish accent, which allowed them to hire friends and acquaintances for a low cost. Mikael does not like talking about how he visualises Carol's appearance, and expressed dismay at the German versions of the first six games having photos of \\"Carol\\" on the cover while the Russian versions had drawings of her. Sarah Louise Williams, who voices Carol Reed and plays Stina, is the sister of Eleen. According to Mikael, \\"she was a natural choice for Carol's voice acting, as her English is excellent\\", having lived in England for ten years. Bjørn Larsen, who plays Jonas, used to be a colleague of Mikael at the Swedish Social Insurance Agency. Bigge is an old friend of Mikael's. Stina is Carol's oldest friend in Sweden. All of the cast members have other careers.  Filming  Practically all of the games in the series take place in summer. This is because of the challenges of shooting during Swedish winter: too dark, few hours of sunshine, and packed streets. In addition there could be continuity errors created because of weather inconsistency: snow-filled one week and clear the next. Mikael shorts the field surveys early in the morning - starting at 4:00 am - due to the lighting and empty streets. When people unavoidably end up in his photos, he retouches them out. As the same locations are visited multiple times throughout the stories, he thinks it would be strange to the player to see the same character or moving object there at different times or on different days. Set in Mikael's hometown of Norrköping, Sweden, the games use photography and local history of the city as a backdrop.\\" Carol Reed's in-game apartment is Mikae's real life apartment, which he photographed for the game; meanwhile the dacha seen in the game is Eleen's summer holiday house. Sometimes he travels outside of the city; for instance the location of the in-game \\"Dead City\\" was an abandoned leper colony in Tenerife, Arico, Spain.  Writing  For the first few games in the series, Mikael took photos in summer then spent the next 6 months creating the game from the footage. The 2013-released title Cold Case Summer: The ninth Carol Reed Mystery took a post-production of 13 months to complete, and Mikael foresaw future games taking about the same amount of time. He put this down to three things: the games having a larger scope, him taking longer to take the photos, and him being slower to create the games due to his age. In terms of the tone, Mikael commented \\"Balancing light and dark, good and evil, etc, is no particular problem. That's simply the way life is\\".  Design  In regards to the gameplay mechanics, Mikael wanted to keep the interface as simple as possible and not provide a barrier between the player and the gaming experience. This includes simplifying mechanics like saving/loading, accessing the inventory, and mouse clicking hotspots. While the games were originally created using Adventure Maker and, Mikael switched to Wintermute Engine for East Side Story: The fourth Carol Reed Mystery. Mikael has made it a design philosophy to not be too ambitious, and only plan things he knows he will be able to pull off. There isn't any blood in the games and he avoids a shock/gore effect; while adventure gamers deem Carol Reed a 'non-bloody detective [series]\\", Mikael thinks that if the same games had been shot in the night time rather than sunny summer days they would have been classified as horror games.  Release  The games are exclusively available via the MDNA Games website. The team has had various American publishers, but prefer to work without one, because they do not have enough time from the tight release schedule.

Their life together began in 1821, the year he separated from his wife, Dominga Ortiz.  Early life  Nieves was born in 1803 on the plains of Apure in Venezuela Province, then part of the Captaincy General of Venezuela.  Mistress  Nieves introduced culture to Paez's life, prompting him to learn other languages and supporting theater and painting. According to José Antonio Calcaño, she was one of the motivations for Paez to begin reading the works of Alphonse de Lamartine, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Miguel de Cervantes. For more than 25 years, the couple lived between Valencia, Maracay and Caracas. They had two daughters, Úrsula and Juana De Dios. The British diplomat Robert Ker Porter was a frequent visitor of La Viñeta, where the family resided. In his diary, he speaks of the house meetings, with music and where the daughters danced for visitors. She died in Maracay on 14 December 1847. Nieves sickened in a critical moment for Páez, who had distanced himself from then President José Tadeo Monagas and was getting ready to confront him. Her death dramatically affected Páez, who referred to \\"the emptiness that her eternal absence has left\\" in a letter to his friend Carlos Arvelo.

He was the author of three books. Personal life and death Straus married Ellen Louise Sulzberger, the niece of Arthur Hays Sulzberger and cousin of Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, publishers of The New York Times. They had four children: Diane Straus Tucker; Katherine Straus Caple (married to Blair Charles Caple); Jeanne Straus Tofel (divorced from Richard Tofel); and Eric Straus (married to Elisabeth Natalie Sand). Ellen died in 1995. In 1998, he remarried to Marcia Lewis, the mother of Monica Lewinsky. Straus died on August 6, 2012 in Manhattan, at 89.

Sall, the wife of President Macky Sall, is the country's first First Lady to possess fully Senegalese heritage by birth and ethnicity, as her three predecessors have been of ethnic French or Lebanese origin. Faye Sall was born in the city of Saint-Louis, Senegal, as the fourth of her family's eight children. According to her official biography, she is of dual Peule and Serer descent. She attended primary school in Saint-Louis before moving to Diourbel, a city in the Diourbel Region of central Senegal with her family. She attended high school and graduated with a technical high school degree. Sall then enrolled at the Higher Institute of Technology at Cheikh Anta Diop University, where she studied electrical engineering, but did not graduate. She left Cheikh Anta Diop following the birth of her first child. Marieme Faye Sall met her future husband, Macky Sall, in 1992 while she was still in high school. She left her studies at Cheikh Anta Diop University in 1995 following her marriage and the birth of her first child. The couple have three children. During her husband's 2012 presidential campaign against incumbent President Abdoulaye Wade Marieme Faye Sall acted as a close advisor and supporter. However, she remained out of the day-to-day planning of her husband's Alliance for the Republic political party. Still, some publications close to President Wade sought to portray her as overly ambitious and pious during the campaign. Macky Sall defeated President Wade in a runoff held on March 25, 2012. Sall became the fourth First Lady of Senegal on April 2, 2012. Sall is Senegal's first black first lady, first Muslim first lady, as well as the first fully Senegalese first lady to be born and raised in the country. Senegal's first and third First Ladies, Colette Senghor and Viviane Wade (Sall's immediate predecessor), were both from France, while former First Lady Elizabeth Diouf, wife of former President Abdou Diouf, had a Lebanese father and a Senegalese mother. She was nicknamed a \\"real Senegalese lady\\" by many Senegalese women. Sall established the Serve Senegal Foundation during her tenure as first lady and heads the charity's board of directors.

Early Life and Education Born in Malden, Massachusetts, Sparrow was a graduate of Emerson College, and began her artistic instruction in Europe at age 16. Sparrow's father — Wellington Parker Kidder, the inventor of the noiseless typewriter — prints her first book of poetry, entitled Lyrics and Translations, in 1904. The volume won Sparrow admittance into The Boston Authors Club. Career Sparrow moved to Washington, D.C. around 1909 with her husband. There, she engaged in further studies in sculpture, working with Henry Kirke Bush-Brown, Edmund C. Messer, and Ulric Stonewall Jackson Dunbar. Primarily a sculptor of portrait busts, she exhibited in numerous local, national, and international exhibits. She was a member of the Society of Washington Artists and the American Artists's Professional League. Her work received a variety of honors during her career including a diploma of honor from the Paris Colonial Exposition in 1931 and a bronze medal from the 1930 exhibition of the Society of Washington Artists. Her plaster bust of Theodore E. Burton is currently in the collection of the United States Capitol; she is also represented in the collections of the Western Reserve Historical Society, the United States Military Academy, the United States Naval Observatory, the Montana State Capitol, and Howard University. Her involvement in a serious car crash in 1934 ended her sculpture career. In the late 1920s or early-to- mid-1930s, Sparrow was hired as Editor of Translations for Star-Dust, A Journal of Poetry. She also wrote over a dozen volumes of verse, the last titled Midnight Meditation and completed shortly before her death. Personal Life In 1909, Sparrow married Captain Herbert G. Sparrow of the United States Navy. The latter Sparrow died in 1924 when his ship, the , ran aground in Mexico; she later wrote the book The Last Cruise about the incident. In 1910, the couple's son, Herbert G. Sparrow, was born. The younger Herbert later became a major general in the United States Army. Louise Sparrow died in 1979 at Walter Reed Army Medical Center after a myocardial infarction. She is buried with her husband at Arlington National Cemetery. Legacy Sparrow's papers are today held at the Harvard University Libraries and National Museum of Women in the Arts. The latter institution holds a variety of tools used by Sparrow to sculpt.

In addition, some authorities expand the order to include the suborder Nandoidei, which includes three families - the Nandidae, Badidae and Pristolepididae \\\\- that appear to be closely related to the Anabantiformes. The order, and these three related families (classified as incertae sedis by the 5th edition of Fishes of the World), are part of a monophyletic clade which is a sister clade to the Ovalentaria, the other orders in the clade being Synbranchiformes, Carangiformes, Istiophoriformes and Pleuronectiformes. This clade is sometimes referred to as the Carangaria but is left unnamed and unranked in Fishes of the World. This group of fish are found in Asia and Africa, with some species introduced in United States of America. These fish are characterized by the presence of teeth on the parasphenoid. The snakeheads and the anabantoids are united by the presence of the labyrinth organ, which is a highly folded suprabranchial accessory breathing organ. It is formed by vascularized expansion of the epibranchial bone of the first gill arch and used for respiration in air.Pinter, H. (1986). Labyrinth Fish.

Established by decree on 26 December 2006, the university has since grown to comprise seven faculties. Lúrio offers degree programs in 21 disciplines, enrolling 1,430 total students, including both undergraduate and postgraduate students. Besides its main campus in Nampula, the university operates campuses in Pemba, Cabo Delgado Province, and Niassa Province. The university is named for the Lúrio River in northeastern Mozambique.  History  Lúrio University was established by decree No. 50/2006 of the Council of Ministers on 26 December 2006, published in the Boletim da República, and officially inaugurated on 29 June 2007 by President Armando Guebuza. Education Minister Aires Ali, among others, attended the inauguration. In 2007, the university rectory was organized in Nampula, at first occupying facilities provided by the Museum of Ethnology of Mozambique. This made it the first public university in the country headquartered outside of the capital, Maputo. On 21 August 2007 the university council held its first session, defining its vision, mission, structure, and a suitable acronym. The Latin Scientia, Cretum, Fides (\\"Science, Development, Commitment\\") was chosen as the motto, and UniLúrio was selected as an acronym. The university logo was also chosen, selected from various designs put forward through a contest promoted by Eduardo Mondlane University's Faculty of Architecture and Physical Planning. The university opened the Faculty of Health Sciences to students in 2007. The university started out with 20 instructors, 254 students, and three courses, medicine, dental medicine, and pharmacy. From the start, the university planned to eventually expand to three campuses. These goals came to fruition in 2008 and 2009, when satellite campuses were opened in Pemba, Cabo Delgado Province and Sanga, Niassa Province, respectively. The Pemba campus opened in temporary quarters in August 2008, and later moved onto a 12-hectare permanent campus. At the Pemba campus' opening, the Minister of Education said that Lúrio University \\"has positively surprised us, because without much uproar it is producing results.\\" By 2013, the university had 192 professors and 1,430 students. That year, the university reported it was planning to construct a 70-bed teaching hospital, and potentially an eye-hospital with Indian assistance. At that point, the university was using the Central Hospital of Nampula as its training hospital. During the rectorship of Jorge Ferrão, the university acquired significant debt.  Rectors  * Jorge Ferrão (c. 2013) * Francisco Pedro Noa (c. 2017)  Academics  Lúrio University comprises six faculties.

The Faculty of Agrarian Sciences provides engineering degrees with specialties in forestry, rural development, and zootechnics. The Faculty of Engineering awards degrees in computer engineering, civil engineering, geological engineering, mechanical engineering. The Faculty of Natural Sciences offers a bachelor's program in biological sciences. The Faculty of Architecture and Physical Planning offers two degrees: architecture and physical planning, and urban planning and spatial planning. The Faculty of Social and Human Sciences awards a bachelor's degree in tourism and hospitality, and a degree in international relations and development. The Business School offers three degrees: economics, business management, and accounting, taxation, and auditing. As of 2008, the university had 43 faculty, of which 46.5% were women, and a student-to-faculty ratio of 17:1. By 2013, the university had 192 faculty, and a student-to-faculty ratio of 7.4:1, one of the lowest in the country. Ten faculty members represent nationalities other than Mozambican. The university is aiming to reach 80% of its faculty having a master's degree or higher, and its ideal is to have 70% of the faculty with master's degrees and 30% with doctorates. {  +Lúrio University faculties ! ! ! - Health Sciences Nampula 2007 - Engineering and Natural Sciences Pemba 2008 - Agrarian Sciences Niassa 2009 - Engineering Pemba 2010 - Natural Sciences Pemba 2010 - Architecture and Physical Planning Nampula 2010 - Social and Human Sciences Nampula ? - Unilúrio Business School Nampula ? }  Campuses  Lúrio University has three campuses in northern Mozambique. The main campus, opened in 2007, is located in Marrere, Nampula Province, near the city of Nampula.

Biography Lender was born to a family who owned a construction company. He first studied at Tallinn's Alexander Gymnasium, later attending the Saint Petersburg State University's Department of Physics and Mathematics from 1896 to 1897, then later attending the St. Petersburg Institute of Technology from 1897 to 1902. After graduating from the latter, he worked as an engineer at the Dvigatel wagon factory in Tallinn until 1906, a lucrative position for the time. In 1904, Lender was elected as Tallinn's city councilor. From 1906 to 1913, he was the mayor of Tallinn while also working at the city's construction department. He primarily tackled issues concerning the economic and communal affairs of the increasingly urbanized population of the city. He was the first ethnic Estonian mayor of Tallinn, as a result of a coalition between Estonian and Russian politicians attempting to break the power that Baltic Germans had on politics in the Baltic states, and in Tallinn in particular, for centuries. This wave of Estonian and Russian politicians also included Konstantin Päts, the future President of Estonia, Jaan Teemant, the first mayor of Tallinn of Russian descent Erast Hiatsintov, and Otto Strandman, the future Prime Minister of Estonia. From 1903 to 1914, he had a building and engineering office where Anton Uesson (who worked at Lender's office from 1909 to 1912, constructing Jugendstil buildings in Tallinn), began his career as a civil engineer. Notable projects done by Uesson at Lender's company include the limestone historicism-inspired chapel at Rahumäe cemetery. Lender's office continued to function under his administration during his mayoralty. Voldemar Lender and his sons' graves at Metsakalmistu Lender was on the supervisory board of Harju Bank from 1919 to 1925. Lender's work primarily consisted of one-and two-story wooden tenement houses with symmetrical facades, called Lender houses. Despite not being the first designer nor the most productive designer of the design that bears his name, he formalized and carried out the supervision of their construction. The Lender-style houses were popular from the late 19th century to the early 20th century in the suburbs of Tallinn, known for their cheap construction costs and popularity among those who moved to (or desired to move to) Tallinn, at a time where Tallinn was experiencing large rates of urbanization. In the modern day, the houses that are still left are considered environmentally valuable housing estates, along with the areas that they are in being considered areas of cultural interest. Lender was also the chairman for the first meeting of the Estonian National Education Society (Estonian: Eesti Rahvahariduse Selts), with the goal of promoting Estonian-language public education at a time when Estonia was under the rule of the Russian Empire. Lender's wife, (née Meikov), was a teacher who founded the first Estonian-speaking girls' school in Estonia. They had four children: daughters Ilka and Juta, teachers, (1906–1942), a diplomat, and (1905–1991), a doctor and military captain. Lender received the second class order of the Order of the Cross of the Eagle on 14 January 1935. Ending in August of 2017, a competition to design a monument memorializing Voldemar and Elfriede Lender was held. The monument will be built near the Elfriede Lenderi Eragümnaasium, which Elfriede founded, in Torupilli district of Tallinn to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of Estonia in 2018.

The type and only species is S. astrosacralis. Discovery and naming Holotype on display in Tomsk State University The material assigned to Sibirotitan was found in the Shestakovo 1 locality of the Ilek Formation, deposited in a cliff on the Kiya River's right bank, near Shestakovo Village in Kemerovo Province, West Siberia, Russia. Vertebrate remains were first recovered in 1953, and larger dinosaur fossils were found later in the sixties. Definitive sauropod remains were first discovered during expeditions in 1994 and 1995. In 2002, a reasonably complete foot would be described by Russian vertebrate paleontologist Alexander Averianov and colleagues; there was insufficient material to name the taxon, but they identified it as a member of Titanosauriformes, noting teeth from the locality indicated possible brachiosaur identity, but that a caudal vertebra from a nearby locality indicated the presence of a titanosaur as well. Model Specimens would continue to turn up, and in 2017, Averianov et al. would name those which could be confidently referred to the same taxon as S. astrosacralis; this included teeth, a sacrum, assorted vertebrae, and the previously described foot. This made it the second sauropod species named from the country, after Tengrisaurus, named earlier in the same year; the genus Arkharavia, named in 2010, although originally described as a sauropod, was later reassigned to Hadrosauridae. Earlier, in 2015, it had been informally nicknamed \\"Sibirosaurus\\" in the press. The final name of Sibirotitan was derived from Siberia, where it was found, and the Greek Τιτάν (titan), the second group of divine beings in Greek Mythology, preceding the Olympians. The specific name S. astrosacralis is derived from the Greek ἄστρον, meaning \\"star\\", and Latin os sacrum, meaning \\"sacred bone\\". This refers to the star- like way in which the sacral ribs radiate in dorsal view. The authors noted that Sibirotitan was one of the oldest titanosauriform species discovered in Asia. More primitive known species were found in other parts of the world, such as Europe, North America, or Gondwana. Sibirotitan, alongside Fukuititan, are the first to appear in the Asian fossil record, both thought to have lived in the Barremian age. Later relatives are well known from Asia afterwards, from the Aptian through to the Santonian, and it is proposed that one of these later taxa could have given rise to the Lithostrotia, a titanosaur group whose earliest representatives are Asian genera such as Tengrisaurus (from the Barremian or Aptian of Russia) and Jiangshanosaurus (from the Albian of China). The latter was noted to have similar dorsal vertebrae to the much older Sibirotitan. Most of the referred specimens, although dis-articulated, are thought to have belonged to a single individual; it was suggested the large remains found in the 1960s could have originally been from the same skeleton as later remains, some found as recently as 2011. A singular cervical centrum was noted to be juvenile, and from a different individual, as the rest of the remains belonged to an adult animal. Among these fossils, PM TGU 120/10-Sh1-22, a dorsal vertebra, was selected as the holotype specimen. Description Two characters were found to distinguish it from its close relatives. The hyposphene ridge on its dorsal vertebrae was particularly high, unlike other members of Titanosauriformes; this is the only autapomorphy of the taxon. Its possession of only five sacral vertebrae distinguishes it from all other somphospondyls, as possession of six is a synapomorphy of the clade. It was noted that juveniles have fewer vertebrae, but given the adult age of the individual examined, the trait was instead seen as an evolutionary reversal. Using one of the cervical vertebrae, a size estimate was attempted. They found it roughly corresponded in size to that of the diplodocoid sauropod Apatosaurus, and suggested a similar size of 20 tonnes might have been possible. Classification Several characters were noted among the remains, four of which allowed classification in the group Titanosauriformes. These include the fashion in which the tooth crowns align in the jaw, presacral bone texture, and both the elongation of and the concave nature of certain parts of the cervical centra. An additional character, relating to the size of the arch of the cervical vertebrae, was used to assign it more specifically as a member of Somphospondyli. Characters in its vertebrae and ribs were found shared with Epachtosaurus and Euhelopus. A phylogenetic analysis was performed. It was noted that many differing and conflicting matrices exist for analyzing the systematics of Titanosauriformes, due to many taxa being poorly known. Because it is suited well for basal Titanosauriformes in particular, the matrix of Mannion et al. (2013) was chosen. In this analysis, it was found to be a relatively advanced non-titanosaurian somphosondyl.

By the 1920s, the town was controlled by Consolidated Naval Stores (now part of the Consolidated Tomoka Land Company); the only store in the town was the company's commissary. The population of the town was approximately 250 at its peak, large enough to secure it an official US Postal Service office. In 1929, the town was disassembled by Consolidated Naval Stores and relocated near Lake Placid, Florida. This was typical for turpentine operations once the trees needed for raw materials were used up. Archaeologists have found remnants of the clay cups used to catch the turpentine tapped from the area's trees near the site of the former town.

The couple lives with the Rahul's father Aaba. Rahul is a lawyer & Bhakti is a college professor. Rahul's partner in the law firm Nitin is also his good friend One day late night Aaba falls off their balcony & admitted to hospital. Inspector Nagargoje who looks very similar to Aaba & of same age comes for questioning Rahul. Rahul narrates him about bickering relationship between his father & wife. As a consequence there son Nishu is sent to boarding school so that he is not affected by this. 2 days before the incident they have a short 2 day trip to Lonavala which Bhakti leaves half-way & the two return next day. Nagargoje accuses both of them for abetment to suicide. He provides evidence that Aaba has committed suicide, which both deny. Later they get a call from hospital stating that Aaba has recovered from Comatose state however he is still unconscious. Later Rahul tells Bhakti that he had a showdown at Lonavala with Aaba & that could have triggered his suicide. Nagargoje calls them to his home late night & tells them it is not a suicide case. Both are enraged at him for causing such mental agony, however since they cannot do anything they leave peacefully. Next day Nagargoje meets Rahul at the court & puts a seed of suspicion that his wife has attempted to kill Aaba. Rahul wants to test his theory & brings him home. Nagargoje confronts Bhakti with evidence & finally she breaks downs. Rahul tries to defend her, however she confesses that she has attempted to kill Aaba with help of Nitin. Later Rahul visits Nagargoje & tries to convince him to drop charges. He tells him that the only way to save his wife is he has to confess to the crime & he would plead for lenient punishment in the court. When he returns home Bhakti tells Rahul that Nagargoje had visited her earlier in the day & told her that he suspects Rahul has tried to kill his father. To bring about the truth, she & Nitin should play along with him, confess that she attempted to kill Aaba & then Rahul would narrate the truth in a bid to save her. Next day Nagargoje comes with arrest warrant for Rahul & provides new evidences (which he had ignored earlier) to prove that he has attempted to kill Aaba. Rahul is arrested & later bailed out by Nitin. After a few days they receive a letter from Aaba which is a suicide note. Nagargoje later tells them that note or the signature did not match with Aaba's handwriting. Later Aaba regains consciousness & narrates the whole incident which was a plain accident & everyone is relieved. When they meet Nagargoje they have a lengthy discussion on eroding emotional bonding between parents & children. Both of them realise their mistake & ask forgiveness to Nagargoje & Aaba.

It was designed by Queensland Department of Public Works and built in 1922. It is also known as Marburg Rural School. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 9 October 2015.  History  Marburg State School opened in 1879 as Frederick State School (renamed Marburg State School in 1888) on a small site within the small agricultural settlement of Frederick, to serve its growing rural population. In February 1920, Marburg Rural School commenced in rented buildings until the rural school and primary school moved to the current school site in June 1922. The school has been in continuous operation since establishment and has been a focus for the local community as a place for important social and cultural activity. European occupation of the Rosewood Scrub and nearby Sally Owens Plains for pastoral purposes dates from the early 1840s.Marburg School Committee, Marburg State School 125th Anniversary, Marburg State School, Marburg, 2004, p. 4.

The original state school opened on a small sloping site in Edmond Street on 18 March 1879. The school, comprising a classroom and residence, was constructed by J Byers and had an average daily attendance during the first year was 31.8 pupils.Marburg Centenary Committee. Marburg School Centenary 1879-1979, pp. 5, 6, 8. The provision of state-administered education was important to the colonial governments of Australia. Following the introduction of Queensland's Education Act 1860, which established the Board of General Education and began standardising curriculum, training and facilities, Queensland's public schools grew from four in 1860 to 230 by 1875.Thom Blake, \\"Chapter 9: Educating Queenslanders\\" in Queensland Historical Thematic Framework, 2007 (rev. 2013 by EHP), p. 2. The Queensland Education Act 1875 provided for free, compulsory and secular primary education and the establishment of the Department of Public Instruction. This further standardised the provision of education, and despite difficulties, achieved the remarkable feat of bringing basic literacy to most Queensland children by 1900.Greg Logan and Eddie Clarke, State Education in Queensland: a brief history, a report for the Department of Education, Queensland, 1984, p. 2. The establishment of schools was considered an essential step in the development of early communities and integral to their success. Locals often donated land and labour for a school's construction and the school community contributed to maintenance and development. Schools became a community focus, a symbol of progress, and a source of pride, with enduring connections formed with past pupils, parents and teachers. The inclusion of war memorials and community halls reinforced these connections and provided a venue for a wide range of community events in schools across Queensland.Project Services, \\"Mount Morgan State High School\\" in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, for Education Queensland, 2008, pp. 4-5; Paul Burmester, Margaret Pullar, Michael Kennedy Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, a report for the Department of Education, 1996, pp. 87-8. To help ensure consistency and economy, the Queensland Government developed standard plans for its school buildings. From the 1860s until the 1960s, Queensland school buildings were predominantly timber-framed, an easy and cost-effective approach that also enabled the government to provide facilities in remote areas. Standard designs were continually refined in response to changing needs and educational philosophy and Queensland school buildings were particularly innovative in climate control, lighting, and ventilation. Standardisation produced distinctly similar schools across Queensland with complexes of typical components.Burmester, et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, pp. 84, 120-1. Marburg State School, at the original location, 1910 During the 1880s Marburg grew as a commercial centre for the surrounding agricultural area and as an administrative centre for Walloon Division (1879-1903).Project Services, \\"Marburg State School\\" in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, p. 3. In 1888 the school was renamed Marburg State School to reflect the town's change of name, and it continued to grow - with additions in 1888, reroofing in 1904, and repairs and improvements in 1908.Marburg Centenary Committee. Marburg School Centenary 1879-1979, p. 6. Growth of the town continued in the new century. Marburg gained rail connection to Ipswich and Brisbane when the Marburg branch railway was extended from Rosewood on the Main Line railway in 1911, but the siting of the Marburg railway station reduced the grounds of the school.Officially opened on 26 January 1912.

Additional land on the western side of the school reserve was added but was steep and unsuitable for a playground.Marburg Centenary Committee. Marburg School Centenary 1879-1979, p. 7. The idea of rural schools, to educate country children in practical subjects, arose in the early 20th century following the establishment in 1897 of the Queensland Agricultural College at Lawes near Gatton to train young men in agriculture and related sciences.Moreton Bay Courier, 6 Jul 1850. Hector Holthouse, Looking Back. The first 150 years of Queensland schools, a report for the Department of Education, Queensland, 1975, p. 128. The college, administered by the Department of Agriculture and Stock, was part of a wider scheme of introducing \\"scientific agriculture\\" to the colony, which included experimental farms and travelling model dairies.Greg Logan, \\"American Prophet among Queensland Farmers: the troubled career of EM Shelton, 1890-98\\" in Educational Historian, 3:1, 1990, pp. i-iv. Within the school system, a limited form of rural instruction was introduced in syllabus changes made in 1905 and 1915. John Douglas Story, Under-Secretary of Public Instruction from 1905, believed like many others, that Queensland's future depended on agricultural development. Between 1914 and 1916 he finalised a plan for three tiers of agricultural education - rural schools, state high schools, and University Agricultural Department. In 1910, to provide expert guidance from within the Department of Public Instruction, Story appointed James Clement Stubbin as Queensland's Teacher of Agriculture. Stubbin promoted the notion of a scientific approach to agriculture by writing a textbook on the school garden, agricultural bulletins, and constantly touring schools to give lessons on topics such as milk and cream testing, planting and pruning. In 1917 Queensland's first rural school was established as an adjunct to the Nambour State School.Brady, The Rural School Experiment, p. 4; Blake \\"Chapter 9: Educating Queenslanders\\", p. 12. Marburg State Rural School, 1926 With the success of the Nambour Rural School, the Department of Public Instruction decided to open three more rural schools in 1920, one of which was at Marburg.The others were at Boonah and Gracemere. Source: Brady, The Rural School Experiment, p. 152. Consequently, a 10-acre (approximately ) lot in Louisa Street, about to the northwest of the first school site but close to the Marburg town centre with its railway station, was purchased from A Beutel for £250 on 30 August 1920 as the future site of the Marburg Rural School.QSA, Item ID 16763, 20/42249. 'Crown Solicitor's Office, Brisbane: Marburg Rural', 30 Aug 1920 cited by Brady, The Rural School Experiment, p. 170. This proximity to the railway station was important because \\"pupils aged between 12 and 14 years and ex-pupils to 17 years were eligible for free rail travel and free tuition at a Rural School one day per week\\".Brady, The Rural School Experiment, p. 189, 249, 263-4; Marburg Centenary Committee.

Rural school classes were held in rented buildings in the Marburg Show grounds until 1922, when the former school buildings were transported to the new site and repurposed as vocational classrooms.Marburg School Committee, Marburg State School 125th Anniversary, p. 18. The purpose of rural schools was to educate children to enable them to develop rural areas and to provide a means of extending country children's education beyond the compulsory years with an additional year of agricultural and domestic studies.Tony James Brady, The Rural School Experiment: Creating a Queensland Yeoman, QUT, doctoral thesis, 2013, p. 167; 'Nambour's Rural School', Nambour Chronicle, 29 Oct 1915, p. 5 cited by Brady, The Rural School Experiment, p. 10. Altogether 30 rural schools opened in Queensland between 1917 and 1939. Each was located in prime fruit-growing, dairying or agricultural areas and functioned \\"as a central school for the surrounding district schools, teaching domestic, commercial, agricultural and vocational classes\\".Brady, The Rural School Experience, p. ii. The new sectional school building at Marburg State School was built to a Department of Public Works (DPW) standard design (D/T1), with some modifications, for £2990 and was ready for use on 29 January 1922.DPW drawing 1921; Project Services, \\"Mount Morgan State High School\\" in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, p. 6. A 1921 plan of the sectional school building shows it as a long, weatherboard-clad structure, highset on tall stumps, with a Dutch-gable roof and two circular roof vents. A teachers annexe was attached to the verandah on the northern side, and included one space for the head teacher and another for the assistant teachers. Stairs either side of the teachers' annexe provided access to the verandah, which was enclosed at the western end for hat and coat racks, and at the eastern end for use as a store room. Large banks of windows spanned the southern wall. The interior was divided into five wide classrooms of varying lengths, and a science room was located at the eastern end. Three western classrooms were connected via folding glass doors and each classroom featured a ceiling vent.ePlan, QLD Government Architect Drawing 25-15-3-1, \\"Marburg Rural School\\", 1921. Two vocational training buildings were constructed from the former school building, which was cut in half and moved to the site. Reconstruction and fitting out of the vocational building was supervised by a Mr Ash, for £215/10s, and was completed by 5 March 1923.'Marburg', Qld Times, 17 Jan 1923, p. 7 \\"Marburg State Rural School\\", Qld Times, 19 Feb 1923, p. 6. This included enclosing under the buildings with sheet metal. Its total cost was £718.Project Services, Marburg State School' in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, p. 6. The layout of the school grounds was designed by William Ernest Bick, curator of the Brisbane Botanic Gardens. His 1922 report stated that:Marburg Centenary Committee.

The work was to be completed through working bees and the government would supply the wire. During the same meeting, arrangements were made to plant shade trees on the northern side of the school grounds and it was noted that the Department of Public Instruction advised of its intention to construct a new teacher's residence.'Marburg', Qld Times, 17 Sep 1925, p. 3. Most Queensland state schools incorporated a teacher's residence on the site, particularly in rural areas. In Australia, only Queensland offered free accommodation to teachers, the government policy applying to male teachers (only) from as early as 1864. This was partial recompense for a low wage, an incentive for teacher recruitment in rural areas and provided onsite caretakers. Refinement of the standard residence design occurred over time, with each modification responding to teacher complaints and Teachers' Union agitation. Following World War I, teacher shortages were blamed on the inadequacy and shortage of teachers' residences. Consequently, many new teacher residences were constructed across Queensland in the 1930s and again following World War II.Blake, \\"Chapter 9: Educating Queenslanders\\", p. 4; Project Services, Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, pp. 33-5. Residences designed by the DPW's architects, and constructed to the high standard demanded by the state, were typically of a higher-quality in design, materials and construction than most similarly-scaled private residences. The detached teacher's residence was located within the school grounds at a distance from the teaching buildings, usually with a separate, fenced yard with gardens and trees. The designs ranged from one to four bedrooms and evolved simultaneously with the teaching buildings to keep up with modern needs and styles. Teacher's residence from the south-west, 2015 A new teacher's residence was built at Marburg Rural School in 1926 for £1145. It was located on the eastern side of the site and faced south toward the entry driveway. The 1926 plan shows the residence as a highset structure, with an front verandah and a rear verandah - the rear verandah was enclosed with weatherboard cladding and casement windows. Southern and eastern stairs accessed the front and rear verandahs, respectively. The interior comprised a core of three bedrooms and a dining room arranged around a central hallway; and a rear wing included a kitchen with stove alcove, pantry, bathroom, and servant's room. The understorey housed a wash house (below the kitchen).ePlan, Department of Public Works (DPW) Drawing 202-28-2, \\"Marburg Rural School, Revised plan of residence\\", 1926. In the same year, a fence was constructed around the residence and the understorey was enclosed with battens.Marburg Centenary Committee. Marburg School Centenary 1879-1979, p. 9. Entrance to the forestry plot, from south, 2015 The school retains a forestry plot in the north-east corner of the site, which was the first established in Queensland in 1928.'Forestry Week Marburg Rural School', Queensland Times, 11 April 1934, p. 6. Forestry plots were the product of after-school agricultural clubs, introduced in 1923 at primary schools, under the \\"home project\\" scheme. Curriculum driven, these clubs had a secondary commercial value as well as disseminating information and helping to develop a range of skills. The Department of Primary Industry provided suitable plants and offered horticultural advice.State Education in Queensland 1927, p. 26; lnformation from Greg Logan, History Unit, Department of Education cited by Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, p. 61. School forestry plots were seen by the government as a way of educating the next generation about the economic and environmental importance of trees, as well as providing testing grounds for new species. Located throughout the state, the plots were a means of experimenting with a variety of tree species in different soil and climatic conditions. The sale of timber grown in school plots provided an additional source of income for the school, and the plots themselves were an attractive feature of school grounds. At Marburg State Rural School 275 exotic and indigenous trees were planted initially. Encouraged by the Education and Forestry Departments, by 1953 about 380 Queensland schools were undertaking forestry projects.The Courier Mail, 11 Apr 1934, p. 10; Queensland Times, 19 Nov 1949, p. 5; Queensland Country Life, 2 Nov 1950, p. 4; Queensland Times, 10 Jul 1951, p. 2; Central Queensland Herald, 12 Jul 1951, p. 16; The Courier Mail, 16 May 1953, p. 3; Queensland Times, 2 Jun 1954, p. 2. An account in the school's 125th Anniversary Book recalls that the trees were ordered from the Department of Forestry, planted in rows, and spaced two metres apart.Marburg School Committee. Marburg State School 125th Anniversary, p. 48. Trees planted include: Bunya Pine (Araucaria bidwillii), Kauri Pine (Agathis robusta), Crows Ash (Flindersia australis), Mexican Cedar (Taxodium mexicanum), Pinus longifolia, Pinus radiata, Pinus insularis and Silky Oak (Grevillea robusta). Ongoing planting occurred. The trees remaining include Hoop Pine (Araucaria cunninghamii), Kauri Pine, Silky Oak and Norfolk Island Pine (Araucaria heterophylla). In addition to the usual school subjects, farm-craft, leatherwork, blacksmithing and domestic science were taught.Marburg Centenary Committee. Marburg School Centenary 1879-1979, p. 14. Other activities at the Marburg Rural School were a calf club; a forestry nursery germinating seeds of selected hardwoods and softwoods, and planting the seedling tubes around Marburg; an orchard of citrus and nut trees; pasture renovations using grasses, legumes and fertilizers; potato growing; milk and cream testing; pig raising on the school farm; room competitions; and meal preparation.Marburg Centenary Committee. Marburg School Centenary 1879-1979, p. 13. As well as the forestry plot, other landscaping and tree planting took place in the school grounds. An orchard was created on the site of the current pre-school; an ant-bed surfaced tennis court was added by the school community in 1927, to the west of the teacher's residence, after levelling of the site; and paths and gardens were laid out between the school buildings by the early 1930s. Eighteen fig trees (17 small leafed and one with large leaves) lining the driveway from the entrance gate to the school buildings were planted in the 1930s.John Oxley Library (JOL) photograph Neg. No. 35177, 1930s aerial. The rural school scheme was phased out between the 1940s and 1960s due to a move to larger farms by the late 1940s and the consequent decline in government emphasis on closer settlement; as well as the transfer of domestic, vocational and commercial subjects to the curriculum of the growing number of state high schools.Brady, The Rural School Experiment, pp. 270-1. Marburg Rural School reverted to a state school in 1963 after the cessation of vocational and domestic science training at the school. In 1959 the vocational building burnt down and classes were transferred to Ipswich. Domestic science classes ceased in 1963 and the building was sold for removal. This change coincided with a decline in Marburg's population towards its lowest level in the late 1960s.Marburg, Haigslea, Ironbark, , accessed 29 Oct 2014. Additions and alterations to the school continued in the post-World War II period. In 1959 improvements to the lighting of the sectional school building were made for £855.Project Services, \\"Marburg State School\\" in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, p. 6; ePlan, DPW Drawing 11435446, \\"Marburg Rural SS, Improvements to lighting\\", 1959. Also at this time, the eastern store room was removed from the verandah of the sectional school building. Hat and bag racks were added, and louvres were inserted into the building's verandah walls.ePlan, DPW Drawing 11435446, \\"Marburg Rural SS, Improvements to lighting\\", 1959. A 1969 plan indicates the extension of the teachers annexe by to the north to accommodate a staff-room and services-room. At this time, the building's internal partitions were also altered to accommodate four larger classrooms; and the southeastern and northwestern walls were replaced to include new openings.ePlan, DPW Drawing 11901032, \\"Marburg SS, Alt. and addit. to existing classroom block\\", 1969. Minor alterations have been made to the teacher's residence since its construction. The front verandah has been enclosed with weatherboard cladding and most external windows have been replaced with aluminium frames (the openings remain in their original locations).Site inspection, Department of Environment and Heritage Protection (EHP) officers, 19 Mar 2015; ePlan, DPW Drawing 202-28-2, \\"Marburg Rural School, Revised plan of residence\\", 1926. A 1966 plan shows the addition of a weatherboard-clad toilet extension on the eastern side of the rear verandah, and to accommodate this, the repositioning of the eastern set of stairs.ePlan, DPW Drawing 11901054, \\"Marburg SS, New toilet block and residence WC\\", 1966. In 1966 a new toilet block north of the sectional school building was installed. A modular pre-school building was added in 1978 southeast of the sectional school building, on the former orchard site, and replaced in 1990-1 by a new building southeast of the residence.Project Services, \\"Marburg State School\\" in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, p. 6;. The modular pre-school building, adjacent the sectional school building, was removed from the site between November 2014 and March 2015.Google Earth Aerial, 29 Nov 2014; Site inspection, EHP, 2015. The tennis court was relocated to the southwestern corner of the site between 2005 and 2009; and in 2015 the location of the original tennis court is used as a car- park. In 2009 Marburg State School was granted $250,000 for the construction of a multi-purpose hall as part of the Building the Education Revolution project (Primary Schools for the 21st Century (P21) component). This multi- purpose hall was constructed by January 2012 and is located southeast of the sectional school building. The flagpole on site in the 1920s is not extant in 2015. Celebrations of the school's 75th Jubilee were held in 1954, its centenary in 1979 and its 125th anniversary in 2004. The latter two events included publication of the school's history. The school's bell, which had been stolen, was replaced in 1979 and is located northwest of the sectional school building in 2015. In 2015, the school continues to operate from its 1922 site. It retains its sectional school building, teacher's residence, forestry plot and horse paddock, as well as its landscaped grounds. The school is important to Marburg, having been a focus for the community and generations of Marburg and district students have been taught there. Since establishment it has been a key social focus for the Marburg community with the grounds and building serving as the venue for many social events.  Description  Map of school layout, 2015 Marburg State School occupies the whole of an approximately sloping block within the small rural township of Marburg in the Brisbane Valley. The school complex is accessed via Louisa Street and is surrounded by agricultural and residential properties. Visible from the school entrance and at the highest point of the site is a sectional school building (1922). East of the sectional school building, a teacher's residence (1926) faces south to front the entrance driveway. The landscaped grounds are well- established and include an avenue of mature fig trees along the length of the curved driveway that provides an attractive entrance to the school. The layout of the grounds is clearly divided into areas based on use, including: a teaching area with playing field at the southern end; a residence with garden area to the east; a mature forestry plot in the northeastern corner; and a former horse paddock in the northwestern corner. The school is prominent in its rural location and is clearly visible from the adjacent Warrego Highway. 1922 sectional school building (Block A)  thumb Sectional school building from rear, 2015 The 1922 sectional school building is a highset, timber-framed structure that is clad in weatherboards and stands on combination of timber, concrete and metal stumps. The building is long and narrow, running on a northeast-southwest axis, and has a corrugated metal- clad, Dutch-gable roof with circular roof ventilators and additional gablets on the southeastern side. The teachers annexe on the northwestern side has a hipped roof. The building has timber floors and access is via timber stairs to the northern verandah (now enclosed). An early timber-framed casement window with a horizontally centre-pivoting fanlight is retained in the southwestern wall of the teachers annexe. Recent additions that are not of cultural heritage significance include: modern windows; verandah wall openings; flat sheet wall and ceiling linings; and linoleum and carpet floor linings. The northern verandah has a raked ceiling clad in v-jointed (VJ) tongue and groove (T&G;) timber boards. A small section of early VJ, T&G; wall lining is located within the verandah wall of the teachers annexe. The interior is divided into four classrooms by modern partitions, although timber lattice ceiling vents and metal tie rods indicate the original five-room layout. The coved ceiling is hipped at the end-walls and is lined with VJ, T&G; timber boards. The teachers annexe comprises four administration and storage rooms organised around a central hallway. The two northwesternmost rooms are a modern extension. All walls and ceilings are lined with modern flat sheeting, and the timber floor is lined with modern linoleum. The understorey has a concrete slab floor and is partially enclosed with timber battening and corrugated metal sheeting. It is used as a shaded play-space and has storage rooms at the southwestern end, enclosed with corrugated metal sheeting - some sections of the corrugated metal sheeting have early Lysaght stamps. 1926 teacher's residence  Interior hall of residence showing vertically-jointed tongue- and-groove joinery, 2015 The 1926 teacher's residence is highly intact. The building is highset on tall concrete stumps, clad in weatherboards and has a corrugated metal-clad hipped roof. It comprises a core of bedrooms, with a verandah (now enclosed) at the front (south) and a dining verandah (enclosed) at the rear (north), and a rear wing attached to the northern side of the dining verandah. Timber stairs provide access to the front and rear verandahs. Wide, timber-framed, corrugated metal-clad window hoods shelter windows on the eastern and western sides, and rounded metal hoods shade the northern windows. Early timber joinery is retained throughout the building including: low- waisted French doors with 2-light fanlights from the core to the front verandah and dining room; low-waisted timber doors with fanlights to the core's central hallway; VJ timber-clad doors to the pantry in the rear wing and to the understorey washhouse enclosure; and a double-hung timber sash window to the pantry. Other windows are modern, set within original openings. The entry landing (including toilet) on the eastern side of the building is modern and not of cultural heritage significance. The front verandah retains its single-skin verandah wall, with post and belt rails supporting VJ, T&G; timber boards. Its raked ceiling is lined with modern flat sheeting. The core comprises three bedrooms and a living room, centred around a short hallway. The rear wing includes an eastern kitchen with stove alcove, a central bathroom and pantry, and an eastern former servant's room. All interior walls and ceilings are lined with VJ timber boards; the north and south walls of the dining verandah are single-skin with post-and-belt-rails exposed. The walls of the stove alcove are lined in flat sheeting. A small window seat built into the western wall of the dining room is lined in VJ, T&G; timber boards. Skirtings and cornices throughout are timber and of a simple profile. The building's timber floors are lined with modern carpet and linoleum. The understorey has a concrete slab floor and is enclosed with timber, battened screens. A washhouse at northeastern end is enclosed with flat sheeting.  Grounds and Views  Driveway with fig trees, 2015 Playing fields, 2015 The school grounds are established and well laid-out. The school is prominent in its location and the sloping nature of the site provides opportunities for views of the surrounding, rural area to be obtained from within the school grounds and the school buildings. The driveway, running approximately northwest from the school entrance toward the sectional school building, features an avenue of established small-leaf fig trees (Ficus spp.), with one large leaf-fig tree (Ficus sp.) at the southern end. The avenue enhances the school's prominence in its location, provides a picturesque setting for the school and generates a strong sense of place upon entry to the school. North of the teacher's residence, a variety of hoop pines (Araucaria cunninghamii), Norfolk pines (Araucaria heterophylla) and kauri pines (Agathis robusta) stand within a forestry plot; sections of which are planted in rows. The forestry plot is accessed from the southern end via a gateway with a metal sign featuring the words, \\"Environmental Park; QLD's 1st School Forestry Plot; est. 1928\\". Horse paddock, 2015 In the northwestern corner of the grounds is the horse paddock - a fenced, grassed area that slopes down to a northern creek- bed and features several shade trees.  Other structures  Sheds, play equipment, walkways, tennis courts, the multi-purpose hall, and other structures within the school grounds are not of cultural heritage significance.  Heritage listing  Marburg State School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 9 October 2015 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Marburg State School, established in 1879, is important in demonstrating the evolution of state education and its associated architecture in Queensland. It retains good examples of standard government designs that were architectural responses to prevailing government educational philosophies. At Marburg State School these standard designs are: a sectional school building (1922), which demonstrates the evolution of Department of Public Works (DPW) timber school designs to provide equally for educational and climatic needs; and the highly-intact teacher's residence (1926), which provides evidence of Departmental policy to provide accommodation for married male head teachers as an inducement to teach in country areas and to provide a resident caretaker on the site. The school is important surviving evidence of the establishment of rural schools in Queensland, a popular initiative to provide a practical education for rural students and encourage them to stay on the land. The forestry plot (1928), the first established in Queensland, is important surviving evidence of a movement to convey the economic and environmental importance of forestry to students while creating an attractive landscape feature and income for schools. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Marburg State School is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of Queensland state schools with their later modifications. These include: timber-framed buildings constructed to standard designs by the Queensland Government; and generous, landscaped sites with mature shade trees and play areas. The teacher's residence is an excellent, intact example of its type - retaining its highset, hipped roof and weatherboard-clad form with early joinery; and comprising a core of three bedrooms and a living room, a front verandah (now enclosed), a rear dining verandah (enclosed), and a rear kitchen and bathroom wing. The sectional school building is a good example of its type, retaining its highset form with play space beneath, gable roof, blank end walls, northern verandah, large south-facing windows, projecting teachers rooms, and internal features such as coved ceilings lined in tongue- and-groove boards. The forestry plot at Marburg is an excellent example of its type, containing several pine tree species planted in rows. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Marburg State School, with its grounds designed by William Ernest Bick (horticulturalist, landscaper and curator of the Brisbane Botanic Gardens 1917-40), is important for its aesthetic significance. It possesses beautiful attributes due to the intactness of its well-composed original layout, which includes: a Fig-lined driveway that gracefully sweeps from the entrance, uphill around the school oval and to the school buildings; a forestry plot; a horse paddock; mature trees; and expansive rural views. The sloping grounds are divided into areas designated for specific uses, creating a harmonious park-like landscape within a rural setting. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Schools have always played an important part in Queensland communities. They typically retain significant and enduring connections with former pupils, parents, and teachers; provide a venue for social interaction and volunteer work; and are a source of pride, symbolising local progress and aspirations. Marburg State School has a strong and ongoing association with the Marburg community. It was established in 1879 through the fundraising efforts of the local community and generations of Marburg children have been educated there. The place is important for its contribution to the educational development of Marburg and district and is a prominent community focal point and gathering place for social and commemorative events with widespread community support.

Built with dry-masonry technique, Enguera (Valencia · España). The cuco is a type of construction made with the dry stone technique, in Valencia. Within the Valencian autonomous community (Comunidad Valenciana) they are located geographically in the regions of the valley of Ayora–Cofrentes, La Costera and La Canal de Navarrés. The latter concentrates the greatest number of these constructions, highlighting quantitatively the entire municipality of Enguera.(es:) En Enguera se construyen en fincas agrícolas, alejadas del casco urbano. La amplitud de su término municipal favoreció su proliferación (In Enguera, they are built on agricultural farms, far from the urban center.

Two types of stone are used, the limestone that is used in the body of the construction, the one that holds the cover and the cover stone (tap: (es:) Margas muy calcáreas, de color claro, que en este ámbito geográfico se conocen con el nombre de \\"tap\\" (Very calcareous margas, of a light color, which in this geographical area are known as \\"tap\\") · (Darder, 1929, 603). white marls), lighter, on the deck.Cuco. Detail of the wall on which the roof rests. Enguera (Valencia).  Typology  The typology of the constructions is very varied. Round-plan constructions predominate, although those of quadrangular plan are frequent. In occasion the cuco adapts to the relief of the land and adopts an irregular plan. The covering systems are all the same. A false dome is built by approaching courses. The covering of the access spans is made with large slabs as a lintel. Other typologies are documented as two slabs supported on both sides of the span, the approach of courses or the adovelado (with dovelas) arch (built with irregular slabs arranged radially). Inside the cucos complementary structures are found: fireplace, cupboard, manger, etc. They are usually free buildings, although sometimes they are attached to the roadways (terraces); or they can have a quadrangular annex space.

Over the last fifty years, academic research has identified hundreds of factors that impact stock returns. Security characteristics that may be included in a factor-based approach includes size, value, momentum, asset growth, profitability, leverage, term and carry. A factor-based investment strategy involves tilting equity portfolios towards and away from specific factors in an attempt to generate long-term investment returns in excess of benchmarks. The approach is quantitative and based on observable data, such as stock prices and financial information, rather than on opinion or speculation.  History and evolution  The earliest theory of factor investing originated with a research paper by Stephen A. Ross in 1976 on Arbitrage Pricing Theory, which argued that security returns are best explained by multiple factors. Prior to this, the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), theorized by academics in the 1960s, held sway. CAPM held that there was one factor that was the driver of stock returns and that a stock’s expected return is proportional to its beta, or sensitivity to equity market returns. In the following decades, academic research has identified more factors that impact stock returns. For example, in 1981 a paper by Rolf Banz established a size premium in stocks: smaller company stocks outperform larger companies over long time periods, and had done so for at least the previous 40 years. In 1993, Eugene F. Fama and Kenneth B. French published a seminal paper that demonstrated a value premium, or the fact that expected returns of value stocks were higher than for growth stocks. The roots of value investing date to decades earlier with the work of Benjamin Graham and David Dodd as outlined in their 1934 book Security Analysis, and their student Warren Buffett outlined their findings and application in his 1984 article \\"The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville\\". In 1993, Sheridan Titman and Narasimhan Jegadeesh showed that there was a premium for investing in high momentum stocks. Other significant factors that have been identified are measures of corporate profitability, asset growth, external financing, leverage and research and development costs.  The value factor  The earliest and most well-known factor is value, which can be defined primarily as change in the market valuation of earnings per share (\\"multiple expansion\\"), measured as the PE ratio. The opportunity to capitalize on the value factor arises from the fact that when stocks suffer weakness in their fundamentals, the market typically overreacts to it and values them extremely cheaply relative to their current earnings. A systematic quantitative value factor investing strategy therefore buys those stocks at their cheapest point and holds them until the market becomes less pessimistic about their prospects and re-values their earnings.

Nashville, Tennessee, has hosted professional baseball teams since the late 19th century at five ballparks around the city. The first was Sulphur Springs Ball Park, later renamed Athletic Park, but best known as Sulphur Dell, which was the home of Nashville's minor league teams from 1885 to 1963. A number of Negro league teams competed at Sulphur Dell, which was demolished in 1969, as well as at Greenwood Park and Tom Wilson Park. In 1978, Herschel Greer Stadium was built on the grounds of Fort Negley, an American Civil War fortification just south of downtown. Greer served as the home of the Nashville Sounds for 37 seasons until they left for the new First Horizon Park, located at the site of Sulphur Dell, in 2015. Greer was demolished in 2019.

In the 1850s, a portion of the land was re-purposed for baseball. By 1870, the baseball grounds were referred to as \\"Athletic Park\\". In 1885, a wooden grandstand was built at the corner of modern-day Fourth Avenue North and Jackson Street to accommodate fans of the Nashville Americans, who were charter members of the original Southern League. Several other minor league teams followed the Americans, but the ballpark's longest tenant was the Southern Association's Nashville Vols, who played there from 1901 to 1963. Sportswriter Grantland Rice started referring to the ballpark as \\"Sulphur Spring Dell\\" in 1908, which he later shortened to \\"Sulphur Dell\\". The original grandstand was situated with home plate facing the southwest toward the Tennessee State Capitol building. Consequently, batters would often have to compete with the afternoon sunlight shining in their eyes. After the 1926 season, the entire ballpark was demolished and rebuilt as a concrete-and-steel structure with home plate in the southwest corner facing northeast along Fourth Avenue North. Sulphur Dell's infamous outfield was born out of this realignment. The second configuration included a significant \\"terrace\\" or sloping outfield: a steep incline that ran along the entire outfield wall, most dramatically in right and center fields. In its prime, Sulphur Dell was nestled in an area that was home to the city's garbage dump, stockyards, and other various warehouses. The Vols left after the conclusion of the 1963 season. Amateur baseball teams played there in 1964, and it was converted to a speedway for three weeks in 1965. The stadium then served as a tow-in lot for Metro Nashville, before being demolished on April 16, 1969. Until 2014, it was the location of a number of parking lots used by state employees. In 2015, the city built First Tennessee Park on the site.

In addition to picnic space, amusement riders, and a swimming pool, the grounds were home to a baseball diamond used by the independent Nashville Standard/Elite Giants from 1920 to 1928 and other Negro league teams. The park was demolished after its 1949 closure.

It opened in 1929 to serve as the home park for owner Thomas T. Wilson's Nashville Elite Giants, a Negro league team which competed in Nashville in several circuits from 1929 to 1930 and 1932 to 1934. The ballpark also served as a spring training site for other Negro league teams. Wilson discontinued all baseball activities at the park in 1946, and it was later demolished.

The facility closed at the end of the 2014 baseball season, after which the Sounds left for the new First Tennessee Park. Greer remained deserted for over four years until its demolition in 2019. Amidst the Sounds' 37-season run, Greer simultaneously hosted two professional baseball clubs in 1993 and 1994, acting as a temporary home to a displaced Southern League franchise known during that period as the Nashville Xpress. They were named for the railroad tracks located just beyond the right-center field wall to the stadium's east-southeast. Greer was best recognized by its distinctive guitar-shaped scoreboard, which measured 115.6 feet (35.2 m) across, 53 feet (16 m) high, and 2 feet (0.61 m) deep.

He usurped the throne from his father some time in 383 BC after his failed war against Oktamasades's mother, Tirgatao. Biography His accession to the throne was likely backed by the Sindian aristocracy, as his father was probably unpopular due to his previous affairs and having been restored by Satyros I who perhaps made him even more unpopular. In the ensuing days of his accession to the throne, he was induced by his mother to make war on the Bosporan Kingdom who was at the time under the rule of the ambitious and militaristic ruler, Leukon. Heeding to his mother's words, he attacked the Bosporan city of Labrytai which provoked Leukon into a battle. It can be speculated that Leukon was already setting his sights in fully annexing the Sindians, and used this as an excuse to finally do so. In the following Battle of Labrytai, Leukon completely routed Oktamsades's forces and forced him to flee into Scythia. After this battle, nothing more is known about him.

Jade lingling-o from Vietnam Jade lingling-o from Vietnam with the double-headed animal motif Lingling-o or ling-ling-o, is a type of penannular or double-headed pendant or amulet that has been associated with various late Neolithic to late Iron Age Austronesian cultures. Most lingling-o were made in jade workshops in the Philippines, and to a lesser extent in the Sa Huỳnh culture of Vietnam, although the raw jade was mostly sourced from Taiwan. The earliest surviving examples of lingling-o, dating back to around 500 BC, were made out of nephrite jade, but many later examples were made of shell, gold, copper, and wood; the kind of material suggests differences in the social standing of its wearer. The term was first popularized by H. Otley Beyer, who adapted it from the Southern Ifugao name for such ornaments. The term has since also come to be used as a blanket term for various metal age Austronesian ornaments found in the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam.  Batanes workshop site Earlier historians have posited that the earliest lingling-o artifacts found in the Philippines were created outside of the archipelago, but an expedition to the northern Philippine province of Batanes, led by archeologist Peter Bellwood in the early 2000s, led to the discovery of a lingling-o workshop, complete with construction tools and fragments. The find provides evidence of indigenous Philippine manufacture of lingling-o as early as 2,500 years ago. Lingling-o manufacturing survived until around AD 1000 in the Philippines.

H. Clark's Halifax Street Brewery 1844 Crawford brothers Edward James Frederick \\"Fred\\" Crawford (c. 1809 – 8 May 1880) and George Tinline were partners in a brewery, which by 1844 was producing an ale of marketable quality. From that year on, Tinline's name did not appear with reference to the brewery; though it is likely that being a banker, his interest in the business was only ever financial, and remained so. The brewery then operated as \\"Crawford Brothers\\", though the name of no brother ever appeared in connection with the brewery. James Field Crawford (1815 – 24 May 1906), the explorer, and Thomas George Tremlett Crawford (c. 1825 – 5 September 1911) were brothers, for whom Mt. Crawford may have been named. Fanny Crawford (1829 – 7 April 1898), who married publican Charles James Ware (c. 1824 – 19 December 1891), was a daughter of William Crawford, arrived aboard D'Auvergne March 1839, and probably not related. T. G. T. Crawford may have been the Thomas George Crawford of Newbridge Brewery which wound up in 1876. The brewery was situated on Lot 83, Manton Street, Hindmarsh, which Crawford leased from Daniel Cudmore, and later purchased; the area today bounded by Orsmond, Milner, and Manton streets, and Crawford Lane. :The site was noted for the safe drinking water which the brewery extracted from an aquifer, using a pump built by John Ridley, and made available to nearby residents. Echoes of the facility now operating outside the Southwark brewery, barely a kilometre away. In 1850 Crawford purchased from Luther Scammell a strip of land, soon dubbed Brewery Lane, for better access from the Port Road to his brewery. At a later date this was known as Kangaroo Lane, and is now Crawford Lane. :In July 1854 W. H. Clark, with partners J. B. Spence, J. H. Parr and Edward Logue, took over Crawford Brothers' Hindmarsh Brewery in order to close it down and supply its customers from their Halifax Street brewery. The business continued however under Crawford, but under what conditions it has not yet been found. In 1859, under financial stress, he assigned the property to his creditors. Around this time Crawford was manager of the Pirie Street Brewery. In 1861 he purchased the brewery founded in 1859 by Watson & Borrers, on Hindmarsh Lot 162 on nearby Richards Street.Now \\"Richard Street\\", it was named for P.M. Richards, an early member of the board of management. Lot 162 was closer to Chapel Street than the Manton Street corner. and taken over the following year by the short-lived partnership of Bauer & Coulthard. Crawford was an avid real estate speculator, which may have been the cause of his bankruptcy in 1867 after four years of drought and recession, and he departed for Ararat, Victoria out of reach of his creditors. The property was purchased by Haussen & Catchlove. In 1869 E. J. F. Crawford founded the Crawford and Moyle brewery, later Crawford Brothers, and did much to encourage local hop growing. The brewery closed sometime before 1875 and he was employed at the Victoria Brewery, Sale, Victoria. He and his wife died there, she in 1877 and he died intestate in 1880. Probate was granted to his eldest son James John Crawford (1848– ) in 1894 and published ten years later. John James Crawford settled in Koroit, perhaps initially in straitened circumstances but grandson Sidney Crawford (1885–1968) became a wealthy and influential Adelaide businessman.Susan Marsden, 'Crawford, Sidney (1885–1968)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/crawford-sidney-9859/text17443, published first in hardcopy 1993, accessed online 12 February 2018. Haussen & Catchlove Henry Hermann Haussen (1 September 1830 – 28 December 1870) was born in London, a son of Otto Carl Haussen (c. 1781 – 11 August 1862) and Maria Haussen (c. 1784 – 15 June 1865), who emigrated to South Australia aboard John, arriving in September 1839 with their children Otto Charles Haussen (c. 1821 – 16 October 1881) married Henriette Wormker (spelling?) in 1850, Emily Rose, Emma and Henry Hermann. Emily Rose, the youngest daughter, married G.A.F. Heseltine on 7 May 1846. Haussen established a potato business in Gouger Street, Adelaide that operated 1859–1870; much of the business being importation of seed potatoes from Van Diemen's Land (today's Tasmania). George Henry Catchlove (c. 1830 – 17 October 1892) and his widowed father Henry Catchlove (c. 1806–1867) arrived in June 1839 aboard Hooghly. Henry's brother Edward William Catchlove (c. 1878–1846) arrived in November 1836 aboard Tam O'Shanter with a larger family. His wife Harriet died en voyage. Edward was licensee of the Shipwright's Arms, Albert Town (today's Alberton), transferred it to George in 1845. Advertising logo, Haussen & Catchlove's Hindmarsh Ales The Hindmarsh Brewery was purchased in 1868 from Crawford's bankrupt estate by Haussen and his brother-in-law Catchlove, operating it originally as Crawford & Co., then Haussen & Catchlove. The brewery's cellars, dubbed \\"the warren\\", were extensive, totalling about , and remarkable for requiring no timbering or brickwork, as the ground was of a most tenacious type of clay. They had offices at 63 Hindley Street, which from January 1869 also carried a wide range of imported ale, wines and spirits. The number 62 Hindley Street was a misprint and later corrected. They also had an office and warehouse at Port Adelaide. The company only produced their beverages in barrels for supply to licensed premises, but at least one company made a business of bottling their ales and porters: this was R. Strutton of Gilbert Place, later of Blyth Street. Haussen died in 1870, and his wife continued as partner in the business until 1874 when it was purchased by Frederick Estcourt Bucknall and Frank South Botting (c. 1849–1894), but continued trading as Haussen & Co. Some time after 1881 Bucknall, who was Mayor of Hindmarsh 1880–1883, ceased to have any involvement in the Company, perhaps as late as 1886 when he lost most of his fortune with the failure of the Commercial Bank of South Australia. Botting and his father Francis Joseph Botting (1819–1906) took over the business. Frank Botting died in November 1894, and his father became sole proprietor. A public company Haussen & Co. Ltd. was established in 1910 to operate the Richards Street brewery, which continued operation until 1927, when it was absorbed by the Walkerville Cooperative Brewing Co.. Haussen & Co. continued as owners of their various hotels, but contracted to that company (which despite its name was located at Southwark) for their supplies. (Auguste John) Charles De Bavay (died 10 November 1962), son of Auguste Joseph Francois De Bavay OBE (1856–1944) was head brewer 1913, and introduced new methods and equipment.  Strutton & Trapmann  In 1876 Robert Strutton (died 1919) and Carl Wilhelm Ferdinand Trapmann (Mayor of Hindmarsh 1876–1877; died 1885) opened the \\"Kangaroo Brewery\\" on the site of the old Hindmarsh Brewery. The business closed in 1884, but the \\"Kangaroo Brewery\\" sign, and the informal name \\"Kangaroo Lane\\" (now Crawford Lane) persisted into the 20th century.

The forecast may give the pollutants concentration or the air quality index. Countries and cities are given forecasts by state and local government organizations, as well as private companies like Airly, AirVisual, Aerostate, BreezoMeter, PlumeLabs, and DRAXIS that give air pollution forecast. Techniques * Air pollution forecasting can be done by coupling weather forecasting systems with Chemical transport model and Atmospheric dispersion modeling. * Using machine learning techniques. The forecast takes into account local emission sources (like nearby traffic or industry) and remote sources (e.g. dust that is carried by air parcels and follows the wind direction). The forecast temporally resolution is usually daily or hourly and the spatial resolution can change from block resolution to dozens of km resolution. Most forecasts of air quality cover two to five days. Motivation * By knowing the air quality forecast one can decide how to act, e.g. due to air pollution health effects, one can choose the best time to do an outdoor activity. * Deciding whether to put on a skin care ointment. * Find the cleanest route for cars. * Deciding whether to leave the windows open or closed.

Their purpose is to jointly exercise certain municipal functions and to execute their functions specifically assigned by the region.  Debate  Mountain communities are the subject of much debate in Italy. In Sicily, they were abolished in 1986. In Friuli-Venezia Giulia, they were abolished in 2001, were later reintroduced in 2004, and were once again abolished on 1 August 2016. In Sardinia, they were abolished in 2007. In Molise, after proposing a reduction in the number of mountain communities, they were abolished. In Lombardy, since 2009, the number of mountain communities dropped from 30 to 23. Puglia abolished mountain communities, but the Constitutional Court of Italy declared the act partially unlawful. In Liguria, their number was reduced from 19 to 12 in 2009, and were abolished altogether on 1 May 2011. The mountain communities of Piedmont, after a reorganization in 2010, were abolished in 2012.

The company was founded by Marko Kobal and Matjaž Škorjanc in 2014. USD$64 million were stolen from the company's customers in December 2017. In the aftermath the company decided to return the stolen funds through the Repayment program. 82% of the old funds was already reimbursed by January 2020. Their headquarters are based in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Buyers rent computing (hashing) power through NiceHash's online platform. Sellers provide hashing power by connecting to the NiceHash marketplace with NiceHash's own mining software.  Business model   Hashing power buyers  Buyers select the crypto-currency that they want to mine, a pool on which they want to mine, set the price that they are willing to pay for it, and place the order. Once the order is fulfilled by miners who are running NiceHash Miner on their machines, buyer gets the crypto-currency from the pool. This means that buyers aren't required to run complex mining operations themselves, and there is no capital investment in mining hardware required. Hashing power sellers (miners)  Sellers or miners have to run NiceHash Miner software and connect their mining hardware or just regular PCs to NiceHash stratum servers and to the buyer's order. Their hashing power is forwarded to the pool that the buyer has chosen for mining. For each valid share they submit, they get paid in bitcoins for the price that is determined by the current weighted average and refreshed each minute. This is all done automatically and the process does not require complex technical skills. In return for providing this service, NiceHash takes a percentage or a fee from each group (buyers and sellers). Service disruptions On December 6, 2017, approximately 4,700 Bitcoins (US$64 million at the time of the hack) were stolen from NiceHash allegedly by a spear phishing attack. Due to the open and transparent nature of the blockchain, the security breach received an influx of attention as the stolen sum and movement of bitcoins were visible to anyone on the internet. On December 21, 2017, Marko Kobal resigned as the CEO of NiceHash. On that day, the company also re-opened their marketplace after the December 6th hack. NiceHash has decided to reimburse the affected users through the Repayment program. 82% of the old funds were already reimbursed by January 2020. Controversies NiceHash's founder Matjaž Škorjanc is a creator of malware Mariposa botnet, which infected over 1 million computers with Butterfly (mariposa in Spanish) Bot. The goal of Butterfly Bot was to install itself on an uninfected PC, monitoring activity for passwords, bank credentials and credit cards. Slovenian police arrested Matjaž on charges of distributing the malware in 2010. Matjaž was found guilty and had served four years and ten months in a Slovenian prison. On June 5, 2019, US law enforcement opened a case in the operations of the Mariposa (Butterfly Bot, BFBOT) malware gang. FBI has moved forward with new charges and arrest warrants against four suspects including Matjaž Škorjanc.

It is located about half a mile from the nearest highway built by the Works Progress Administration. By the time the highway was constructed, Clive had been disestablished.  History  Cline was founded on May 5, 1894, as farm town and was dissolved on March 31, 1948. Before Cline was disestablished it used to have a post office, cemetery (located at ),{{GNIS1091464name=Cline Cemetery (historical) store, and school. As well as a major population for its time. In 1905 a Blacksmith shop was built as well as a feed barn to sell feed and hold stock sales in. In 1912, the stock was moved to Gate, Oklahoma, the post office was discontinued and the mail came from Gate by Star Route. The store in 1901 was ran by a man by the name of J. B. Lamaster. John and Bob Carr operated the store and post office later on.  Cline School  Cline school was built just west of Cline store(Sec.33, T. 3, R. 29), and then later moved on land owned by A. H. Laverty (Sec. 19, Y. 3 R. 28) in approximately 1911 or 1912. Its name changed multiple times starting out as Cline School then changing to Highland about 1920, there were two teachers that taught there for its time.

The concept for MasterClass was conceived by David Rogier and Aaron Rasmussen. The classes are typically not interactive, though at least one course included \\"interactive assignments\\" where the student acted with other students, either in person or over Skype. History MasterClass was formed by David Rogier and Aaron Rasmussen in 2014 under the name Yanka Industries. The website was published publicly under the MasterClass name on May 12, 2015. It had 30,000 sign-ups within a few months of release. MasterClass was started with $4.5 million in initial funding and two seed-funding rounds totalling $1.9 million. This was followed by $15 million in funding announced in 2016, $35 million in 2017, and $80 million in 2018. As of 2018, MasterClass' total funding was about $130 million. Classes MasterClass produces online classes with \\"renowned personalities in their respective fields.\\" Each class has video lessons, exercises, workbooks, and interview sessions with the instructor. A typical class has about 10–25 video lessons that are two to five hours in total. Classes cover topics like writing, sports, and cooking. As of 2019, the company was expanding into politics, economics, and video game design. Many instructors do live demonstrations if the topic is easy to illustrate visually, while writers lecture. Initially, MasterClass was started with just three instructors. 12 classes were added in 2017. In late 2017, an acting class given by Kevin Spacey was removed after multiple sexual assault allegations were publicly made against the actor. By late 2018 MasterClass had about 50 classes and 1,000 lessons. Support for mobile devices was first added in April 2018.  Reception  Some journalists have written that while the classes do not teach technical skills to improve proficiency in the craft, they do provide insight into the grueling nature of artistic pursuits and the strive for perfection while inspiring a love of the craft. The Verge noted that while the subscriptions last a lifetime, each course has little replay value, and so it is challenging to keep the student learning within the platform once they have viewed the video classes. MasterClass won two Webby Awards in 2020. One for Education & Reference in the category Apps, Mobile & Voice, and the other for Media Streaming in the category Web.

Biography  He was a descendant of Álvaro de Bazán, 1st Marquess of Santa Cruz, as eldest son of José Joaquín de Silva-Bazán (1734–1802), 9th Marquess of Santa Cruz and his second Austrian wife Mariana de Waldstein (1763–1807). He was a senator, a Knight in the Order of the Golden Fleece (1821), the Order of Calatrava and the Order of Carlos III. He was also Gentilhombre, Mayordomo mayor and Sumiller de Corps of Ferdinand VII, member of the Regency Council during the childhood of Isabella II of Spain, Ambassador in París, special envoy to London for the coronation of George IV, and director of the Real Academia Española. He was even Prime Minister of Spain for 6 days in January 1822. In 1817, he became the first Director of the Prado Museum. Before the Peninsular War, his father had already convinced King Charles IV not to burn the obscene paintings in the Royal collection, as was the wish of the previous King Charles III, but to store them in a private gallery. After the War, under impulse of Queen Maria Isabel of Braganza, the Museum was created with José Gabriel de Silva-Bazán as its first Director. He was replaced as Director by his brother-in-law Pedro de Alcántara Téllez-Girón, after the outbreak of the Liberal Triennium, but in the uncertain times following the death of King Ferdinand VII of Spain, he collaborated with the new Director José Rafael de Silva Fernández de Híjar to keep the museum's collection together.

It originates west of Petaluma, California at 220-acre Laguna Lake which straddles Marin and Sonoma Counties, from which it flows west before joining Walker Creek, a tributary of Tomales Bay. History Chileno Creek is named for Chilean immigrants who settled the Chileno Valley, with encouragement from Adrian Godoy. Chileno Valley Ranch was purchased by Carlo Martinoiya, an immigrant from Cevio, Switzerland from Henry Halleck in 1862. Henry Halleck served as General-in-Chief of all Union armies during the American Civil War and also served as President Abraham Lincoln's Chief of Staff. Carlo Martinoiya anglicized his name to Charles Martin and his great-great- granddaughter Sally Gale and her husband now run one of the ranches in the Chileno Valley. Several of the ranches in the watershed are maintained as agricultural land by the Marin Agricultural Land Trust (MALT). Watershed and course The Chileno Creek watershed drains . The creek originates at Laguna Lake, a shallow natural lake at the head of the Chileno Valley. Although Laguna Lake is officially classified as a vernal pool, it retains some water year round. The Chileno Creek watershed ranges from to at Chileno Creek's confluence with Walker Creek. A study of Chileno Creek geohydromorphology found that 30% of the sediment in the watershed is blocked by small stockpond dams, and that lack of sediment causes downstream erosion and slows riparian recovery. Most of its tributaries have one or more dams as well as the mainstem such that dam density, or number of dams per drainage area, is . Ecology In the early 1900s, coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) were abundant in Walker Creek, but were nearly extirpated apparently due to severe erosion and siltation secondary to overgrazing and logging operations. In 1975 D. W. Kelley performed a comprehensive investigation of steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and coho salmon populations. He found small numbers of steelhead young-of-the-year in all viable habitat areas in the watershed, but only eight coho near the confluence of Chileno and Walker Creek. In addition, the Soulajule Reservoir dam blocked all anadromous salmonid fish migration to Arroyo Sausal. California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) began planting coho salmon from Olema Creek into Walker Creek in 2003 with modest success. In 2008 and again in 2013 coho returned to Walker Creek, Salmon Creek and Frink Canyon. Laguna Lake is used extensively by migrating and breeding waterfowl, including whistling swans (Cygnus columbianus) in winter.

When the show transferred to DWET, it expanded into a four-hour radio show, then expanded to six hours a few months after. By 2014, Becca Music renamed the show as SAVED Radio on Energy FM, along with a refreshed lineup of programs for each hour including its known portion entitled \\"The Worship Hour\\". In mid-2015, SAVED Radio expanded its airtime to 18 hours on Sundays and introducing new programs with radio jocks hired separately from the Energy FM roster. Gaining positive feedback from its listeners, SAVED Radio finally became full-time a few weeks later, when it occupied the remaining Sunday airtime of Energy FM's programming. However, it continues to operate as a blocktime show on Energy FM and not as a separate broadcaster. Also, despite its expansion in Manila, SAVED Radio remained to be a late-night Sunday show on Energy FM's provincial stations.  A New Direction  On December 24, 2017, through Saved Radio's Facebook page, Becca Music announced that Saved Radio would temporarily leave the FM radio band after December 31. No other details were revealed except for its upcoming return by 2018, yet the outcome of the FM relaunch is still unknown. As a compromise, though, Becca Music sets up an exclusive daily online streaming service on the Saved Radio website to allow loyal listeners of the program to continue listening on contemporary Christian music.

Drosophila circadian rhythm is a daily 24-hour cycle of rest and activity in the fruit flies of the genus Drosophila. The biological process was discovered and is best understood in the species Drosophila melanogaster. Other than normal sleep-wake activity, D. melanogaster has two unique daily behaviours, namely regular vibration (locomotor activity) during the process of hatching (called eclosion) from the pupa, and during mating. Locomotor activity is maximum at dawn and dusk, while eclosion is at dawn. Biological rhythms were first studied in Drosophila. Drosophila circadian rhythm have paved the way for understanding circadian behaviour and diseases related to sleep-wake conditions in other animals, including humans. This is because the circadian clocks are fundamentally similar. Drosophila circadian rhythm was discovered in 1935 by German zoologists, Hans Kalmus and Erwin Bünning. American biologist Colin S. Pittendrigh provided an important experiment in 1954, which established that circadian rhythm is driven by a biological clock. The genetics was first understood in 1971, when Seymour Benzer and Ronald J. Konopka reported that mutation in specific genes changes or stops the circadian behaviour. They discovered the gene called period (per), mutations of which alter the circadian rhythm. It was the first gene known to control behaviour. After a decade, Konopka, Jeffrey C. Hall, Michael Rosbash, and Michael W. Young discovered novel genes including timeless (tim), Clock (Clk), cycle (cyc), cry. These genes and their product proteins play a key role in the circadian clock. For their contributions, Hall, Rosbash and Young received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2017. History During the process of eclosion by which an adult fly emerges from the pupa, Drosophila exhibits regular locomotor activity (by vibration) that occurs during 8-10 hours intervals starting just before dawn. The existence of this circadian rhythm was independently discovered in D. melanogaster in 1935 by two German zoologists, Hans Kalmus at the Zoological Institute of the German University in Prague (now Charles University), and Erwin Bünning at the Botanical Institute of the University of Jena. Kalmus discovered in 1938 that the brain area is responsible for the circadian activity. Kalmus and Bünning were of the opinion that temperature was the main factor. But it was soon realized that even in different temperature, the circadian rhythm could be unchanged. In 1954, Colin S. Pittendrigh at the Princeton University discovered the importance of light-dark conditions in D. pseudoobscura. He demonstrated that eclosion rhythm was delayed but not stopped when temperature was decreased. He concluded that temperature influenced only the peak hour of the rhythm, and was not the principal factor. It was then known that the circadian rhythm was controlled by a biological clock. But the nature of the clock was then a mystery. After almost two decades, the existence of the circadian clock was discovered by Seymour Benzer and his student Ronald J. Konopka at the California Institute of Technology. They discovered that mutations in the X chromosome of D. melanogaster could make abnormal circadian activities. When a specific part of the chromosome was absent (inactivated), there was no circadian rhythm; in one mutation (called perS, \\"S\\" for short or shortened) the rhythm was shortened to ~19 hours; whereas, in another mutation (perL, \\"L\\" for long or lengthened) the rhythm was extended to ~29 hours, as opposed to a normal 24 hour rhythm. They published the discovery in 1971. They named the gene location (locus) as period (per for short) as it controls the period of the rhythm. In opposition, there were other scientists that stated genes could not control such complex behaviors as circadian activities. Another circadian behavior in Drosophila is courtship between the male and female during mating. Courtship involves a song accompanied by a ritual locomotory dance in males. The main flight activity generally takes place in the morning and another peak occurs before sunset. Courtship song is produced by the male's wing vibration and consists of pulses of tone produced at intervals of approximately 34 msec in D. melanogaster (48 msec in D. simulans). In 1980, Jeffrey C. Hall and his student Charalambos P. Kyriacou, at Brandeis University in Waltham, discovered that courtship activity is also controlled by per gene. In 1984, Konopka, Hall, Michael Roshbash and their team reported in two papers that per locus is the centre of the circadian rhythm, and that loss of per stops circadian activity. At the same time, Michael W. Young's team at the Rockefeller University reported similar effects of per, and that the gene covers 7.1-kilobase (kb) interval on the X chromosome and encodes a 4.5-kb poly(A)+ RNA. In 1986, they sequenced the entire DNA fragment and found the gene encodes the 4.5-kb RNA, which produces a protein, a proteoglycan, composed of 1,127 amino acids. At the same time Roshbash's team showed that PER protein is absent in mutant per. In 1994, Young and his team discovered the gene timeless (tim) that influences the activity of per. In 1998, they discovered doubletime (dbt), which regulate the amount of PER protein. In 1990, Konopka, Rosbash, and identified a new gene called Clock (Clk), which is vital for the circadian period. In 1998, they found a new gene cycle (cyc), which act together with Clk. In the late 1998, Hall and Roshbash's team discovered crybaby, a gene for sensitivity to blue light. They simultaneously identified the protein CRY as the main light-sensitive (photoreceptor) system. The activity of cry is under circadian regulation, and influenced by other genes such as per, tim, clk, and cyc. The gene product CRY is a major photoreceptor protein belonging to a class of flavoproteins called cryptochromes. They are also present in bacteria and plants. In 1998, Hall and Jae H. Park isolated a gene encoding a neuropeptide named pigment dispersing factor (PDF), based on one of the roles it plays in crustaceans. In 1999, they discovered that pdf is expressed by lateral neurone ventral clusters (LNv) indicating that PDF protein is the major circadian neurotransmitter and that the LNv neurones are the principal circadian pacemakers. In 2001, Young and his team demonstrated that glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) ortholog shaggy (SGG) is an enzyme that regulates TIM maturation and accumulation in the early night, by causing phosphorylation. Hall, Rosbash and Young shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2017 “for their discoveries of molecular mechanisms controlling the circadian rhythm”. Mechanism Key centers of the mammalian and Drosophila brains (A) and the circadian system in Drosophila (B). In Drosophila there are two distinct groups of circadian clocks, namely the clock neurones and the clock genes. They act concertedly to produce the 24-hour cycle of rest and activity. Light is the source of activation of the clocks. The compound eyes, ocelli, and Hofbauer-Buchner eyelets (HB eyelets) are the direct external photoreceptor organs. But the circadian clock can work in constant darkness. Nonetheless, the photoreceptors are required for measuring the day length and detecting moonlight. The compound eyes are important for differentiating long days from constant light, and for the normal masking effects of light, such as inducing activity by light and inhibition by darkness. There are two distinct activity peaks termed the M (for morning) peak, happening at dawn, and E (for evening) peak, at dusk. They monitor the different day lengths in different seasons of the year. The light-sensitive proteins in the eye called, rhodopsins (rhodopsin 1 and 6), are crucial in activating the M and E oscillations. When environmental light is detected, approximately 150 neurones (there are about 100,000 neurones in the Drosophila brain) in the brain regulate the circadian rhythm. The clock neurones are located in distinct clusters in the central brain. The best-understood clock neurones are the large and small lateral ventral neurons (l-LNvs and s-LNvs) of the optic lobe. These neurones produce pigment dispersing factor (PDF), a neuropeptide that acts as a circadian neuromodulator between different clock neurones. Molecular interactions of clock genes and proteins during Drosophila circadian rhythm. Drosophila circadian keeps time via daily fluctuations of clock-related proteins which interact in what is called a transcription- translation feedback loop. The core clock mechanism consists of two interdependent feedback loops, namely the PER/TIM loop and the CLK/CYC loop. The CLK/CYC loop occurs during the day in which both Clock protein and cycle protein are produced. CLK/CYC heterodimer act as transcription factors and bind together to initiate the transcription of the per and tim genes by binding to a promoter element called E box, around mid-day. DNA is transcribed to produce PER mRNA and TIM mRNA. PER and TIM proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm, and exhibit a smooth increase in levels over the course of the day. Their RNA levels peak early in the evening and protein levels peak around daybreak. But their proteins levels are maintained at constantly low level until dusk, because during daylight also activates the doubletime (dbt) gene. DBT protein induces post-translational modifications, that is phosphorylation and turnover of monomeric PER proteins. As PER is translated in the cytoplasm, it is actively phosphorylated by DBT (casein kinase 1ε) and casein kinase 2 (synthesised by And and Tik) as a prelude to premature degradation. The actual degradation is through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and is carried out by a ubiquitin ligase called Slimb (supernumery limbs). At the same time, TIM is itself phosphorylated by shaggy, whose activity declines after sunset. DBT gradually disappears, and withdrawal of DBT promotes PER molecules to get stabilized by physical association with TIM. Hence, maximum production of PER and TIM occurs at dusk. At the same time, CLK/CYC also directly activates vri and Pdp1 (the gene for PAR domain protein 1). VRI accumulates first, 3-6 hour earlier, and start to repress Clk; but the incoming of PDP1 creates a competition by activating Clk. PER/TIM dimer accumulate in the early night and translocate in an orchestrated fashion into the nucleus several hours later, and binds to CLK/CYC dimers. Bound PER completely stops the transcriptional activity of CLK and CYC. In the early morning, the appearance of light causes PER and TIM proteins to breakdown in a network of transcriptional activation and repression. First, light activates the cry gene in the clock neurones. Although CRY is produced deep inside the brain, it is sensitive to UV and blue light, and thus it easily signals the brain cells the onset of light. It irreversibly and directly binds to TIM causing it to break down through proteosome-dependent ubiquitin-mediated degradation. The CRY's photolyase homology domain is used for light detection and phototransduction, whereas the carboxyl-terminal domain regulates CRY stability, CRY-TIM interaction, and circadian photosensitivity. The ubiquitination and subsequent degradation are aided by a different protein JET. Thus PER/TIM dimer dissociates, and the unbound PER becomes unstable. PER undergoes progressive phosphorylation and ultimately degradation. Absence of PER and TIM allows activation of clk and cyc genes. Thus, the clock is reset to commence the next circadian cycle.

Early life  Hilda D. Smith was born in Smith's Parish, Bermuda, the daughter of farmers Gilbert S. W. Smith and Clara A. Smith. Her paternal grandmother, Caroline Boyd, was born in London, and moved to Bermuda in 1849, a workhouse child sent to work as a servant in the British colony. Hilda Smith attended the Bermuda High School for Girls.  Career  Hilda Smith worked for the post office before she married in 1914. She was active with the Girl Guides beginning when her children were young. She was a Brownie troop leader for 23 years and the Central District Girl Guide Commissioner. She served on the Board of Health, and on the Smith's Parish Welfare Society board. During World War II, she worked with a government nutrition committee on the island's food supply. She was also a member of the Bermuda Women’s Suffrage Society led by Gladys Morrell; after suffrage was won in 1944, she was active in the society's successor, the Bermuda Women’s Civic and Political Association. Aitken was elected to the Colonial Parliament of Bermuda in 1948, one of the first two women to serve in that legislature, alongside Edna Watson. She served in the legislature for five years, and chaired the Social Welfare board from 1951 to 1953, and served on committees focused on the island's beaches and on the 1950 census. She lost re-election in 1953, in part because of her successful efforts to include birth control access in a public health bill. In 1953, Aitken was awarded a Coronation Medal for her public service.  Personal life  Hilda Aitken was married to Robert (Robin) Aitken in 1912; they had two daughters, Joan and Jean. She was widowed in 1970 and she died in 1987, aged 96 years. Her portrait hangs in Bermuda's House of Assembly.

He was born in Leningrad, USSR in 1964. He holds a number of senior positions in the Orthodox Jewish community. Activities  FREE - Chabad of Bondi  Ulman is the Rabbi of Friends of Refugees of Eastern Europe (FREE), which has been servicing Sydney's Russian speaking community since 1986. FREE attempts to connect many of the thousands of immigrants from the former USSR to their Jewish roots. In this role Ulman has presided over many adult circumcisions, as they were forbidden in the USSR.  Synagogue building controversy  FREE had been trying to get a permit to build their new synagogue in Bondi on land that until recently had been a public amenity. Because the space was originally zoned as recreational space, a permit was required to change the use to residential. The Waverley Council did not want the change in zoning since it had been keeping pace with housing needs in the council area, and they felt there was a need for the recreational space. FREE eventually managed to overturn the council's decision after appealing to the NSW Planning Department. In their planning permit they included a security document about the dangers of a 500 kg bomb, a situation that had never existed in Australia. The addition of this document in the planning document led a number of communal leaders and security experts to express \\"absolute shock\\". The council on the back of this document rejected the submission because the existing structures were not sufficient to repel a bomb of this size. The problem was a major error by FREE, that they \\"did not address the issues that it raised in its own submission.\\" The rejection of the permit on security grounds initially caused outrage amongst the Jewish population, and the wider Australian press. Ulman accused the council of attempting to \\"stifle Jewish existence and activity in Sydney and indeed, by creating a precedent, the whole of Australia, and by extension rewarding terrorism.\\" It was also reported in a number of international publications. However the outrage quickly died down. Far right Jewish groups, led by self described Jewish Nazi Avi Yemini, planned to hold a demonstration outside the council building, which was to be attended by several members of the neo Nazi movement in Australia. The demonstration was eventually cancelled. When asked to summarise the incident, two prominent Sydney lawyers described it as \\"a beat up\\" and that \\"the only thing it’s a precedent for is the principle that if your application doesn’t include the required information it will be rejected.\\" Ulman refused to distance himself from the neo-Nazi presence at the rally on behalf of his synagogue. The new centre was approved shortly after.  Sydney Beth Din  Ulman is the senior member of the Sydney Beth Din and owns in partnership with the other senior dayan, Moshe Gutnick. The Beth Din has jurisdiction over Orthodox conversions and divorces. More recently the Beth Din making efforts to be the sole arbiter of who is a Jew in Sydney. After the leaking of a secret document from the Israeli Chief Rabbinate it was revealed that the Sydney Beth Din, with Ulman as the senior rabbi, was one of the few Beth Dins around the world that were recognised to perform conversions. After a number of Australian rabbis were placed on a secret Israeli blacklist, Ulman interceded on behalf of one of them to have him removed from the list, even though the Israeli courts are expressing an ultra-Orthodox viewpoint not in keeping with a majority of Australian Jews. The Sydney Beth Din and Ulman specifically have received criticism from the secular judiciary in Australia. They have had a number of their decisions overturned and have lost some appeals. The Rabbinical Council of NSW, of which Ulman was a vice president at the time, issued a ruling that forbade any dispute with a Jewish institution from going to the courts, unless mediation had failed. In 2013 a ruling of the Beth Din against a Sydney man, Benjamin Amzalak, was overturned in the state Supreme Court. The ruling included an excommunication order that called on the community to \\"expel his children from school and his wife from synagogue\\". Ulman did not sign this excommunication letter, It was only signed by Rabbis Telsner and Kaminetsky. In a transcript of the Beth Din's deliberations, Ulman was recorded as saying in Yiddish \\"I am already persuaded, [but] so that we do not give the appearance of impropriety, let us give him [Amzalak] some time to answer.\\" Ulman was also involved in the siruv (Jewish contempt of court order) of South Caulfield Hebrew Congregation in Melbourne. The dispute began when the congregation reduced the salary of their existing rabbi and member of the Melbourne Beth Din, Yacov Barber. The ruling excommunicated all members of the board and prevented any rabbi or clergy from assisting the congregation in any way. The siruv was later lifted.  Contempt of court case  In another case the rabbis of the Beth Din, including Ulman were found to be in contempt of court for threatening sanctions on Reuven Barukh if he took his case to the secular courts and did not first attend the Beth Din. The letter, sent on behalf of all the individuals on the Beth Din stated that \\"all members of the Jewish faith are obliged to have their disputes heard in accordance with Jewish Law at a Beth Din” and that Jews are “not permitted to seek adjudication at a civil court without the express permission of a Beth Din\\". The judge in his ruling stated that their behaviour \\"displays either arrogant disregard of their own procedures and rules of natural justice, substantial ineptitude, or inexperience dealing with commercial disputes\\". The rabbis involved appealed the case, and although the fines were reduced to $25,000 from $50,000, they were still expected to pay costs for the case which were expected to be $350,000. In the aftermath of this ruling the Rabbinical Council of Australia and New Zealand (RCANZ) committed to an internal review, although a statement from the Rabbincal Council of NSW rejected the judgment calling the ruling a \\"serious violation of religious freedom, a principle that Australia holds dear.\\" RCANZ later changed their stance and rejected the calls for the rabbis of the Beth Din to stand down. The Sydney Beth Din of which Ulman is a senior member, released a statement stating that Jews must go to a Beth Din to settle matters with other Jews and they should not go to secular courts. In their statement they said that this is a fundamental core religious principle, and that removing the power of the Beth Din to force Jews to come before them \\"sets a precedent that affects... our ability, as Jews, to freely practice our religion.\\" In March 2019 the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies (JBOD) intended to investigate the Beth Din which Ulman is a part owner and senior member. The resolution which was passed unopposed was to look into all aspects of the Beth Din in connection to this case. JBOD said that the Beth Din had a \\"history of effectively undermining the theological basis of Orthodoxy and halachah,\\" and that there were serious \\"defects in the ownership structure, governance, mechanisms of accountability and dispute-resolution processes\\" and that they were a law unto themselves. The Beth Din responded that JBOD had a \\"this attempt by the BOD to assert authority over the SBD creates an insurmountable conflict of interest for the BOD, a body with a history of effectively undermining the theological basis of Orthodoxy and halachah\\". They rejected the concept that JBOD \\"has any right to be involved in, to interfere with or comment on the affairs of an Orthodox rabbinical body\\".  Other activities  Ulman supplied written testimony to court on behalf of Jaron Chester, who was accused of money laundering for an alleged Sydney organised crime family. While the organised communal leadership distanced themselves from Chester, Ulman testified as a character witness and called Chester a \\"very fine boy.\\" Ulman was one of the signatories to a letter to the Prime Minister opposing marriage equality, even in the secular context. The other Jewish signatories were fellow Sydney Beth Din member, Moshe Gutnick and senior rabbi on the Melbourne Beth Din, Mordechai Gutnick. In a submission to the Senate inquiry into same sex marriage, to which Ulman was a signatory, homosexuality was compared to adultery, incest and bestiality. Ulman is the rabbinic authority of the Australian Jewish Fertility Network (AJFN), which offers halachic advice for couples who are having fertility issues. Besides Australia he is responsible for Kosher IVF in a number of cities across the globe including, Chicago, NY, Caracas, Panama and others. Ulman's knowledge and expertise is viewed highly in the Chabad communities around the world. He is a reference point for family purity, organ tissue donation, as well as running an international institute for Dayanut. He has also taken a stance in favour of medicinal marijuana, and is publicly in favour of reporting child sexual abuse. Ulman is the Jewish Chaplain for the NSW corrections serving all Jewish inmates with their religious needs including: attending court hearings, supplying references, organising packages and meals for the holidays.

They often help out customers with their worries. Characters Main characters ; : :Shop owner and manager of Rokuhōdō. His first name is actually Kyousui, but he is fondly called Sui by everyone. He quit his office job to reopen the tea house he inherited from his grandfather. He learnt the art of tea making from his grandfather and is now a tea expert. His tea is known to have a relaxing attribute and is easy to drink too. Though he seems pretty clueless at times, he is pretty sharp and level headed at others. Although his tea is excellent, he totally sucks at cooking, and as such, his cooking is feared by everyone. He is a big fan of cats, and has a pet cat named Kinako at home, which was a stray he picked up. He is not really on speaking terms with his twin brother, whom he wants to make up with. ; : :With a calm disposition and a gentle nature, Tokitaka is the main chef at Rokuhōdō. He was Sui's middle school classmate and a popular potter from a young age. After helping Sui with some tableware, he decides to join Sui in re-opening Rokuhōdō and thus becomes one of the first employees. He has a gentle disposition and gives pottery lessons to the retired elderly, who are also regulars at the cafe. He also makes the café's tableware and decides on the main menu. ; : :He is the Barista at Rokuhōdō. He grew up and learned his trade in Italy. He was an 'angry young man' as a teenager, but after he was taken in by a Barista there, he learnt the art from him which also changed his character. This is also the reason he has a lever operated espresso machine at Rokuhōdō. He returned to Japan since it was his father's country. Although his coffee is extremely delicious, he is totally clueless about his iffy latte art. He is cheerful and outgoing. He is also a member of the local duck boating club. He often has friendly arguments with Tsubaki. ; : :Rokuhōdō's Pâtissier. Although a terrific Pâtissier, he is an introvert, and tends to get nervous from people's eyes . Though he is completely at home with the others at Rokuhōdō, he is still shy when he gets complimented. He has an extreme sweet tooth, and goes around to other cafes to have their sweets and restaurants when they have sweets buffets. He is in charge of the dessert menu and also comes up with some original menus. He also guided Isago to enjoy eating sweets at cafes, and is referred to as 'Master' by him. He is also praised by Tsunozaki, who tells Sui that he acquired a great talent (while referring to Tsubaki). He is usually seen teasing Gure. ; : :Sui's pet cat, but adored by all the members of Rokuhōdō and the customers of Rokuhōdō too. Kinako has a very calm and quiet personality and is often seen in front of the cafe, sunbathing. Other characters ; : Sui's older brother. Stoic and silent in nature, he is the Vice-President of East Side Grand Hotel, which belongs to his father. Though he shares fond childhood memories of Rokuhōdō, where he spent time with Sui and his grandfather, he currently resists coming to Rokuhoudou, saying that \\"he doesn't belong there\\". His relationship with Sui seems to be a bit strained, though Sui wants to make up with him. ; : A chirpy, cunning character, Tsunozaki is a famous, top pâtissier, acknowledged for his skills, taste and originality. He works for the East Side Grand Hotel, though he also helps out in other pâtisseries at times. He is also Yakyō's friend. He was first introduced to the members of Rokuhōdō when he asks them to substitute another store in an event in a department store, without telling them his identity. But gives them trouble in the event, by calling in too many customers and the television, when they are not used to it. He later arrives at Rokuhōdō to know and understand more about Sui. Though he appears cunning and unbearable at times, he is a loyal friend, who wants to help Yakyō reconcile with Sui, and also gives out tips on making his desserts better to Tsubaki. ;Takehiko Amagami A proud, energetic old man and owner of the Amagamiya, a tea shop (selling tea leaves). He was a customer of the old Rokuhōdō and was encouraged by Sui's grandfather's tea to start business. In the present, he was having temper tantrums due to a customer cancelling their contract in favour of ready-made, bottled tea - this is the time Sui meets him first. He makes a bet with Sui to determine whether he wants to sell Rokuhōdō his tea, and later enters a contract with them. He loves the food and tea at Rokuhōdō, though never admits it, instead coming over for 'inspections'. ;Takehiko Sae Wife of Takehiko Amagami. She has a calm demeanour as compared with her husband. ;Takehiko Kotsuru Granddaughter of Takehiko Amagami. A school going child, her knowledge about tea has been tempered by her tea- loving grandfather, and she is a tea lover herself. Her knowledge regarding tea also seems to be high level, as she is able to tell the individual tea leaves the from the tea mixture used at Rokuhōdō. She is also shy and timid child, but comes to Rokuhōdō to try to propose to them her grandfather's tea - though she never gets to it. She is also best friends with Gin Yonogura, who is her polar opposite in personality. She learns how to make matcha ice cream from Tsubaki to share with Gin. She also becomes a big fan of Rokuhōdō, often visiting the store with her grandfather. ;Hirokazu Isago A man with a sweet tooth who works for the magazine G! Moto. He wanted to start a new article in the magazine, listing fancy new cafes, but couldn't gather courage to actually visit said cafes, since they are usually the hangouts of women. He observes Tsubaki going to one such cafe fearlessly, and dubs him first a 'Hero'. He then visits Rokuhōdō, where after meeting Tsubaki, renames him 'Master' for showing him to actually relax in cafes. After this, he gains enough courage to start a new column named listing out cafes a single man can visit. He becomes a regular customer of Rokuhōdō.

History The coat of arms of the University of Chicago was assumed by resolution of the university's board of trustees on August 15, 1910. The blazon was devised by Pierre de Chaignon la Rose, working under the direction of university architect Charles Coolidge. An initial version had the book appearing without the division of the chief, however, it was noted that this would make it appear as though the book itself were being burned; the final version placed the book in chief to avoid this appearance. The arms were modified the following year with the addition of the motto Crescat scientia; vita excolatur on the pages of the open book in chief. Since 2012, the University of Chicago uses a modified version of its arms which eliminates the chief and makes the book appear suspended directly over the flame-engulfed Phoenix. The tinctures are also suppressed to two: Gules and Argent. This modified version of the arms, when used in tandem with the university's wordmark, comprise the logo. Design Blazon :Argent, a phoenix displayed Gules, langued Azure, in flame proper. On a chief Gules, a book expanded proper, edged and bound Or. On dexter page of book the words Crescat scientia, inscribed, three lines in pesse Sable. On sinister page the words, vita excolatur, inscribed, three lines in pesse Sable. Meaning According to the University of Chicago, \\"no surviving documents make clear precisely why the phoenix was adopted as the central element on the Coat of Arms, although several possibilities have been suggested\\". It has been hypothesized that the phoenix either signifies the \\"rebirth\\" of the University of Chicago, recalling an earlier - but unrelated - University of Chicago that existed in the city from 1857 to 1886, or it may represent the City of Chicago which was heavily damaged by the Great Chicago Fire.

Sandoval, a Captain, was the highest-ranking soldier to have died in the Battle of Marawi. Early life and education Sandoval was a graduate of the Philippine Military Academy's Class of 2005. He was a graduate of Bauan High School now Bauan College class of 1996. Marawi siege President Rodrigo Duterte pays his last respects to Captain Rommel Sandoval, September 11, 2017. Sandoval had spent over three months in the siege of Marawi without losing a single one of his men. His command, the 11th Scout Ranger Company, had not had a single casualty since their deployment. In August 2017, he had saved a group of Scout Rangers who had been trapped in a building in the main battle area. Under his instructions, they had exfiltrated the building using an armored personnel carrier and escaped the Maute group. Death On 10 September 2017, Sandoval's company was tasked with retaking a stronghold of the Islamic militants. The building, a 5-storey commercial complex called C&D; Centerpoint, was occupied by a branch of the Land Bank of the Philippines prior to the siege. It was referred to by the Philippine military as part of the militants' final defensive position and was defended by more than 26 militants. Sandoval's men began clearing the building from top to bottom. After clearing the fifth to the second storeys, they were about to enter the ground level when a burst of gunfire wounded Corporal Jayson Mante. His two other companions managed to quickly withdraw to the safety of the building's second storey, but Mante's injury prevented his own escape. Several failed attempts to rescue Mante transpired, during which time he was wounded several more times. At this point, Sandoval himself found an alternate route by which to approach and rescue Mante. He ordered his men to provide suppressive fire while he and another soldier, Private First Class Sherwin Canapi, attempted the rescue. As he reached the wounded soldier, Sandoval checked the latter's pulse and tried to pull him to safety. Sandoval was first wounded in his side. He returned fire but was then shot in the cheek, which proved fatal. He managed to crawl on top of Mante, shielding him from enemy fire. His body was later found to have bullets lodged in the chest, proving that he had protected Mante from getting further hit. Canapi was also killed in the rescue attempt. Captain Sandoval was buried at the Libingan ng mga Bayani on 15 September 2017. He was conferred the Armed Forces of the Philippines Medal of Valor, the highest award conferred to members of the AFP, on 20 December 2017. Personal life Sandoval was married to Maria Ana Rosario \\"Ani\\" Ello Sandoval. He was said to have been a talented artist; an illustrator, painter and wood carver who also had a passion for bonsai.

Early life Sixtus was presumably born around 1220The assumption of Sixtus' biographer Péter Kis; in 1215 new rules were issued in the University of Paris, governing who could become a magister. To teach the arts, a candidate had to be at least twenty-one, to have studied these arts at least six years, and to take an engagement as professor for at least two years. into a lower noble family, which possessed lands and fields in Hetény (today Chotín in Slovakia). His permanent honorary title of \\"magister\\" demonstrates his university degree (possibly he studied in Sorbonne or other Paris-type cathedral schools, gaining rhetorical and legal erudition). In contemporary records, he is first referred to as a cleric by Pope Innocent IV on 20 February 1245, when he authorized papal legate Giacomo Pecoraria to permit Sixtus' consecration and to grant him the right of possession of church benefices despite his \\"lack of origin\\". The document says Sixtus was the son of a lowborn priest. Sixtus had a sister Joanna, who married Lawrence, a landowner in Szőllős (today Vinodol, Nitra). Their marriage produced several children. His other brother-in-law Ampud of Macsala was also a landowner in Hetény. Through the paternal branch, he was related to Mikó Szécs, a courtier in Esztergom. Ecclesiastical career Historian Péter Kis assumes Sixtus was identical with a namesake cleric who is mentioned as a cantor of the Győr Chapter by four charters in the period between 1241 and 1248. He also argues Sixtus functioned as dean of Pressburg Chapter in 1253. Sixtus is first referred to as lector of the Esztergom Chapter in 1255. Through his extensive kinship in Esztergom County, he could compensate his nuclear family's relatively low origin. Besides his duty to proclaim the Scripture readings used in the Liturgy of the Word, Sixtus was responsible for management of the cathedral school of Esztergom and teaching the clerics and the poor scholars, in accordance with Canon 18 of the Third Council of the Lateran (1179). Thus he was also styled as \\"scholasticus\\" in contemporary documents. Additionally, Sixtus led the local place of authentication in this capacity. Approximately thirty charters remain from Sixtus' term. For this role, Charles I of Sicily referred to him as \\"chancellor of Esztergom\\" () in 1270. Sixtus occasionally also used this title thereafter. Sixtus resigned as lector, when he was sent as head of the Hungarian diplomatic mission to Rome, from 1258 to 1264. Then he became archdeacon of Komárom (present-day Komárno, Slovakia). On 15 July 1264, Pope Urban IV ordered Vincent, Bishop of Nyitra (or Nitra) to provide a dignity and benefice for Sixtus either in Zagreb or other cathedrals, or perhaps in a church of the Archdiocese of Esztergom, because he \\"wants to leave\\" his position of archdeacon in Komárom (probably due to its extensive administrative obligations). After 1266, Sixtus returned to his office of lector in Esztergom. In August 1271, after Ottokar II of Bohemia invaded the lands north of the Danube and destroyed the archives of the Diocese of Nyitra (Nitra), vice-ispán Michael, Benedict, provost of Arad and Sixtus were mandated by King Stephen V to determine the borders of the diocese, cataloging its estates and churches upon the request of Bishop Vincent. In early 1272, Sixtus appeared as an ad-litem judge to investigate the credibility of the udvarnik lands countrywide. In this capacity, he traveled the counties of Veszprém, Zala, Somogy and Vas. He last appears in contemporary sources on 17 April 1285. A certain Cyprian succeeded him as lector of Esztergom by 15 August 1286, suggesting Sixtus was deceased by then. In 1287, he is referred to as of \\"good memory\\" (bone memorie). Sixtus made his last will and testament in 1272, along with cantor Valentine. Accordingly, his gifted lands in Hetény was inherited by the Archdiocese of Esztergom. Sixtus stipulated that the archbishop had to finish the construction of the St. Anne monastery in the area. The monastery later belonged to the Williamites. Diplomatic missions Both Urban IV in 1264 and Charles of Sicily in 1270 referred to Sixtus as a \\"royal cleric\\", which connected his diplomatic activity. At first, he was sent to Italy in 1258 to represent King Béla's interests at the Roman Curia, as some of his policies gave rise to many conflicts between the Hungarian royal court and the Holy See after the Mongol invasion. Sixtus sold some part of his inherited land in Hetény to his relative and neighbour Mikó Szécs, in order to finance his diplomatic mission to Rome. He stayed there as the permanent ambassador of the Kingdom of Hungary to the Papal States until 1264. For instance, Sixtus protested in the name of his king when Pope Urban IV appointed Timothy as Bishop of Zagreb without Béla's consultation in late 1263. At the same time, the king was angered by the fact too that Pope Urban allowed his opponent Cardinal Báncsa to be free to distribute Timothy's benefices in Hungary among his relatives. When the reconciliation of Béla and his rebellious son Duke Stephen proved to be only temporary in 1263, the king commissioned Sixtus to convince the pope to support Béla's interests and withdraw support from some pro-Stephen Hungarian prelates. For his loyal service, Sixtus was granted royal land donations from his monarch and spouse Queen Maria Laskarina in Hetény and Radvány (present-day Radvaň nad Dunajom, Slovakia) after returning home. According to the narratios of three of Béla's donation letters, \\"[Sixtus] protected us and the right of our crown for many years\\". For his merits, Sixtus was also appointed as titular papal chaplain by Pope Urban after 1264. During the years spent in Rome, his envoy companion was a certain Egyed from the Diocese of Győr. In 1270, Sixtus was among the members of the Hungarian delegation presumably led by magister Ákos sent to Naples which escorted the then twelve-year-old princess Mary to marry Charles the Lame. Before that he sold another part of Hetény for 70 silver coins to Mikó Szécs. For Charles of Anjou, Hungary was an important ally, when he forged alliances in the Balkan Peninsula to counteract the surrounding great powers, the Byzantine Empire and the Republic of Venice. Charles' three documents mention Sixtus' stay in the Sicilian royal court at the end of 1270. Charles sent his notary Reginald of Florence as Sixtus' accompaniment. The diplomat returned to Hungary by June 1271. Historian Jenő Szűcs argued chronicler Simon of Kéza belonged to Sixtus' familia and also took part in the diplomatic mission.

Description  It was first held in 1924 and generally lasts five days. It is officially started on Fridays with an opening ceremony by the Bürgermeister and the enthroning of the Kuseline. The fair always closes with a firework display on Tuesday. In addition to various amusement rides and a festival tent, there are also many stalls along Trier Street where various consumer goods are offered. Information on the numbers of visitors is not yet available.  Kuseline  Every year on Friday, the newly elected Kuseline is presented, a woman chosen annually by a jury of local dignitaries, comparable to a wine queen. The election of the first Kuseline in 1977 was initiated by Paul Kaps, the former deputy editor-in-chief of the daily newspaper, Die Rheinpfalz, and the then leader of the Rhenish-Palatinate local editorial office in Kusel, Wolfdietrich Meder.  Election  The election is held annually two weeks before the Kusel Autumn Fair in the tithe barn at Lichtenberg Castle. There, the candidates stand individually in front of a jury and talk about their profession, hobbies and motivation to apply for the office of Kuseline. The jury is composed of the one representative from each of the following: Kusel county, the collective municipality of Kusel, the town of Kusel, the Kreissparkasse bank, the Kusel interest group, the retail association, the tourist office, the Karlsberg brewery, the Simon drinks company, the aviation club, Voborsky Intercoiffure and two representatives from the local newsroom. The Kuseline who is still in office, not only sits on the jury, but also announces her successor's name after the election.  Inauguration  The accession of the new Kuseline traditionally takes place on the first evening of the autumn fair. She is introduced into office by a leading editor of the daily newspaper Die Rheinpfalz. Since 2007, the former Kuselinen have met in the Deutsches Haus restaurant. Afterwards they go to the exhibition tent together to participate in the enthronement. During her one year in office, the Kuseline receives numerous gifts from the sponsors participating in the election. This includes a sightseeing flight over the county of Kusel, a trip to the twin town of Toucy, free hairstyles at Intercoiffure Voborsky and much more. The current Kuseline has numerous engagements in and around the county of Kusel. The first date after the enthronement is the procession on Saturday at the Kusel Autumn Fair. On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the Kuseline, a number of former Kuselines took part in the parade of the Kusel Autumn Fair.

The land it was formerly built on is currently restricted from the public. The demolished palace had long been confused with the dilapidated Istana Woodneuk due to its proximity, which was located on another smaller hill not far away. The difference with the roof tiles of these former palaces is that while Woodneuk was blue, Tyersall was red. History William \\"Royal Billy\\" Napier, the former Lieutenant-Governor of Labuan and first lawyer in Singapore, once had a house built in 1854 at the Tyersall estate of 67 acres in Singapore. Upon his retirement and departure back to England in 1857, his house at Tyersall was put on sale by Boustead & Co. in March 1857 and would later be bought over by Abu Bakar in 1860. Abu Bakar would later move his residence there from Telok Blangah upon his reign as Temenggong of Johor after his father's death in 1862. Temenggong Abu Bakar was proclaimed as the Maharaja of Johor on 30 June 1868, and was eventually proclaimed as the 21st Sultan of Johor on 13 February 1886. Later on, he decided that it was time to build a new palace in Singapore to commemorate his ascension. In 1890, Sultan Abu Bakar had Napier's former house demolished to make way for his upcoming palace. Architecture Dato Yahaya Awaluddin, an architect and a member of the Sultan Abu Bakar's Cabinet was deployed to design the plans according to the wishes of the Sultan's 3rd wife Sultanah Fatimah. Sultanah Fatimah was a Chinese woman of Cantonese heritage whose name was Wong Ah Gew before she married Sultan Abu Bakar. The Sultan employed the service of his long-time acquaintance Wong Ah Fook, a Chinese contractor to oversee the building of the palace. Wong had already built many of Johor's heritage buildings prior to his work assignment in Singapore and was a close friend to Sultanah Fatimah who shared the same common surname and dialect. Howarth Erskine carried out most of the ironwork, with some portions of the work done by H.C. Hogan, and the upholstering of furniture and equipments was provided by John Little & Co.. Sultana Fatimah did not live to see the completion of the palace as she had died on 25 February 1891. According to Singapore Free Press, they noted that: \\"The rectangular building measured 210 feet long by 174 feet deep, was in the \\"Corinthian style of architecture\\" with a red tiled roof and a seventy-feet high tower in the center topped by the Sultan's symbolic star and crescent.\\" \\"Among its key features were a spacious projected carriage porch, a grand staircase with ornamental iron balustrades, a grand reception room, a ball room, a billiard room -- and it was fitted with electric light. The installation of electricity was hailed by the Free Press as indicative of an improvement of \\"domestic civilization, and a marked step in the industrial progress of the Colony.\\" Interior-wise, the fanlights were Arabsque in design, the wood used was teak and ironwood and the building had altogether 420 doors.\\" Opening The palace was officially declared opened on 3 December 1892 by the 13th Governor of the Straits Settlements Sir Cecil Clementi Smith accompanied by Lady Teresa Newcomen, with the Sultan addressed in English and Malay in the ballroom attended by the selected company of power brokers of Singapore and Johor officials with the Sultan of Pahang Ahmad Muazzam Shah and Sultan of Riau Abdul Rahman II Muazzam Shah among them. The palace was known to be first building in Singapore to be supplied with electricity. Historic events As well as the Sultan of Johor's official residence in Singapore, the palace was also a venue to several historic events and parties. On 10 December 1892 at the palace, the Sultan received the First Class of the First Grade of the Order of the Double Dragon by the Guangxu Emperor, as conveyed by the Consul General in Singapore of his care, sympathy and kindness for permitting the Chinese to settle in Johor. The presentation event was witnessed by a gathering of Chinese towkays. On 6 April 1893, the Sultan held his reception to the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his party who arrived at the palace in the evening at 5.30 pm. The Archduke and Prince Franz Ferdinand and his party was shown various rooms and items of the palace, before proceeding on the Sultan's carriages towards the direction of Tanjong Pagar. On 24 February 1894, the Sultan held a dinner reception with the 14th Governor of the Straits Settlements Sir Charles Mitchell, attended by about eighty guests. On 14 January 1895 in the evening, the Sultan's Ball was held at the palace's ballroom, attended by Governor Sir Charles Mitchell and his wife Lady Eliza Weldon, several military and government officials. The Sultan's son Tunku Mahkota Ibrahim Al-Marhum, his eventual successor, was there as well. There were also Europeans, Chinese and Arabs guests, and including several Johor nobles. On 9 March 1895, the Sultan held a luncheon gathering party in honour of his old friend Thomas Shelford, who would be leaving Singapore for England, the gathering were consisted of principal residents of Singapore and their wives, and some of the Johor officials and residents. On 15 April 1895, the Sultan held his last reception at the palace in the late afternoon attended by hundreds of guests, among them were the former Sultan of Perak Abdullah Muhammad Shah II, and representatives of the consular, military and civil societies. before embarking on the mail steamer Pekin bound for Europe on 23 April 1895. Sultan Abu Bakar died of pneumonia in South Kensington, London, on 4 June 1895, it was at the palace that his son Tunku Ibrahim Al-Marhum received the telegram from Dato Sri Amar DiRaja Abdul Rahman Andak on the same day that informed of his father's death. Tyersall and its premises was handled over to his son upon his reign as the Sultan Ibrahim of Johor on 2 November 1895. The new Sultan however, would preferred to stay at the Woodneuk House, previously renamed as the Istana Woodneuk, of the nearby hill upon his arrival in Singapore. On 3 August 1896, Ungku Maimunah, the 1st Sultana to Sultan Ibrahim of Johor, and the Sultan's family held their reception to the King of Siam Rama V and his Queen Savang Vadhana at the palace. On 9 December 1896, Spanish Consul to the Straits Settlements Guillermo Leyra and his officers paid a private visit to the Sultan of Johor in his palace. On 11 January 1897, the Sultan held a luncheon party in honour of the former and 1st Postmaster-General of the Straits Settlements Henry Trotter, who will be retiring to England. His son Noel Trotter had since took over his duties. After the Farewell Gymkhara with 4th King's Own Regiment on 17 February 1900 at Tyersall, the Sultan held the farewell luncheon party at the palace on 21 February, with over 60 guests which included officers of the King's Own Regiment and the 16th Madras Native Infantry and the rest of the Garrison, and also the representatives of the official, commercial and sports. On 24 September 1902, the Sultan Ball was held by the Sultan in connections to the celebrations of his 29th birthday anniversary at the palace, attended by four hundred invited guests. The last noted reception at the palace was held by Sultana Maimunah on 28 April 1904 in the afternoon attended by Datos, Johor Government officials and a crowd of residents in honour of four Johor princes (Sultan's sons) and other four sons of the Malay high officials, before they were sent off from Tyersall on automobiles at 6.30pm to the P & O Wharf at Keppel Harbour to board the steamer SS Bengal, which left on the morning of the following day bound for England, where they would attend school there. Serious fire at the palace On 10 September 1905, a fire broke out at Istana Tyersall at midnight, and there were no occupants at the palace. One of the servants at the premises spotted the fire at about 2 am on 11 September 1905 and telephoned the fire brigade. By 2.45 to 3.00 am, the alarm was sounded and three fire engines from the Singapore Fire Brigade was deployed to the site, about 500 Sherwood Foresters soldiers who were stationed nearby rushed to help put out the fire. The fire was extinguished by 6.00 am, which saw the palace's ballroom and billiard room \\"hopelessly wrecked\\", several furniture and art collections were badly burnt. The cause of the fire was reported to be a faulty wiring ignited the hall's floor which was coated with \\"inflammable paint\\". Damage cost was estimated for up to S$200,000. The palace was abandoned soon after. Failed proposal of Tyersall Country Club On 30 November 1910, the meeting was held at the Straits Chinese Recreation Club's pavilion clubhouse in Hong Lim Green, Singapore, announced that the Sultan was willing to lease the premises and the ground for 21 years at the rental of S$150 per month for the first 7 years, S$250 per month for the next 7 years, and S$350 per month for the last 7 years, all which have been approved by the committee and members of the club. On 7 December 1910, the Tyersall Country Club was formed at the meeting attended by the members of the various clubs of Singapore and chaired by the 16th Governor of the Straits Settlements Sir John Anderson, at the abandoned Istana Tyersall with the purpose to set up a first general social club in Singapore. The club, according to Sir John Anderson, would \\"supply the real want\\" due to Singapore being the \\"only town of the great size without the general social club\\". The Club proposed the plans to become the lessees of Tyersall Palace (Istana Tyersall), to determine the issue of debentures and other matters, which included the dividing of its halls and apartments, the rebuilding of its ballroom, the erection of the new buildings nearby with the capital expenditure of S$65,000 on 21 February 1911 and later the estimated capital expenditure S$72,300 on 3 October 1911. However the scheme was reported to have fallen through during the meeting at Tanglin Club in early 1912. Demolition By 1930, the palace was in the state of dilapidation. On 16 December 1932, a second fire incident occurred at the palace's tower which was put out in a few minutes by two fire engines. On another hill not far away, a new palace Istana Woodneuk, or Istana Wooden York to the State of Johor, was rebuilt on its former site in 1932 and completed in September 1935 as the replacement for the Sultan Ibrahim and his 3rd wife Sultanah Helen. The dilapidated Istana Tyersall was reportedly been demolished under the tender issued from the Sultan in 1935. The site that was once the location of demolished Istana Tyersall, including its surrounding grounds, had since allowed by the Sultan to be used by the Indian Army to be stationed and converted as a military camp area in 1939.

Red-colored regions supported unionist parties; blue-colored regions supported separatist parties. Tabarnia (; ) is a fictional region within Catalonia, a satirical parody of the Catalan independence movement and a movement against the independence of Catalonia from Spain. The Tabarnia movement mirrors the independentist movement advocating for a referendum to create a new Spanish autonomous community out of coastal urban parts of Catalonia, a region that gathers most of the population of Catalonia and in which, in general, votes for independentist parties rarely reach 50% of the votes. It would encompass the current Catalan comarques of Maresme, Baix Camp, Baix Penedès, Alt Penedès, Garraf, Baix Llobregat, Barcelonès, Vallès Oriental, Vallès Occidental and Tarragonés. The Tabarnia movement assumes that the sovereign subject is not the total of Catalans, but the total of Spaniards (as stated in the Spanish Constitution), so it proposes satirically a gerrymandering strategy to mirror another case of alleged gerrymandering by Catalan independentists, that propose breaking the sovereignty of Spain to decide if Catalonia should become a separate state, allowing people to vote only where secessionism could have chances to win. Proponents believe the area somewhat corresponds to the historic County of Barcelona, although its extent is considerably different. This proposal, from a platform created in 2011 provoked renewed interest after the electoral results of the 2017 Catalan regional election. The word 'Tabarnia' went viral on 26 December 2017, reaching worldwide top-trending status with over 648,000 mentions. The only major demonstration organized by the Tabarnia movement took place in Barcelona on 4 March 2018, with 15,000 participants according to the Guarda Urbana and 200,000 according to organizers.https://elpais.com/ccaa/2018/03/04/catalunya/1520162880_273146.html The term, the concept and the Tabarnia flag were invented by a neighbor of Barcelona named Daniel de la Fuente in 2012. Jaume Vives and Albert Boadella (considered one of the founders of Ciudadanos) have self-proclaimed to be the spokesman and president of Tabarnia. Jaume Vives stated: \\"It is starting to achieve its objective, that the (Catalan) independentists start debunking their own arguments.\\". Miquel Martinez presents itself as the representative of Platform for Tabarnia, but in the association registry of Catalonia only exists the \\"Associació Somos Tabarnia\\" (Association We are Tabarnia). At a Spain level two other platforms exist: \\"Coordinadora por Tabarnia\\" and \\"Asamblea Nacional de Tabarnia\\". Several anti-secession parties have publicized and participated in events in support of the idea of Tabarnia. Those include Ciudadanos, Partido Popular, Vox and Plataforma per Catalunya. Other parties and movements, mostly pro-secession, have criticized the concept of Tabarnia, like Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, PDeCAT and the far-right and xenophobic Moviment Identitari Català and Front Nacional de Catalunya.  Movement  Tabarnia's movement protest on 4 March 2018 against Catalan independence from Spain Floral offering to Rafael Casanova during the protest Proponents of Tabarnia wish to distance themselves from the Catalan separatist movement and reclaim the right of a number of territories near the area of Barcelona and Tarragona to constitute themselves as an autonomous community within Spain. In the 2015 and 2017 Catalan regional elections, parties opposed to secession (mainly Citizens, PSC and PP) received a majority of votes and seats in Tabarnia as a whole and in a small number of coastal comarques (Tarragonès, Baix Penedès and Baix Llobregat) including the city of Tarragona. They received a plurality of votes in the comarca of Barcelonès, yet not in the city of Barcelona itself. They allude to a series of fiscal arguments similar to those of Catalan separatism in regards to Spain. The term \\"Tabarnia\\" is a neologism based on the names of Tarragona and Barcelona, the two Catalan provinces where support for separatism is lower, although in last Catalan election, Tarragona province showed more support for separatism than unionism. The movement uses as a legal basis the Canadian Clarity Act, according to which regions opposed to Quebecois separatism are to remain within Canada in case of a secession, as well as Articles 143 and 144 of the Spanish constitution, which allows the formation of autonomous communities. An ongoing online petition is taking place at Change.org in order to be sent to the Spanish Congress of Deputies to consider the creation of this new autonomous region. It has received 281 000 signatures to date. On 4 March 2018 a protest mocking the Catalan independence bid was organized by the Tabarnia movement. 15 000 demonstrators according to the urban guard and 200 000 according to the organizers gathered with Spanish, Tabarnian and Catalan flags and waived slogans for Tabarnia mimicking those of the Catalan independence movement. The protest started with a floral offering at the statue of Rafael Casanova, Considered by the independentists a patriot of their cause, but that according to one of his descendants present at the protest was actually a Spanish patriot. According to one of the organizers, the goal of the protest was to show the absurdity of the arguments for independence. He told the media that \\"we want to be the mirror of what the independence movement is all about\\". The protest was also criticized by some separatists which claim that Tabarnia trivializes their movement, which according to them is based on a distinct cultural identity and a long history of tension with Madrid. The protest ended at Saint James's Square, directly across from the Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya. The protest on 4 March received support from some civic and political associations, including the pro Spanish union platform Societat Civil Catalana, and far-right political parties like PxC and Vox. An online petition was begun on Change.org to have the name of the (Catalan Countries Square) changed to \\"\\".  Political claims  Tabarnians claim vote representation in Catalonia to be unfair across the four different provinces Lleida, Girona, Tarragona and Barcelona, resulting in unfair economic investment. Under the current electoral law, in the province of Barcelona 48,521 votes are needed to elect one representative in the Catalan Parliament for the 20,915 votes needed in Lleida, resulting in a 2.3 ratio. Tarragona requires 31,317 votes and Girona 30,048. Catalan separatists argue the current electoral law ensures political representation for areas with a lower population density while tabarnians argue the law has not been revised because historically Lleida and Girona have always had a majority of voters in favor of the separatist political parties that have kept them in government. The same way Catalan separatist have used an interpretation of economic data to argue they have an unfavourable finance balance towards the rest of Spain, Tabarnians argue Tarragona and Barcelona underrepresentation in the Catalan Parliament has resulted in unfavourable finance balance towards their region, also backed by similar interpretation of economic data.  Demonym  On 27 December 2017, following public enquiry by Spanish citizens, the Real Academia Española (Royal Academy of Spanish Language) informed through their Twitter account that the most appropriate demonym for Tabarnia would be \\"Tabarnés\\" among other possible options such as \\"tabarniense\\", \\"tabarniano\\", or \\"tabinososano\\".  Hypothetical territory and historical revisionism  thumbCatalan regional plan 1995, used as the basis for different veguerias projects. Tabarnia is a fictional territorial proposal that does not correspond to any present political or administrative unit. The tabarnian movement mirrors the alleged historical revisionism by Catalan separatists, and finds a precedent of territorial political and administrative unit at a certain point in history that justifies their existence: According to their own publication, the County of Barcelona, during the Middle Ages, had a similar territory to the one proposed by Tabarnians, today. Most sources consider Tabarnia to be just a fictional region.  Controversy  The movements founders, Catalan politicians such as Inés Arrimadas and numerous commentators have argued that the rise of this movement creates tension among the Catalan separatist movement because it serves as a mirror of their argumental contradiction. By using their same arguments for independence, it forces Catalan separatists to contradict themselves by using \\"unionist\\" counter-arguments in order to discredit the Tabarnia movement. By proposing the hypothetical separation of Tabarnia from Catalonia, the founders of the Tabarnia project want for the separatist politicians to realize that a large proportion of Catalans consider themselves Spanish and do no not want to leave Spain and that a declaration of independence could trigger similar movements within the territory, to the point of absurdity. According to Manuel Muñiz, the dean of the school of international relations at IE University in Madrid, it sparked a debate over \\"who is to vote and when\\" in a democracy and he questioned whether regions should be the ones entitled to decide on their independence or if cities would also qualify? Or should it be neighborhoods within cities? According to Salvador Garcia Ruiz, the chief executive of Ara, Tabarnia is nothing more than a sour response to the results of the 2017 Catalan regional election in which the independentists did not lose their majority over the parliament. He labeled Tabarnia as Peter Pan's \\"Neverland\\" for the unionists. Podemos' leader Pablo Iglesias was also critical with the movement because he claimed it was fueling an unhelpful \\"war of flags\\" but the spokesman for Tabarnia claims that the goal was never to break up Catalonia, but rather ending Catalan secessionism and all its disruptive consequences.

Owuor was also appointed a goodwill ambassador to UNICEF. In 1993, she was appointed chair of the Task Force on Laws Relating to Women, which resulted in the passage of the 2006 Sexual Offences Act. She was a commissioner on the Kenya Law Reform Commission from 1984 until 2000. After the NARC government came to power, Owuor was named in Aaron Ringera's report seeking to investigate the judiciary and opted to retire rather than fight malpractice charges. Under the Mwai Kibaki government, she was nominated to the International Criminal Court in 2006 but her appointment was challenged due to her mention in the Ringera report. Owuor withdrew and the position on the bench was taken by fellow female Kenyan judge Joyce Aluoch. Owuor and Aluoch were the first two members of the Kenya Women's Judges Association, an affiliate of the International Women Judges Association, formed in 1993 when they were the only two female judges in the country. Owuor retired from the court in 2008, but continues to chair the Sexual Offences Task Force. Personal life Owuor was married to research scientist Beneah Majisu, whose sister was married to Amos Wako. They divorced. She has six children. Owuor was an advocate against customary practices, and she herself was caught up in the Luo custom of widow inheritance when her second husband died. She said, \\"the Luo community treats widows like dirty people who have to be cleansed before they can integrate into the society once again. As the chairperson of a government task force that is reviewing the legal regime and how it affects women, it is humiliating to be harassed by men when I am still mourning my husband.\\" She refused to be \\"inherited\\" by her husband's family.

Because the pardon was granted on Christmas Eve, it became known as the \\"indulto de Navidad\\" (\\"Christmas pardon\\"). In 2009, Fujimori had been convicted of human rights violations and sentenced to 25 years in prison for his role in killings and kidnappings by the Grupo Colina death squad during his government's battle against Shining Path leftist guerrillas in the 1990s. The verdict marked the first time that an elected head of state has been extradited to his home country, tried, and convicted of human rights violations. Fujimori was specifically found guilty of murder, bodily harm, and two cases of kidnapping. The pardon was granted after Fujimori had completed 10 years of imprisonment in Lima. The pardon sparked protests across Peru. Protestors accused Kuczynski of corruption, claiming that the pardon was payback for the support of Fujimori's son, Kenji Fujimori, which had been central to Kuczynski's success in surviving an impeachment vote days earlier. On 3 October 2018, Fujimori's pardon was reversed by Peru's Supreme Court and he was ordered to return to prison. He was rushed to a hospital and entered prison on 23 January 2019. Background President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski  Legal situation  According to Peruvian law, the president has the power to grant a humanitarian pardon when the condemned person presents a terminal illness; an advanced, incurable, degenerative illness where prison conditions put the person's life, health, or integrity at risk; or a chronic, degenerative, mental illness where prison conditions put the person's life, health or integrity at risk. Fujimori's criminal trial and convictions Alberto Fujimori was President of Peru between 1990 and 2000 in the period of the so-called Fujimorato. While still president, Fujimori fled the country and took refuge in Japan when faced with charges of corruption in 2000. On arriving in Japan he attempted to resign his presidency via fax, but his resignation was rejected by the Congress of the Republic, which removed him from office by the process of impeachment. Wanted in Peru on charges of corruption and human rights abuses, Fujimori maintained a self-imposed exile until his arrest while visiting Chile in November 2005. He was extradited to face criminal charges in Peru in September 2007. In 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years for homicide for ordering the Barrios Altos and La Cantuta massacres. He was also sentenced for other crimes such as corruption. Other accusations against Fujimori include the mass sterilization of 231,774 indigenous people in rural Peru as a result of the National Population Program. Previous pardon request Press reports in late 2012 indicated that Fujimori was suffering from tongue cancer and other medical problems. His family petitioned then-president Ollanta Humala for a pardon. President Humala rejected a pardon in June 2013, saying that Fujimori's condition was not serious enough to warrant it. In July 2016, with three days left in his term, President Humala said that there was insufficient time to evaluate a second request to pardon Fujimori, leaving the decision to his successor Pedro Pablo Kuczynski. Impeachment of Pedro Pablo Kuczynski In December 2017, Kuczynski faced impeachment proceedings for his connection to the international corruption scandal surrounding the Brazilian firm Odebrecht. The impeachment request was presented by left-wing party Broad Front (headed by a former priest and environmental activist called Marco Arana). Fujimori's daughter Keiko was the most outspoken supporter of the impeachment proceedings against Kuczynski, who had defeated her the year before in a tightly contested presidential election. Kuczynski survived the impeachment vote on 21 December, largely due to the support of Fujimori's son Kenji. Pardon On 11 December 2017 Fujimori requested a pardon for humanitarian reasons. A medical board composed of Juan Postigo, Víctor Sánchez and Guido Hernández recommended pardoning the former President due to a \\"progressive, degenerative and incurable disease\\". On 23 December, Fujimori was transferred from the Diroes prison to a clinic. On 24 December, the Press Office of the Presidential Office announced the pardon of Alberto Fujimori through a press release. The same day, Kuczynski signed R.S. No. 281-2017-JUS., granting Fujimori \\"pardon and right of grace for humanitarian reasons within the Barbadillo Penitentiary Establishment\\". Reactions On 25 December, in the face of protests against the pardon, Kuczysnki released a Message to the Nation, asking people to not \\"get carried away by hate\\" nor to allow the former President to \\"die in prison\\". In a video broadcast on his social media, Fujimori apologized to those who were \\"defrauded by [his] government\\" and thanked Kuczynski. There was widespread criticism in Peru that the pardon was motivated less by clemency than a desire to reward Fujimori's son Kenji for his role in helping Kuczynski survive the impeachment vote against him the week before the pardon. Thousands of protesters took to the streets in Lima on 26 December. The Peruvian non-profit law office Legal Defense Institute denounced the pardon as political and illegal and vowed to appeal it to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR). The Peruvian human rights organization Association for Human Rights (APRODEH) and the international organization Center for Justice and International Law (CEJIL) released a statement on 27 December asking the IACHR to intervene. Amerigo Incalcaterra, the South America representative for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, categorically rejected the pardon, stating that \\"Not putting victims at the center of this decision derails the progress the Peruvian state has made on truth, justice, memory and reparations\\", Before the pardon was announced, Human Rights Watch had condemned the possibility of a pardon, calling it \\"a slap in the face to victims of atrocities in Peru and a major setback for the rule of law in the country\\"; and Amnesty International said that the pardon would violate Peru's obligations under international law and undermine the fight against impunity. The days following the pardon saw the resignation of various members of Kuczynski's Peruvians for Change party, including the Minister of Culture, three members of Congress, and eight appointed officials. Facing a second impeachment process, Kyczynski himself resigned in March 2018.  Reversal of pardon  Following appeals by victims of Fujimori's decisions, Peru's Supreme Court reversed his pardon on 3 October 2018. Fujimori was ordered back to prison. The court found that the pardon lacked legal foundation, as one of the reasons given for Fujimori's pardon was a terminal illness, but he did not suffer from one. Furthermore, it found that \\"the pardon was unlawful because Fujimori's crimes are considered crimes against humanity, and therefore can't be pardoned under Peruvian and international law\\". Fujimori's attorney said he would appeal the decision. On the day the reversal was announced, Fujimori was transported by ambulance to a private clinic to be treated for a heart condition. He gave an interview there one day later, saying that a return to prison would kill him. Days later, on 11 October 2018, the Congress of Peruwhose members are mainly fujimoristapproved a bill allowing older adults to be released from prison and be placed on electronic monitoring, a move that was seen as benefiting Fujimori. In January 2019, a court-appointed panel found that Fujimori was healthy enough to return to prison, and he was forced back to prison on 23 January 2019. The Supreme Court rejected an appeal by Fujimori's lawyers on 13 February 2019, confirming the earlier decision that Fujimori must serve the remaining 13 years of his sentence in prison.

Kühl was a member of the Ładoś Group also known as the Bernese Group and he is particularly known for his role in the production of false Latin American passports by the Polish Legation in Bern, Switzerland, thanks to which between several hundred and several thousand Jews in German- occupied Poland and Netherlands survived the Holocaust. Early life Juliusz Kühl was born shortly before the World War I in Sanok, southern Poland, which at that time was a part of Austro-Hungarian province of Galicia, into an orthodox Jewish family. When he was five years old Sanok became part of the Second Polish Republic and he himself – its citizen. According to Mark MacKinnon he was sent at the age of nine to live with his uncle in Zurich because his father had died when he was young, and his mother wanted him to get a good education.Mark MacKinnon, 'He should be as well known as Schindler': Documents reveal Canadian citizen Julius Kuhl as Holocaust hero, \\"Daily Globe and Mail\\", August 8, 2017 Polish scholar Agnieszka Haska quotes Kühl's unpublished autobiographical note and claims he entered the University of Zurich to study economics, the subject he obtained a PhD in 1939.Agnieszka Haska \\"Proszę Pana Ministra o energiczną interwencję\\".

The couple had two daughters and two sons. His oldest daughter, Janine, married Israel Weinstock, a businessman from Colombia S.A.,and the younger daughter married Israel Singer, who, between 1986 and 2001 served as Secretary General of the World Jewish Congress. Holocaust rescue operation and \\"passport\\" affair In March 1940 Kühl was employed in the Legation of Poland to Switzerland and Liechtenstein as an auxiliary employee. After the German and Soviet invasion of Poland and their subsequent occupation, the Legation remained loyal to the Polish government-in-exile headed by general Władysław Sikorski which pledged to continue the struggle against the Axis powers. Soon Kühl's superior, minister Tytus Komarnicki, was replaced by Aleksander Ładoś, former member of the Polish government in exile, who would later on become Kühl's protector and top collaborator and – after the war – personal friend and business partner. Kühl was tasked with working with Polish refugees coming in massive numbers from occupied France, Belgium and the Netherlands, vast majority of whom were Jews and Poles of Jewish descent escaping from Nazi persecution. Starting in 1941 Kühl and his superiors Stefan Ryniewicz and Konstanty Rokicki supervised the illegal market of Latin American passports bought by Jewish organizations for Jews in occupied Poland. The documents were bought from the consuls and honorary consuls of, among others, Honduras, Haiti and Bolivia or received gratis from the consulate of El Salvador. A particular case was the honorary consul of Paraguay, the Bernese notary Rudolf Hügli, who did not produce passports himself, but rather sold blank passes to the Legation of Poland. Consul Konstanty Rokicki would enter by hand the names and personal details of their beneficiaries – Polish and Dutch Jews who could thus claim they were citizens of neutral countries and were largely considered exempt from deportations to German Nazi-concentration camps. Particular help was provided to people inside the Warsaw Ghetto. Funds to acquire the documents were raised mostly by World Jewish Congress represented by Abraham Silberschein and Agudath Yisrael and the leader of its Swiss branch Chaim Eiss. In 1943, the Swiss police broke the ring and brought Hügli, Kühl, Eiss and Silberschein in for questioning. In September the Federal Council took a decision not to recognize Kühl's status as an 'employee of the Polish diplomatic mission'.Note of the Political Department, September 29, 1943, Bundesarchiv Bern Probably by December 1942, the Gestapo was aware that most Latin American passports were part of a larger conspiracy and may have been falsified. The Swiss police identified Kühl and Rokicki as top perpetrators. A report signed by Federal Councillor Edmund von Steiger on 21 July 1943 stated the following: In January 1943, while being interrogated by the police, Kühl admitted his part in the production of false passports and claimed that Paraguayan passports had been already in use in 1939, during which time they served to enable influential Polish Jews to leave the Soviet occupation zone. Aleksander Ładoś refused to dismiss him and tried to extend his status. He also intervened in Kühl's defense with the Swiss Foreign Minister Marcel Pilet-Golaz.Note of Mr Pilet-Golaz, Director of the Political Department, E 2809/1/3, Bern, October 13, 1943, Bundesarchiv Bern After the passport operation ended, the Polish government in exile granted Kühl in January 1944 full diplomatic status and the minor rank of attaché. According to Michal Potocki and Zbigniew Parafianowicz, the whole Polish Legation including Kühl contributed to issuing 4000 passports and saved the lives of 400 people.Zbigniew Parafianowicz, Michał Potocki, 'Forgotten righteous. How Aleksander Ładoś saved lives of hundreds of Jews', wiadomosci.dziennik.pl/historia/aktualnosci/zdjecia/555783,1,jews-holocaust- germans-aleksander-lados.html Agudat Yisrael estimated the number of rescued people at 'many hundred'. Later life and emigration After the Communist take-over in Poland after the war, Kühl, Ładoś, Ryniewicz and Rokicki left the foreign service and remained in Switzerland. All but Rokicki, tried a business activity together. Ładoś and Kühl were also believed to be politically linked to the Polish Peasant Party, the only non-Communist opposition allowed between 1945 and 1947. After the fiasco of their business they split and migrated to different countries. Later on Kühl would often come back to Switzerland for business trips. At the end of the 1940s, Kühl migrated first to New York City and after a short period moved to Canada where he lived for decades in Toronto, where running a successful construction company. In 1980 he moved to Miami where he died five years later from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, an illness he had suffered for many years. Shortly after that his private archive was donated to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Juliusz Kühl practically never spoke in public about his role in the passport affair neither did much to commemorate his former colleagues. However he gave much credit to Aleksander Ładoś to whom he referred as 'the real saviour'.Zbigniew Parfianowicz and Michal Potocki, 'How a Polish envoy to Bern saved hundreds of Jews', www.swissinfo.ch/eng/holocaust_how-a-polish-envoy-to- bern-saved-hundreds-of-jews/43398504 Controversies The role of Kühl in filling out the passports is uncertain. MacKinnon claims he participated in the procedure along Rokicki, but it seems of little probability given that Kühl himself admitted the main fraud had been generally perpetrated by his Polish superior. Most of the found Paraguayan passports contain the same hand- writing which seems to belong to Rokicki rather than Kühl. Also the leaders of Jewish organizations referred most frequently to Rokicki as their focal point. It is indisputable however that both played an important role in producing the passports and having them smuggled while Ryniewicz and Ładoś secured diplomatic coverage for their actions. The details of a big part of activities of the Ładoś Group remains unknown because they had conspiratory character and Ładoś did not inform the Polish government in exile about the details, probably out of fear of de-conspiring. Recognition Being a Jew Dr. Kühl is not eligible to be declared Righteous among the Nations by Yad Vashem. Yad Vashem's declared policy is not to provide meaningful recognition, even in a possible new category, to Jews who rescued Jews, regardless of the number of people their activism saved.

His name appeared together with the ones of Ładoś, Rokicki and Ryniewicz in a thank you letter sent by Agudath Yisrael World Organization to the Polish government-in-exile.Harry A. Goodmann's letter to Polish MFA, January 2, 1945, the Sikorski Institute, London Trivia Kühl was fluent both in speaking and writing in Polish and Yiddish, the language spoken at that time by the majority of the Polish Jews. The archives contain his correspondence and hand-written notes in both languages. He also used both versions of his name – the Polish one Juliusz and the Jewish one Yehiel being later on – due to his short stature – nicknamed \\"Little Hilek\\" (Polish Mały Chilek). According to his war-time colleague Stanisław Nahlik Kühl eagerly used the nickname himself.Stanisław Nahlik – Przesiane przez Pamięć, Kraków 2002 r.

It is a recombinant form of the human enzyme beta- glucuronidase. It was approved in the United States in November 2017, to treat children and adults with an inherited metabolic condition called mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (MPS VII), also known as Sly syndrome. MPS VII is an extremely rare, progressive condition that affects most tissues and organs. The most common side effects after treatment with vestronidase alfa include infusion site reactions, diarrhea, rash (urticaria) and anaphylaxis (sudden, severe allergic reaction). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. It was approved for use in the European Union in August 2018. Text was copied from this source which is © European Medicines Agency. Reproduction is authorized provided the source is acknowledged.  Medical uses  Mepsevii is indicated for the treatment of non-neurological manifestations of Mucopolysaccharidosis VII (MPS VII; Sly syndrome).  History  The safety and efficacy of vestronidase alfa were established in a clinical trial and expanded access protocols enrolling a total of 23 participants ranging from five months to 25 years of age. Participants received treatment with vestronidase alfa at doses up to 4mg/kg once every two weeks for up to 164 weeks. Efficacy was primarily assessed via the six-minute walk test in ten participants who could perform the test. After 24 weeks of treatment, the mean difference in distance walked relative to placebo was 18 meters. Additional follow-up for up to 120 weeks suggested continued improvement in three participants and stabilization in the others. Two participants in the vestronidase alfa development program experienced marked improvement in pulmonary function. Overall, the results observed would not have been anticipated in the absence of treatment. The effect of vestronidase alfa on the central nervous system manifestations of MPS VII has not been determined. The FDA approved vestronidase alfa-vjbk based primarily on evidence from one clinical trial (NCT02230566) of 12 participants with mucopolysaccharidosis VII. The trial was conducted at four sites in the United States. The benefit and side effects of vestronidase alfa were based primarily on one trial. Participants were randomly assigned to four groups. Three groups of participants received placebo treatment before starting vestronidase alfa treatment and one group received vestronidase alfa only. vestronidase alfa or placebo were given once every two weeks as intravenous (IV) infusions. Neither participants nor healthcare providers knew which treatment was given until after the trial was competed. The benefit of 24 weeks of vestronidase alfa treatment was primarily evaluated by the 6-minute walking test (6MWT) and compared to placebo treatment in ten participants who could perform the test. The 6MWT measured the distance a patient could walk on a flat surface in 6 minutes. An additional follow-up using 6MWT was done for up to 120 weeks. The application for vestronidase alfa was granted fast track designation, orphan drug designation, and a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher. This was the twelfth rare pediatric disease priority review voucher issued. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted approval of Mepsevii to Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical, Inc, and required the manufacturer to conduct a post-marketing study to evaluate the long-term safety of the product.

Formation It was formed after an actress working in the Malayalam film industry was waylaid and harassed. The organisation aims at the welfare of women in Malayalam cinema. On November 1, 2017 Women in Cinema Collective was registered as a society in Kerala. Activities * ‘Punarvaayana’, a year-long series of events was intended to address and bring more awareness in the society on issues such as exclusionary workspaces, workplace exploitation and gender discrimination. This curtain- raiser brought together prominent and successful women from various fields — including mediapersons, lawyers, bureaucrats, politicians, social activists to discuss and contemplate on these matters. *WCC also intends to celebrate the role of women in cinema by holding exhibitions and announcing end-of-year awards for Malayalam Cinema that pass the Bechdel Test. *On May 18, 2017, WCC submitted a petition to the Chief Minister of Kerala, requesting an inquiry and prompt action on the sexual assault case involving a prominent film actress in the Malayalam Cinema. Later WCC also publicly condemned and revolted against the decision of AMMA to reinstate actor Dileep, when the matter was only sub judice. * WCC members has requested the intervention of the government to formalise wage structure and welfare schemes for women working in the film industry such as maternity pay and tax subsidies for production crews that have at least 30% women representation, among many others. * WCC requested the Kerala government to start more movie production related technical courses that provides direct employment opportunities for more women and provide for more women's reservations in government-owned studios. Controversies * Actor Parvathy, a member of AMMA and WCC, was one of the first to openly state that films with misogynist dialogues should not be encouraged. She named the veteran actor Mammootty’s film Kasaba (2016 film), as one such movie. She requested that senior actors like Mammootty who is much respected and has a wide fan following should henceforth refrain from acting in movies that has such misogynistic scripts for the betterment of the society at large. Parvathy's viewpoint received mostly criticism but also some support from the film fraternity and she became the victim of cyber-bullying. She was viciously trolled and abused by fans of Mammootty and two of them were arrested by the Kerala police following a complaint from Parvathy  Similar Initiatives  *Film Employees Federation of Kerala (FEFKA) rolls out its own women's wing. Bhagyalakshmi, the chairperson of the newly created women's wing, criticised WCC in being selective in its approach. The new women's wing which in many ways is looked upon as a parallel association to WCC, is claimed to be a platform where concerns of women technicians can be voiced out and they would act as arbitrators with the concerned producers to sort them out.

The course of the river flows entirely in the canton of Roy. The hydrographic slope of the Natevier River is accessible via route 167, which also serves the south side of Waconichi Lake and the Waconichi River. This last road comes from Chibougamau, going north- east to the south-eastern part of Mistassini Lake. The surface of the Natevier River is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however, safe ice circulation is usually from mid-November to mid-April.

The Natevier River flows to the west bank of the Oreille River; the latter is a tributary of the North shore of the Blondeau River which flows to the north shore of McKenzie Bay of Chibougamau Lake. From this mouth, the current crosses this bay to the south, borrows the McKenzie Passage which is crossed by a road bridge, before crossing it to the Southwest on Chibougamau Lake bypassing the island of Portage which bounded on the northeast by Dorés Lake (Chibougamau River). Chibougamau Lake is the main head lake of Chibougamau River. From the mouth of Chibougamau Lake, the current flows through Dorés Lake (Chibougamau River), and then generally descends to the Southwest (except the upper S of the upper part of the river) along the Chibougamau River, to its confluence with the Opawica River. From this confluence, the current flows generally southwesterly through the Waswanipi River to the east shore of Goéland Lake (Waswanipi River).

The tradition started around 1830 and had its heyday between 1850 and the First World War. During this time, several thousand musicians travelled through the world and a livelihood for themselves and their families.  History   Origin  The West Palatinate has always been one of the poorest agricultural regions of Germany. In the 19th century, transport links to industrial centres did not exist and harvests, such as those of 1816/17 or 1831, were poor, regularly resulting in famine. The region was also badly impacted by the decline in mining on the Königsberg and Potzberg. For many families, the way out of this misery was either to emigrate or to work as migrant workers in the better-off regions of Europe. The economic boom in France during the reign of Napoleon, for example, attracted many Germans to southern France, where they found work in the ports.Marliese Fuhrmann: Kuckucksruf und Nachtigall. Gollenstein Verlag, . At the same time, migrant trades developed in various professions that sold home- made products abroad, such as brushes and brooms from Ramberg or shoes from the Pirmasens area.Paul Engel: Pfälzer Musikantenland-Museum auf Burg Lichtenberg. Görres-Verlag, Koblenz, . The reasons why the inhabitants of the region that later became the Musikantenland, betweenKusel, Kaiserslautern, Rockenhausen and Meisenheim devoted themselves to the presentation of music are not exactly known. It is assumed that the significance of Electoral court in Mannheim as the music centre of Europe in the 18th century played an important role in this development. Miners who had been recruited from Saxony, Thuringia or the Alsace to extract the mineral resources at Königsberg and Potzberg and who played the folk music of their homeland in their free time, are also said to have contributed to the musicality of the inhabitants of the Musikantenland. The names of the first musicians to travel around, and who could thus be regarded as role models, are unknown, nor is it known when the first journeys were undertaken. Thecode civil introduced during the French period, which among other things brought commercial freedom, led to the fact that, from 1800 onwards, the secondary job title of \\"musician\\" is to be found more and more often. In the early days, the first musicians played at church festivals or other festivals in the surrounding area or in neighbouring countries. Since it was economically worthwhile, more and more bands formed around 1830, so that the travelling area had to be extended as well. In the beginning, they travelled mainly to areas where many Germans lived as emigrants or migrant workers, and came as far as southern France or Spain. The number of passports issued for international travel increased from year to year. The Bavarian state government - the Palatinate had been part of the Kingdom of Bavaria since Congress of Vienna - became aware of the growing number of musicians. However, since it was alleviating the economic hardship in the West Palatinate, it was decided not to take action against it. Only school-age children, who accompanied their fathers or relatives more and more often, were banned from travelling. { class=\\" float-right\\" - ! colspan=\\"2\\"The \\"largest\\" musician villagesWest Palatine Musicians Museum, Mackenbach - ! Location ! Number of musicians -  Jettenbach  532 -  Mackenbach  427 -  Eßweiler  284 -  Wolfstein  227 -  Rothselberg  226 }  Heyday  From 1850, it was increasingly trained musicians who played in the bands. The bands now travelled all over Europe and also went overseas - Asia, Australia, Africa and above all America were worthwhile destinations. Everywhere, they were known as \\"Mackenbachers\\", even if they came from other places. Mackenbach was, however, a typical musicians' village; at times a quarter of the population was musically active. The number of musicians and bands grew steadily. In 1909 alone, 1,043 wandering musicians were identified from county of Kusel on the basis of passport applications. At that time it was possible to travel to some countries without a passport - in England only 100 gold marks and a valid employment contract needed to be shown - it is assumed that at the turn of the century around 2,500 musicians were on tour every year. Over time, the musicians became more professional and the standard of training improved. In English seaside resorts, wealthy citizens spent the summer months. The West Palatine musicians were welcome there, as long as they adapted to the increased demands of the audience. In order to be engaged by the baths and spas, their usual street clothes had to be exchanged for uniforms and contemporary pieces of music by well-known composers had to be included in the repertoire. To communicate with employers and officials, at least the conductor had to speak foreign languages. Hubertus Kilian, for example, spoke English and French and understood Italian and Spanish. There were also bands that travelled on foot from place to place through the emigrant regions and played in town squares, but the proceeds from street performances alone were lower. Those who were unable to converse in foreign languages and only had Palatine folk music in their programme could not hope for permanent employment. Another, crisis-proof sector was the circus, which even offered work for some musicians after the First World War. In the 19th century, large circus companies developed, which sometimes had several bands. There was a great demand for musicians and many Palatines, especially from Mackenbach, found well paid jobs at Hagenbeck, Sarrasani or Busch. In the hometowns, instrument-making developed as a flourishing industry, as did the businesses of the cloth makers, dyers and tailors. Music brought prosperity to the once impoverished region, and many musicians returned as wealthy men, sometimes after years of absence.  Decline  The band of Hubertus Kilian in China (1863/64) The start of the First World War marked the beginning of the end for touring music bands that had just reached its absolute climax. Many men had to go to war, most of the job opportunities for musicians were eliminated and Germany's borders were blocked. Musicians who were caught out by the start of the war during a trip abroad were prevented from returning home. Rudolf Mersy from Aschbach was interned until 1920 in camps in Australia and New Zealand, Otto Schwarz from Hinzweiler and his band, who had previously lived in England for several years, were incarcerated on the Isle of Man. After the war, Germans were initially banned from entering almost all countries, with the exception of the Netherlands. After the hardship of the post-war period was over and cultural life flourished again, the travelling musicians faced increasing competition from with records, radio and film; the trade was never able to return to its heyday. At best, as a circus musician some touring musicians were able to continue their profession for a while. Some musicians stayed abroad, especially in the US, and continued to make music there. Bill Henry, originally Heinrich Jakob from Mackenbach, hired a young singer, Frank Sinatra, for his band in 1932. In 1935, the remaining full-time wandering musicians of the Palatinate were admitted to the Reichsmusikkammer (\\"State Music Institute\\"). A prerequisite for a professional travelling outfit was that the band had to consist of at least seven members. They had to pass examinations and needed a responsible director, who was issued with a group pass by the State Director of the Saar-Palatinate division of the Reichsmusikkammer. In 1938, musical auditions were conducted in Mackenbach and Lauterecken, where a total of 30 bands were examined. With effect from 1 April 1939, the act on the membership of wandering musicians was repealed by the Reichsmusikkammer as their activities were \\"not considered to be promoting musical culture\\". With that, the era of travelling musicians from the West Palatinate came to an end.  Musicians   Training  The repertoire of the bands required the individual musician to be able to play several instruments; as a rule, one had to master not only a wind instrument but also a string instrument. There were no music schools in the Palatinate, but Jettenbach pastor, Schowalter, tried in vain before the First World War to form one politically. A musical apprenticeship was similar to that of a craftsman: the apprentice was taught for several years by a master, an experienced touring musician. The best known teachers were Ludwig Christmann from Kaulbach, Jakob and August Rech from Etschberg and Ludwig Jakob from Mackenbach, who was also called \\"Gorlhauser Lui\\" because he grew up in Godelhausen. Training began while a boy was still at school, the pupil had to attend music lessons several times a week. The first journey for the young musicians - called \\"Easter boys\\" because they had just been released from school at Easter - often took place with their father or a close relative. This prevented homesickness, but also prevented young people from falling into the hands of unscrupulous bandmasters who only exploited them. With the first trip, the actual training period of the musicians began. For two to three years, the young musicians were usually only allowed to play accompanying roles, which they called abstoßen (\\"detached\\") or abknuppen. The leader would decide whether someone was talented enough to become a soloist or whether he had to remain in the background as an accompanying musician. Many musicians gave up quickly when they found a more suitable place to work, and only went on a few trips. The most talented musicians took further lessons with good teachers of their instrument, often abroad, at every opportunity. A further training opportunity offered itself during the military era. A regimental musician was not only able to improve the mastery of his instrument, but also gained an insight into a wider range of music and the possibilities for its arrangement. This proved useful for the later time as a touring musician in selecting and interpreting the pieces.Paul Engel: Das westpfälzer Wandermusikantentum im Lichte wissenschaftlicher Untersuchung. In: Erich Weingart, Paul Kaps: Zum Beispiel – Der Landkreis Kusel. Pfälzische Verlagsanstalt, 1985, p. 157–176. Hubertus Kilian from Eßweiler, for example, received such training when he did his military service in 1852 with an infantry battalion in Kaiserslautern.  Bands  The bands (Kapellen or Banden), were put together by the bandmaster, an experienced wandering musician, relatives were often preferred. On longer journeys, several conductors would sometimes join their bands together. Most of the bands consisted of five to ten musicians, but they could also have 20 or more members. The musicians were employees of the bandleader and received their wages after the trip from him, which were determined depending on their skills, their experience and the income of the band. The instrumentation was mostly mixed, pure wind or string groups were less common. The conductor had to make sure that even more demanding pieces could be included in the repertoire in order to get better paid engagements. Easily transportable, more robust instruments were preferred. The discipline of the musicians was important, later on the external appearance and the appearance of the musicians was also emphasized.

Bone was meanwhile promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel in May 1939. In November 1939, the 1st Defense Battalion was activated in San Diego with Bone as its commanding officer. As experienced artillery officer, Bone supervised the formation and initial training. His battalion consisted of the batteries with 5\\"/51 caliber guns, searchlight and aircraft sound locator and antiaircraft groups with M2 Browning and M1917 Browning machine guns and were ideal for the defense of the islands from the attack from the sea and air.

In spite of a severe shortage of building materials and equipment and limited shipping facilities for procuring them, he displayed sound judgment and high professional skill in solving the many problems which confronted him. During the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Bone was stationed on Hawaii and coordinated the trucks with ammunition. In May 1942, Bone was transferred to the staff of South Pacific Island Base Inspection Board under Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd and travelled to the South Pacific Area as a member of the inspecting party. He was promoted to the rank of colonel on July 24, 1942.

He is best known for founding and leading the diagnostic test manufacturer Alere. Early Life and Education Zwanziger was born in Israel in 1954 and raised on the island of Cyprus, after his family moved there in 1956. He earned an engineering degree from Imperial College London in 1975 and an MBA from Harvard Business School (HBS) in 1981. Career Medisense (1981-1991) Along with three HBS classmates, Zwanziger co-founded Medisense Inc., a maker of glucose meters used in diabetes home care, in 1981. He served as CEO until 1991. Originally, the company worked on 13 disparate biotechnology ideas, hoping one or another would pay off. By 1984, the company had narrowed its focus to one of the projects, which concerned electrochemical biosensors. In 1987, Medisense introduced the ExacTech, which was the first electrochemical biosensor-based glucose meter for home use. This technology required less blood to obtain a reading, and by 2008 was used in a majority of the 6 billion home blood glucose tests being performed annually. In his textbook on electrochemistry, Alan Bond of Monash University suggests that the commercial success of electrochemical home glucose monitoring \\"predominantly can be attributed to the introduction of the ExacTech system.\\" Medisense was acquired by Abbott Laboratories in 1996 for $876 million. Alere (1991-2014) Zwanziger founded Alere Inc. (then called Selfcare Inc.), a diagnostic test manufacturer, in 1991. He served as CEO until 2014. Alere's diabetes unit was sold to Johnson and Johnson (LifeScan) in 2001 for $1.3 billion. With the 2001 acquisition of the subsidiary Unipath from Unilever, Alere became the leading manufacturer of ovulation and pregnancy tests. Alere acquired Biosite Inc. in a $1.7 billion hostile takeover in 2007. By 2012, Alere was the largest manufacturer in the HIV testing space, according to the nonprofit Population Services International. Abbott acquired Alere in 2017 for $5.3 billion. LumiraDx (2014-present) Along with longtime partners Drs. David Scott and Jerry McAleer, Zwanziger co-founded the diagnostic test manufacturer LumiraDx in 2014, and he currently serves as CEO. Funding rounds for Lumiradx included $270 million in 2018 and $302 million in 2020. In 2020, the company was reported to be developing tests for COVID-19.

It aired as the 13th and 14th episodes of season 8 in 1977.  Production  The episode saw the third and final appearance of Beverly LaSalle (played by Lori Shannon), after \\"Archie the Hero\\" (where Archie Bunker saves her life) and “Beverly Rides Again” (where she invites the Bunkers out to dinner).  Plot  Beverly LaSalle, a transvestite and recurring character, and good friend of Edith, is mugged alongside Mike, a few days before Christmas (the result of a gay bashing). Mike survives the ordeal with only minor injuries, but Beverly is killed. Edith Bunker has a crisis of faith and begins to wonder how God would allow people to punish one of his children. She believes that all people are worthy of love and feels a sense of loss and sadness at the tragic event, and doesn't understand it.  Critical reception and analysis  Pop Matters thought this episode highlighted the \\"social stigma against trans(sic) persons, an act of injustice emphasized by Edith's inability to understand humanity's rejection of people like her dear friend.\\" NewNowNext thought the storyline was groundbreaking for 1975 and even by 2016 standards. The Queer Encyclopedia of Film and Television deemed the episode \\"daring and disturbing\\". DVDTalk notes that while Edith notes that while Beverly was killed because of \\"who she was\\", the episode is coy about defining what that is, and argues that an earlier episode would have hit the gay- bashing aspect of this violent crime head on. The Age of Netflix argues that by choosing to air both parts of the episode on Christmas night 1977, the episode \\" massively recalibrates the episode's affective stakes\\" by forcing viewers to associate the holiday with a time to \\"(mourn) queer loss\\".

Since its rebranding to NEO from Antshares in 2017, the project's vision is to realise a \\"smart economy\\" by utilizing blockchain technology and smart contracts to issue and manage digitized assets. The network runs on a proof of stake decentralized Byzantine fault tolerant (dBFT) consensus mechanism between a number of centrally approved nodes, and can support up to 10,000 transactions per second. The base asset of the NEO blockchain is the non-divisible NEO token which generates GAS tokens. These GAS tokens, a separate asset on the network, can be used to pay for transaction fees, and are divisible with smallest unit 0.00000001. The inflation rate of GAS is controlled with a decaying half life algorithm that will release 100 million GAS over approximately 22 years. A total of 100 million NEO were created in the Genesis Block. 50 million NEO were sold to early investors through an initial coin offering in 2016 that raised US 4.65 million, with the remaining 50 million NEO locked into a smart contract. Each year, a maximum of 15 million NEO tokens are unlocked which are used by the NEO development team to fund long term development goals. The core of the NEO feature set revolves around tools that allow developers to efficiently deploy and scale smart contract applications on the NEO blockchain. X.509 Digital Identities allow developers to tie tokens to real world identities which aids in complying with KYC/AML and other regulatory requirements.  History  In 2014, Antshares was founded by Da Hongfei and Erik Zhang. In the following year, it was open- sourced on GitHub and by September 2015, the white paper was released. NEO was officially rebranded from Antshares in June 2017, with the idea of combining the past and the future. The word “neo”, originates from the ancient Greek prefix, “νεο-“, meaning ‘new’, ‘modern’, and ‘young’. The vision of building a “smart economy” was developed along with the rebranding. In March 2018, NEO's parent company Onchain distributed 1 Ontology token (ONT) for every 5 NEO held in a user's cryptocurrency wallet. These tokens will be used to vote on system upgrades, identity verification mechanisms, and other governance issues on the NEO platform.  Organizational structure  In 2018, Da Hongfei announced the adoption of a new organizational structure. The NEO Council was to be reorganized into the NEO Foundation, co-chaired by Hongfei and Erik Zhang, and two operational units funded by the NEO Foundation: NEO Global Development (NGD) and NEO Global Capital (NGC). NGD is dedicated to the research and development, community operations and marketing and will be executing strategies outlined by NEO Foundation. In April 2018, the first NGD office was set up in Shanghai and a year later, the second NGD office was opened in Seattle.

Kenan Jr. Professor of Humanities at Wake Forest University. He is known for his expertise on post-Kantian philosophy. Career He specializes in Continental (nineteenth- and twentieth-century German and French) philosophy, philosophy of art, environmental philosophy, and philosophy of religion. Prior to moving to the United States, Professor Young taught at all levels at the universities of Auckland, Pittsburgh, Calgary and Tasmania, the following: Introduction to Ethics, Introduction to Metaphysics and Theory of Knowledge, Introduction to Theories of Human Nature, British Empiricism, Quine and Sellars, Wittgenstein, Plato, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, Heidegger, Sartre and Camus. He has supervised and examined numerous MA and PhD theses at Auckland and throughout Australasia. He is the author of ten books, mostly on nineteenth- and twentieth-century German philosophy. He has appeared on radio and television in Ireland, New Zealand and the US, and has written for the Guardian, the New York Times and Harper's Magazine. Accusations of Plagiarism In 2011, Mark Anderson, a professor at Belmont University, discovered that a significant number of passages in Young's Friedrich Nietzsche: A Philosophical Biography (Cambridge University Press, 2010) were plagiarized from an earlier biography by Curtis Cate.Anderson, Mark. \\"Telling the Same Story of Nietzsche's Life.\\" Journal of Nietzsche Studies, The 42.1 (2011): 105-120. In addition to \\"large-scale structural similarities\\",Anderson, \\"Telling the Same Story\\", p. 114 Anderson provides more than ten examples of Young's unethical academic practice. A group of scholars led by Mohan Matthen (Professor of Philosophy and senior Canada Research Chair in Philosophy of Perception at the University of Toronto) suggested that Young admit publicly that the Nietzsche book \\"contains a number of passages that are copied from an earlier biography by Curtis Cate\\". Young's response was reported by Professor Matthen: \\"Julian Young has now inserted into unsold copies of his book a list of Errata an acknowledgement of Cate's biography and a list of changes to his text.

The Bruce Highway passes through the locality from north (Tinana) to south (Glenorchy). The principal land use is irrigated cropping, principally sugarcane. There is also grazing on native vegetation.  History  Local residents requested the Queensland Government provide a school for the local area, pointing out that children were having to walk three or four miles to the school in Tinana. Local farmer John Parke offered of his property \\"Spring Grove\\" for the Teddington State School (as it was originally planned to be named). The school was officially opened 24 October 1914 by the Under-Secretary for the Department of Education, John Douglas Story. The school admitted its first 21 students on 11 November 1914; the first teacher was Grace Smith. On 24 November 1914 it was officially announced that the school would be renamed Parke State School in honour of Parke who was killed in a farm accident in November 1913 (although this name was already in unofficial use at time of its opening).  Education  Parke State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at 400 Teddington Road (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 58 students with 4 teachers and 5 non-teaching staff (3 full-time equivalent).

Norman Tindale says that an extensive vocabulary of Walangama was collected from informants in 1938. Country Tindale estimated their territory as comprising some sround, On Carron River and Walker Creek. Their western bordersd lay around Maggieville and Normanton, while to the east, their frontier was at Croydon. To their south, their confines were around the headwaters of Belmore Creek, and their northern extension ran up to Stirling along the southern side of the Gilbert River.

The refrain calls them to give thanks by singing \\"Glory to God in the highest\\", alluding to the Annunciation.

She is popularly known for her humorous sketches which she writes and stars in for live performances as well as online platforms. In an online article, Hindustan Times referred to Sumukhi Suresh as \\"India's Tina Fey.\\" Early life Sumukhi Suresh was raised in Nagpur. She finished her graduation from M.O.P Vaishnav College for Women, Chennai. Suresh moved to Bengaluru in 2009 and started working at Hippocampus, a Children's Library. She then went on to work as a chef and was also employed at a food laboratory for a brief period of time. In 2013, Sumukhi joined The Improv, which was an improvisational comedy show in Bengaluru, while working at the laboratory. Along with the rest of the Improv team, Sumukhi performed in 100 shows in Bengaluru, Dubai, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Sweden. In 2015, she quit her full-time job to start a career in comedy. Career Sumukhi's first video was Anu Aunty- Engineering Anthem with Varun Agrawal. She then did the Maid Sketch with Sanjay Manaktala as the boisterous Parvati Bai. Sumukhi rose to fame after portraying the character of 'Sumukhi Chawla', an NGO employee, in India's first mockumentary-style YouTube series—Better Life Foundation. Sumukhi has performed comedy shows with Naveen Richard, the writer of the show Better Life Foundation. She also gained popularity for her property \\"Disgust Me\\" a by invite, women-only stand-up comedy show. After getting much appreciation for her role in Better Life Foundation, Sumukhi launched a video series called Behti Naak on her own YouTube channel. In the video series, she plays Behti Naak - a 10-year-old girl with a deadpan style of humour.The videos became viral. Sumukhi was approached by Amazon Prime, India to make a web series. Pushpavalli, created by Sumukhi Suresh, was released on December 15 on Amazon Prime Video in India and received positive reviews. The show is directed by Debbie Rao and stars Naveen Richard, Manish Anand, Preetika Chawla and Shraddha. Sumukhi was approached by Amazon Prime, India for a second time to make a one hour web show titled Don't tell Amma which since its release has received positive reviews. This was a recording show in Begumpet, Hyderabad. The show wittily describes the relationship between millennials and their Indian Mothers. Though the title says Don't tell Amma (Mother), interestingly enough, many people watched the show with their mothers. Sumukhi, along with fellow comedian and absurdist Naveen Richard, co-created the Prime Video show Go Straight Take Left. The show is a compilation of six sketches. In 2018, Sumukhi Suresh hosted the first season of Prime Video's web series Comicstaan alongside comedian Abish Mathew.

She plays the role of Lavanya, wife of Nograj (Danish Sait). This film is a political satire. Stand on feminism In India, where stand-up comedy shows are generally dominated by men, Sumukhi is known as one of the very few successful female stand-up comedians. However, Sumukhi has spoken against the tag.

H.Rob. (Greek gymnos = naked and anthos = flower, alluding to the lack of paleae on the receptacle - mespilifolium = leaf like that of Mespilus), is a sprawling woody liane up to 15 cm thick from Southern Africa occurring in the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo, Mpumalanga, Western Cape. This species is found as a vigorous pioneer in abused or degraded habitats such as cleared areas and forest margins. The genus comprises some 43 species found in sub-Saharan Africa, Madagascar, Southern Asia, and introduced into Brazil. Gymnanthemum was first described by Cassini in 1817, then included in Vernonia by Candolle in 1836 and Bentham in 1873 and finally resurrected by Robinson and Kahn in 1986 and 1999. The taxonomic limits of the genus are presently narrower than in 1999. Currently nine species are recognised in southern Africa, of which five are endemic to South Africa. The other four are more widespread - they are Gymnanthemum theophrastifolium (Schweinf. ex Oliv. & Hiern) H. Rob., Gymnanthemum coloratum (Willd.) H. Rob. & B. Kahn, Gymnanthemum amygdalinum (Del.)

She made her first appearance as Mazeppa in what was then known as the Continental Theatre; now the Trocadero Theatre, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Stage life Under the management of Allinson & Hincken on January 4, 1864, Raymond played a six-week engagement as Mazeppa; her first appearance on any stage according to her husband O. B. Collins, a stage actor himself. With her husband along with her a large percentage of the time, she traveled around the country performing in equestrian dramas until the season of 1866-7, when she played at the St. Charles Theatre (now demolished, in its place the Orpheum Theatre) in New Orleans, under the management of De Bar & Eddy. In the spring of 1867, along with Wilson's Broadway Theatre Company, she traveled through Canada. From 1867-8, she was soubrette of John Templeton's Company on the Southern circuit. She played a role as Mazeppa for the second time, also under management of Templeton, in the spring continuing into the season of 1868-9 where she did a four-week engagement at the Olympic Theatre (now demolished, most recently called Tivoli Theatre) in Brooklyn, New York, under the management of Donnelly & Hooley in February 1869. She starred in \\"Jack Sheppard on Horseback,\\" \\"The French Spy,\\" and similar pieces until 1872, where she made her appearance in a new play written specifically for her by Thad. W. Meighan titled \\"The Waifs of New York.\\" Her role was Willie the Waif, and it won instantaneous and pronounced success. In July 1874 at the Bella Union Theatre in San Francisco, California, she played for 231 consecutive nights. In the Fall of 1875, she appeared in Liverpool, performing at Theatre Royal (now the location of the Liverpool Football Club store).

A prequel titled is released as part of bonuses included in limited edition Blu-ray and DVD Box Set of the anime's first volume. Two manga adaptations, one based on the game and one on the prequel, written by Makoto Sanada and with art by Kudan Nazuka, began serialization in Media Factory's shōjo manga magazine Monthly Comic Gene in 2015 and Kadokawa Pixiv in 2016, respectively. The first manga has been collected in seven tankōbon volumes and has over 1 million volumes in print while the prequel has been collected in two volumes. Following the adaptations, a two-volume 4-koma manga series titled Satsuten! and the three-volume novel series are published with art by negiyan and written by Kina Chiren. The series is licensed in North America by Yen Press, who published the first volume on November 14, 2017. A 16-episode anime television series adaptation by J.C.Staff began airing from July 6, 2018. Synopsis 13-year-old Rachel \\"Ray\\" Gardner is taken to a hospital for counselling after murdering her parents, but the catch is she forgot about it. However, she wakes up to find herself on basement Floor B7 instead with no memories apart from her name and the reason she came to the hospital. A series of mysterious broadcasts and scribbled messages on the wall set the scene as a game where each participant is designated a floor of their own, and anyone who trespasses on another participant's floor has the chance to be killed. Ray, ignorant of the details, is almost killed by serial killer Isaac \\"Zack\\" Foster, the owner of Floor B6, and captured by Daniel \\"Danny\\" Dickens, the owner of Floor B5 and the doctor who examined her. Danny, who has a maniacal obsession with eyes, desires Rachel's blue, once-blank eyes. During this time, Ray recovers her memory during the night when the murder occurred, just as Zack kills Danny for her, but spares Ray after losing interest in her lack of emotions. As Zack has killed someone that was not on his floor, the broadcast designates him as a \\"sacrifice\\" along with Ray, where they can freely be killed by any floor master. The two, in the same situation, form an alliance where Zack can use her intelligence to escape, and upon doing so will fulfil Ray's desire to be killed by him. Ray and Zack continue to go to the upper floors to find a way out, defeating the two other floor masters, Edward \\"Eddie\\" Mason at B4, a young boy with an unhealthy obsession with graves, and Catherine \\"Cathy\\" Ward at B3, a sadomasochistic former jail guard, in the process. When Zack gets injured during the fight against Cathy, Ray encounters a reverend, Abraham Gray, at B2 who reveals himself to be the one who designed the game in order to figure out the definition of \\"religious faith\\" in people's hearts, appointing the various floor masters as \\"angels\\" that are not afraid to kill without hesitation. Although Gray lets Ray return to B5 to get medicine, she must pass through a trial to determine her identity before she can proceed to the next floor. Meanwhile, back on B2, Zack discovers that Danny is still alive, the latter having faked his death. Ray is forced to confront her selfishness in the trial but survives through it to save Zack, convincing herself that he is her God. When the duo arrives at B1 though, they come to a house filled with fake flowers and the stitched corpses of a couple, driving Ray hysterical and desperate for Zack to kill her immediately. Danny then tricks Zack into leaving Ray alone in the room and lock it up, forcing Zack to search the floor in order to discover the truth about Ray. With help from Gray, Zack realizes that Ray suffered in the midst of her parents' terrible relationship, and subsequently both were killed, with her dad killing her mom, and Ray shooting her dad. After which, she stitched their corpses together to form her new \\"perfect family\\". Counseling her at the hospital, Danny then took an interest in her blank blue eyes and used his authority as an \\"angel\\" to bring her to B1, making her the final floor master. As Zack finds out the truth, Ray, coming into the realization that Zack won't become the God she desires, shoots Danny and attempts to kill Zack by leading him around the traps of her floor, but he helps her to come to terms with her actions and both renew their oath. Just as they reach the exit, Danny activates the self-destruct sequence of the building and critically shoots Ray. Before Danny can kill both Ray and Zack, Gray, having completed his experiment, appears and kills Danny, allowing Zack and Ray to escape just as the building burns down. The police promptly arrive and Zack lets himself be arrested to save Ray's life. Zack is sentenced to death for his killing spree years ago as well as the murder of Ray's parents along with Ray's kidnapping. Zack denies killing Ray's parents or kidnapping her but he does admit to the other murders. Ray is taken to a rehabilitation center due to her apparent delirium and attachment to him. Never losing faith, she pretends to get better while clinging to the hope of the oath they made. A few months after, Zack escapes from prison and breaks into Ray's room to fulfill his end of the oath. The two escape together, with Ray once again asking him to kill her. By the time the police arrive, the room is already empty with the window broken, a trail of blood, and Zack's old knife that Ray left behind. Characters Main characters ; / : : The 13-year-old female protagonist of the story. After witnessing a murder, she is taken to a hospital for counselling, only to wake up on Floor B7 with no memories from her past. She later recovers them after a scuffle with Danny, the doctor responsible for counselling her, and reverts to an apathetic character. Believing death will be her salvation, she requests Zack's help to kill her in exchange that he can use her intelligence to help him escape the building. Under her emotionless and calm exterior though, Ray harbours a morbid interest in stitching up animals or people she deems imperfect and a twisted perception and blind faith in God. : Her interests stemmed from her parents, who hated each other. Ray then witnessed her father kill her mother, and in terror, killed her own father with a gun, before deciding to stitch up their corpses to turn them into her \\"perfect\\" parents. Taken to the hospital, Danny develops an interest in her blank blue eyes and uses his authority to make her the floor master of B1. Ray's floor is modelled after her house and is filled with many deadly traps with the exception of her bedroom and living room where the stitched corpse of her parents is placed. ; / : : The 20-year-old male protagonist of the story. Once an infamous serial killer, he is now the floor master of B6. He is noticeable for his body being completed covered in bandages and wields a grim-reaper-like scythe. Bloodthirsty, Zack delights in destroying the happiness of his victims and filling them with despair. As Ray showed a severe lack in emotions, he found no interest in killing her and let her stay alive for him to use her intelligence to escape the building, in return that he will kill her once they escape. : Zack grew up only knowing how to kill due to being treated abusively as a child. Abandoned by his parents, his stepfather tried to burn him and his mother to death, wounding his body with burns that he covered up with bandages and causing him to develop an intense fear of fire. His mother then left him in the care of an illegal orphanage that trafficked children, where he faced subsequently more abusive treatment, becoming a tool of labour. Upon watching a slasher horror movie left by the head of the orphanage, Zack was inspired to go on a murder spree, with the heads of the orphanage being his first victims. He is subsequently found by Gray and became a floor master. His floor is modelled after a deserted, dirty network of alleyways. Supporting characters ; / : :A counsellor who has an insane obsession with eyes, especially Ray's blank, blue ones. Due to being born without a right eye, he was bullied for most of his childhood. His missing eye also caused fights between his parents until they divorced and his mother committed suicide. From there, Danny began to find blank, dead eyes like his mother's beautiful, becoming a counsellor to search for eyes that could satisfy him. :Prior to the series, he was a counsellor for prisoners and met Gray, who offered him the chance to become the floor master of B5. Believing it could satisfy him, Danny took on the offer and subsequently used his authority to bring Ray into Gray's experiment and make her the floor master of B1, hoping that he could live close to her eyes. He is ultimately killed by Gray in his pursuit for Ray. In the prequel manga Episode.0, he becomes the main character. ; / : :A young boy characterised by his pumpkin mask and love for making graves. His floor is modelled after a graveyard and made completely out of stone. Born a child of grave-makers, Eddie was proud and skilled at his job, but became discontent with the fact that he was never given anything that could truly belong to him, for most of his things were hand-me-downs passed from one child to the next. He then began to kill his pets and bury them in his own graves, feeling that things only truly belonged to him once they were put in graves dug by him. :When he was invited by Grey and became the floor master of B4, he began building graves for those killed by the other floor masters, hardly ever killing anyone himself. However, he took it upon himself to kill Ray and bury her in a beautiful grave after falling in love with her at first sight. Due to constantly building graves in the dark, Eddie got used to seeing in a dark environment, which gives him the advantage when he kills. He is killed by Zack when Ray turns on the lights, and buried in the grave originally meant for her. In the game prequel Episode.Eddie, which focus more on his past before becoming floor master, he becomes the main character. ; / : :The floor master of B3, who is known widely as the \\"Condemner\\" due to her past as a former jail guard, with Danny as her prisoners' counsellor. A sadomasochistic woman, Cathy delights in uncovering her criminals' crimes and delivering punishment to them through torture, often killing them. Those who survive are then confined as her playthings. :She is the most formidable of all the floor masters due to her wide range of death traps and torture instruments. Viewing Zack as an exemplary sinner, she attempts to punish him thoroughly to her amusement but is killed when Ray catches her off guard with a gun. Her floor is modelled after a huge jail block, along with her private room where she controls the various traps on the rest of the floor and monitors her victims. ; / : :The floor master of B2 and a reverend who created the facility as an experiment to determine the definition of \\"religious faith\\", including gathering all the various floor masters and providing them with victims. He is extremely eloquent, able to mesmerise his listeners through words, and harbours a cold and logical heart without mercy. Gray also employs the use of drugs to make his victims hallucinate in order to see their true inner selves. His floor is modelled after a church, with the stained glass window concealing the exit of the building. Other characters ; :A character introduced in the manga adaptations, Lucy is Cathy's best friend who harbours a borderline insane admiration for her. After graduating school together, the both of them became jail guards that specialised in punishing criminals, often with Lucy dealing the finishing blow. When Cathy is invited to become a floor master by Danny, Lucy becomes her first victim, deeming her a sinner as well for all the prisoners she had killed. ; :A character in Episode.0 and the original floor master of B3 before being replaced by Eddie. Shin was originally a pair of twin brothers who owns a furniture store selling furniture made from human flesh. Deeming that the twins fit the criteria to become an angel for Gray's experiment, Danny invites them. However, Gray would only accept either one of them, deeming their dependency towards each other as imperfect. Driven by the idea that only one being is perfect, each twin decided to kill the other. It is unknown which twin succeeded killing the other as the survivor reappears and reintroduces himself as the \\"one complete\\" Shin. In the official Angels of Death guidebook, it is explained that while working on one of his furniture, Shin hurt his hand by accident, causing his blood to stain the furniture. Seeing the beauty in the furniture stained by his own blood, Shin used his own body as ingredients to make the furniture without a care of his own body, which resulted with his death. Media Manga A manga adaptation by Kudan Nazuka and Makoto Sanada began its serialization on the Monthly Comic Gene magazine on January 27, 2016 and will end its serialization on September 15, 2020. The prequel of the game, Episode.0, also by Kudan Nazuka and Makoto Sanada began its serialization on the MFC Gene Pixiv series on March 3, 2017. A two-volume 4-koma manga series titled Satsuten! by Makoto Sanada and negiyan began its serialization also on the Monthly Comic Gene magazine on February 27, 2017. Novel A novelization of the game written by Kina Chiren and Makoto Sanada and illustrated by negiyan is published by Kadokawa label, Enterbrain. The novel series consisted of three volumes. Anime A 16-episode anime television series by J.C.Staff premiered on July 6, 2018. The anime is directed by Kentarō Suzuki with scripts overseen by Yoshinobu Fujioka, music composed by Noisycroak at Lantis and character designs handled by Miki Matsumoto who is also serving as chief animation director. Masaaki Endoh performed the opening theme titled \\"Vital,\\" while Haruka Chisuga performed the ending theme titled \\"Pray\\" under her character name Rachel. The series is also streamed on Crunchyroll with English subtitles, while Funimation produced an English dub for the series and streamed it on their website. Reception Game In November 2017, it was announced that the game had achieved 1M downloads in Japan. In a review of the game's PC version, Hardcore Gamer rated it a 4 out of 5, while noting the ’wonderfully odd chemistry’ between Rachel and Zack. The game's creativity, storyline and gameplay were praised while its brevity, belated character development and low resolution graphics were criticized. Manga Roundups of the first volume from ANN note that it is short on tension, suspense and horror and somewhat confused in its delivery; its characters seem unnatural and are perhaps more appropriate to a game than to this format; and while the environment art often works well, overall the illustrations do not serve the story. Anime First impressions from ANN are mixed. Some criticised the pacing to be weak and writing repetitive that lacks scares in horror genre, but praise its episodic structure that strongly pushes the creepiness factor that deliver an intriguing plot. Steve Jones from the same site, on the other hand, gives the anime more positive review. While he found the early episodes to be a campy romp and criticised the slow pacing, he praised the main characters' growth and interaction and the performance of the voice actors. In Tokyo Anime Award Festival 2019, the anime ranked 72.

As a two-year-old in 2009, he was unbeaten in two races in Ireland including the Group 1 National Stakes. After a transfer to Godolphin and a lengthy absence, he returned for two races in England in 2010 and won the Listed Ben Marshall Stakes. In the following year, he was beaten in all three of his starts and was retired to stud in Italy at the end of the season. Background Kingsfort is a dark bay horse with no white markings bred in Kentucky by the Irish-based Airlie Stud. As a yearling in October 2008, the colt was consigned to the Goff's Orby Million and Sportsman's Yearling Sale and was bought for €36,000 by the bloodstock agent Frank Barryon behalf of the veteran trainer Kevin Prendergast. Prendergast also bought the filly Termagant shortly afterwards at the same auction and later joked \\"It was a good job I wasn’t out for a cup of tea\\". Kingsfort was taken into training by Prendergast and entered the ownership of the Irish businessman Norman Ormiston. His sire War Chant recorded his biggest victory in the 2000 edition of the Breeders' Cup Mile. As a breeding stallion, the best of his progeny have included Chamberlain Bridge, who won the Breeders' Cup Turf Sprint in 2010 and the Santa Anita Derby winner Midnight Interlude. Kingsfort's dam Princess Kris showed modest racing ability, winning one minor race from eight starts. She did better as a broodmare, also producing the Gulfstream Park Breeders' Cup Handicap winner Prince Arch. She was a granddaughter of Royal Saint, a full sister to Altesse Royale. Racing career 2009: two-year-old season Kingsfort made his racecourse debut in a maiden race over seven furlongs on soft ground at the Curragh on 26 June and started at odds of 100/30 in a twelve-runner field. He was settled behind the leaders before taking the lead two furlongs from the finish and won by two lengths from the Dermot Weld- trained Stunning View with the Aidan O'Brien-trained favourite Viscount Nelson four and a half lengths back in third. After a two-month break, Kingsfort returned for the Group 1 National Stakes over the same course and distance on 12 September. He started the 9/4 second favourite behind Alfred Nobel in a six-runner field which also included Beethoven, Air Chief Marshall (runner up to Alfred Nobel in the Phoenix Stakes) and the highly regarded maiden winner Chabal. Ridden as on his first appearance by Declan McDonogh, he raced in third place behind Air Chief Marshall and Beethoven before going to the front a furlong out and held off a late challenge from Chabal to win by a neck. In October, Kingsfort was acquired privately by Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin organisation and transferred to the training stable of Saeed bin Suroor. 2010: three-year-old season In early 2010, it was announced that Kingfort had suffered a \\"setback\\" and would miss both the 2000 Guineas and the Epsom Derby. After an absence of over a year, the colt made his first appearance for his new connections in the Listed Guisborough Stakes over seven furlongs at Redcar Racecourse on 2 October 2010. He started the 11/4 joint- favourite but made little impression and finished fifth behind the five-year- old gelding Harrison George. In the Ben Marshall Stakes at Newmarket four weeks, later he was the least fancied of the three Godolphin runners, starting at 10/1; whereas, his stablemates Secrecy and Alexandros went off at 15/8 and 100/30, respectively. The best of the other five runners appeared to be Nationalism and The Cheka both of whom were preferred to Kingsfort in the betting. After racing in third place behind the 40/1 outsider Lefty, Kingsfort was sent to the front a furlong out and kept on well to win by one and a quarter lengths from The Cheka. 2011: four-year-old season In the early part of 2011, Kingsfort was sent to Godolphin's training base in the United Arab Emirates and contested two handicap races at Meydan Racecourse in Dubai, ridden on both occasions by Frankie Dettori. He finished third to Derbaas in the Falcon Lounge Trophy over 1600 metres in January and fifth to Raihana in the Dubai Excellence Trophy over 1800 metres in February. On his return to Europe, he had one further race. In the Prix du Muguet over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 1 May, he led for most of the way before being overtaken in the last 200 metres and finishing sixth behind Rajsaman. Stud record At the end of his racing career, Kingsfort was retired to become a breeding stallion at the Azienda Agricola Cansana in Italy.

He is considered one of the leading figures in the history of medicine in MoliseTesta, Le grandi figure... p. 68 and of the neapolitan medicine of his time. Indeed, he was one of the most important doctors of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, being he the personal physician of the King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies. In medicine he was one of the proponents of the experimental anatomo-clinical method and founder of the Neapolitan positive-naturalistic school that opposed the vitalist theories then in vogue and supported in Milan by Giovanni Rasori and in Bologna by Giacomo Tommasini with his \\"New Italian Medical Doctrine\\".Testa, Le grandi figure... p. 68-69 Studies Pietro Ramaglia was born on 31 March 1802 in Ripabottoni from a family of humble means: his father, Francesco (1773 - 1851) worked as a tailor, while his mother, Veneranda de Julio (1775 - 1815) was a farmer. He completed his elementary studies in his birth town, probably due to the poverty of his parents. Having shown excellent predisposition, he was sent to Larino's seminary to continue his studies. Released with the certificate of highly trained student, he was sent to complete his preparation in the Domenico Trotta's private college in Toro, Molise, situated in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.Testa, Le grandi figure... p. 68-69 The prof. Nasca, his friend and colleague, reports that the young Ramaglia, at the early age of 15, decided to study medicine after meeting with a doctor who had particularly struck him. He moved to Naples after completing his studies in Toro, Molise. There he was welcomed as an intern in the Royal Medical College, where he graduated in 1823, being awarded, in consideration of his academic distinction, with the complete exemption from any expense connected to the graduation. During his studies he was particularly appreciated by his professors for his acumen and the tenacious application to the study.Testa, Le grandi figure... p. 69-70 left Works After his graduation he entered as an assistant in the Ospedale degli Incurabili, Naples (Italian for \\"Hospital for Incurables\\"). Here he devoted himself, with particular interest, to the study of normal and pathological anatomy. Always updated on the progress of medicine, he developed a \\"diagnostic method\\" that was described and published by his student, dr. Domenico Capozzi.Testa, Le grandi figure... p.69-72 In 1833 he opened a private study, where he started his career as private lecturer, activity that he would have carried on up until 8 November 1849, when he was authorized to continue his teachings in the Ospedale degli Incurabili. Later on, in 1852, he was appointed personal physician to the king of Two Sicilies, Ferdinand II of Bourbon. In 1857 he co-founded a medical journal named \\"Il Morgagni\\", after the famous anatomist Giovanni Battista Morgagni, which, under his direction, rapidly became one of the most relevant periodical publications on the subject. It was only after the fall of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies that Francesco De Sanctis, Minister of Education in the first post unitary government and reorganizer of the University of Naples, called him to the chair of pathological anatomy firstly and then to that of Medical Clinic. In 1865, however, Ramaglia, who had had the first signs of the evil that ten years later would have taken him to the grave, renounced his chair, but did not abandon his studies which ended with the precise analysis of his illness.Testa, Le grandi figure... p.70-73 He studied tuberculous meningitis for 40 years grouping a remarkable series of works which committed him until the end of his life, in Naples on June 4, 1875. He left his wife, Marianna Tambelli, the task of publishing his latest work \\"Studies on the basic granular meningitis\\", a study that saw the light in 1876.Testa, Le grandi figure... p.70-73 Personal life In 1839 he married the noblewoman Marianna Tambelli, of the barons of San Martino and Sant’Anzino, whose father was the wealthy neapolitan lawyer Paolo Tambelli, baron of Sant’Anzino; he had two daughters: Giovanna, married into the barons del Pozzo family, and Concetta, married to Luigi d’Amato, patrician of Amantea.

She is also the first out queer person in that country and has worked to eradicate discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in Bosnia and Herzegovina. As of 2018, she lives and works in Maryland, and Washington, D.C..  Personal background  Durkovic was born in Zagreb, Croatia, in 1974 and lived with her family in Sarajevo. Her mother, of Macedonian origin, and her father, of Montenegrin descent, were both refugees during World War II. Shortly before the Bosnian War broke out in 1991, Durkovic was in the United States in Halifax County High School on a student exchange program living with a family of local attorneys. As the war progressed she could not return to BiH, and she gained refugee status in America and graduated from Halifax County High School. On April 22, 1992, she lost contact with her family in Sarajevo during the siege of that city. Their next communication was 15 months later. Durkovic returned to Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2002.  Education  Durkovic completed her B.A. course with Honors in Anthropology, with a minor in Art History at Longwood University in May 1996 and her M.A. in Social Sciences at the University of Chicago in August 1998.  Work  She worked for the American Sociological Association from 1998 to 2000 as a Governance Coordinator and as a Minority Affairs Program Assistant. Upon returning to Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2002, she and Istok Bratic started the first initiative one human rights for LGBTIQ persons in the country, The Bosnia 14 September. This was the first educational and information web portal for LGBTIQ persons in BiH. In 2004, Durkovic co-founded the first LGBTIQ Organization Q. She was an early public advocate for LGBTIQ human rights, appearing on national television, radio, and social media in BiH from 2002 to 2009. Parallel to her experience in Organization Q, she has also worked in the UN Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights, UN Development Programme, and UNICEF. She also worked as a coordinator, facilitator and instructor in educational programs, training events and seminars related to gender, sex, identity, and human rights across BiH and the Balkan region, as well as for the Women Studies Program Žarana Papić. Due to her work and visibility as LGBTIQ human rights defender, she has received death threats.  Organization Q  DShe is one of the founders of the first LGBTIQ organization in BiH, Organization Q, registered in 2004. It was founded as a non-profit and non-governmental organization in Bosnia and Herzegovina dedicated to protection of human rights of LGBTIQ persons, as well as empowerment, development and public visibility of queer identity and culture, leading to the improvement of equality based on gender, sex, sexual orientation, sexual identity, gender identity and/or expression, and (inter)sexual characteristics. Durkovic was the president of Organization Q, and later, served as Executive Director. She has conducted research and co- authored publications and reports dealing with discrimination and social exclusion of the LGBTIQ population, namely in the areas of human rights, education, media, legislation, and health. Queer Sarajevo Festival 2008 Durkovic was one of the organizers and the public spokesperson for the Queer Sarajevo Festival 2008, the first of its kind in Bosnia and Herzegovina, held in September 2008. Before the festival opening, many publications, including the popular SAFF and Dnevni Avaz, used derogatory language, calling for the festival organizers to be lynched, stoned, doused with petrol, or expelled from the country. Death threats were also issued on the Internet against individual activists, including Durkovic. When the festival opened on September 24, 2008, at the Academy of Fine Arts in Sarajevo, a group of 70 religious extremists and hooligans attacked and injured eight people, including journalists and participants. The following day, a YouTube video appeared threatening the event organizers, showing digitally manipulated images of a beheaded Durkovic. The organizers terminated the festival the next day due to the reaction of the media, public, political, and religious representatives.

Paintings of the latter are to be found at the Louvre in Paris and at the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia.\\"Een schets van C.C. Huijsmans\\", Ad C.J.M.

Earlier generations of the Huijsmans family used to spell their family name slightly differently, i.e. Huysmans.Gazet van Antwerpen, 18 August 1939, p. 4. Early life and family Constant Cornelis Huijsmans was born in Breda on 1 January 1810. He was not only a painter but he was the Principal of the Art Academy in Breda as well as a teacher at the Royal Military Academy, also in Breda. He was the son of the painter and chemist Jacobus Carolus Huijsmans and Maria Elisabeth Beens.\\"Een schets van C.C. Huijsmans\\", Ad C.J.M. Willemen, Tijdschrift voor geschiedenis, monumenten en cultuur, jaargang 6, juni 1988, p. 78. In 1854 he married Ludovica Francisca Kerstens (1823–1855), whose father was the owner of a successful brewery in Breda.\\"Een schets van C.C. Huijsmans\\", Ad C.J.M.

The French author Joris-Karl Huysmans (Charles-Marie-Georges Huijsmans, 1848–1907) was his nephew.See paragraph on uncle and nephew Huijsmans in Een zachte aanraking van zijn zieleleven. Over 'ware' en 'valse' mystiek rond 1900, Peter J.A. Nissen, Van Tilt, 2008, p. 9. On the occasion of the latter's first major publication of a collection of French poems Huijsmans wrote in a letter dated 26 December 1874 to his nephew “by the way, your name in Dutch is Joris-Karel Huijsmans … you wrote [Jorris-Karl] which is German”.In a letter dated 26 December 1874 Huijsmans wrote to his nephew Joris-Karl Huijsmans: “A propos, ton nom en hollandais est Joris-Karel Huijsmans. Tu a écrit de l'allemand”, Jef van Kempen, “Joris-Karl Huijsmans in Tilburg”, Tijdschrift voor geschiedenis, monumenten en cultuur, jaargang 6, juni 1988, p. 72.The relationship between Constant Huijsmans and his nephew Joris-Karl Huijsmans has been described by Wilma van Giersbergen in De kunst is geheel en al bijzaak, de moeizame carrière van C.C. Huijsmans (1810-1886), tekenmeester in Brabant, Amsterdam, 2003, pp. 120 ff. Training and early work (1828–1840) Early years between 1828 and 1840 in Antwerp, Paris and Breda Huijsmans studied at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp and at the Academy of Fine Art in Paris.Huijsmans studied in Antwerp (1828-1830) and Paris (1833-1835), De kunst is geheel en al bijzaak, de moeizame carrière van C.C. Huijsmans (1810-1886), tekenmeester in Brabant, Wilma van Giersbergen, Amsterdam, 2003, pp. 28-32. Initially, he specialized in romantic landscapes, but later he turned to interior scenes. Several of his sketchbooks have survived and some of his early paintings are known. In 1835 he returned home because of his father's going blind. As the eldest of eight children he took upon himself the task to support his family financially and to succeed his father who had been an art teacher at the Art Academy as well as at the Royal Military Academy, both located in Breda. In 1838 Huijsmans became close friends with Pieter Johannes Veth (1814-1895), his colleague (until 1841) at the Koninklijke Militaire Academie. Veth later became professor of Ethnology of the Dutch East Indies at the University of Leiden and the first Chairman of the Royal Netherlands Geographical Society. They kept up a correspondence until Huijsmans died in 1886.51 letters have survived, cf. De kunst is geheel en al bijzaak, de moeizame carrière van C.C. Huijsmans (1810-1886), tekenmeester in Brabant, Wilma van Giersbergen, Amsterdam, 2003, pp. 5, 7-8. Huijsmans managed to combine both his teaching job and his painting and took part in various national exhibitions.\\"Een portret van Constant Huijsmans (1810-1886) op 24-jarige leeftijd\\", Wilma van Giersbergen, Jaarboek De Oranjeboom, 54, 2001, p. 216. Art teaching career (1840–1879) Brabants landscape, 1849 (75 x 60 cm). Brabants landscape, 1849. Huijsmans developed two art teaching methods and he used these methods himself in his art classes. Some institutions such as the Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten) in Amsterdam employed his approach as well. Huijsmans was the first in The Netherlands to dedicate himself to the professionalization of the subject of art teaching. His first art teaching method was called Het landschap (The Landscape), developed and published in 1840.C.C. Huijsmans, Het Landschap, published by H.J. Backer, Dordrecht, 1840. It became a bestseller. The art dealer Vincent van Gogh (\\"uncle Cent\\", the uncle of Vincent van Gogh) subscribed to this new teaching method.\\"Een schets van C.C. Huijsmans\\", Ad C.J.M. Willemen, Tijdschrift voor geschiedenis, monumenten en cultuur, jaargang 6, juni 1988, p. 78. In 1845 King William II of the Netherlands bought Huijsmans’ painting “Interior of a House in North-Brabant”. This seemed the beginning of success for Constant Huijsmans. However, in 1851 he decided to give up painting completely and to concentrate on teaching. In 1852 Huijsmans developed a second teaching method Grondbeginselen der Teekenkunst, eene theoretische en practische Handleiding om het teekenen grondig te leeren (Principles of Art Teaching, a Theoretical and Practical Manual).C.C. Huijsmans, Grondbeginselen der Teekenkunst, eene theoretische en practische Handleiding om het teekenen grondig te leeren, published by P.N. van Kampen, Amsterdam, 1852.\\"Een schets van C.C. Huijsmans\\", Ad C.J.M. Willemen, Tijdschrift voor geschiedenis, monumenten en cultuur, jaargang 6, juni 1988, p. 78. Between 1853 and 1872 he published articles in several magazines, such as De Gids.For the titles of Huijsmans’ articles in The Gids, see Digitale Bibliotheek voor de Nederlandse Letteren, C.C. Huysmans (here once again written with “y” instead of “ij”). As a result of the mediation of Dutch statesman and minister of liberal signature, Johan Rudolph Thorbecke,\\"Een schets van C.C. Huijsmans\\", Ad C.J.M. Willemen, Tijdschrift voor geschiedenis, monumenten en cultuur, jaargang 6, juni 1988, p. 79. Huijsmans obtained in 1865 the important position of art teacher at the new and prestigious Willem II College in Tilburg, a school commissioned by King William II himself. The school was housed in the former royal palace, now the City Hall of Tilburg, but moved in 1934 to a new location.Jaren van voorzichtig beleid, ter gelegenheid van het 125-jarig bestaan van de Rijksscholengemeenschap Koning Willem II in Tilburg (1866-1991), . (Years of Careful Management, published on the occasion of the 125th anniversary of the King Willem II College in Tilburg). Vincent van Gogh Vincent van Gogh aged about 19 years During Huijsmans' years as art teacher at the Willem II College in Tilburg, Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh was the school's and Huijsmans’ most famous student between 15 September 1866 and 19 March 1868.Huijsmans’ art classes were attended by Vincent van Gogh during 1866-1868, see chapter “De tekenklas en Vincent van Gogh”, De kunst is geheel en al bijzaak, de moeizame carrière van C.C. Huijsmans (1810-1886), tekenmeester in Brabant, Wilma van Giersbergen, Amsterdam, 2003, pp. 173-74. Van Gogh (1853–1890) had initially been taught at home by his mother and a governess, and later attended the village school in Groot-Zundert, in North Brabant. In 1864 he was sent to a boarding school at Zevenbergen, but in 1866 his parents decided to send him to the new and prestigious Willem II College in Tilburg. In March 1868 Van Gogh suddenly returned home. One drawing of two men with shovels (1867) has survived from this period in the life of Vincent van Gogh.\\"Vincent van Gogh Special\\", Tijdschrift voor geschiedenis, monumenten en cultuur, jaargang 8, nr. 2, mei 1990, p. 35. A year later, in July 1869, Van Gogh obtained his first job with an art dealer Goupil & Cie in The Hague, through the mediation of his uncle Cent (Vincent van Gogh, 1820-1888), also an art dealer in The Hague. Huijsmans remained an art teacher at the Willem II College until 1877.\\"Een schets van C.C. Huijsmans\\", Ad C.J.M. Willemen, Tijdschrift voor geschiedenis, monumenten en cultuur, jaargang 6, juni 1988, p. 80. Later years and death (1879–1886) In 1879 Huijsmans moved to The Hague together with his sister Oda. Huijsmans died in The Hague on 28 November 1886 at the age of 76.\\"Een schets van C.C. Huijsmans\\", Ad C.J.M. Willemen, Tijdschrift voor geschiedenis, monumenten en cultuur, jaargang 6, juni 1988, p. 80. Library Huijsmans had built up an interesting library with works from e.g. Leonardo da Vinci, Giorgio Vasari and Karel van Mander, as well as six books by Jan Luyken, and many, mostly French, poetry collections.A description of his library in his beautiful house in a street called “de Ven” (today Piusplein 6 and 6a, Tilburg), is to be found in \\"Een schets van C.C. Huijsmans\\", Ad C.J.M. Willemen, Tijdschrift voor geschiedenis, monumenten en cultuur, jaargang 6, juni 1988, p. 79 . There are six letters from him to the famous Dutch William Shakespeare translator, Leendert Burgersdijk. They knew each other well and Burgersdijk would regularly ask Huijsmans for comments on the translations.\\"Vincent van Gogh Special\\", Tijdschrift voor geschiedenis, monumenten en cultuur, jaargang 8, nr. 2, mei 1990, p. 54.

In 1945 she took a job as rehearsal pianist, coach, understudy or multi-tasking \\"swing-girl\\" for The Firebrand of Florence, a Kurt Weill musical making its Broadway debut. This proved to be the start of a new career as Weill's musical assistant: from that point a principal focus of her professional life was on the composer and, more particularly after his early death in 1950, the career of his widow, the stage performer Lotte Lenya. When Lenya died, in 1981, Lys Symonette was appointed vice-president of the Kurt Weill Foundation, also serving as its \\"musical executive\\". When she died her friend and frequent collaborator, Prof. Kim H. Kowalke, published an affectionate tribute in which he described her as \\"the last and irreplaceable link to the inner artistic circle of Weill and Lenya\\".  Life   Provenance and early years  Berta Elisabeth Weinschenk was born in Mainz. Max Weinschenk, her father, was a Jewish wine merchant. Her mother, born Gertrude Metzger, was a committed singer who, as a contralto, gave recitals not just in her home city but also in Frankfurt and Gotha. There was musicianship on her father's side too: Jacob Hugo Weinschenk, her uncle, was an enthusiastic 'cellist (who also wrote sonnets). Bertlies (as she quickly came to be known) grew up with her parents and her younger sister, Marianne, at the family home at \\"Fischtor 21\\" in Mainz. An early blow was the death of her father when she was eleven. Almost at once, however, Bertlies and Marianne found they had acquired a (Christian) stepfather, Dr. Willi Honheisser.Frauenbüro 2015, p. 59: Reinhard Frenzel: \\"Marianne Lee, geborene Weinschenk\\" She attended the \\"Linkenbach\\" private school and then, between 1924 and 1934, the Senior Girls' School in Mainz.Frauenbüro 2015, p. 58: Reinhard Frenzel: \\"Lys Symonette, Bertlies Weinschenk\\" She passed her school final exams (Abitur) in 1934. She had not excelled particularly at mathematics and the sciences, but at the Senior School she had obtained top marks in singing and shown herself to be more than competent as a pianist. Her exam results in 1934 would, under other circumstances, have opened the way to university level education, but it was at this time still unusual for girls to attend university and the times were, in any case, malign. Nevertheless, at some point she was taught by Lothar Windsperger at the Peter Cornelius Conservatory in Mainz, and she briefly moved to Berlin to embark on a period as a music student, studying both the piano and singing.  Nazi takeover  At the start of 1933 the Nazi Party took power in Weimar Germany and lost little time in transforming the country into a one-party dictatorship. The shrill antisemitism which had featured prominently in Nazi propaganda during the preceding decade became a key underpinning of government policy. During 1933 and 1934 many believed that the government, like others before it, would not last, but four years later the Nazis were still in control. At this stage arrest and imprisonment were still, for the most part, restricted to those Jews who were politically active: nevertheless, employment and business opportunities were being systematically cut away. In September 1933 Bertlies Weinschenk obtained an exit visa and relocated with her family, briefly, to Cologne where her sister had found a job in the garments industry. In 1936 she fled via Italy to Cuba. Bertlies would later recall that on the day they left Cologne she opened the balcony window of the hotel room where she was staying and played records of music from Kurt Weill's Threepenny Opera – which had been banned in Germany since 1933 – for the benefit of passers-by. From Cuba, helped by American contacts, she was able to obtain the necessary permits to enter the United States of America towards the end of 1937. In 1938 she was joined in the U.S. by her younger sister, who had managed to make the journey from Nazi Germany with fewer hold-ups.  New life in the United States  It was also in 1938 that Bertlies Weinschenk enrolled at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia where, as before, she studied as both a piano and a voice student. She received a stipendium which funded her studies and covered her living expenses. Her teachers included Vera Brodsky and Elisabeth Schumann. Someone else whom she met at the Curtis was Ned Rorem, a composition student from the mid-west: she became the first singer to perform Rorem's songs in public. After graduating, during the early 1940s she performed regularly in clubs across the country as part of the two-piano combo \\"Yola and Lisa, the Mexican sisters\\" with Alberta Masiello, for which the two young women dressed \\"appropriately\\", \\"with big skirts and big earrings\\". The story is told of one night when the \\"sisters\\" were hired to perform at a club venue precariously located at the end of a pier in Galveston: they played on through a hurricane in order to avoid foregoing their fee.  Kurt Weill and Randolph Symonette  It was Maurice Abravanel who recommended her to Kurt Weill as a rehearsal pianist for his new 1945 Broadway musical, The Firebrand of Florence. Abravanel was the conductor for the original production. As she would later laconically recall, Abravenal \\"suspected that [she] might be able to do the job, having been both a voice and piano major at the Curtis ...\\". After three days of \\"sight-reading-transposing-improvising\\" as she provided accompaniment for what felt like a never ending succession of auditioneers, a small man emerged, grinning, from the shadows of the auditorium: \\"I'd love to have you in the show. I'm Kurt Weill\\". Until Weill's early death in 1950 she worked closely with him. Using the stage name \\"Lys Bert\\" she appeared in the chorus. On the occasion of Lotte Lenya's Broadway debut, the great diva (still relatively unknown outside Germany) was to be preceded by Billy Dee Williams singing \\"Make Way for the Duchess\\", but Williams found himself unable to maintain his pitch that night and the song was instead sung offstage by the \\"boyish-sounding soprano\\", \\"Lisa Bert\\" (as she was listed on that occasion). Despite participating in stage performances, it appears that her more crucial contribution quickly became as a répétiteuse and as a coach for the singers. She evidently had an intense understanding of the singular singing style that Weill's music invited and, she would have insisted, needed. In 1949 she embarked on a parallel role as a translator, applying her skills to the libtretto of Weill's 1927 one-act comic opera, Der Zar lässt sich photographieren (The Czar Has His Photograph Taken) for the Metropolitan Opera studio. The part of the Hangman in the original production of The Firebrand of Florence had been taken by a New York bass-baritone called Randolph Symonette. In October 1949, Lost in the Stars opened on Broadway. Her rehearsal work done, Lys left for an extended visit to Canada where she married \\"The Hangman\\". They returned to New York in March 1950: when Lys Symonette tried to telephone him that she was back, the telephone was answered by a maid who told her that \\"Mr Weill\\" was in hospital. He died a few days later. This triggered a major turning point. Randolph and Lys Symonette now relocated to West Germany where Randolph Symonette appeared in various major opera houses, focusing on some of the large-voice Wagner roles. Initially he spoke absolutely no German and his new wife had to coach him phonetically for his roles. During the 1953/54 season Lys was able to return with her husband to Mainz where he appeared at the recently reopened Staatstheater. During their time living in West Germany she also promoted Weill's later works in that country \\"through ingenious translations and ceaseless proselytizing\\".  Return to New York  Ten years later the couple returned to New York City. Over the next few years Randolph made a number of further appearances at the Metropolitan Opera. Lys appeared with Weill's widow, Lotte Lenya at the Theatre de Lys, accompanying the singer in Gene Frankel's production, Brecht on Brecht. Over the next couple of decades she worked closely with Lenya as accompanist, trusted musical advisor and, at least on matters touching Kurt Weill's artistic legacy, friend and mentor. She persuaded Lenya to allow her to hand over a fat pile of unpublished Kurt Weill songs to Teresa Stratas which led to the publication of numerous songs that otherwise would have been lost to posterity including, most notably, \\"Youkali\\". In 1968 the Symonettes relocated to Tallahassee where Randolph had accepted a teaching job – later a professorship – at Florida State University. Two years after that she was drawn back to New York in order to be at the side of Lotte Lenya during preparations for an English-language premiere of Weill's \\"Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny\\" (\\"Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny\\"). Preparation of the opera had been dogged by artistic and legal disagreement, and Symonette reprised her role as \\"musical representative\\" of Lotte Lenya for rehearsals and performances. In the end credit for the translation of the libretto was shared between Lys Symonette and the poet Arnold Weinstein. As the 1970s progressed the amount of time spent supporting Lotte Lenya increased. Additionally, in 1974 Lys Symonette returned to the Curtis Institute, now as a voice coach. During the decade she collaborated on several new Weill productions and engaged in other projects which involved the publication and, frequently, the performance of hitherto unknown Kurt Weill songs.  Later years and the Kurt Weill Foundation  Lotte Lenya died of cancer on 27 November 1981. She had been ill for several years, undergoing surgery in 1977 and again in 1978, and had initially avoided the implications of her failing health for her late husband's artistic legacy. However, by the later summer of 1980 she had been persuaded to give the matter serious consideration, and on 25 September a board of six trustees was elected for the newly established \\"Kurt Weill Foundation\\". The six included Kim Kowalke, today (2017) the foundation's long-standing president and, Lys Symonette who for a quarter of a century, till her death would serve as the foundation's vice-president. When Lenya died the foundation's mandate to \\"administer, promote, and perpetuate \\"the legacies of Kurt Weill and Lotte Lenya\\" was confirmed in her will. Lys Symonette suffered a fatal heart attack at Windsor, New York less than a month before what would have been her ninety-first birthday.

It was the 48th edition of the singles event and the 43rd edition of the doubles competition. The tournament was contested by eight singles players and eight doubles teams. This was the final year for Singapore to hold this tournament. Tournament Singapore Indoor Stadium hosted the WTA Finals for the first time in 2014. The 2018 WTA Finals took place at the Singapore Indoor Stadium the week of October 21, 2018, and was the 48th edition of the event. This was the final year in which Singapore hosted the event. The tournament was run by the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) as part of the 2018 WTA Tour. Singapore was the ninth city to host the WTA Finals since its inauguration in 1972. Qualifying In singles, point totals are calculated by combining point totals from sixteen tournaments. Of these sixteen tournaments, a player's results from the four Grand Slam events, the four Premier Mandatory tournaments, and (for Top 20 players at the end of 2017) the best results from two Premier 5 tournaments must be included. In doubles, point totals are calculated by any combination of eleven tournaments throughout the year. Unlike in singles, this combination does not need to include results from the Grand Slams or Premier-level tournaments. Format The singles event features eight players in a round robin event, split into two groups of four. Over the first four days of competition, each player meets the other three players in her group, with the top two in each group advancing to the semifinals. The first-placed player in one group meets the second-placed player in the other group, and vice versa. The winners of each semifinal meet in the championship match. The doubles event returns to a single elimination event. The winners of each quarterfinal match will advance to the semifinals and the winners of each semifinal match will advance to the final. Round robin tie-breaking methods The final standings were made using these methods: # Greatest number of wins. #Greatest number of matches played. # Head-to-head results if only two players are tied, or if three players are tied then: ::a. If three players each have the same number of wins, a player having played less than all three matches is automatically eliminated and the player advancing to the single elimination competition is the winner of the match-up of the two remaining tied players. ::b.

Early life and family  Lady Mary Olivia Charteris was born on 23 April 1987 to James Charteris, 13th Earl of Wemyss and 9th Earl of March, and the Hon. Catherine Ingrid Guinness, a former colleague of Andy Warhol and the daughter of Jonathan Bryan Guinness, 3rd Baron Moyne. She has an older brother, Francis Richard (Dick) Charteris, Lord Elcho.

In 1995 her father remarried to Amanda Feilding. She was educated at Francis Holland School in London, where she studied classical civilisation, art, and ethics.  Career   Modelling  As a teenager, Charteris began modelling after Isabella Blow, a magazine editor and family friend, introduced her to the Storm Models agency. She has modelled for Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Nike, Iceberg, Philip Treacy, Markus Lupfer, Thakoon, Jason Wu, and Topshop. She has been featured in print editorials and spreads in Vogue, Vogue Italia, British Vogue, Vanity Fair, Love, Tatler, Glamour Spain, Elle Korea, L'Officiel, Flaunt, and Purple and has posed for Mario Testino, Terry Richardson, Olivier Zahm, Ellen Von Unwerth, Solve Sundsbo, David Bailey, and Michel Comte.

She is a frequent attendee at music festivals like Glastonbury and Coachella. In June 2018 she performed as a DJ at the Cartier Queen's Cup.  MPRSSS  In January 2013 Charteris announced an electronic music project she created called MPRSSS. She was influenced by her relationship with her husband's band. She began experimenting in her husband's studio with beats and synths with different effects, which lead to the creation of MPRSSS. The video was directed by Rob Hawkins.

She joined the rock group on tour; selling merchandise, managing press, and assisting with stage lighting. In 2016 she joined the rock group as a keyboarder and vocalist. Charteris' first record as a member of the band, making her debut in the single Hightimes, was the EP Empire Underground which released on 4 March 2016. In 2016 she began her first tour with the band as a vocalist on their North American tour. She and Robbie Fulze also perform sets as DJs together under Big Pink and Big Pink Stripped Back.

Guests included Florence Welch, Lily Allen, Poppy Delevingne, Sean Lennon, Jerry Hall, and Georgia May Jagger. Her wedding dress, designed by Pam Hogg, was later put on exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Charteris and her husband live in Los Angeles.

His second visit to Ireland was at the invitation of the College Theological Society at Trinity College Dublin in 1978. This was after his decision to ordain some seminarians in the summer of 1976. On that occasion the Archbishop told the people who came to hear him that the Irish were, in his opinion, traditionalists at heart and if they knew what he really believed they would be more receptive. He also claimed that he did not oppose Pope Paul VI. He was accompanied on that occasion by Rev. Richard Williamson one of his English speaking priests. By the late 1970s and early 1980s there was a group of Catholics in Ireland that desired the older form of the Mass. There was no resident priest and people hosted priests that came from England to offer Mass on a monthly basis. In 1980 Lefebvre visited again and spoke on 8 May in Liberty Hall and held a press conference on the same day. On the following day he offered Mass in the Central Hotel for about 150 people. In 1982 a priest was assigned to Ireland on a full-time basis and it was necessary to purchase a suitable residence. This was done despite the small size of a congregation at the time. With a full-time priest resident in Ireland and regular services the size of the congregation more than doubled to over 500 and it was necessary to purchase a church. It wasn't until the summer of 1985 that the faithful of the Society of St Pius X had a permanent church of their own in Ireland. The first Mass in the newly acquired church was offered by Fr. John Emerson on 11 August that year with over 250 faithful in attendance. The church was dedicated by Archbishop Lefebvre in front of a congregation of 500 on 29 September. In the same year two men from Ireland entered the seminary in Écône. At this time the priest resident in Dublin also traveled to offer Masses in Newry and Belfast.

In particular, he gave leadership to a crowd of about 25,000 members of the community at Mattancherry during the open revolt against the Portuguese in 1653 following the capture of the Syrian Bishop Ahatallah.

Aftermath of the Coonan Cross Oath  After the Coonan Cross Oath, Thommen organized an important meeting of the Saint Thomas Christian community, at Alangadu Church. This meeting made the historic decision to administer the Malankara church independent of the Portuguese Padroado or Roman Catholic prelates. In order to take over the administration of the church, the meeting also decided to form a council of four senior Kathanars willing to support Archdeacon Thomas. Apart from Thommen, the members of this council were: * Kadavil Chandy Kathanar * Palliveetil Chandy Kathanar * Vengoor Geevarghese Kathanar However, the Portuguese made some offers and managed to convince two of these Kathanars to transfer their allegiance to the Roman Catholic Church.

Here, Mr Riah is scolded by Jenny Wren, \\"You are the Wolf in the Forest, the wicked Wolf!\\" Give a dog a bad name and hang him is an English proverb. Its meaning is that if a person's reputation has been besmirched, then he will suffer difficulty and hardship. A similar proverb is he that has an ill name is half hanged. The proverb dates back to the 18th century or before. In 1706, John Stevens recorded it as \\"Give a Dog an ill name and his work is done\\". In 1721, James Kelly had it as a Scottish proverb – \\"Give a Dog an ill Name, and he'll soon be hanged.

The site where the stones were assembled, some as high as 3 feet, and in a distinct set of circles, was known as Alabena, which, because had been used for cattle mustering, a practice which contributed to the deterioration of the ceremonial ground's structure.

Early life and military career Claude Nicholson was the elder son of Richard Francis Nicholson, a distiller from Hampshire, and was born on 2 July 1898 in Chelsea, London, England. He was educated at Winchester College, and in 1915 he entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst and served with the 16th Lancers in France and Belgium until 1918 during World War I. He later served in Palestine, India and Egypt. After attending the Staff College, Camberley, from 1928 to 1929, in 1930–31 he served at the War Office and then commanded cadets at the Royal Military College. On 31 December 1935 he married Ursula Katherine Hanbury-Tracy. In 1934 he was promoted to brevet Major. In 1938 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and taught at the Staff College and then commanded his regiment, the 16th/5th Lancers, in India from 1938 to 1939. World War II When World War II started, Nicholson was given command of 30th Infantry Brigade, which was created on 20 April 1940 to serve in Norway. Nicholson's brigade left Dover and reached Calais on 23 May 1940 to keep the Calais port open and relieve the defenders at the Battle of Boulogne. With the German advance, that became impossible and Nicholson held Calais. The Germans advanced on the town and laid siege to it, shelling the town and drawing closer. This was just before the start of Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) through Dunkirk. The next day, Nicholson was told that his brigade might be evacuated back to Britain. As the large German force fought through the town the same day, Nicholson ordered a staged withdrawal from the ramparts to more easily defensible places in the city, such as the Citadel and the Gare Maritime, a train station. On the morning of the 25th, the Germans sent the Mayor of Calais to Nicholson to ask him to surrender, saying that if he did not, they would bomb and shell the town until it was razed. Nicholson said: \\"Surrender? No, I shall not surrender. Tell the Germans that if they want Calais they will have to fight for it.\\" The Germans resumed their fire and soon after Nicholson received a telegram from Anthony Eden, Secretary of War. \\"Defence of Calais is of vital importance to our country and BEF and as showing our continued co-operation with France. The eyes of the whole Empire are upon the defence of Calais, and His Majesty’s government is confident that you and your gallant regiments will perform an exploit worthy of the British name.\\" He received and refused another offer to surrender from the Germans: \\"The answer is no, as it is the British Army’s duty to fight as well as it is the Germans'.\\" Nicholson continued visiting the troops at the front lines. That night, Winston Churchill telegrammed Nicholson: \\"Every hour you continue to exist is of the greatest help to the BEF. Government has therefore decided that you must continue to fight. Have greatest possible admiration for your splendid stand. Evacuation will not (repeat not) take place, and craft required for above purpose are to return to Dover.\\" Churchill later wrote that he felt physically sick after sending the telegram. On 26 May, the German barrage continued and in the afternoon, the Germans broke through, taking Nicholson and many soldiers prisoner. On 4 June 1940 Churchill spoke to Parliament about Nicholson's defence: He was taken to a prisoner camp near Salzburg, then later to one in Hesse.  Katyn incident  While imprisoned, Nicholson was asked to be an independent witness that the Germans did not perpetrate the Katyn massacre, where around 20,000 Polish officers and intelligentsia were killed by the Soviets. Nicholson, the senior British officer at his camp, and the senior American officer, Col. John H. Van Vliet (later the author of the \\"Van Vliet report\\" implicating the Soviets in the massacre) refused, not wanting to be part of a German propaganda effort. Van Vliet and another American officer were later forced to go.  Death Nicholson died in captivity in 1943, in the German city of Rotenburg an der Fulda where he was kept as a POW. According to his death certificate, he threw himself out of a window after suffering from depression, suffering a skull fracture. He was taken to the city hospital, where he died in the early morning hours of 26th June 1943 and was buried at Rotenburg Civil Cemetery. His date of death is given as 26th or 27th June in his obituary in The Times. He was awarded Companion of the Order of the Bath for his services at Calais in 1940. Historical reaction In 1949, Churchill wrote that the defence of Calais led by Nicholson delayed the German attack on Dunkirk, helping to save the British Expeditionary Force, a claim that German general Heinz Guderian contradicted in 1951. In 1966, Lionel Ellis, the British official historian, wrote that three panzer divisions had been diverted by the defence of Boulogne and Calais, giving the Allies time to rush troops to close a gap west of Dunkirk. In 2006, Karl-Heinz Frieser wrote that the halt order issued to the German unit commanders because of the Anglo-French attack at the Battle of Arras (21 May) had a greater effect than the siege. Hitler and the higher German commanders panicked because of their fears of flank attacks, when the real danger was of the Allies retreating to the coast before they could be cut off. Reinforcements sent from Britain to Boulogne and Calais arrived in time to forestall the Germans and hold them off when they advanced again on 22 May. Film portrayal Nicholson is portrayed by Richard Glover in the 2017 film Darkest Hour about Winston Churchill in 1940.

The Stoke-on-Trent Green Belt is a green belt environmental and planning policy that regulates the rural space throughout mainly the West Midlands region of England. It is contained within the counties of Cheshire and Staffordshire. Essentially, the function of the designated area is to prevent surrounding towns and villages within the Stoke-on-Trent conurbation from further convergence. It is managed by local planning authorities on guidance from central government.  Purpose  The following policy was stated for the creation of the green belt area by Staffordshire County Council in 1967: * \\"To limit the expansion into adjoining open country of the urban areas of North Staffordshire forming part of the Potteries Conurbation. * To prevent the following towns and settlements in the adjoining open area from merging with the Potteries Conurbation and with other settlements; ::a) The built up areas of Kidsgrove and Biddulph; ::b) The settlements of Brown Edge, Endon, Stanley, Bagnall, Stanley Moor, Norton Green, Baddeley Green, Baddeley Edge, Light Oaks, Werrington, Cellarhead, Caverswall, Cookshill, Blythe Bridge, Forsbrook, Meir Heath, Barlaston, Alsagers Bank, Halmer End, Miles Green, Wood Lane, Bignall End and Audley. * To prevent the coalescence of the following towns and settlements around the Potteries Conurbation: ::Leek with Longsdon; Leek with Cheddleton; Longsdon with Cheddleton; Longsdon with Endon; Cheddleton with Folly Lane; Folly Lane with Wetley Rocks; Wetley Rocks with Cellarhead; Cheadle with Kingsley Holt; Kingsley with Kingsley Holt; Cheadle with Dihorne; Cheadle with Forsbrook; Fulford with Meir Heath; Stone with Oulton; Stone with Yarfield; Tittensor with Barlaston; Barlaston with Stone; Madeley Heath with Madeley; Betley with Audley. * To maintain the present open character of the land within the North Staffordshire Green Belt and to prevent the coalescence of smaller settlements not mentioned above.\\" Cheshire County Council set out their policy in 1961: * \\"Prevent the outward spread of development from Greater Manchester, Merseyside and the Potteries\\" Geography Land area taken up by the green belt is , 0.5% of the total land area of England (2010). The main coverage of the area is within northern Staffordshire, extending into southern Cheshire. The North West Green Belt area surrounding Macclesfield lies close to the Stoke-on-Trent green belt, being just over a mile away at its closest extent from the River Dane which forms the northern boundary for the area. Landscape facilities and features within the green belt area include the Cudmore Fisheries, Meaford Energy Centre, Millennium Topograph in Downs Banks, JCB Harewood Estate, Rudyard Lake, Meir Heath, Barlaston Common, Chatterley Whitfield Country Park and enterprise centre, Bucknall Reservoir, the Trent & Mersey and Caldon canals, the River Blythe and Trent, Wedgwood Museum and estate, Strongford Sewage Treatment Works, and Trent Vale Pumping Station. A large portion of the western boundary is formed by the West Coast Main Line railway. Towns on the outer extents of the green belt include Alsager, Cheadle, Congleton, Crewe, Leek, and Stone. Towns and villages within the area include Biddulph, Endon, Kidsgrove, Rudyard, Scholar Green and Swynnerton. Due to the green belt lying across county borders, responsibility and co-ordination lies with several district councils and unitary authorities as these are the local planning authorities.

It was introduced into the United States in the 1890s and has since spread over the southern half of the country. Taxonomy This insect was first described in California in 1892 by the American entomologist Frank Ellsworth Blaisdell. He named it Scymnus lophanthae, and thought it was a native American species. Unbeknown to him, the beetle was an introduced species, and at about the same time, it was described in its native Australia by the Australian entomologist Thomas Blackburn, who gave it the name Rhizobius toowoombae. However, Blaisdell's name took precedence as it was published first, and R. toowoombae became a synonym. The specific name lophanthae means \\"of lophantha\\", referring to the plant Paraserianthes lophantha on which Blaisdell originally saw the ladybird. Description Rhyzobius lophanthae is a small ladybird with a length between and a width of between . The head and prothorax are reddish-brown, as is the underside, both being densely covered with short hairs of two lengths. The elytra (wing cases) are blackish, often with a metallic bronze sheen. The larvae are dark brown and is clad in stout spines. Distribution and habitat R. lophanthae is native to Australia where it is present in Queensland and Southern Australia. It was introduced into California in 1892 in an attempt to control the olive scale (Saissetia oleae). It has since spread over much of the southern United States. Ecology Both adults and larvae feed on scale insects, and especially on armoured scales at all periods of their development; they also feed on mealybugs. The younger beetle larvae crawl under the adult scale insect's protective scale, feeding on the scale nymphs before they disperse. These insects are a pest of citrus, sucking the sap from the plants, and the ladybirds have been used in biological pest control, in order to reduce the number of scale insects in the crop.

Personal and professional life  Liepmann was born in Stettin and the son of a bank director. His elder brother, , was an economist. After attending Gymnasium in Jena, where he took school leaving exams in 1923, he studied German, philosophy, modern history and political economy simultaneously at the University of Jena. In his leisure time he worked at an academic book dealer. His teachers at Jena included, among others, Emil Lederer and Alfred Weber, and he heard their lectures on political economy. In the summer term of 1925 Liepmann moved to Heidelberg, where, aside from replacing German with sociology, he continued with the same subject specialisms. In 1931 he submitted his dissertation, supervised by von Weber, on Economy and Revolution in Germany in 1848, and was awarded Dr. rer. oec. (comparable with a PhD in Economics), with a summa cum laude commendation. During his studies in Heidelberg, Liepmann founded the Akademischdemokratische Studentengruppe (Democratic Student Group) which was closely allied with the DDP, and led it from 1926 till 1929. Liepmann spent the summer term of 1932 on a post-doctoral scholarship at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva after which he returned to Heidelberg, where until 1934 he worked as a research assistant under von Weber in the research programme supported by the Rockefeller Foundation on \\"Zum wirtschaftlichen Schicksal Europas\\" (\\"Concerning the Economic Fate of Europe\\"). In 1936 Liepmann moved to the UK, on account of growing harassment connected with his Jewish origins. In 1938 he published his only book on political economics, a comprehensive quantitative and comparative study of the development of customs tariffs in the principal European trading nations, and their economic effects. Given the growing protectionism shortly before and during the Great Depression, which provided rich data for the period between 1927 and 1931, the work attracted considerable interest, and was discussed in British periodicals. In order to compare average increases in customs tariffs in various countries, Liepmann chose a notional 'sample list' of goods, rather than using actual country-specific goods and quantities, and used it to calculate 'potential tariff levels'. He demonstrated, using statistical material, that tariffs for all product categories, and in particular for agricultural produce, had risen sharply in the five years following the failed World Economic Conference of 1927, and he was a critic of British protectionism. The Nazi police authorities classified Liepmann as an enemy of the state after his emigration. In early 1940 the Reich Main Security Office added him to The Black Book, an index of persons who, in the event of a successful invasion of Britain by the German army, were to be found and arrested as a matter of high priority by SS Commandos who would follow the occupying forces.Entry for Liepmann in The Black Book. (Link to the Website of the Imperial War Museum in London). In early 1940 Liepmann was offered research funding at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, but was unable to take it up owing to his internment by the British authorities in May 1940 as an enemy alien. Following his release in February 1941, he was unable to obtain either a visa or an ocean passage to Canada to take up the position. In 1942 he received a scholarship to work at the Royal Institute of International Affairs/Chatham House in Cambridge; then from April to September 1943 he was employed for his linguistic skills as a monitor by the BBC. From January 1944 Liepmann was a German teacher at the County Grammar School for Boys (now Langley Park School for Boys) in Beckenham, Kent.Liepmann is described as 'Teacher' in , where his name and address appear in the list of persons naturalized as British citizens in January 1948.

In October 2015, Block won a gold medal at the Kickboxing World Championships in Belgrade, Serbia, in the 60 kg (132 pound) senior division. She said: \\"It is such a good feeling [being a champion].... it’s so special to become a symbol in the world as a Jew and as an Israeli. They didn’t expect me to win, coming from such a small country. Who would have expected it?\\" That year she was named Female Athlete of the Year by the Federation of Non-Olympic Competitive Sports in Israel (Ayelet). In 2016, at 20 years of age, she won the 17th International Federation of Muaythai Amateur (IFMA) World Championship for the first time, in the 60 kg division, in Jonkoping, Sweden.

It begins in the Galician port cities of Ferrol (118 km) or A Coruña (75 km) and runs south to Santiago de Compostela. Middle Ages The English Way was a path of convenience for medieval pilgrims to reach Santiago de Compostela. Pilgrims from Scandinavia or other areas of Northern Europe would travel by ship instead of by foot or horseback. At least one Icelandic pilgrim is known to have followed this path in 1154. During times of conflict between France and other countries, especially England, this alternative saw exceptional traffic. During the Hundred Years' War (1337–1453) between the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of France, the English Way became well-established as English pilgrims and traders would travel with permission of the English Crown to Galician ports and visit Santiago. Known pilgrim hospitals with significant English support were located in Sigüeiro, San Paio, Pontedeume, Betanzos, Bruma, Neda, Miño and Paderne. Modern Revival In the modern era the English Way has been revived as a much briefer alternative to the classic French Way. In order to receive the Compostela, the official certificate issued by the Cathedral of Santiago to confirm that a person has completed their pilgrimage, a minimum walk of 100 km is required. Only Ferrol is this distant on the English Way. There is a marker on the docks of Ferrol across from the Tourist Information building which announces this fact. Modern public albergues are located in Neda, Pontedeume, Miño, Betanzos, Presedo and Bruma. However, as of December 2016, the Cathedral of Santiago has agreed to grant the Compostela to those starting in A Coruña subject to certain conditions: they are required to complete a 25 km certified pilgrimage in their country of origin. In 2018, 14,150 pilgrims (4.32% of the total number of pilgrims arriving to the Pilgrims' Reception Office of the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela) walked the English Way.

In 1943 the Klubi 7 variant had to be replaced due to a lack of raw materials with a new version called Klubi 77, which then became the all- time most popular Klubi variant. Klubi cigarettes were produced until the mid 1990s, when new anti-tobacco regulations of the European Union came as a major obstacle. No agreement had been reached about the necessary production technology of low tar.

Opened in 1896 by the West Highland Railway, it was built on a single track section without a passing loop in between Garelochhead and Glen Douglas and closed by the British Railways Board in 1964.Butt (1995) page 247  History  System map of the West Highland Railway The station was officially opened at 12 noon on Tuesday 20 October 1896, designed by the architect James Miller, and it was of a different design to the other stations on the West Highland Railway that had opened the line to passengers on 7 August 1894; later operated by the North British Railway, until in 1923 it became part of the London and North Eastern Railway. In 1948 the line became part of the Scottish Region of British Railways following nationalisation and remains open as a route to Fort William, Mallaig and Oban. The trustees of the Luss Estates (Colquhoun) had been promised a station and the North British Railway finally conceded. The 'chalet-like' and non-standard appearance as well as the later opening date are explained by the reluctance of the company to invest in a station in this remote spot. Built to serve the Whistlefield hamlet, Portincaple with its fishing fleet and the surrounding area, the first station master was George Gall who was in post until his retirement in 1929 after which date both Shandon and Whistlefield came under the control of Garelochhead until closure and demolition in 1964. At one time it was in regular use for Sunday church services. In 1906, when King Edward VII came by train to the area before continuing to Fort William and he was welcomed at Whistlefield by the stationmaster George Gall, with flags and other decorations adorning the whole station. Whistlefield and near by Shandon were the locations of a German PoW camps and prisoners were regularly taken by train from the Faslane Platform and Whistlefield to work on the Loch Sloy hydroelectric scheme, disembarking at Inveruglas or possibly Glen Falloch Halt. The station and inn were frequented by the many drovers using the drove roads that once ran through this area to Portincaple and other destinations. The original 1896 service, affectionately known as the Wee Arrochar, was a Craigendoran (Upper) to Arrochar and Tarbet via Whistlefield and the other local stations and halts that was continued by British Rail until June 1964, when it fell victim to the Beeching Axe.\\"The 'Wee Arrochar'\\"Helensburgh Heritage Trust website; Retrieved 27 December 2017 Infrastructure The West Highland Line near the Whistlefield Station site. The single platformed station, without a passing loop, was located on a steep section of the line between the Garelochhead and Finnart Viaducts. A new platform was built in 1925. Steps ran up from the road to the station and remnants of these can still be seen. Railway cottages were built slightly to the north and these survive as private dwellings. The Whistlefield Store and tea room, later the 'Green Kettle Inn' was built close by to capture the trade created by the railway with steamer excursions on the loch, picnickers, etc. A house for the innkeeper was also constructed. A siding was is recorded as present in 1896 and a photograph of the 1920 or 1930s also shows a loading dock of some kind built from railway sleepers with a shed which may help explain the detailed instructions on the railway sign regarding shunting on the line with its significantly steep gradient. Boxes of fish from the Portincaple fishing fleet were loaded on to passenger trains. The station was host to a LNER camping coach from 1936 to 1939. When first opened no signalling was present and the point for the siding was worked under the control of a tablet. Bruce Henderson was the signalman at a later date, living in the railway cottage until moving to Garelochhead. A pair of semi-detached small railway cottages were also located at Glen Douglas, similar in appearance to the one at Whistlefield railway station. A water balance funicular railway had been proposed from Whistlefield down to Portincaple to carry passengers using a steamer service at a new pier.

The band was initially formed in 2012 as a quartet by Nate Hilts (vocals, guitar, mandolin), Scott Pringle (guitar, mandolin, vocals), Danny Kenyon (cello, vocals) and Colton Crawford (banjo). Crawford left the band in 2015 and was replaced by studio musician Eliza Mary Doyle for several years. Crawford re-joined the band starting with the Voices In Your Head tour in mid-2018. In August 2020 Kenyon left the band, following sexual abuse allegations. The band played live venues before releasing their debut five-song 2013 EP, The Ocean Went Mad and We Were to Blame. Their 2014 album Good Company was released by German label Devil Duck Records, and led to significant overseas touring for the next two years. Good Company's single \\"In Hell, I'll Be in Good Company\\", produced by Orion Paradis at SoulSound studio, was created along with a video on YouTube, and is credited as contributing to the breakthrough release for the band. To date, The Dead South have released one EP - The Ocean Went Mad and We Were to Blame (2013), and three studio albums: Good Company (2014), Illusion and Doubt (2016), and Sugar & Joy (2019).  History  Nate Hilts and Danny Kenyon came up with the idea for a \\"rockin' stompin' bluegrass band\\" in 2012 while playing together in a short- lived alternative grunge band. After the grunge band's demise, Colton Crawford and Scott Pringle joined what would become the Regina-based band The Dead South. Crawford learned banjo and Pringle learned how to play the mandolin to supplement his guitar. They ended up with their own version of the bluegrass genre. They strive for a satirical view of the genre while remaining true to it. The band toured extensively and repeatedly in Canada and Europe. Crawford left the band in 2015, and Eliza Mary Doyle, a noted solo and studio musician, was hired to fill the vacancy. After almost 2 years of absence from the band, Colton \\"Crawdaddy\\" Crawford returned to the lineup, replacing Doyle as banjoist. On tour, Danny Kenyon was occasionally replaced on cello by Erik Mehlsen, owing to Kenyon's career in engineering. In July 2020, allegations surfaced accusing Danny Kenyon of sexual misconduct. On August 19th 2020, Kenyon left the band.  The Ocean Went Mad and We Were to Blame (2013)  While the band played various venues, they would sell what would eventually become their self-released EP The Ocean Went Mad and We Were to Blame. In his review of the EP, Jamie Funk of Divide and Conquer Music was initially unsure if he could handle banjo picking in every song, but ended up enjoying it. The five songs offered in the EP reminded Funk of alternative bands attempting to play bluegrass music and succeeding beyond expectations. While most of the songs are classically \\"knee-slapping hoedown\\" bluegrass, other songs bear some similarities to alternative songs from the 90's.  Good Company (2014)  The Dead South's debut studio album Good Company was released in 2014 through the German record label Devil Duck Records, and led to extensive touring in Canada and Europe. The album contains a total of 14 tracks, including a rendition of Banjo Odyssey, which previously appeared on The Ocean Went Mad and We Were to Blame. In October 2016, a music video for \\"In Hell I'll Be In Good Company\\" was released onto YouTube, retroactively fueling interest in Good Company. Though the song and respective album were released in 2015, they appeared in the Top 50 on the Billboard music charts and on the Top 20 on US iTunes overall chart during December 2017.. It is The Dead South's most viewed video by a considerable margin, with over 200 million views. Rachel Freitas of MusicExistence notes that the album's second track, Achilles, \\"has the signature banjo sound that The Dead South are known for, but the instrumentation is a bit lighter. What one will find quickly while listening to the LP is that The Dead South are master storytellers that really know how to bring a song to life\\".  Illusion and Doubt (2016)  Illusion and Doubt was the band's second album, and was noted for its eccentric lyricism, and unusual musical influences, including its usage of a cello. Particular attention was brought to the African-American origins of its sound, with Mark Johnson of Americana UK summarising the album by saying \\"Bluegrass? How about blackgrass?\\" Amanda Hathers, of CanadianBeats, opines that, while the album provides \\"the traditional folk/country experience, chock full of banjo plucking, twang and impressive harmonies, the band's ability to make the music entertaining and engaging is impressive. Boots, the album's first track, begins soft and quiet before picking up speed before its end. Miss Mary in particular, serves as an atypical and surprising example of folk music as interpreted by The Dead South and Hard Day showcases Hilts' grit and power as vocalist.\\" By March 2019, Good Company and Illusion and Doubt had sold 90,000 physical copies, and The Dead South's songs had a total of 55 million streams on Spotify.  Sugar & Joy (2019)  Sugar & Joy is The Dead South's most recent album to date, which expanded upon the imagery and unconventional composition in Illusion and Doubt. The album was very well received critically, reaching #1 on the American bluegrass charts. Peter Churchill of Americana UK gave the album a 9/10, writing \\"There is a feeling, when first listening to the album, of anticipation, of wondering in what direction these bunch of outrageously talented musicians might head with the next track. The only consistent here is the quality and the sheer infectiousness of the music.\\" Chris Conaton of PopMatters gave it an 8/10, praising the diversity of the themes and the manner in which it incorporated different styles of music: \\"Sugar and Joy shows there's a lot of life in the corner of roots music where playing loud and fast while also leaving room for slower, more nuanced songs is considered a great combination. It's nice to hear an album that embraces the core tenets of 21st-century Americana (or Canadiana, in the Dead South's case) while still doing their own thing. Sugar and Joy is one of the most entertaining albums I've heard in 2019.\\"  Musical style and influence  The band refers to themselves as \\"Mumford and Sons' Evil Twins\\", a nod to their dark and often violent interpretation of the \\"aesthetic of old western pioneers\\". Freitas of MusicExistence notes the \\"evil twin\\" comparison, but considers that, with Good Company, the band stands on its own merit in the folk world. Hilts and Kenyon had been listening to bluegrass bands Trampled by Turtles and Old Crow Medicine Show before forming their own band. They agreed that they wanted to perform their own version of traditional folk and bluegrass. AllMusic reviewer Timothy Monger considers that tradition to be \\"a gritty punk ethos with traditional bluegrass and old-time string band music\\" In their review of Good Company, Sputnik Music notes that the band includes songs about the usual: lovin', cheatin', killin' and drinkin'.\\" Sputnik Music also points out that the band's clothing style of ordinary white shirts, black trousers, black suspenders and the occasional flat-brimmed hat is often mimicked by their fans. RJ Frometa, of Vents Magazine, notes the odd clothing style – referred to by the band itself as \\"their distinctive hillbilly cum pioneer look\\" – as well, considering them \\"fun, modern-day hillbillies who marry an incredible stage presence with their distinct country twang that includes banjos, mandolins, a cello, guitars, whistles, finger snapping and occasionally some head banging.\\" Frometa opines that The Dead South strive to create a sarcastic sound all their own. Sarah Murphy of Exclaim.ca says that the band's injection of folk and bluegrass sounds with a \\"punk rock ethos (not to mention a banjo player who's a self-proclaimed metalhead), the band bring a fresh perspective to classic genres.\\" MusicCrowns.org reviewer James Cooke suggests that the band's \\"gritty vocals, aggressive guitar strumming, mandolin chops, banjo licks and a steady kick drum to fuse it all together,\\" to deliver a unique sound that doesn't exactly fit the traditional definition of bluegrass. Cooke notes that The Dead South's release of \\"In Hell I'll Be In Good Company\\" is labelled as bluegrass, but has caused fans to question whether the label is appropriate or not. He argues that since bluegrass has been influenced by Irish, Scottish, and African American music, the definition of bluegrass as a genre has become blurred.

On the obverse is a woman's head, probably representing the goddess Diana, while the reverse depicts a she-goat with a bow and a quiver of arrows.Eckhel, vol. v, p. 275. The gens Plancia was a minor plebeian family of equestrian rank at ancient Rome. Few members of this gens are mentioned in the time of the Republic, but a family of the Plancii rose to prominence from the time of Vespasian, and held a number of important magistracies through the time of Hadrian. Other Plancii are known from inscriptions.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, pp. 381, 382 (\\"Gnaeus Plancius\\"). Origin The nomen Plancius is derived from the common Latin surname Plancus, originally referring to a person with flat feet. The Plancii must therefore have been Latins. Chase classifies them among those families that either originated at Rome, or cannot be shown to have originated anywhere else. However, the Plancii known to Cicero hailed from Atina, a town in southern Latium that had been taken during the Samnite Wars.Chase, pp. 109, 110, 129–132. Members * Gnaeus Plancius, an eques who served under Publius Licinius Crassus, consul in 97 BC. Plancius became a publican, and was influential in his field, pressing for a law reducing the amount that the publicani had to pay for the taxes in Asia. He was an early supporter of Caesar, who reduced the fee in 59 BC, to the great annoyance of the aristocracy. * Gnaeus Plancius Cn. f., quaestor in Macedonia in 58 BC, and tribune of the plebs in 56. Elected aedile in 54, he was accused of sodalitium, a form of electoral bribery, but was successfully defended by Cicero. He supported Pompeius during the Civil War, and afterward lived in exile at Corcyra.Cicero, Pro Plancio, Epistulae ad Quintum Fratrem, ii. 1. § 3, Epistulae ad Atticum, iii. 1. § 4, 14, 22, Epistulae ad Familiares, iv. 14, 15, vi. 20, xiv. 1, xvi. 9.Broughton, vol.

As of 2017, chef Brad Steelman had been there for 17 years. The restaurant has been reviewed twice by the New York Times and received two stars both times. Hurricane Sandy River Cafe on Water Street The restaurant is located on an underwater pier in the East River and was damaged by flooding during Hurricane Sandy. The damage included corroded wire, lost food and wine, and the destruction of antiques and a piano. Walls also needed replacement after the storm due to mold. The restaurant was closed for over a year while being repaired, despite hopes that it would open either on the anniversary of the storm or around Thanksgiving in 2013. Criticism In 2012, the restaurant was accused of discriminating against Jewish patrons. Workers alleged that reservationists were instructed to alert the maitre d’ if Hasidic clients requested a seat at the restaurant's main bar using the phrase \\"Is there space for two at the water bar?\\". An employee denied these claims. However, the New York Post sent a Hasidic couple and two reporters to the restaurant to see if the minimum would be enforced for both pairs. The Hasidic couple was charged a minimum, while the reporters were not.

It is situated above the eponymous village of Falkenstein on the Donnersberg, the highest point in the Palatinate region, which rises within the German state of Rhineland- Palatinate.  History  For the political history see County of Falkenstein Falkenstein is first recorded in 1135 as the castle of the lords of Falkenstein, a branch of the lords of Bolanden. It is mentioned again in 1233 in the possession of Philip I, the Lord of Falkenstein, the Imperial Chamberlain (Reichskämmerer) and burgvogt at Trifels Castle, where the Imperial Regalia were guarded. After the death of the imperial chamberlain of Münzenberg Philip I took over the office. In 1255 he inherited the Landvogtei in the Wetterau. Lich was later the centre of the territory of Philip I of Falkenstein. In the mid-14th century the Falkensteins built New Falkenstein in the Taunus region of Germany. Around 1500 Uhland I acquired the castle rights and expanded the castle further. His descendants purchased Schloss Bertholdstein near the town of Fehring in the Styria in Austria and subsequently settled there. In 1647 Falkenstein was besieged by French troops, stormed and slighted. In 1736, Falkenstein Castle and the County of Falkenstein went to the imperial House of Habsburg. In 1794, it was destroyed once more by the French during the Coalition Wars, since when it has remained a ruin, albeit partially restored after 1979.  Description  Partly preserved are the bergfried, remains of the outer walls of the great hall (Ritterhaus), the shield wall, the enceinte and the cistern.

During this period, even weeks before activities begin, hundreds of families settle in tents and vehicles in the hills. History According to tradition, due to the distance between Coquimbo and Santiago, news of the establishment of the First Government Junta on 18 September 1810 arrived two days later. For this reason, 20 September is currently a holiday in the Coquimbo Region and the official closing date of La Pampilla. All these celebrations began to take place annually on 29 July 1823. There are records that indicate that, at the end of the 19th century, horse races were held in this place on 19 and 20 September. According to photographic archives, attendance during the Fiestas Patrias grew in the first decades of the 20th century. When was created in 1864, La Pampilla – then known as La Serranía – was owned by . Upon his death, the land was auctioned and acquired in 1870 by José del Carmen Vicuña Lavigne, who used the property for public entertainment.

The mayor at the time, , signed this before the notary Alejandro Roncangliolo. The festival at La Pampilla corresponds to the most multitudinous celebration of the Fiestas Patrias. From the beginning of the celebrations until 20 September, more than 100,000 people are present, some in tents, to enjoy the fondas and shows that take place there. Its popularity is such that it recently has begun to be celebrated in other locations in northern Chile. Outside of September, the site is used as a venue for amateur football and motorsport, the latter due to the road course built in 2006, which has hosted regional speed competitions. Internal distribution During September's celebration, fondas and ramadas are set up - places where traditional Chilean food and drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) are sold. Several traditional games are held near the sector of the ramadas. The sector designated for the sale of national and international products of all types - clothes, electrical appliances, candies, trinkets, and different articles for the home - occupies a great part of La Pampilla. In this sector, people who want to set up a stall must pay the Municipality for a permit.

The company was founded by R. Donahue Peebles in 1983 specializing in residential, hospitality, retail, and mixed-use commercial properties. Developments Select developments include 2100 Martin Luther King, Jr. in Washington, D.C.; the Courtyard by Marriott Hotel and Convention Center in D.C., The Residences at The Bath Club. Peebles engaged in extensive litigation with the City of Miami Beach throughout the construction of these projects relating to the City's representations and the soil quality on the beach. In 2013, Peebles and ElAd Group acquired 346 Broadway (also known as 108 Leonard and the Former New York Life Insurance Company Building) for $160 million, the largest disposition ever undertaken by the New York City Economic Development Corporation. Development plans for the Renaissance Revival landmark and former New York Life Insurance Building include luxury condominiums. In 2014, Peebles was selected to redevelop Fifth and Eye, a parcel in Washington, D.C.'s burgeoning Mount Vernon Triangle neighborhood, into a nearly 250,000-square- foot project to include a boutique hotel and branded residences. In 2015, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority and Massachusetts Department of Transportation chose Peebles for the development of an intersection in Boston's historic Back Bay neighborhood. Plans for the proposed $330 million, 390,000-square-foot project include a hotel, condominiums, rental apartments, retail, and a Hynes MBTA station. Peebles is currently anticipating developing Family Court Building, the historic neo-classical former courthouse on 1801 Vine Street in Philadelphia's Logan Circle, into a boutique hotel. The company’s Miami and Miami Beach projects include a 900,000-square-foot mixed- use project in Downtown Miami and The Bath Club Estates. In 2016, Charlotte's Mecklenburg County selected Peebles and Conformity Corporation for the development of Brooklyn Village, a development site consisting of 16 acres located in the neighborhood within Uptown Charlotte, NC. The proposed project is planned to be a 2.3 million square foot \\"urban village\\", and will be constructed over multiple phases. In December 2017, Peebles, as part of the three-team development partnership Angels Landing Partners, was unanimously approved to redevelop the Bunker Hill site in Downtown Los Angeles, dubbed Angels Landing. The estimated $1.2 billion development will include residential, hotel, retail, and communal spaces distributed over two towers. The main tower, when constructed, would reach at least 80 stories and would be divided into three parts: hotel, apartments, and condominiums. A 192-room SLS hotel with its own swimming pool would be below 425 apartments (including some subsidized affordable units), on top of which would be 250 condominiums and another swimming pool. The second tower would reach 27 stories and would contain a charter elementary school and a 289-room Mondrian hotel that offers a rooftop pool and bar.

The not-for-profit was created in 2014, after a 2011 law by the British Columbia Ministry of Environment, transferring the cost of recycling from residents to producers. Producers who sell products in British Columbia pay fees to Recycle BC for the packaging and paper supplied on a quarterly basis determined by how many kilograms of each material they sold in the province. Items collected are sorted and sold to end-markets for processing into new products.  Curbside recycling  Recycle BC manages recycling collected from 156 communities which include 1.8 million households (98% of British Columbia's population). In 13 of these communities, Recycle BC also manages the collection of materials directly from households. The remaining communities receive curbside and multi-family recycling collection paid for by Recycle BC. Items accepted by the program can differ depending on the community, but typically include paper, cardboard, plastic containers, metal containers, cartons, paper cups. Some areas also have separate bins for the collection of glass bottles and jars; however, they are only accepted at depots in most areas. Collected plastics are processed within the province through a contract with Green by Nature. The three major newspaper companies in British Columbia (Postmedia Network, Black Press and Glacier Media) have refused to pay their fees, resulting in the provincial government sending the publishers warning notices in 2016. In 2017, News Media Canada created their own stewardship plan, which uses operational elements of the Recycle BC system to recycle newsprint. A pilot project was conducted in Coquitlam from May – August 2018 to recycle squeeze tubes, making it the first city in North America to accept the item through curbside recycling.  Collection done by Recycle BC  * Anmore * Coquitlam * Langley (city) * Prince George * Quesnel * Regional District of North Okanagan * Regional District of Kootenay Boundary (Kootenay Region) * Revelstoke * University Endowment Lands * Pitt Meadows * Regional District of Central Kootenay (areas H, I, J) * Vancouver * Regional District of Kootenay Boundary (Boundary Region)  Recycling depots  Recycle BC has contracts with private companies which operate recycling depots and are paid by the kilogram per material type. Most of these recycling depots also act as Return-It depots to collect bottles and cans with deposits. Most depots accept curbside recycling items; however, some only collect polystyrene foam, plastic bags and glass (in some communities). In June 2018, a pilot program began at 116 depots in the province to collect flexible plastics. Items accepted in this new program include cellophane, zipper storage bags, bubble wrap, chip bags. granola bar wrappers, net bags for produce, plastic shipping envelopes and woven rice bags. London Drugs stores in the province also act as Reycle BC depots.  Streetside recycling  In August 2016, Recycle BC began a pilot program with the City of Vancouver consisting of 31 sets of bins, including for paper and mixed containers. They are located in the West End and the pilot program ran until the end of 2017. As of July 2018, the bins were still in place. Multiple cities have criticized Recycle BC for still not fulfilling its obligation to operate streetside recycling programs, as of October 2018, even though they have been obliged to do so since 2014. The organization claims that the streetside bins are too contaminated for the material to be recycled.  Criticism  Recycle BC grossly exaggerates the efficacy of its plastics recycling program. The annual report for 2019 claims: • More than 98% of plastics collected in BC are sold to end markets in BC with a local end market in Metro Vancouver where it is processed into pellets to be recycled into new packaging and products; (https://recyclebc.ca/wp- content/uploads/2020/06/RecycleBC2019-Final.pdf). Whereas the general number for plastics recycling in Canada is estimated by multiple sources to be closer to 10%. https://www.cbc.ca/documentaries/the-passionate-eye/recycling-was-a- lie-a-big-lie-to-sell-more-plastic-industry-experts-say-1.5735618 https://nationalpost.com/opinion/raymond-j-de-souza-we-can-finally-admit-that- plastic-recycling-has-been-a-sham-all-along Some residents in small BC communities have criticized Recycle BC for not collecting materials there, as it costs more than in larger centres. Some communities have also seen items which were previously taken in curbside bins (e.g. plastic bags) now having to be brought to a recycling depot. Books are also excluded from recycling in British Columbia, as the province decided not to make publishers pay for their recycling. The town of Osoyoos has also complained to Recycle BC regarding their plan to eliminate blue plastic bags as a method for curbside collection. During a comment period in October 2018, Recycle BC proposed expanding their program to include packaging-like products, which was supported by local governments and depots. However, they caved to the pressure by product manufactures and backed down from the proposal.

Its design, that of the adjacent Parkway Central Library, and their placement on Logan Circle closely follow that of the Hôtel de Crillon and the Hôtel de la Marine on Paris's Place de la Concorde. The building was designed by John T. Windrim and constructed by his chief designer W. R. Morton Keast (William Richard Morton Keast). Construction began on September 17, 1938 and the cornerstone was laid on June 20, 1939. The building opened on 1801 Vine Street. According to National Park Service, the building was completed in 1941, however, William Richard Morton Keast states the building was completed and occupied by November 25, 1940. In 1971, Family Court Building was accepted into the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places. On March 31, 2014, the Family Court Building was accepted into the National Register of Historic Places. Description The building housed the Philadelphia Family Court from 1941 to 2014. Three stories and the ground level were opened to the public. The building was used as a juvenile court as well as a court for domestic issues. The building is known for its murals and has been described by Ben Leech, director of advocacy at the Preservation Alliance for Greater Philadelphia, as \\"a virtual museum of New Deal art\\". Plans had been made by the city to move the Philadelphia Family Court closer to Market Street. In 2014, the Peebles Corporation made a bid to turn the courthouse into a museum and boutique hotel. The Philadelphia Family Court moved to a new location at 1501 Arch Street,https://www.courts.phila.gov/common-pleas/family/ leaving the Family Court Building unoccupied.

Schaak is an American chemist and currently a DuPont Professor of Materials and Chemistry at Penn State University. He assumed his position at Penn State in 2007. Prior to this, he was an assistant professor of chemistry at Texas A&M; University since 2003. In 2017 he was named a fellow for the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Background Schaak’s research interests primarily lie in the area of synthetic inorganic nanochemistry. His group has made important contributions to the development of a retrosynthetic design of solids and the synthesis of nanoparticles. His interests also include the understanding of chemical reactions that occur with nanoparticles and their formation pathways. Raymond Schaak is also passionate about finding ways to convert catalytic materials that are largely available on earth for energy applications. Education Schaak decided to study chemistry in college because in high school he enjoyed applying math to solve everyday life issues and performing experiments. He began his chemistry research career when he earned his undergraduate degree in Chemistry from Lebanon Valley College, then received his Ph. D. from Pennsylvania State University in 2001. Career Raymond Schaak worked on as a postdoctoral researcher with Robert Cava at the department of chemistry at Princeton University from 2001-2003. He then began his independent career at Texas A&M; as an assistant professor. If he had not become a chemist, he would have become an architect, graphic designer, or photographer. Publications Research on Nanostructured Nickel Phosphide 150px 250px The publication, “Nanostructured Nickel Phosphide as an Electrocatalyst for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction”, explained electrocatalytic activity and stability of nanostructured nickel phosphide (Ni2P) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic solutions. Schaak and co-workers also proposed that other known hydrodesulfurization (HDS) catalysts could be candidates of HER electrocatalyst since Ni2P is originally only known as an HDS catalyst. Other Discoveries Schaak’s other achievements include research on cobalt phosphide (CoP) nanoparticles, study about a general strategy for synthesizing transition metal phosphides and study on a one-pot synthetic strategy for accessing hollow CoPt nanospheres with a Co−Pt alloy structure. Awards and Honors Schaak has received numerous awards and honors for his work and contributions to the chemistry field. In 2006, he has received two awards the National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER Award and Beckman Young Investigator Award, along with the DuPont Young Professor Grant.

Rowing career Zumkeller is a member of RV Neptun Konstanz, a rowing club based at Lake Constance near the border with Switzerland. For the 1961 rowing season, he teamed up with Dieter Bender in the coxless pair cause a sensation at their first regatta in Mannheim when they came second, by just 0.1 seconds, to the 1960 Olympic gold medallists in the coxed pair, Bernhard Knubel and Heinz Renneberg. Later that year, Zumkeller and Bender won the national championships in West Germany. This qualified them for the 1961 European Rowing Championships, where they won a gold medal in this boat class. In 1962, the again won at the national championships. This qualified the pair for the 1962 World Rowing Championships in Lucerne where they won a gold medal in the same boat class. In 1963, Zumkeller and Bender won the national championships for a third time in succession. As the International Rowing Federation (FISA) did not recognise East Germany as a country and insisted on one German team per boat class at international regattas, selection trials had to be held for the 1963 European Rowing Championships. Zumkeller and Bender won their selection trial against Jörg Lucke and Heinz-Jürgen Bothe by just 0.05 seconds. At the 1963 European Championships, Zumkeller and Bender won silver, beaten by the team from Italy. At the 1964 national championships, Zumkeller and Bender came third. The winners of the national championships, Michael Schwan and Wolfgang Hottenrott, went on to become the German representatives in the coxless pair at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Zumkeller and Bender separated after the 1964 nationals, and Zumkeller joined Klaus-Günter Jordan to form a coxed pair. Jordan had previously been national champion in this boat class (1961 to 1963). They concentrated on getting the Olympic nomination for the United Team of Germany and did thus not go to the 1964 European Rowing Championships in Amsterdam. The European champions from Amsterdam were the East Germans Peter Gorny and Günter Bergau, with Karl-Heinz Danielowski as their cox. In the qualification race, the East Germans were in the lead and the West German team was catching up, but with 200 m to go, Jordan caught a crab. East German media claimed that even without this mishap, the East German team would still have won. In 1966, Zumkeller continued to row with Klaus- Günter Jordan in the coxed pair (the cox that year was Burkhard Zwosta), and they took out the title that year. This qualified them for the 1966 World Rowing Championships in Bled where they came in sixth place in the final. Awards For their 1961 European Championship title, Zumkeller and Bender received the Silbernes Lorbeerblatt (Silver Laurel Leaf), the highest sports award in Germany. For its centenary in 1985, RV Neptun Konstanz established an honorary membership for those who have made significant contributions to the rowing club. Zumkeller was one of nine members elevated to this status.
