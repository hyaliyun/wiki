Bundo was initially adopted for a film project by Pence's daughter Charlotte Pence during her freshman year. His name is a pun on actor Marlon Brando, chosen after Bundo's previous owner said \\"Make me an offer\\" when Pence asked about his price. He is the first rabbit to travel on Air Force Two, has a popular Instagram account, and is the subject of two children's books. ==Biography== The rabbit Marlon Bundo was named after actor Marlon Brando and has been with the Pence family at the United States Naval Observatory since 2017. Other pets owned by the second couple include an Australian Shepherd named Harley, and two cats named Hazel and Pickle. Marlon Bundo was acquired via Craigslist by Pence's daughter Charlotte Pence in 2013 when she was a freshman at DePaul University. At the time she needed a rabbit for a short film student project. In the film, Bundo portrayed a \\"symbol of rebellion in a world of conformity\\" as a rabbit who repeatedly escapes from his cage. Before this, Bundo was \\"just another scrappy Chicago bunny\\". Pence texted Bundo's owner to ask how much the rabbit cost, and the owner replied, \\"Make me an offer.\\" In Mario Puzo's novel The Godfather and the 1972 film of the same name, Marlon Brando's Don Vito Corleone says, \\"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.\\" Pence's friend, a Brando fan, noticed the similarity between the seller and Corleone, and suggested naming the rabbit Marlon Brando. Pence finally decided to name him Marlon Bundo. Speaking to The Chicago Tribune Charlotte recalled: > We drove out to the suburbs, my friends and I, and we picked him up. I think > he was like $20. He was in the short film, and I just kept him after that. Bundo lived with Charlotte throughout college in Chicago, for four years, and was part of a student friends group.:2:19 Bundo traveled to Washington, D.C. from his home in Indianapolis, Indiana aboard Air Force Two in January 2017, making him the first rabbit to ever travel on the plane. He made his official debut in May 2017, appearing at an event honoring Military Appreciation Month at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where he was \\"admired\\", according to the official transcript of the event. Bundo was featured on the White House's Flickr landing page on May 11, 2017, detailing his first trip to the White House. Bundo has not been in the Oval Office, .:7 President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump met Bundo at a dinner at the Naval Observatory. Melania Trump invited Karen and Charlotte Pence to read their book at the 2018 White House Easter Egg Roll, but the Pences did not accept because they – and Marlon Bundo – were taking a \\"mini-spring vacation\\". Karen Pence said, \\"You have to have the bunny on Easter.\\" The Pence family originally drew criticism online and questions regarding their care for Bundo, based on the observation that his nails were \\"far too long\\". As Callie Beusman, a senior editor with Vice Media commented: > The Pence family cannot claim ignorance on these issues because insane > rabbit people (including myself) frequently comment on Marlon Bundo's > Instagrams with alarm and concern. The piece went on to observe that \\"BOTUS otherwise seems well-loved\\". The White House press office did not respond to a related request for comment on the matter. The Washington Post later observed that Bundo \\"promptly got a pedicure\\". ===Social media=== Bundo has his own Instagram account, which has over 33,000 followers . Charlotte created his Instagram account after her father's inauguration, \\"not knowing if anybody would follow it\\". Four former U.S. presidents have had rabbits; Bundo is the first in such circles with a social media account. According to The Fresno Bee, Bundo generally avoids partisan politics online, preferring instead to stick to \\"posting pictures of his bunny life, including being hugged by his mom, Charlotte Pence, the vice president's ... daughter, hopping around the house, and playing hide and seek with Pickle, the family cat\\". Photographs on Bundo's Instagram account show him \\"reading the Constitution, taking phone calls, signing documents, and working out on the treadmill\\". Because of Bundo's popularity on Instagram, Charlotte and Karen decided to create a children's book about him. ==Children's books== Bundo is the main character in two children's books. Marlon Bundo's A Day in the Life of the Vice President features Bundo accompanying Vice President Pence through his daily activities as seen from Bundo's perspective. It is written by Charlotte Pence and illustrated by Karen Pence. Bundo posed for all illustrations in the book.:28 As of March 2018, Bundo was scheduled to accompany Charlotte and Karen on the press tour for the book. Proceeds from the book benefit Tracy's Kids, an art therapy program, and The A21 Campaign, which works to combat human trafficking. As of late March 2018, the book had sold approximately 100,000 copies, entered the top-ten books on Amazon, and was the No. 7 Children's Picture Book on The New York Times Best Seller list. A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo is a book published by the television show Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. It was written as a parody of Marlon Bundo's A Day in the Life of the Vice President. It details a gay romance between Marlon Bundo and a rabbit named Wesley. Authorship is attributed to Bundo as well as Jill Twiss. In response to the release of the parody, Marlon Bundo's Instagram account made a post featuring a photo of him wearing a bow tie nearly identical to the one worn by the bunny in the book. The photograph was accompanied by comment from the account reading: \\"Not gonna lie, I do look pretty fly in a bow tie. The only thing better than one bunny book for charity is...TWO bunny books for charity. #BOTUS - Marlon\\" Proceeds from the book benefit The Trevor Project, which operates a crisis hotline for members of the LGBTQ community, and AIDS United. As of late March 2018 the book had sold approximately 400,000 copies, spent several days as the top- selling book on Amazon, and was the No. 1 Children's Picture Book on The New York Times Best Seller list. ==Reception== In December 2017, President of the United States Donald Trump reportedly described the presence of Bundo and the other family pets in the Vice Presidential residence as \\"low class\\". Writing for Jezebel, Ellie Shechet acknowledged Bundo's cuteness, but continued that it is \\"an indisputable fact that underneath his huge blinky eyes and nice fat tummy lies the twisted heart of a dirty trickster\\", and further accused him of using his \\"good looks and pleasant demeanor as a fluffy tool of mass obfuscation\\". The Washington Post praised Bundo as \\"ridiculously cute\\" and \\"a natural actor\\". Others have called him the \\"only positive thing in Washington, D.C.\\" Writing in Vogue, Bridget Read summarized Bundo as \\"clearly a lover, not a fighter, based on how much he loves snuggling\\", but also that he is \\"clearly not new to navigating his own PR, and has demonstrated some media training\\". Read concluded by saying that Bundo's \\"social media rollout\\" may be an indication that he is planning to run for public office. Speaking to Ellen DeGeneres, comedian John Oliver described Bundo as a \\"fantastic rabbit\\", adding, \\"if you have a problem with that bunny you're dead inside\\". ==See also== * Rabbits and hares in art * United States presidential pets * Dear Socks, Dear Buddy – 1998 children's book written by then-First Lady Hillary Clinton about the two pets that lived in the White House during the Clinton administration, Socks the cat and Buddy the dog. ==NotesReferencesHouse rabbit Marlon Bundo makes his debut, video from The Washington Post Category:Individual rabbits Category:Mike Pence Category:Pence family Category:Animals in politics Category:Pets in the United States ","title":"Marlon Bundo"},{"id":"56911199","text":"This article lists the fixtures of the knockout stage for the 2018 Uber Cup in Bangkok, Thailand.

In 1933 she won two of her five races including the Windsor Castle Stakes and the Moulton Stakes and was rated the best juvenile filly in England. In the following spring she won the Column Produce Stakes and then recorded her biggest win in the 1000 Guineas. In her two subsequent races she finished fourth in the Epsom Oaks and second in the Champion Stakes. As a broodmare she exerted an enduring influence as a broodmare through her daughter Calluna. ==Background== Campanula was a bay mare with a white star bred and owned by George Bullough. She was trained throughout her racing career by Jack Jarvis at the Park Lodge stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. Physically she was described as a \\"beautiful\\" and \\"very charming\\" filly, but somewhat lacking in size and range. She was sired by Blandford an Irish-bred stallion who won three of his four races including the Princess of Wales's Stakes. He went to become an outstanding breeding stallion who was a three-time Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland and whose other offspring included Bahram, Blenheim, Brantôme, Udaipur and Windsor Lad. Campanula's dam Vesper Bell was descended from the influential British broodmare Perseverance (foaled 1865) by Voltigeur. ==Racing career1933: two-year-old season=== After finishing fifth on her racecourse debut, Campanula ran second by a neck to the colt Colombo in the First Spring Stakes at Newmarket in late April. At Royal Ascot in June 1933 Campanula defeated male opposition to take the Windsor Castle Stakes and was described as one of the best juveniles seen at the meeting. She sustained a minor injury in September and missed an intended run in the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster, but returned to the track to win the Moulton Stakes at Newmarket, carrying top weight of 131 pounds. In the Free Handicap, a ranking of the season's best two-year-olds, Campanula was rated the best filly, seven pounds behind Colombo who was the top colt. ===1934: three-year- old season=== Campanula began her second season in the Column Poduce Stakes at Newmarket in April and won by a short head from the colt Bright Bird, to whom she was conceding twelve pounds. On 4 May, ridden by Harry Wragg, she started 2/5 favourite for the 121st running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile. The best of her nine rivals appeared to be Light Brocade who was owned by George Bullough's son-in-law John Lambton, 5th Earl of Durham. Campanula prevailed by a length from Light Brocade, with six lengths back to Spend A Penny in third. A month later, Campanula, with Wragg again in the saddle, was strongly fancied to win the Oaks Stakes over one and one-half miles at Epsom Racecourse.

Members of this gens are not mentioned in history until imperial times, and they achieved little prominence until the late third century, from which time the family rose in importance, gaining the consulship on a number of occasions from the time of Constantine the Great to that of Justinian, and frequently holding the post of praefectus urbi.PIR, vol. III, p. 141. ==Origin== The nomen Rufius is derived from the common Latin surname Rufus, red, originally given to someone with red hair. It is frequently confounded with Rufrius, presumably from the related ruber, reddish or ruddy. Chase classifies Rufius among those gentilicia that either originated at Rome, or cannot be shown to have come from anywhere else.Chase, pp. 110, 131. ==Branches and cognomina== The Rufii used a variety of personal cognomina, which was typical of Roman nomenclature in imperial times. The only distinct family name seems to have been Festus, joyous or festive, which appears among the Rufii for several centuries.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. festus. The nomen Caeionius, apparently a variation of Ceionius, suggests that some of the Rufii were probably descended from the Ceionii, and acquired the nomen Rufius through a female line, although this is uncertain given the variability of Roman nomenclature under the Empire, in which nomina could be rearranged for political reasons, to emphasize family connections. Avienus, which appears multiple times among the Rufii from the fourth to the sixth century, was probably acquired in this way; it was the nomen of an obscure plebeian family, while another of the family bore Postumius, the nomen of one of Rome's great patrician houses; it occurs twice more among the Rufii a century later, once in the derivative form Postumianus, although whether the latter were descended from the earlier Postumius is unknown. Volusianus, derived from the ancient gens Volusia, was also passed down for several generations.Salomies, Adoptive and Polyonymous Nomenclature in the Roman Empire. ==Members== * Rufius Crispinus, or Rufrius Crispinus, an eques who rose to the rank of praetorian prefect under Claudius, and was rewarded with the quaestorian insignia for apprehending Decimus Valerius Asiaticus in AD 47.

It stars Janne Puustinen and Boodi Kabbani. The film had its world premiere at the 2017 BFI London Film Festival as part of the Love strand. Unusually for a Finnish film, most of the dialog is in English as it is the only language shared by the two leading characters. == Plot == Leevi returns to Finland from his university studies in Paris to spend the summer helping his father Jouko renovate the family lakehouse for sale. Leevi is estranged from his conservative father, his only living relative, and hopes to avoid mandatory military service by obtaining French citizenship. Tareq, an architect by profession who has come to Finland from war-torn Syria seeking asylum, has been hired to help with the work. When Leevi's father returns to town on business, the two young men, speaking English, their only common language, establish a connection. They spend a few days discovering one another during an idyllic Finnish midsummer. == Cast == * Janne Puustinen as Leevi * Boodi Kabbani as Tareq * Mika Melender as Jouko * Virpi Rautsiala as Pirjo == Production == Mikko Mäkelä, a Finn from Lappeenranta, South Karelia, who has lived in the England for ten years wrote the screenplay and directed the film. He explained the absence of a feature- length Finnish film addressing gay relationships saying \\"Non-commercial documentaries are alive and well in Finland, but full-length fiction cinema is always made with the returns in mind. Production companies don't take risks in countries this small.\\" As a result, most of the film's budget came from private financing with a very small portion coming from crowd funding Indiegogo. Filming took place in August 2016. On his decision to choose gay actors for the lead roles, director Mäkelä wrote: \\"Casting gay actors for gay roles was the only option that made sense for me\\".\\" The film had its world premiere in the Love strand of the BFI London Film Festival on 6 October 2017. It has since gone on to screen at festivals around the world including Goteborg International Film Festival, Seattle International Film Festival and Frameline in San Francisco. == Reception == A reviewer in Film Inquiry called A Moment in the Reeds \\"the biggest surprise of the London Film Festival\\". He noted the plot's superficial resemblance to that of God’s Own Country, which was in production at the same time, but found the Finnish film \\"far more subtle\\" and, like its British counterpart, \\"one of the most moving gay romance stories of recent years\\". In Sweden's MovieZine, Alexander Dunerfors said the filmmakers turned their low budget to advantage by using just a few actors in an isolated setting and noted that \\"Most of the dialogue has been improvised by the actors themselves, giving a strong authentic touch–even in broken English.\\" A German reviewer called it \\"a film pearl that shines with truthfulness and authenticity\\". He described the principal characters' relationship to Finland, one alienated and the other finding refuge: \\"Homeland is a strange world for both of them.\\" Variety magazine's Dennis Harvey wrote favourably of the film. \\"There's an admirable quiet intensity to A Moment in the Reeds, a first feature by London-based Mikko Mäkelä set in his native Finland. Superficially similar to God's Own Country, this bittersweet tale of attraction between a prodigal son and a refugee worker is both a more straightforward romance for much of its runtime and a sadder one in the end.\\" == References  External links == * * List of festival screenings * Category:Finnish films Category:2017 films Category:LGBT-related romantic drama films Category:Finnish romantic drama films Category:Gay-related films Category:2017 LGBT-related films Category:Films about refugees Category:Refugees in Finland Category:Syrian refugees ","title":"A Moment in the Reeds"},{"id":"56911583","text":"Guangyun Temple (), also known as Xuetang Temple (), is a Buddhist temple located in the Cangyuan Va Autonomous County of Yunnan, China. ==History== Guangyun Temple was first built in 1828 by the Yunnan government, in the Daoguang period (1821-1850) in the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), it is influenced by the architectural style of Han Chinese buildings and at the same time preserves the basic form of the Theravada Buddhist temples.

On October 11, both armies met near Simbirsk. While inferior in numbers, government troops were superior in discipline, armament, and tactics, resulting from the military reforms of Tsar Alexis according to Western European standards. Disciplined units of Reiters and Dragoons attacked first, firing on rebels at point-blank range, then rapidly retreated, luring rebels into firing ranks of infantry and artillery. Razin himself was wounded twice and fled with some Don Cossacks, while most of the rebels scattered, and subsequently died on the run. == Aftermath == Defeat was decisive for rebellion of Stepan Razin: soon he was betrayed by Don Cossacks and executed on June 16, 1671 in Moscow. ==References== Category:Conflicts in 1670 ","title":"Battle of Simbirsk"},{"id":"56911709","text":"Noah Kahan (born January 1, 1997) is an American singer-songwriter of folk- infused pop who signed to Republic Records in 2017.

Juhász earned a degree of communications and PR at the Kodolányi János University of Applied Sciences (KJF) in 2000. He was involved in various telemarketing, trade and catering companies since 2001. His firm Juhász és Villányi Ltd. went bankrupt in 2003, as well as his other companies Peter, Peter & Partners Ltd. and Ó 17 Ltd. in 2006 and 2008, respectively. He was labelled that he owned various phantom companies to avoid the successful implementation of the tax regulations. Altogether, he owned 11 companies since 2001, six of them went bankrupt and were phantomized. ==Activism== Juhász founded the Hemp Seed Association (Kendermag Egyesület) in 2002, which advocated for the legalization of \\"soft drugs\\" and the decriminalization of all kinds of drugs. In this capacity, Juhász and other activists organized a so-called \\"Civil Obedience Movement\\" in March 2005, under which dozens of cannabis users reported themselves to the police, including Juhász. The Hungarian Civil Liberties Union (TASZ) provided legal assistance and representation for all activists involved in the movement. During the trial, Juhász declared that he grew and used cannabis solely to supply his own personal needs, and also presented a five-foot ripe cannabis plant before the court. In January 2006, he was sentenced to a fine of 70,000 HUF at first instance. The court of second instance confirmed the verdict against Juhász in December 2006; the court declared that Juhász \\"is extremely dangerous to the society, because he wanted to use criminal prosecution, the instrument of law and the court to proclaim the legalization of drug consumption\\". TASZ refused the argument and claimed \\"the courts are also places of freedom of expression\\". He acted as spokesperson of the Hemp Seed Association until 2009, following that he was elected its president, replacing László Felső. Juhász vocally supported the ban of the Magyar Gárda in December 2007. He was an organizer of the Tarka Magyar! protest against ethnic and racial exclusion in October 2008. He was an anchorman at the Tilos Rádió from 2008 to 2012, and was a curator of its foundation. Simultaneously, he was also involved in the Romani program of the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union between 2009 and 2012. ==Political career== Juhász organized a protest against Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's newly accepted Media Act on 20 December 2010. Thereafter he created a Facebook page named One Million for Press Freedom (Egymillióan a magyar sajtószabadságért), mostly known by its shorter name Milla. The movement participated in numerous protests in the following period and, by 2012, the Facebook page reached 100,000 likes. Juhász and some of his followers founded an association behind the Milla on 10 October 2012, and Juhász was elected its president. Former prime minister Gordon Bajnai announced his return to politics on 23 October 2012, during the anti-government demonstration of the Milla. Bajnai, Juhász and Péter Kónya (Hungarian Solidarity Movement) founded Together 2014 as a coalition of left-wing and liberal political movements and civil organizations to contrast the Orbán cabinet. According to plans, Together 2014 would have been an umbrella organization of centre-left parties, similar to the Olive Tree in Italy which established against Silvio Berlusconi's right-wing coalition in 1995. However Politics Can Be Different (LMP) had rejected the cooperation in November 2012Az LMP nemet mondott Bajnaiéknak – Index, 2012-11-18 and January 2013,Szétszakadt az LMP – Index, 2013-01-27 and the Hungarian Socialist Party led by Attila Mesterházy gradually took over the initiative. The Together movement transformed itself into party on 8 March 2013, as only parties could take part in the election according to the rules. Three co-presidents were elected: Viktor Szigetvári (Patriotism and Progress Association), Péter Kónya (Solidarity) and Péter Juhász (Milla).Párttá alakult az Együtt 2014 - közismert arcok a vezetőségben – Híradó.hu, 2013-03-08 The party was registered as \\"Together – Party for a New Era\\" because several other organizations overtaken the name \\"Together 2014\\" at the National Election Office. After Together entered into an electoral coalition with left-wing parties, including former PM Ferenc Gyurcsány's Democratic Coalition, Juhász offered his resignation and stepped down from his party's national list in the 2014 parliamentary election. Péter Juhász ran as candidate of the position of mayor of Belváros-Lipótváros (5th District of Budapest) during the 2014 local elections, but received 30.26 percent of the vote and was defeated by Péter Szentgyörgyvölgyi (Fidesz). Nevertheless, he became a member of the local representative body. During his activity, he made public several corruption suspicious real estate transactions from the tenure of the previous Fidesz mayor Antal Rogán. On 4 February 2017, Péter Juhász was elected as the party's new leader. He resigned as a member of the representative body in the 5th district in April. Since March, Juhász urged the election cooperation of those \\"democratic opposition parties\\", which refuse both the Orbán regime and the former governing left-wing parties, who represent the \\"world before 2010\\". Juhász called his concept as \\"New Pole\\" (Új Pólus), with the possible participation of the Politics Can Be Different (LMP), the Dialogue for Hungary (PM), the Hungarian Two-tailed Dog Party (MKKP) and the Momentum Movement, in addition to his party. With that statement, Juhász refused the cooperation with the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), the Democratic Coalition (DK) and the Hungarian Liberal Party (MLP) for 2018 parliamentary election. According to a Medián opinion poll published in July 2017, this hypothetical alliance would receive 16 percent of the vote in the next election. While the Together and the PM renewed their alliance in accordance with Juhász's \\"New Pole\\" concept on 4 October 2017, both LMP and Momentum Movement had rejected the election cooperation with other parties. On 23 June 2017, MP Zsuzsanna Szelényi announced that she resigned from her position in the party leadership and quit Together, after losing the election for the party leadership in February against Péter Juhász. She also disagreed with the new direction and method of politics, installed by Juhász and criticized the new president's guerrilla campaign methods and media PR campaigns and \\"ostentatious performances\\". She also said that she would retain her parliamentary mandate. In January 2018, leaders of the party announced that Together will participate in the 2018 national election separately. Former party president Viktor Szigetvári was nominated their candidate for the position of prime minister. Juhász intended to run as a candidate in the 5th district of Budapest, but, following a domestic violence scandal, when it was revealed that he assaulted his former life partner physically, withdrew his nomination in order to support a single opposition candidate against Fidesz politician István Hollik. The Together party failed to reach 5% electoral threshold, receiving 0.66 percent of the vote. According to the laws, Together had to repay the state aid of HUF 150 million to the state budget, as a result Juhász organized a fundraising campaign.Évtizedekig törlesztheti a párt adósságát az Együtt egyetlen képviselője - 24.hu, 2018-04-10 The Together ceased to exist on 2 June 2018. ==References== Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Politicians from Budapest Category:Together (Hungary) politicians Category:Hungarian cannabis activists ","title":"Péter Juhász (politician)"},{"id":"56911772","text":"Terminalia calamansanai,GRIN taxon: Terminalia calamansanai (Blanco) RolfeWikispecies: Terminalia calamansanai also spelled Terminalia calamansanay,Unresolved in The Plant List: Terminalia calamansanay Rolfe is a species of plant in the family Combretaceae. ==References== calamansanai Category:Flora of Indo-China Category:Taxa named by Francisco Manuel Blanco Category:Taxa named by Robert Allen Rolfe ","title":"Terminalia calamansanai"},{"id":"56911785","text":"Irfan Jaya (born 1 May 1996) is an Indonesian professional footballer who plays as a winger for Liga 1 club Persebaya Surabaya and the Indonesia national team. ==CareerPersebaya Surabaya=== On 2017, he signed a four- year contract with Persebaya Surabaya.

It was released on April 20, 2018, by Republic Records, their first for a major record label. The title Vide Noir is French for \\"Black Void\\". ==Background== After recording their second album, Strange Trails, in 2014, and releasing it in early 2015, the band toured heavily in support of its release during the following few years. This exposure eventually led to the band’s song, \\"The Night We Met,” being featured in the Netflix show 13 Reasons Why. The feature led to the song breaking into the Billboard US all-format Hot 100 chart at number 84. The song's mainstream breakthrough caught the attention of Republic Records. After signing, the band began to work on their third studio album. ==Writing and recording== The album was their first to be recorded on a major record label. The album was mixed by veteran music producer Dave Fridmann, who the band chose to work with due to his previous work with Tame Impala, The Flaming Lips, and Baroness. ==Themes and composition== The album's title, Vide Noir, is French for \\"Black Void\\".https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/lord-huron- vide-noir-album-review Frontman and lyricist Ben Schneider stated that he drew influence for writing the album from wandering around Los Angeles at night.https://www.stereogum.com/1980273/lord-huron-ancient-names-part-i- ancient-names-part-ii/music/ He explained: Schneider noted a slight change in sound for the band in the album; noting that it was more of a \\"very bass- and drums-heavy record\\" and that \\"There’s plenty of acoustic guitar still on there, but usually, it’s distorted and blown to shit.\\" Spin Magazine and NPR noted that the song \\"Ancient Names (Part 1)\\" possessed the band's usual indie folk rock sound, while \\"Ancient Names (Part 2)\\" was described as moving into a more garage rock sounding sound. Conversely, \\"Wait by the River\\" was described as having a waltz-like sound with the vocals of an obsessive narrator. ==Release and promotion== On January 26, 2018, the band announced the album's name - Vide Noir and its release date, as April 20, 2018. The same date, the band also premiered the first two songs from the album, \\"Ancient Names (Part 1)\\" and \\"Ancient Names (Part 2)\\". A third song, \\"Wait by the River\\", was released ahead of the album on February 16, 2018, and another released on March 30, 2018 titled \\"When the Night is Over.\\" \\"Ancient Names (Part 1)\\" would peak at number 45 on the Billboard Hot Rock Songs chart, while \\"Wait by the River\\" would peak at number 17 on the same chart,https://www.billboard.com/music/lord-huron/chart-history/rock-songs number 22 on the Billboard Adult Alternative Songs chart.

Like other halts on the line, Waterloo was very basic, consisting of a single ground-level platform made from sleepers, a name-board and one lamp (though the halt did have a second lamp for at least some of its later life). There was no shelter, with passengers being confined to a fenced enclosure, whose gate to the platform would be unlocked by the guard when the train arrived. Located on the original Brecon & Merthyr Loop Line (as opposed to the second line which was built later by the Pontypridd, Newport & Caerphilly Railway), Waterloo Halt was served by 'down' services only. Fountain Bridge Halt on the opposite side of the river (on the PN&CR; line) was served by the 'up' trains. The halt closed in 1956 when the passenger service was withdrawn.

The Church of the Nativity of the Theotokos or Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary () is an Orthodox church in Skopje, North Macedonia. According to the legends, there was a medieval church. During the early 19th century the locals in Skopje decided to build there a new church. The project had become possible because the Ottoman building law, which had once limited the construction or renovation of Christian churches, had been changed. The construction works began in 1809 under the direction of the builder and painter Damjan Jankulov. He died during the construction period and the church was completed by his sons, led by Andreja Damjanov. On May 1, 1835, it was consecrated to the birth of the Blessed Virgin. The church is a three-aisled stone basilica with a western extension. The iconostasis is decorated with marble and wood carvings. One year after the completion of the church, a convent school teaching in Bulgarian was built in its courtyard. Around 1850, the school was converted according to the Lancasterian system and 1895 it was transformed into Bulgarian Pedagogical School of Skopje. According to a Firman issued by the Sultan Abdülaziz on February 28, 1870, after a plebiscite of the Slavic population of Skopje, the first bishop of the Bulgarian Orthodox Diocese of Skopje was appointed in 1874. The Diocese eventually became part of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. The Church of Our Lady became its local seat. After the incorporation of Skopje in 1912 in Serbia, the church was subordinated to the Serbian Orthodox Church. During Bulgarian occupation of the area in the First and in the Second World War the church was subordinated again to the BOC. The church was affected by a fire during an Allied bombing raid on April 6, 1944.Василиев, Асен. Български възрожденски майстори: живописци, резбари, строители. София, Наука и изкуствo, 1965. с. 207. According to other report, the incident was triggered by accident by the cook of a German military unit stationed in the service premises of the church.Иван Хаджийски.

Part of the church plate was brought out of the burning building and was subsequently taken over by the Bulgarian church authorities. During the bombing, a number of properties of the BOC's Skopje diocese were seriously damaged. According to the controversial Macedonian historiographycal data the church was burned up deliberately by the Bulgarian \\"fascistic occupiers\\".Јовчев Спасе. „Соборен храм Рождество на Пресвета Богородица во Скопје“, Скопје, 1997 год., стр.20. In 1950s it was subordinated to the Macedonian Orthodox Church. It remained a bishop's church until its destruction during the Skopje earthquake of 1963. From 2005 to 2008 it was completely reconstructed. In 2018, a report and a photograph of preserved slab appeared in Macedonian media. On the slab was an inscription: \\"The Main Door of the Bulgarian People's Church of the Nativity of the Holy Virgin, July 20, 1879.\\" The report has revealed that the slab was mounted on the church itself, but later was removed and kept for years in a secret place, as not to be destroyed by the Yugoslav authorities. == References Sources== * Јов.

He specialized in the study of skin disorders affecting racial minorities. He was one of the first African- American doctors to receive formal training in dermatology, and his mentees often described him as the \\"dean of black dermatology\\". ==Early life and education== Kenney was born in Tuskegee, Alabama, on October 8, 1914. He was the oldest of four children of John A. Kenney Sr. and Frieda Armstrong Kenney, both of whom were also influential figures in African-American medicine. His father joined the Tuskegee Institute on the invitation of its founder, Booker T. Washington; he later became medical director and chief surgeon there. His mother graduated from Boston University, making her one of the first black women to do so; she later also took a teaching position at the Tuskegee Institute. After the family was threatened by the Ku Klux Klan, they moved to Montclair, New Jersey in 1923, where Kenney attended Montclair High School. He graduated from Bates College in 1942, where he studied chemistry and biology, and received his medical degree from Howard University in 1945. At Howard, he was a member of both Alpha Omega Alpha and Kappa Pi. ==Career== Kenney was an instructor in biochemistry at Howard from 1946 to 1948, and served as the assistant editor of the Journal of the National Medical Association from 1947 to 1952.

It was described as new to science in 1984 by Norwegian mycologist Leif Ryvarden. ==Description== Fruit bodies of the fungus are crust-like, measuring up to 1 mm thick, with a pore surface colour ranging from cream to straw to pale yellowish brown. The shallow pores number 2–3 per millimetre. G. bambusicola has a dimitic hyphal system; its generative hyphae have clamp connections. Spores are more or less ellipsoid in shape, thin- walled, and measure 7–8.5 by 4–5 μm. The fungus is similar in morphology to Grammothele ochracea (found in Thailand), but differs from that species in having larger pores, more yellowish colour, and spores that are longer and more ellipsoid. ==Habitat and distribution== The type collection was made an altitude of in Ghorepani, in the Gandaki Zone of Nepal, in October 1979. It was found growing on Bambusa.

It is terrestrial, growing from tubers, to a height of up to 30 cm, with pinkish flowers arranged in a one- sided spike. It was placed in several different genera before a study in 2014 showed that it belonged in an expanded Ponerorchis. ==Description== Ponerorchis cucullata grows from more or less ellipsoid tubers. It reaches a height of around 10–30 cm. It has two basal leaves, 5–7 cm long by 1.5–3 cm wide. One or two smaller bract-like leaves occur further up the stem. The pinkish flowers are arranged in a one-sided spike. The lip or labellum is 7–9 mm long and is deeply divided into three lobes, the middle lobe being the longest. The sepals and lateral petals are about 1 mm shorter than the labellum, and together form a \\"hood\\". A spur is present, about 6 mm long, slightly expanded at the tip. The viscidia are not enclosed in a \\"sac\\" or bursicle. ==Taxonomy== The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 as Orchis cucullata. It was subsequently transferred to a number of genera, including Gymnadenia and Habenaria, before being placed in Neottianthe in 1919. A molecular phylogenetic study in 2014 found that species of Neottianthe, Amitostigma and Ponerorchis were mixed together in a single clade, making none of the three genera monophyletic as then circumscribed. Neottianthe and Amitostigma were subsumed into Ponerorchis, with this species becoming Ponerorchis cucullata. ==Distribution== Ponerorchis cucullata has a very wide distribution in temperate regions of Eurasia. In Europe, it is native to Poland and Eastern Europe. In Asia, it is found in Siberia, the Russian Far East, Mongolia, China, Japan and Korea. It is also found in the Himalayas including Nepal. ==References External links == * cucullata Category:Flora of China Category:Flora of East Himalaya Category:Flora of Eastern Europe Category:Flora of Japan Category:Flora of Korea Category:Flora of Mongolia Category:Flora of Nepal Category:Flora of Poland Category:Flora of Siberia Category:Flora of the Russian Far East Category:Flora of West Himalaya Category:Plants described in 1753 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Ponerorchis cucullata"},{"id":"56912067","text":"The Hardest Heart is In Strict Confidence's ninth studio album.

The first term on the right-hand side of the SMVE is called the \\"advection- like\\" term, while the second term is called the \\"diffusion-like\\" term. The advection-like term of the Soil Moisture Velocity Equation is particularly useful for calculating the advance of wetting fronts for a liquid invading an unsaturated porous medium under the combined action of gravity and capillarity because it is convertible to an ordinary differential equation by neglecting the diffusion-like term. and it avoids the problem of representative elementary volume by use of a fine water-content discretization and solution method. This equation was converted into a set of three ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using the method of lines to convert the partial derivatives on the right-hand side of the equation into appropriate finite difference forms. These three ODEs represent the dynamics of infiltrating water, falling slugs, and capillary groundwater, respectively. ==Derivation== This derivation of the 1-D soil moisture velocity equation for calculating vertical flux q of water in the vadose zone starts with conservation of mass for an unsaturated porous medium without sources or sinks: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\theta}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial q}{\\\\partial z}= 0. We next insert the unsaturated Buckingham–Darcy flux:Jury, W. A., and R. Horton, 2004. Soil physics. John Wiley & Sons. :q=-K(\\\\theta)\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\psi(\\\\theta)}{\\\\partial z} + K(\\\\theta), yielding Richards' equation in mixed form because it includes both the water content \\\\thetaand capillary head \\\\psi(\\\\theta): :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\theta}{\\\\partial t}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z} \\\\left[K(\\\\theta) \\\\left(\\\\frac {\\\\partial\\\\psi(\\\\theta)}{\\\\partial z}-1\\\\right)\\\\right] . Applying the chain rule of differentiation to the right-hand side of Richards' equation: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\theta}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial }{\\\\partial z} K(\\\\theta(z,t))\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z} \\\\psi(\\\\theta(z,t))+K(\\\\theta)\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial z^2}\\\\psi(\\\\theta(z,t))-\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z}K(\\\\theta(z,t)) . Assuming that the constitutive relations for unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and soil capillarity are solely functions of the water content, K=K(\\\\theta) and \\\\psi=\\\\psi(\\\\theta) , respectively: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\theta}{\\\\partial t} = K'(\\\\theta) \\\\psi'(\\\\theta) \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\theta}{\\\\partial z} \\\\right)^2+K(\\\\theta) \\\\left[\\\\psi(\\\\theta)\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\theta}{\\\\partial z}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\psi'(\\\\theta)\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\theta}{\\\\partial z^2} \\\\right]-K'(\\\\theta)\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\theta}{\\\\partial z} . This equation implicitly defines a function Z_R(\\\\theta,t) that describes the position of a particular moisture content within the soil using a finite moisture-content discretization. Employing the Implicit function theorem, which by the cyclic rule required dividing both sides of this equation by {-\\\\partial \\\\theta}/{\\\\partial z} to perform the change in variable, resulting in: \\\\frac{\\\\partial Z_R}{\\\\partial t}= -K'(\\\\theta)\\\\psi'(\\\\theta)\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\theta}{\\\\partial z}-K(\\\\theta)\\\\psi(\\\\theta)\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\theta}{\\\\partial z}-K(\\\\theta)\\\\psi'(\\\\theta)\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2\\\\theta/\\\\partial z^2}{\\\\partial \\\\theta/\\\\partial z}+K'(\\\\theta) , which can be written as: \\\\frac{\\\\partial Z_R}{\\\\partial t}= -K'(\\\\theta)\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi(\\\\theta)}{\\\\partial z} -1 \\\\right] - K(\\\\theta)\\\\left[\\\\psi(\\\\theta)\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\theta}{\\\\partial z}+\\\\psi'(\\\\theta)\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\theta/\\\\partial z^2}{\\\\partial \\\\theta/\\\\partial z}\\\\right] . Inserting the definition of the soil water diffusivity: : D(\\\\theta) \\\\equiv K(\\\\theta)\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{ \\\\partial \\\\theta} into the previous equation produces: \\\\frac{\\\\partial Z_R}{\\\\partial t}= -K'(\\\\theta) \\\\left [\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi(\\\\theta)}{\\\\partial z} -1 \\\\right]-D(\\\\theta) \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2\\\\psi/\\\\partial z^2}{\\\\partial \\\\psi/\\\\partial z} If we consider the velocity of a particular water content \\\\theta, then we can write the equation in the form of the Soil Moisture Velocity Equation: \\\\left. \\\\frac{dz}{dt} \\\\right\\\\vert_\\\\theta = \\\\frac{\\\\partial K(\\\\theta)}{\\\\partial \\\\theta} \\\\left[ 1- \\\\left (\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi(\\\\theta)}{\\\\partial z}\\\\right) \\\\right] - D(\\\\theta) \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\psi / \\\\partial z^2}{\\\\partial \\\\psi / \\\\partial z} ==Physical significance== Written in moisture content form, 1-D Richards' equation isPhilip, J.R., 1957. Theory of infiltration 1: The infiltration equation and its solution. Soil Sci. 83(5):345-357. : \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\theta }{\\\\partial t}= \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z}\\\\left(D(\\\\theta)\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\theta}{\\\\partial z}\\\\right)+\\\\frac{\\\\partial K(\\\\theta)}{\\\\partial z} Where D(θ) [L2/T] is 'the soil water diffusivity' as previously defined. Note that with \\\\theta as the dependent variable, physical interpretation is difficult because all the factors that affect the divergence of the flux are wrapped up in the soil moisture diffusivity term D(\\\\theta). However, in the SMVE, the three factors that drive flow are in separate terms that have physical significance. The primary assumptions used in the derivation of the Soil Moisture Velocity Equation are that K=K(\\\\theta) and \\\\psi=\\\\psi(\\\\theta) are not overly restrictive. Analytical and experimental results show that these assumptions are acceptable under most conditions in natural soils. In this case, the Soil Moisture Velocity Equation is equivalent to the 1-D Richards' equation, albeit with a change in dependent variable. This change of dependent variable is convenient because it reduces the complexity of the problem because compared to Richards' equation, which requires the calculation of the divergence of the flux, the SMVE represents a flux calculation, not a divergence calculation. The first term on the right-hand side of the SMVE represents the two scalar drivers of flow, gravity and the integrated capillarity of the wetting front. Considering just that term, the SMVE becomes: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial Z_R}{\\\\partial t}= -K'(\\\\theta) \\\\left [\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi(\\\\theta)}{\\\\partial z} -1 \\\\right] where {\\\\partial \\\\psi(\\\\theta)}/{\\\\partial z} is the capillary head gradient that is driving the flux and the remaining conductivity term K'(\\\\theta) represents the ability of gravity to conduct flux through the soil. This term is responsible for the true advection of water through the soil under the combined influences of gravity and capillarity. As such, it is called the \\"advection-like\\" term. Neglecting gravity and the scalar wetting front capillarity, we can consider only the second term on the right-hand side of the SMVE. In this case the Soil Moisture Velocity Equation becomes: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial Z_R}{\\\\partial t}= -D(\\\\theta) \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2\\\\psi/\\\\partial z^2}{\\\\partial \\\\psi/\\\\partial z} This term is strikingly similar to Fick's second law of diffusion. For this reason, this term is called the \\"diffusion- like\\" term of the SMVE. This term represents the flux due to the shape of the wetting front -D(\\\\theta) {\\\\partial^2\\\\psi/\\\\partial z^2}, divided by the spatial gradient of the capillary head {\\\\partial \\\\psi/\\\\partial z}. Looking at this diffusion-like term, it is reasonable to ask when might this term be negligible? The first answer is that this term will be zero when the first derivative <\\\\partial \\\\psi/\\\\partial z=C, because the second derivative will equal zero. One example where this occurs is in the case of an equilibrium hydrostatic moisture profile, when \\\\partial \\\\psi/\\\\partial z=-1 with z defined as positive upward. This is a physically realistic result because an equilibrium hydrostatic moisture profile is known to not produce fluxes. Another instance when the diffusion-like term will be nearly zero is in the case of sharp wetting fronts, where the denominator of the diffusion-like term \\\\partial \\\\psi/\\\\partial z \\\\to \\\\infty , causing the term to vanish. Notably, sharp wetting fronts are notoriously difficult to resolve and accurately solve with traditional numerical Richards' equation solvers.Farthing, M. W., & Ogden, F. L. (2017). Numerical Solution of Richards’ Equation: A Review of Advances and Challenges. Soil Science Society of America J. Finally, in the case of dry soils, K(\\\\theta) tends towards 0, making the soil water diffusivity D(\\\\theta) tend towards zero as well. In this case, the diffusion- like term would produce no flux. Comparing against exact solutions of Richards' equation for infiltration into idealized soils developed by Ross & Parlange (1994)Ross, P.J., and J.-Y. Parlange, 1994. Comparing exact and numerical solutions of Richards' for 1-dimensional infiltration and drainage, Soil Sci. 157(6):341-344. revealed that indeed, neglecting the diffusion-like term resulted in accuracy >99% in calculated cumulative infiltration. This result indicates that the advection-like term of the SMVE, converted into an ordinary differential equation using the method of lines, is an accurate ODE solution of the infiltration problem. This is consistent with the result published by Ogden et al. who found errors in simulated cumulative infiltration of 0.3% using 263 cm of tropical rainfall over an 8-month simulation to drive infiltration simulations that compared the advection-like SMVE solution against the numerical solution of Richards' equation. ==Solution== The advection-like term of the SMVE can be solved using the method of lines and a finite moisture content discretization. This solution of the SMVE advection-like term replaces the 1-D Richards' equation PDE with a set of three ordinary differential equations (ODEs). These three ODEs are: ===Infiltration fronts=== Infiltration fronts in finite water-content domain With reference to Figure 1, water infiltrating the land surface can flow through the pore space between \\\\theta_d and \\\\theta_i. Using the method of lines to convert the SMVE advection-like term into an ODE: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial K(\\\\theta)}{\\\\partial \\\\theta}=\\\\frac{K(\\\\theta_d)-K(\\\\theta_i)}{\\\\theta_d-\\\\theta_i}. Given that any ponded depth of water on the land surface is h_p, the Green and Ampt (1911)Green, W. H., and G. A. Ampt (1911), Studies on soil physics, 1, The flow of air and water through soils, J. Agric. Sci., 4(1), 1–24. assumption is employed, : \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi(\\\\theta)}{\\\\partial z}=\\\\frac{\\\\psi(\\\\theta_d)+h_p}{z_j}, represents the capillary head gradient that is driving the flow in the j^{th} discretization or \\"bin\\". Therefore, the finite water-content equation in the case of infiltration fronts is: : \\\\left(\\\\frac{dz}{dt}\\\\right)_j= \\\\frac{K(\\\\theta_d)-K(\\\\theta_i)}{\\\\theta_d-\\\\theta_i} \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\psi(\\\\theta_d)+h_p}{z_j}+1\\\\right). ===Falling slugs=== Falling slugs in the finite water-content domain. The water in each bin is considered a separate slug. After rainfall stops and all surface water infiltrates, water in bins that contains infiltration fronts detaches from the land surface. Assuming that the capillarity at leading and trailing edges of this 'falling slug' of water is balanced, then the water falls through the media at the incremental conductivity associated with the j^\\\\text{th}\\\\ \\\\Delta\\\\theta bin: : \\\\left(\\\\frac{dz}{dt}\\\\right)_j= \\\\frac{K(\\\\theta_j)-K(\\\\theta_{j-1})}{\\\\theta_j -\\\\theta_{j-1}}. This approach to solving the capillary-free solution is very similar to the kinematic wave approximation. ===Capillary groundwater fronts=== Groundwater capillary fronts in finite water-content domain In this case, the flux of water to the j^\\\\text{th} bin occurs between bin j and i. Therefore, in the context of the method of lines: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial K(\\\\theta)}{\\\\partial \\\\theta}= \\\\frac{K(\\\\theta_j)-K(\\\\theta_i)}{\\\\theta_j - \\\\theta_i}, and : \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\psi(\\\\theta)}{\\\\partial z} = \\\\frac{\\\\psi(\\\\theta_j)}{H_j} which yields: : \\\\left(\\\\frac{dH}{dt}\\\\right)_j= \\\\frac{K(\\\\theta_j)-K(\\\\theta_i)}{\\\\theta_j - \\\\theta_i} \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\psi(\\\\theta_j)}{H_j}-1\\\\right). Note the \\"-1\\" in parentheses, representing the fact that gravity and capillarity are acting in opposite directions. The performance of this equation was verified, using a column experiment fashioned after that by Childs and Poulovassilis (1962). Results of that validation showed that the finite water-content vadose zone flux calculation method performed comparably to the numerical solution of Richards' equation. The photo shows apparatus. Data from this column experiment are available by clicking on this hot-linked DOI. These data are useful for evaluating models of near-surface water table dynamics. It is noteworthy that the SMVE advection-like term solved using the finite moisture-content method completely avoids the need to estimate the specific yield. Calculating the specific yield as the water table nears the land surface is made cumbersome my non-linearities. However, the SMVE solved using a finite moisture-content discretization essentially does this automatically in the case of a dynamic near-surface water table. Column experiment used to observe moisture response in a fine sand above a moving water table.

Retrieved March 22nd, 2018. Key findings of his research include the following: * The increases in the returns to schooling observed in the U.S. during the 1980s cannot be attributed to a change in the relationship between ability and schooling wherein higher returns to schooling would have e.g. masked an increase in the average ability of graduates (with David Neumark).Blackburn, M., Neumark, D. (1993). Omitted- Ability Bias and the Increase in the Return to Schooling. Journal of Labor Economics, 11(3), pp. 521-544. * Together with David E. Bloom and Richard B. Freeman, Blackburn documents the strong deterioration of the economic position of less-skilled American males in the 1970s and 1980s, which the authors attribute to a combination of deindustrialization, deunionization, and changes in the growth rates of different education groups, but find no role for decreases in the minimum wage, technological change, increased female labour market participation, and changes in the quality of less-educated workers.Blackburn, M.L., Bloom, D.E., Freeman, R.B. (1989). The Declining Economic Position of Less-Skilled American Males. NBER Working Paper Series, 3186. * Contrary the downward bias in the OLS estimates of the returns to schooling in the U.S. found in earlier research, Blackburn and Neumark find that OLS estimates which fail to control for ability overestimate returns to schooling by 40%.Blackburn, M.L., Neumark, D. (1995). Are OLS Estimates of the Return to Schooling Biased Downward? Another Look. Review of Economics and Statistics, 77(2), pp. 217-230. *Differences in unobserved ability appear to explain only a small share of wage differentials between industries and occupations in the U.S. (with Neumark).Blackburn, M., Neumark, D. (1992). Unobserved Ability, Efficiency Wages, and Interindustry Differentials. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 107(4), pp. 1421-1436. * Increases in minimum wages in the U.S. between 1983 and 1996 appear to have reduced poverty among teenagers and older dropouts from junior high schools (with John T. Addison).Addison, J.T., Blackburn, M. L. (1999). Minimum Wages and Poverty. ILR Review, 52(3), pp. 393-409. * Unemployment insurance may have increased the wages of workers in the U.S. after the end of their unemployment spells, though less than indicated by earlier research.Addison, J.T., Blackburn, M.L.

It may also refer to the tune used when reading the other books of the Tanach, and to a lesser degree, the Mishna. The Moroccan rite is distinct from other Sephardic, Yemenite and Ashkenazic cantillations and is considered to be a category unto itself. == Torah == The names of the cantillation notes (Te'amim) used by Moroccan Jews are similar to those used by other Sephardic communities, although their tunes are different. Moroccan Te'amim generally fit into the Makam scales of Zidane and Higaz while Yerushalmi Te'amim are considered to be classified as Makam Sigah. === Ta'am Elyon === In mainstream parlance, Ta'am Elyon refers to the alternate cantillation used to read the Ten Commandments. However, in the Moroccan community, it is also used to refer to the special cantillation used in certain sections of the Torah portions of Beshalach and Yitro. Specifically, Ta'am Elyon refers to the alternate tune in the Tarḥa and Sof Pasuk cantillations at the end of certain verses in those Torah portions. == Tanach  Haftara === Moroccan Jews also have a distinct cantillation when reading the Haftara. The Moroccan cantillation for the Haftara can be further subdivided into the tune used by the general Moroccan community and that of the Spanish Moroccan community. Generally, this difference can be observed on ordinary Shabbatot, but on holidays, the Spanish Moroccans use the same tune as the general Moroccan community. Furthermore, there is a custom among some Moroccans to use the Spanish Moroccan tune for the Haftara that is read on Tisha B'Av. There exists a difference between the Darga and Tevir cantillations depending on if they are in the middle of a verse or closer to the end of a verse. If there are two sets of Darga and Tevir, they are always read in the two different tunes.  Tlata DePuranuta  On the Shabbatot that fall during the Three Weeks, special Haftarot are read whose themes deal with the Jewish exile and other calamities. In the Moroccan rite there is a special, solemn tune used to read these Haftarot, in line with the mournful period of the year. There are some opinions which maintain that such a tune is inappropriate since any public forms of mourning are forbidden on Shabbat, even during the Three Weeks. === Psalms === The cantillation used for Tehillim can also be subdivided into the Moroccan and the Spanish Moroccan rites. The tune used by Spanish Moroccans is that which is used to read Psalms at funerals by other Moroccans. === Shir Hashririm === As with other Sephardic communities, Shir Hashirim is chanted during Kabbalat Shabbat as well as at the end of the Seder. This too has its own unique cantillation in the Moroccan community. Megillat Ruth, which is traditionally read on Shavuot, has a tune which is very similar to that of Shir Hashirim, with some minor differences. The book of Job also has a similar tune. == See also == *Cantillation *Minhag Morocco *Moroccan Jews ==Bibliography== * Darké Abotenou: The Laws and Customs of the Jews of Morocco, * Tikkun Korim Ish Matzliah, Machon Harav Matzliah * Siddour, Patah Eliyahou, Editions Charbit == External links == * , channel with recordings of Torah, Haftara and other readings.

She worked as a flight instructor and wrote about aviation in North Carolina. == Biography  Pre-Mercury 13 === Cagle was born on June 3, 1925 in North Carolina. Cagle had always wanted to fly from a young age. When she was 12, her brothers taught her to fly using the plane they owned. When she \\"earned her wings\\" at the age of 14, she was the youngest pilot in North Carolina, and at the time, may have been the youngest in the United States. She joined the high school's aeronautics class, when the school's instructor was drafted to fight in World War II, she finished out her year as the teacher. As a Flight Instructor she was nicknamed, \\"Captain K\\". Cagle earned her private pilot's license when she was nineteen. Cagle joined the Civil Air Patrol, the Ninety-Nines, and wanted to become a WASP. Cagle went on to run an airport near Raleigh and her own charter plane service. In 1950, she earned a trophy in the Powder Puff Derby. She earned her Commercial Pilots license with Airplane Single and Multi-Engine Land ratings and Instrument ratings by 1951. She was also a certified Flight Instructor, Flight Instrument Instructor and Ground Instructor. Her flight school was located in Selma. Cagle began writing a column called \\"Air Currents\\" in 1946 for the Johnstonian Sun newspaper in Selma. Later the column was moved to the Raleigh News and Observer from 1953 to 1960. When she flew a T-33 jet trainer, she became one of only five women who had \\"ever piloted a jet.\\" === Mercury 13 === Cagle married former pupil, Walt Cagle, in 1960. Her wedding dress was made from parachutes. She moved to Macon, Georgia, in 1961. Not long after she arrived, she was invited to participate in the new Women in Space Program. Cagle had 4,300 hours of flying time by the time the program started. Cagle and the twelve other women participants eventually became known as the \\"Mercury 13.\\" During the program, Cagle was warned by the administrators not to become pregnant. Among the multitude of tests she underwent as part of the program, she noted that one of the worst tests she faced was having her eardrums frozen. === Post-Mercury 13 === Plaque of Cagle at the Georgia Aviation Hall of Fame Cagle went back to teaching students how to fly and also enrolled in Mercer University. She continued to be involved in the Civil Air Patrol. In 1964, she competed in the International Women's Air Race. In 1986, she became a member of the Warner Robins Air Logistics Team. In 1988, Cagle became the second woman to graduate with an airframe and powerplant mechanic's rating from the Georgia Technical Institute. She was still flying her single-engine Cessna in 1998 at age 73, even though she had retired from teaching at Robins Air Force Base. On April 26, 2003, Cagle was inducted into the Georgia Aviation Hall of Fame. In 2007, she and eight of the Mercury 13 graduates earned an honorary doctorate from the University of Wisconsin, Oshkosh. ==Death == Cagle died on December 22, 2019. == References  External Links == * Myrtle K.

David Munro Milne (1863–1927), an Aberdeen-educated minister and the incumbent at St Luke's, Edinburgh from 1896 to 1927, and his wife Jane (or Jeanie; died 1922), daughter of James Mackay, of Banffshire. He had two sisters, Mary Catherine (born 1899; she married James Davie, MC, and settled in South Africa) and Agnes Jane (born 1906; she married Koert Nicholas Pretorius, of Botswana, formerly British Protectorate of Bechuanaland).Ian Levitt, \\"Milne, Sir David (1896–1972)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (online edition, Oxford University Press; September 2004, revised January 2008).

Milne was educated at Daniel Stewart's College and the University of Edinburgh, although his studies at the latter were interrupted by the First World War (he served with the Royal Scots from 1915 to 1919).\\"Milne, Sir David\\", Who Was Who (online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2007). Retrieved 22 March 2018. After the war, he completed his classics degree at Edinburgh and won several scholarships. == Career, honours and retirement == Milne joined the Scottish Office as an Assistant Principal in 1921. After seven years he was promoted to be Private Secretary to the Permanent Under-Secretary of State at the Scottish Office. Two years later, he became Private Secretary to the Secretary of State and in 1935 he was promoted to Assistant Secretary to head up the Scottish Office's new Local Government Branch in Edinburgh, which was meant to enable Scottish people and institutions to meet with government officials without having to travel to the Scottish Office in London.James Mitchell, The Scottish Question (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014), p. 70. Four years later, Milne was promoted to Deputy Secretary at the new Scottish Home Department, and he was promoted to become its Secretary in 1942. Milne's final promotion in the civil service was to be Permanent Under-Secretary to the Scottish Office, in which office he served from 1946 until his retirement in 1959. Milne wrote The Scottish Office in 1958, a guide to its organisation and operation. In retirement, he was a Governor of the BBC in Scotland (1960–65) and Chairman of the Scottish National Orchestra Society (1961–70). He had been appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1942, and was promoted to Knight Commander five years later, followed by Knight Grand Cross in 1958. He died on 4 February 1972; his wife, Winifrede (the daughter of Surgeon-Captain L. Kilroy), had died two years prior, leaving two children. == Assessment == Milne had what Ian Levitt called in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography a \\"brand of comfortable unionism ... his administrative style and ability to select deputies of similar mind did much to ensure that Scottish opinion felt able to work and prosper with the United Kingdom government.\\" His obituary in The Times remarked that \\"Only those who were at Dover House in those days [the Scottish Office in London during the minority Labour government of 1929–31] can appreciate how much his sympathy, his tact, and his capacity for getting into the mind of Ministers and acting as an interpreter between them and their civil servants contributed to the smooth running of the administration\\".\\"Sir David Milne\\", The Times (London), 8 February 1972, p. 14. Later while Milne was its Permanent Under-Secretary, the Scottish Office grew and increasingly came to argue for the peculiarity of Scotland and the need for its consideration during policy-making. This, Levitt argues, reflected Milne's desire to stem the growth of Scottish nationalism; the result was a series of concessions to Scotland in the 1940s and 1950s in the form of lower tax rates but equivalent spending to England. == Likenesses == * Sir David Milne, by Elliott & Fry (bromide print, 1947).

It offers project-based after-school and summer programs in the arts, communications and leadership, sports and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math). == History and background == After School Matters was originally founded by the former first lady of the City of Chicago, Maggie Daley, during her husband Richard M. Daley's term as mayor. Gallery 37 was the predecessor to the organization, which offered after school programs focusing primarily on the arts. In 2000, After School Matters was formed and began offering Chicago teenagers a wider range of programs, including programs from Gallery 37. When the youth organization first launched as Gallery 37, 260 kids were enrolled that summer. Over 200,000 teenagers have been associated with or members of After School Matters since its launch. Mellody Hobson has served as the president since 2012. == Demographics == After School Matters works with the local Chicago adolescent population between the ages of 14 and 19 years old. Over 90% of its participants identify as ethnic minorities. == Programs and partnerships == Programs are offered in forms of apprenticeships and internships that cover areas such as science, sports, technology, college readiness skills, and communication. Programs are offered in three sessions: Summer, Fall, and Spring. The organization works with various organizations across Chicago and other corporate entities. Some include, West Town Bikes, Forward Momentum, 1871, The Chicago Fire Foundation, and Bank of America, who further provide teenagers with programs. === Art === Programs under the arts primarily fall under performing, visual and culinary arts. These include theater, graphic design, choir, catering, and printmaking. * Students created a series of artworks that were added to the newly renovated McCormick Places Metra Station waiting room in 2017. * J-DEF Peace Project, a mural located in the Pilsen neighborhood, was created by students in dedication to those who have lost their lives due to gang violence. * In 2015, ASM teens helped create a mural promoting healthy eating at Whole Foods Market in Edgewater. *A cooking exhibition was led by students at the 2013 Taste of Chicago. *Students can also participate in programs offered through Forward Momentum where they can learn and perform different dance styles such as Ballet, Latin, African, and Hip-Hop. === Communications and leadership === Programs are offered in business, journalism, marketing, media, and social science. Some examples are documentary video, creative writing and debate. After School Matters and the USC Shoah Foundation partnered to create a program called \\"iWitness\\", which teaches leadership skills and in understanding public political discourse. The students were also able to develop their own contributions to the political debate via social media. === Sports === Sports instruction, stadium management, health and wellness, and sports-related programs such as soccer and lifeguarding are offered via After School Matters. A partnership with West Town Bikes allows for students to attend a program were they can learn about cycling, rules on the road, transportation, and even how to repair bikes. The program offers students the opportunity to build their own bikes as well as earn a stipend at the end of the program. === STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) === Programs offered are applied and natural science, audio/visual technology, industrial technology, and information technology. A partnership with 1871, a technology and entrepreneurship company, allows students to apply for internship positions at the company and work in event planning and community outreach. == After School Matters Annual Gala == Every year After School Matters holds a gala to celebrate its members' accomplishments and collect funds to support its programs. This platform has been used as a showcase for many of the teenage members' work and contributions to the general public and outside contributors. In 2016 the program held its 25th annual gala at Navy Pier and raised a total of $4.5 million. == Funding and notable donations == After School Matters sustains itself through grants and donations. In 2013 a $25 million donation, given in $5 million increments, was made to the program by filmmaker George Lucas and Mellody Hobson through the George Lucas Foundation. The donation funded a $275 to $425 student stipend, which had been cut during the recession. In 2013 the City of Chicago invested $12.2 million in the program. Donations were also made by former Chicago Bulls players Michael Jordan and Derrick Rose, who donated $1 million in 2014. == Controversies == Linda Wutton of WBEZ found that teenagers who were paid $5 an hour in 2009 would now make $1.10 due to pay cuts in the program despite an increase in After School Matter's budget. Students who were previously earning a $400 stipend for a program would be receiving $100 for the same program the following year. Board member, Avis Lavele, of After School Matters claimed that the cuts were made to focus on eliminating clubs and bringing in more beneficial programs without reducing the number of students involved with After School Matters. == References == Category:1991 establishments in Illinois Category:Education in Chicago Category:Non-profit organizations based in Chicago ","title":"After School Matters"},{"id":"56912433","text":"Edmundo Pisano Valdés (19 May 1919 – 29 March 1997) was a Chilean plant ecologist, botanist and agronomist.

She served as the Vice President for Air Freighters International and Air Services, Inc. Truhill died on November 18, 2013. == Early life == Truhill was first exposed to aviation a young age, but due to the restrictive views on women pilots during the era, she was often discouraged from pursuing the career. When she was 15, she began taking flying lessons without the knowledge of her parents. After this was discovered, she was sent to a Catholic School in San Antonio, Texas. == Aviation career and Mercury 13 == Truhill spent much of her time based out of Dallas, Texas, where she began a partnership with Joe Truhill, who she would eventually marry. She and Joe flew North American B-25's under Texas Instruments, Incorporated. Through this, she helped to develop Terrain Following Radar (TFR) and smart bombs. Truhill also participated in numerous Air Races. In 1961, she got a call from friend Jerrie Cobb, asking for her interest in a secret government project, which would turn out to be the Women in Space Program run by Dr. William Randolph Lovelace, who ran an astronaut testing center for NASA in Albuquerque, N.M. Through Dr. Lovelace, the women went through the same Mercury era testing as the men. After the program was halted, the Truhills bought and flew a P-51 Mustang, during which she also modeled a pink lycra flight suit for Monsanto. She bought a house in Richardson, where she lived until her death. == She Should Have Gone to the Moon == Truhill was the subject of the 2008 documentary She Should Have Gone to the Moon which was based upon a series of lengthy conversations between Truhill an director Ulrike Kubatta in which she tells the story of the Mercury 13 programme in her own words and from her own point of view. The interviews are augmented, supported and illustrated by archive footage and stylised reconstruction sequences. Truhill recounts details of her training, and that of other women trainees, reflects on the achievements of American female pilots and astronauts (notably ignoring Soviet women such as Valentina Tereshkova), and on her personal story including her pre-Mercury 13 work with flight testing new equipment for Texas Instruments up to and during the Bay of Pigs incident, and her personally confronting Lyndon Johnson at a fundraiser to challenge the cessation of the Women in Space programme. == References == Category:1929 births Category:2013 deaths Category:American female aviators Category:Mercury 13 Category:Aviators from Texas ","title":"Jerri Sloan Truhill"},{"id":"56912480","text":"Petelia medardaria is a moth of the family Geometridae first described by Gottlieb August Wilhelm Herrich-Schäffer in 1856.

GBR Athletics. Retrieved on 2016-08-26. ==History== Indoor athletics at a national level began to take shape in the Soviet Union from 1940 onwards, in the form of winter indoor matches between teams from Moscow and Leningrad, then expanding to cities including Kiev, Kharkov, and Odessa.1.3.2. Развитие легкой атлетики в ссср . Studfiles. Retrieved 2018-03-22. The early history of event is linked to that of the All-Union Winter Competitions (), which were first held in 1949 and included outdoor throwing events and racewalking.Soviet Indoor Championships. GBR Athletics. Retrieved 2018-03-22. The event took the form of an indoor track and field championship in 1971 and a total of 22 athletics events (12 for men, 10 for women) were contested. The competition also featured a team element, with athletes' performances counting towards a points total for the Soviet Republic or major city that they represented. By the end of the competition's history, a total of 28 events (15 by men, 13 by women) were contested, with pole vault and steeplechase being the only events to remain for men only. With the exception of the indoor steeplechase, in its later years the championships programme roughly aligned with that of the IAAF World Indoor Championships (first held in 1987).Лёгкая атлетика.

The last Soviet Indoor Athletics Championships was hosted in Volgograd in 1991 and it ceased thereafter due to the dissolution of the Soviet Union. A final shared championships was held in 1992 between the Commonwealth of Independent States, after which point the newly independent nations hosted their own national championship events. ==Events== The following athletics events featured as standard on the main Soviet Indoor Championships programme: * Sprint: 60 m, 200 m, 400 m * Distance track events: 800 m, 1500 m, 3000 m, 5000 m * Hurdles: 60 m hurdles * Jumps: long jump, triple jump, high jump, pole vault (men only) * Throws: shot put Indoor versions of the 110 metres hurdles and 100 metres hurdles were held at the first three editions, before being dropped. Men and women also competed over 100 metres in 1972 and 1973. Races over 600 metres were contested by men and women in the first two editions, then 1000 metres in 1973, before the events were standardised to the international class 800 m and 1500 m. A one- off men's weight throw was also held in 1975. The 1976 programme had a one-off change, dropping the 400 m in favour of men's and women's 300 m and 600 m races. Women's 3000 m race were held between 1975 and 1977. The 100 m sprint and 110/100 hurdles were also reintroduced between 1978 and 1980. The 200 metres for men and women began in 1982, as did a women's 3000 metres, and a women's triple jump was introduced at the final edition in 1991. The 1977 championships featured the 10,000 metres race walk for the first time. A women's race walk over 5000 m was first held in 1981, but both walks were dropped in 1982. The walks returned with 5000 m and 3000 m races for men and women, respectively, in 1989 and remained present until 1991. The steeplechase had a very varied history at the competition, given limitations at the scheduled venue. It was contested by men only, as the event was not regularly contested by women during this period. A men's 2000 metres steeplechase was added to the programme in 1978. It was extended to the standard 3000 m distance in 1982, reinstated over 2000 m for 1985 and 1986, returned to 3000 m in 1987, 1990 and 1991, and dropped at the 1984, 1988 and 1989 editions. Combined track and field events were held jointly at early editions of the competitions. A men's pentathlon and women's triathlon were held in 1975, and then moved to the international standard of men's heptathlon and women's pentathlon in 1977. The Soviet Combined Events Championships were contested separately from 1978 onwards. Variations were made at some editions, with women competing in six events in 1982 and 1984, and men competing in an octathlon in 1984, 1988 and 1989. ==Editions== {  - bgcolor=#CCDDEE ! # ! Year !

In addition to her social work, she is known for supporting cultural exchange between the Indigenous community that she was a part of and non- Indigenous people, as well as supporting cultural continuity through her teaching throughout her life. Lavalley was also known as a skilled maker using traditional patterns and stitching techniques, making wearable crafts like moccasins and mittens for instance. == Early life == Sarah and Jim Lavalley on their wedding day, August 26, 1916 Sarah Lavalley was born on April 28, 1895 on Golden Lake (Algonquins of Pikwakanagan First Nation) Reserve. Lavalley attended a day school until grade nine on Golden Lake Reserve, and attended high school in Eganville. Lavalley left school to support her family working as a household servant in Eganville and Ottawa. Lavalley also helped her grandmother Annie Mitchell with midwifery from the age of fourteen. This formative experience led to her completing some training at the Good Samaritan Catholic Hospital in Jersey City, New Jersey, at age nineteen. Sarah married James Lavalley in 1916. On the occasion of their fiftieth wedding anniversary the couple received letters of congratulations from political figures including Governor General Georges Vanier, Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson, Agriculture Minister Joe Greene, and Senator Norman McLeod Paterson, revealing some of the high-profile relationships that Lavalley had established. Other than a couple of brief periods spent in Ottawa and Timmins, Ontario, Sarah lived primarily on Golden Lake Reserve throughout her life. She had eight children and forty-three grandchildren. == Community contributions == Sarah Lavalley at Opeongo Lake in 1967 Lavalley developed a reputation as a dedicated nurse at Golden Lake Reserve and Village, serving 600 villagers and 300 inhabitants on the reserve, addressing the inaccessibility of the nearest hospital. Lavalley was president of the Golden Lake Branch of the Catholic Women’s League and the Golden Lake Homemaker’s Club, where she encouraged women from the community to meet and develop skills, particularly in Indigenous crafts. Lavalley fostered cultural exchange when she taught Indigenous and non-Indigenous women craftwork and beadwork. Lavalley’s work appeared regularly since the 1940s in the Indian Crafts Pavilion at the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto, and was sold nationally, in United States, and in Europe. She also led the Algonquin Crafts project, which provided an opportunity for makers on the reserve to sell their work. Later in her life, Sarah Lavalley acted as a consultant for linguistics research and was included in several publications, such as “Kinship Terms in Golden Lake Algonquin” by George F.

It had a magnitude of 7.4 on the surface wave magnitude scale. It caused the destruction of many houses in Nagano and at least 8,600 people were killed. The earthquake triggered many landslides, the largest of which dammed the Sai River (a tributary of the Shinano River). 19 days later, the failure of this earthquake dam caused a flood that destroyed many more houses and killed a further 35 people. ==Tectonic setting== During the middle of the Miocene period Japan was affected by the opening of the Sea of Japan as a back-arc basin in response to continuing subduction of the Pacific Plate. This period of extensional tectonics caused the development of rift basins on the western side of Honshu, including the northern part of the Fossa Magna. When the back-arc spreading stopped during the late Miocene, the rifted area started to shorten and the basins became inverted. The western margin of the Nagano Basin, part of the Fossa Magna, is formed by an active reverse fault zone, the West Nagano Basin Fault. The 1847 earthquake was caused by rupture on part of this fault zone. ==Landslides== The earthquake triggered a large number of landslides, due mainly the relatively unconsolidated Miocene sediments. At least seven of these formed dams on rivers in the surrounding area. The largest of these dams was formed at the foot of Mount Iwakura from a landslide with an estimated volume of 20 million cubic metres that blocked the Sai River. The water held back by the dam eventually broke through 19 days after the earthquake, flooding a large area downstream from the dam. ==References== Category:Earthquakes in Japan Category:Nagano (city) Category:1840s earthquakes Category:1847 in Japan ","title":"1847 Nagano earthquake"},{"id":"56913148","text":"Jangyeon Byeon clan () was one of the Korean clans.

Her father, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, is the prime minister of the UAE, and her mother, Houria Ahmed Lamara, is from Algeria. Sheikha Latifa has two half-sisters with the same name. She is the full sister of Sheikha Maitha (born 1980), Sheika Shamsa (born 1981), and Sheikh Majid (born 1987). Sheikha Latifa escaped from Dubai in late February 2018 and was forcibly returned from international waters near the Indian coast by a joint India–Emirates operation on 4 March 2018. In December 2018, the Dubai royal court said that she was back in Dubai. ==Early life== In a video statement, Sheikha Latifa said that she and her brother Sheikh Majid spent their early childhood under the care of their paternal aunt. Her early education was at the Dubai English Speaking School and later at the International School of Choueifat, with one year at the Latifa School for Girls. Sheikha Latifa is an experienced skydiver, coached by former world champion skydiver Stefania Martinengo, and held accelerated freefall instructor rating. ==2018 disappearance== On 24 February 2018, Sheikha Latifa and her Finnish friend Tiina Jauhiainen left Dubai in a car and crossed the border to Oman. They left Oman on jet skis and joined American–French citizen and former French intelligence officer Hervé Jaubert and his crew on the yacht Nostromo. Two days later, she made contact with British-based attorney David Haigh of Detained International notifying her of her departure from Dubai, and she posted a few departing messages on her social media account, detailing the circumstances and reasons for her departure. On 3 March 2018, Jaubert made contact with an Indian journalist in preparation for the end of their journey. The following day, Sheikha Latifa, Jaubert and Jauhiainen, along with the crew of three Philippine nationals, were intercepted by Indian authorities while approaching Goa on the U.S.-registered yacht Nostromo, call sign WDG9847. On 9 March 2018, the Daily Mail broke the news of the disappearance of Nostromo and those aboard, after being contacted by Sheikha Latifa's representatives. She had made a 39-minute video before the escape attempt, to be released in case her life was in danger, and it was made public on 11 March 2018. Recorded at Jauhiainen's apartment, the video explains her family background and the circumstances leading to her decision to flee. In the video, she also accuses her father of maltreatment of her and her sister Shamsa along with other serious charges, including murder. The Finnish National Bureau of Investigation confirmed the disappearance of Jauhiainen and opened an investigation in collaboration with the Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The brother of Jauhiainen confirmed her friendship with Sheikha Latifa. On 20 March 2018, Nostromo was spotted at the port of Fujairah in the UAE. It left the next day for Sri Lanka with the released crew, including Jaubert and three Philippine nationals, on board. Nostromo reached Galle, Sri Lanka, on 2 April 2018. On 22 March 2018, Sheikha Latifa's companion Jauhiainen was found, prompting the Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs to terminate its search in cooperation with the Dubai authorities. The location where Jauhiainen was found and details of prior events were not shared officially, but according to her family she returned from Dubai to Finland that night. According to Detained in Dubai, a number of people were detained or interrogated in connection to the event in UAE and Oman, notably Christian Elombo, a French national whose family is living in Luxembourg; Elombo spent more than a month in custody in Oman, from late February to 5 April 2018. After being released without charge, he was again taken into custody in Luxembourg on 6 April 2018 for 41 days under an Interpol Red Notice issued by the UAE. The notice was later retracted without notification or producing any evidence for the cited kidnapping charges.Festgenommener Franzose soll Prinzessin zur Flucht verholfen haben, tageblatt.lu, 12 April 2018 (in German)Retraction of Red Notice by Interpol: Mutmaßlicher Prinzessinnen-Entführer wieder auf freiem Fuß, tageblatt.lu, 16 May 2018 (in German) In December 2018, prior to the release of a BBC Two documentary Escape from Dubai: The Mystery of the Missing Princess, the Dubai royal court released a statement saying that Latifa was safe at home. On 25 December, photographs taken on 15 December were released showing Latifa alongside Mary Robinson, former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and former President of Ireland. ==Interception of the yacht Nostromo== According to the testimonies of the crew, the yacht was being actively searched for by Indian Coast Guard search and rescue aircraft SAR CG 782 on 3 March 2018. On the day of interception the yacht was scouted by another aircraft. Before the raid on 4 March 2018, three marine vessels were spotted on radar by Nostromo's crew, tailing it at a speed of less than 5 knots. Two of the vessels were later identified as ICGS Shoor and ICGS Samarth, described in media statements by Jaubert: \\"The two coast guards vessels had a huge marking on the side of the hull, which read 'Indian Coast Guard' and one had an ID number painted: 11\\". After sunset two unmarked speedboats carrying six to eight armed Indian MARCOS Special Forces personnel in full military gear and Tavor assault rifles were launched from these ships to intercept Nostromo. The raid began with use of stun and smoke grenades to disorient and incapacitate the crew, who were then handcuffed. After being taken over by Indian Coast Guard, the yacht was boarded by at least ten Emirati special forces personnel, who arrived by helicopter. Sheikha Latifa, despite claiming asylum to Indian personnel and expressing a clear unwillingness to go back to the UAE from where she was fleeing, was forcefully taken away onto one of the ships. Nostromo and the rest of the crew were taken to the naval base in Fujairah, escorted by the Indian Coast Guard and then transferred to UAE warship Baynunah. According to Radha Stirling's account, she received her last voice message from Latifa during the alleged raid in a panicked state, telling her \\"Radha please help me, there are men outside\\" and that she had heard \\"gunshots\\". Further attempts of communication from those on-board Nostromo allegedly failed due to jamming from an Indian electronic warfare aircraft. In total, at least three Indian and two Emirati warships, two military planes, and a helicopter were involved in the raid on Nostromo, about 50 miles off the coast of Goa. ===Media reactions and aftermath=== In the early days after the disappearance of the yacht Nostromo and its crew, the news was primarily carried on English and Finnish tabloids, backed up by awareness campaigns in social media and boosted by support from internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom. Jauhiainen and Jaubert made their first public appearance after the incident in a press conference arranged by Detained in Dubai in London despite facing alleged threats from the UAE government to stay silent. Following a period without mention in the Gulf media, the Western media started asking for clarity on the status of Sheikha Latifa. Human Rights Watch questioned Dubai's story, and asked Dubai's authorities to reveal her location, adding: \\"[f]ailure to disclose the whereabouts and status of the princess could qualify as an enforced disappearance, given the evidence suggesting that she was last seen as UAE authorities were detaining her.\\" The UN OHCHR Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearance sought responses on allegations from the Governments of India and UAE. Ad-Diyaar, a mainstream Arab newspaper, also published calls by Human Rights Watch raising the issue that Sheikha Latifa had been forcibly hidden. Support groups also raised awareness of the campaign at the 2018 Kentucky Derby by flying a banner saying \\"DUBAI, WHERE IS PRINCESS LATIFA?\\". The first reaction from the UAE on the matter was unofficial and claimed the incident had been a foreign conspiracy and attempted to discredit those helping Sheikha Latifa using an anonymous Dubai source. The UAE-controlled media began reporting extensively about the social activities of her half-sister with the same name, who serves as Vice Chairman of Dubai Culture & Arts Authority (Dubai Culture). Many news outlets reported show jumper Sheikha Latifah bint Ahmed bin Juma Al Maktoum as missing, due to similarity in names. The Indian government was widely criticised for its extrajudicial outreach, citing national interests and disregard of formal legal process. Indian media reported that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his advisers were directly involved in giving the orders for interception at the request of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and didn't seek any formal request from UAE. An Indian Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson claimed that \\"[n]o such incident has been brought to our notice.\\" Deputy Commandant Avinandan Mitra of the Indian Coast Guard, in response to media queries about this incident near the Indian coastline, said that \\"we have no such information or operation.\\" Indian Intelligence agencies said they were trying to verify the claims but had no further comment. On 2 January 2019, Minister of State for External Affairs V. K. Singh denied any involvement of Indian Government in repatriation of emirati princess while replying to a question raised by member of parliament Saugata Roy. Similarly, the Finnish government was criticised for not raising concerns about a human rights violation of one of their citizens to Indian authorities. A day later, the Finnish Minister of Foreign Affairs, Timo Soini, responded, saying Finland had been in correspondence with UAE and Indian officials about the issue outside of media. Amnesty International, on 4 September 2018, released a public statement appealing to the government of UAE to disclose the whereabouts of Sheikha Latifa and uphold its international legal obligations, while also calling upon the Indian government to investigate any role of its security forces and officials involved in the raid on Nostromo and unlawful excesses that may have been committed. On 6 December 2018, the release of the BBC Two documentary Escape from Dubai: The Mystery of the Missing Princess elicited the first official response on the matter from the Dubai royal court in the form of a brief statement saying that Latifa was safe at home. The documentary covered the escape attempt that Sheikha Latifa had spent seven years planning and also looking into a similar attempt by her sister Shamsa in 2000. In January 2019, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum's wife, Princess Haya al-Hussein of Jordan, half-sister of King Abdullah II of Jordan, spoke in defense of Dubai's treatment of Sheikha Latifa. After news reports of Princess Haya's alleged separation with Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, human rights campaigners called on Princess Haya to speak out on her stepdaughter Latifa’s fate in Dubai. The matter was referred to the United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions by Guernica 37, a London-based law firm representing Latifa and her two friends. Chairman- rapporteur, Bernard Duhaime of the UN's working group on enforced or involuntary disappearances wrote to Dubai's royal family requesting evidence that Latifa was alive and the grounds on which she was being held captive or else they would have to make a public statement.  Mary Robinson's visit  On 24 December 2018, three low-resolution photographs taken on 15 December 2018, showing Sheikha Latifa alongside Mary Robinson, the former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, were released by UAE authorities. According to Mary Robinson, the meeting was arranged by one of the wives of Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Princess Haya, and described Latifa in a BBC Radio 4 interview as a \\"troubled young woman\\" and claiming that she regretted making the earlier video in which she alleged abuse. The comments were criticised by various rights groups and Detained in Dubai's head Radha Stirling for reciting Dubai's official version of the events \\"almost verbatim\\". Human rights groups and associates of Sheikha Latifa questioned the nature of the brief visit, calling for independent investigation and assessment of her situation and disputing suggestions of any psychiatric problems and reiterating the possibility of her being held under captivity.  2019 Court proceedings  In December 2019, a UK family court ruled that — on the balance of probabilities — Sheikh Mohammed orchestrated the abductions of Sheikha Latifa and Sheikha Shamsa and subjected Princess Haya to a campaign of \\"intimidation\\"; the findings were published in March 2020.Re Al M [2019 EWHC 3415 (Fam)] ==Controversy== In May 2018, Helene Jaubert, ex-wife of former French Navy officer Hervé Jaubert told The Daily Beast that Jaubert and Radha Stirling had been in contact with Latifa for five years, and invented the scheme together: \\"The whole plan was for Hervé to help her escape and once he got her out the daughter was going to get to the dad and say 'I want $3 million or else I'll tell all to the media'. It was a con. It's a corrupt scheme gone haywire\\". According to Stirling, Latifa phoned her from the boat in the middle of the ambush, saying she feared for her life and \\"was hearing gunshots\\". Latifa made the call via WhatsApp and evidence of the call was provided to authorities in the United States and the United Kingdom and made available to reporters. However, The Daily Beast looked to discredit this by pointing out that a satellite phone is normally needed to call from their alleged location in the Indian Ocean. However it was quickly established that the Nostromo was outfitted with satellite phone. In August 2019, Tiina Jauhiainen gave her version of events to on-line magazine Insider. ==AncestryReferences *Free Latifa website * * * Category:1985 births Category:2010s missing person cases Category:Emirati people of Algerian descent Category:Emirati princesses Category:India–United Arab Emirates relations Latifa Category:Missing person cases in Asia Category:Women from Dubai Category:Living people ","title":"Latifa bint Mohammed Al Maktoum (II)"},{"id":"56913410","text":"Magdalena Birkner (born 18 January 1966) is an Argentine alpine skier.

He was born in the Bronx, New York City, where he spent his childhood. He is one of 3 children, having a younger sister Carol and an older brother Arthur, also a biochemist. He obtained his high school diploma from the Bronx High School of Science and a B.S. degree, majoring in chemistry, from the City College of New York (1953). Upon graduation, he was recruited by Dr. Sidney Udenfriend to the National Heart Institute of National Institutes of Health (NIH) to enter a new joint graduate program between the NIH and George Washington University. He received his Ph.D. from George Washington University (Thesis: Studies on 5-Hydroxyindole Metabolism, 1957) based on research done at the NIH in the Udenfriend laboratory. In 1958 the NIH supported his postdoctoral studies done with Dr. H.A. Barkerhttps://www.nap.edu/read/10992/chapter/2 at the University of California at Berkeley, where he was involved in the discovery of the coenzyme form of vitamin B12. In 1959 he returned to the NIH as an independent investigator where he continued his studies on the role of vitamin B12 in methionine biosynthesis, research that helped to elucidate the known inter-relationship among vitamin 12, folic acid and one carbon metabolism. The studies on methionine synthesis led to his collaboration with the Nirenberg laboratory at the NIH shortly after the genetic code was cracked. By 1967 the Weissbach laboratory was deeply involved in protein synthesis (translation) at which time he accepted a position as Associate Director of the RIMB to help found the Roche Institute of Molecular Biology (RIMB) with Sidney Udenfriend, and in 1983 he became Director of the RIMB and a Vice-President of Research at Hoffmann- La Roche, Nutley, NJ. The RIMB was involved in the very early days of the emergence of the biotechnology industry and was instrumental in helping Hoffmann-La Roche enter this field. Weissbach described this period at Roche in a book he co-authored with David Fisher in 2016 titled “A Camelot of the Biomedical Sciences: The Story of the Roche Institute of Molecular Biology”. After the RIMB closed, in 1997 he accepted a position as Distinguished Research Professor at Florida Atlantic University (FAU) REFF, where he founded, and was Director, of the Center for Molecular Biology and Biotechnology http://www.science.fau.edu/cmbb/index.php (CMBB) for 20 years. In 2017 he was appointed Distinguished Research Professor Emeritus at FAU. His most recent research has involved understanding the mechanisms that cells use to protect against oxidative damage, based on the observation that cells have a mechanism to protect against oxidative damage to methionine residues in proteins ==Notable awards== * Election to the National Academy of Sciences (1982–Present)http://www.nasonline.org/member-directory/members/49275.html * 300 most cited authors (1961-1976), Current Content July 10, 1978 * Superior Service Award of the Department of Health Education and Welfare (1968) * American Chemical Society Enzyme Award (1970) * Townsend Harris Medal of the City College of New York Alumni Association (1988)https://www.ccnyalumni.org/about-us/distinguished-alumni/nominate-for- awards-medals/20-about-us/distinguished-alumni/medalists-and- awardees/townsend-harris-medalists/83-the-townsend-harris-medalist * George Washington University Distinguished Alumni Award (1994) * Member of the American Academy of Microbiology (1997) * Charter Fellow of the National Academy of inventors (2012) ==Notes== Category:1932 births Category:American biochemists Category:American molecular biologists Category:The Bronx High School of Science alumni Category:Columbian College of Arts and Sciences alumni Category:City College of New York alumni Category:Living people Category:Scientists from the Bronx ","title":"Herbert Weissbach (biochemist)"},{"id":"56913424","text":"Plínio Marcos da Silva (born 31 August 1984), simply known as Plínio, is a Brazilian footballer who plays for Uberlândia as a defender. ==Career statistics== {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"State League !colspan=\\"2\\"Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Continental !colspan=\\"2\\"Other !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - valign=\\"center\\"Guarani 2009 Série B colspan=\\"2\\"—120colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—120 - valign=\\"center\\"América–RN 2009 Série B 70colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—70 - valign=\\"center\\"ASA 2010 Série B 320colspan=\\"2\\"—40colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—360 - valign=\\"center\\"Fortaleza 2011 Série C colspan=\\"2\\"—16130colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—191 - valign=\\"center\\"Anapolina 2011 Série D 40colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—40 - rowspan=\\"5\\" valign=\\"center\\"Caldense 2012 rowspan=\\"3\\"Mineiro colspan=\\"2\\"—20colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—20 - 2013 colspan=\\"2\\"—20colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—20 - 2014 colspan=\\"2\\"—10030colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—130 - 2015 Série D colspan=\\"2\\"—121colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—121 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Subtotal !colspan=\\"2\\"—!!26!!1!!3!!0!!colspan=\\"2\\"—!!colspan=\\"2\\"—!!29!!1 - valign=\\"center\\"Marcílio Dias 2013 Série D 20colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—20 - valign=\\"center\\"Sampaio Corrêa 2015 Série B 222colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—222 - rowspan=\\"3\\" valign=\\"center\\"Botafogo–PB 2016 rowspan=\\"2\\"Série C 160colspan=\\"2\\"—72colspan=\\"2\\"—6Appearance(s) in Copa do Nordeste0292 - 2017 160colspan=\\"2\\"—10colspan=\\"2\\"—30200 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Subtotal !32!!0!!colspan=\\"2\\"—!!8!!2!!colspan=\\"2\\"—!!9!!0!!49!!2 - valign=\\"center\\"Botafogo–SP 2018 Série C colspan=\\"2\\"—130colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—130 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Career total !99!!2!!67!!2!!18!!2!!0!!0!!9!!0!!193!!6 } ==References * Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Campeonato Brasileiro Série B players Category:Campeonato Brasileiro Série C players Category:Campeonato Brasileiro Série D players Category:Sociedade Esportiva Matsubara players Category:Grêmio Esportivo Juventus players Category:Esporte Clube Novo Hamburgo players Category:Clube de Regatas Brasil players Category:Guarani FC players Category:América Futebol Clube (RN) players Category:Agremiação Sportiva Arapiraquense players Category:Fortaleza Esporte Clube players Category:Associação Atlética Anapolina players Category:Associação Atlética Caldense players Category:Goiânia Esporte Clube players Category:Clube Náutico Marcílio Dias players Category:Sampaio Corrêa Futebol Clube players Category:Botafogo Futebol Clube (PB) players Category:Botafogo Futebol Clube (SP) players ","title":"Plínio Marcos da Silva"},{"id":"56913426","text":"Geraldina Bobbio (born 20 August 1967) is an Argentine alpine skier.

Alwi first went to school at Madrasah Al-Manshuriyah Jembatan Lima, Tambora, founded by Muhammad Mansur. After one year in Al-Manshuriyah, he then continued his studies at the Madrasah Ibtidaiyah Al-Ittihad which only lasted for 4 years due to acceleration classes. After graduating from madrasah ibtidaiyah in 1980, he continued his education at madrasah tsanawiyah and madrasah aliyah Pondok Pesantren Tebu Ireng, Jombang until graduate in 1986. It was in Tebu Ireng that he started his organizational activities, such as become the head of OSIS, vice chairman of Indonesian Islamic Student Tebu Ireng, until become a campaigner of United Development Party in 1981. After 6 years as a student at Tebu Ireng, he continued his studies at IAIN Syarif Hidayatullah (now Syarif Hidayatullah State Islamic University Jakarta) majoring in Comparative Religion, Ushuluddin faculty, while deepening some kitab kuning to Habib Muhsin Al Attas Petamburan and Kyai Hajji Muhammad Syafi'i Hadzami. He graduated at IAIN Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta in 1991. ===Personal life=== In 1994, Alwi married Laila Nurlaila Bajri who was a friend of his sister. From his marriage to Laila, he was blessed with three children, Muhammad Husein bin Ali bin Thohir (b. 1995), Ali Zainal Abidin bin Ali bin Thohir (b. 1999), and Muhammad al-Baqir bin Ali bin Thohir. ==Political career== In the Post-Suharto era of 1998, starting from Abdurrahman Wahid's invitation to join the National Awakening Party he founded, Alwi was later joined the party and was elected Chairman of the Executive Council of PKB Tangerang Regency.

Sano family in Pregi village, Lengkong Wetan, Serpong, South Tangerang. The pesantren was built in October 1991. In the beginning, the pesantren was named Pesantren Nur As-Sholihat under the name of the foundation founded by Syarifah Alawiyah bint Thohir (Alwi's sister) in Kota Bambu, Palmerah, West Jakarta. However, a few years later, the name of the pesantren was changed to Pondok Pesantren Modern Al-Husainy. At the beginning of the stand, in the pesantren also built kindergartens and madrasah diniyah. Then throughout the years 1993-1994, then founded boarding house, madrasah tsanawiyah, until madrasah aliyah. On March 7, 1994, Alwi and his sister Syarifah Alawiyah bint Thohir went to a notary to formally record the establishment of the Pondok Pesantren Modern Al-Husainy under the auspices of the Nur As-Sholihat Foundation. At first the curriculum taught in pesantren only includes religious education, but over time there is the addition of general education to the curriculum of pesantren. Due to the expansion of residential land that occurred around the boarding school, now Pondok Pesantren Modern Al-Husainy is in the middle of the planned community of Bumi Serpong Damai, South Tangerang. ===Da'wah=== Alwi began actively doing tausiyah in several mosques when a student at Pondok Pesantren Tebu Ireng between 1982-1983. While studying in Jakarta, he actively counseling campus dakwah institutions at the University of Indonesia, National University, Borobudur University, government and private institutions, to attend various lecture competitions. In 1989, Alwi won a national-level speech contest at the Ibn Sina da'wah institution, Jakarta, beating out other participants such as Muhammad Arifin Ilham who occupied the 2nd position. Alwi's da'wah soul has grown from a young age, so he is often invited to lecture in various places in Jakarta, even outside areas such as Cirebon, Tegal, Pekalongan, Banyuwangi, Banjarmasin, Aceh, Kutai, Batam, Padang, even to Merauke, Papua. Method of da'wah The method Alwi uses in preaching is with pay attention to rhetoric, dawah with pay attention to rhetoric is exposing a religious problem and then people feel involved with the problem being described. He argues, that the rhetoric in preaching is a language skill or art of speaking in the presence of others with a systematic and logical verbal to provide understanding and convince others.

He was affiliated with the Action Group and Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN) during the First and Second Republic respectively. As a member of UPN and a later NPN in Ibadan during the second republic, Adelakun was an important figure in the turbulent politics of the city. Adelakun's father was a cocoa farmer from Ibadan and he inherited his father's farm upon the death of the latter. When he began his first political activities, it was to represent his father during meetings of the Ibadan Peoples Party. From there Adelakun joined the Action Group, it was an arduous task for the party to gain support in Ibadan due to the popularity of a single man, Adegoke Adelabu, even after Adelabu's death AG did not gain much support in Ibadan and violence that sprung out after the death of Adelabu targeted many of the party's members. A schism in AG between the regional Premier, Akintola and former premier, Awolowo emerged in 1962. Adelakun sided the Awolowo faction. Thereafter, Adelakun's faction was weakened in Ibadan during a chaotic period in the Western region. After a military coup dissolved the democratic republic, Adelakun returned to farming and also joined a farmer's union, becoming its president. In 1976, he won the local government elections in Ibadan after a few setbacks which included an initial disqualification. After he was initially disqualified from contesting the election, Adelakun's supporters boycotted the election, while he went to court to declare the election null and void. The court accepted his plea and after the new election was conducted, Adelakun was declared winner. In 1979, Adelakun teamed up with another party leader, Archdeacon Emmanuel Alayande to help UPN clinch majority of votes in Ibadan, it was one of the few times an Awolowo led party was able to win majority votes in the city. In 1979, he was appointed commissioner of local government in Oyo State, two years after, he was redeployed to the Health ministry. In 1983, Adelakun joined a faction that was opposed to the candidacy of Bola Ige as UPN governor. Adelakun and another member of the faction, Sunday Afolabi later joined the opposition party, NPN which went on to win the governorship election in 1983.

In a slightly revised version it was reproduced in the illustrated almanac Stoglav in 1889, in Saint Petersburg. It was also included in the collection Detvora (Детвора, Children, St Petersburg, 1889). Chekhov included it into volume two of his Collected Works published by Adolf Marks in 1899-1901. During its author's lifetime, the story was translated into Danish, Serbo-Croatian, German, French and Czech languages.Commentaries to Беглец // Чехов А. П. Полное собрание сочинений и писем: В 30 т.

The doctor initially seems to him a grim and dangerous man, whose wont is to chide people around him, including his own mother, who'd been neglecting her son's trouble for half a year, until the infection has spread into an elbow joint, so that the arm now was in danger of amputation. The doctor decides that Pashka needs an operation, and suggests that he stays hospital. The boy finds the hospital a rich ground for investigation, full of surprises. First he is served a gorgeous dinner, the likes of which he'd never seen in his life. Then he ventures into his surroundings and discovers a host of very strange people in the neighboring wards, each of whom is apparently ill, but in their own, peculiar way. One man, Mikhaylo, lies with a bag of ice on his head, without moving. Overwhelmed by his impressions, Pashka dozes off. The boy is awaken by a noise and leaves his bed. He sees three figures in the corridor trying to drag somebody through next ward's door, and recognizes the dead body as that of Mikhaylo. Horrified, he rushes out of the hospital in panic. He runs around in the dark, finally falls unconscious at the porch… When he comes to, it is broad daylight. He is inside, and the doctor's voice reproaches him for his silliness. ==Reception== \\"The Runaway\\" was one of Lev Tolstoy's favourite stories. \\"Father greatly enjoyed a little story by Chekhov in the Stoglav almanac and he read it aloud more than once,\\" Tatyana Tolstaya informed her brother Sergey in the 6 February 1889 letter.

Crudden is a Canadian chemist. She is a Canada Research Chair in Metal Organic Chemistry at Queen's University at Kingston. == Education == Crudden earned a Bachelors of Science at the University of Toronto in 1989, working with Mark Lautens, with whom she went on to complete her master's degree. She moved to University of Ottawa for her PhD, working under the supervision of Howard Alper, which she completed in 1995. == Research and career == Crudden was appointed a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council postdoctoral fellow at University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign working with Scott E. Denmark in 1995. She moved to University of New Brunswick in 1996 where she started her own research group. In 2002, she was appointed a Queen's National Scholar and moved her research lab to Kingston, Ontario. Crudden was the first to identify an enantiospecific Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction of chiral boranes. In 2014 she designed more stable nitrogen-based self-assembled monolayer treatments for metal surfaces. The N-heterocyclic carbene self-assembled monolayers can be used in a range of applications, including biosensors. Her interests lie in hydroboration, organometallic chemistry, chiral materials and persistent carbenes. In 2010 Crudden became head of a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council CREATE award in chiral materials, worth $1.6 million. She became President of the Canadian Society of Chemistry. In 2015 she, as Principal Investigator of a group of ten collaborators, was awarded $8.8 million from the Canada Foundation for Innovation for major infrastructure purchases. She won the Queen's University Research Opportunities Fund, which she used to create inexpensive, sensitive biosensors. Her group prepares carbon-based ligands for metal surfaces, which can be used as sensing systems based on surface plasmon resonance. In 2016, she and Dr. Suning Wang held a trilateral Canada-Japan- Germany symposium at Queen's looking at Elements Functions for Transformative Catalysis and Materials. Crudden is a joint Professor at the Institute of Transformative Bio-Molecules, based out of Nagoya University in Japan, where she runs a satellite lab. She is one of only four international collaborators at this Institute. She was recognised as having made the most distinguished contribution to the field of catalysis by the Chemical Institute of Canada in 2018, when they awarded her the Catalysis Award. Crudden also often comments on developments in the field of organic chemistry in various media outlets. === Awards === * 2020 Royal Society of Canada * 2019 Montreal Medal * 2019 American Chemical Society Arthur C.

After his immigrant father suffered a stroke, Slonim's mother was left to tend to her husband and three children. She and her children boarded at Jewish Orphanage and Children's Aid of Western Canada, where she was the cook. In his memoir Grand to Be an Orphan, Slonim recalled that while the Orphanage offered educational opportunities, some of the staff also dished out beatings. ==Education== With Orphanage support, Slonim studied at a yeshivah in Chicago and attended the Illinois Institute of Technology, where he received his B.S.A.S. in 1933. He then attended the Jewish Theological Seminary, where he was ordained and earned an M.H.L. in 1937. He also attended the Albany Law School, New York, between 1935 and 1937. ==Community activism== Slonim held a variety of community positions, including president of the Toronto Zionist Council (1947–52) and chair of the Synagogue Council State of Israel Bonds (1955–60). Slonim grew angry, however, over the policies of the State of Israel and what he perceived as the uncritical support of Israel within the Jewish community. ==Journalism== In 1955 The Toronto Telegram hired Slonim as associate editor on the Middle East. Until the newspaper's demise in 1971 and later in the Jewish Standard, Slonim often attacked Orthodox influence on Israeli politics and Israel's treatment of Palestinians. He also championed Israeli withdrawal from occupied territories and strongly opposed the 1982 Lebanon war. ==Rabbi== In 1937 he became rabbi at Toronto's McCaul Street Synagogue, one of the first Canadian-born rabbis to serve a Conservative congregation, and he remained there for three years. For the next seven years he occupied pulpits in Cleveland and Troy (n.y.) before returning to Toronto in 1947 to serve the McCaul Street Synagogue until its 1955 merger with the University Avenue Synagogue. He was not named to the senior position in the newly established Beth Tzedec Congregation.In 1960, Slonim was hired by a small and unaffiliated liberal Toronto congregation, Congregation Habonim Toronto, established in the spirit of German Liberal Judaism, by central European Holocaust survivors. Slonim attracted younger, Canadian-born congregants but, to the consternation of some, he also used his pulpit to condemn Israeli policy. After the war in Lebanon, he was dismissed. He described his time as a pulpit rabbi in To Kill a Rabbi (1987). Slonim never at any time expressed anger at the Jewish community where his views were unpopular. He subsequently co-founded the Association for the Living Jewish Spirit, which until 1999 met on High Holidays. ==Later life== Towards the end of his life, Slonim received belated recognition from the Jewish community. Rabbi Gunther Plaut, who had often been at loggerheads with Slonim, later admitted that Slonim was unjustly ostracized by the Jewish community and regretted his own part in the process. In 1998, the Jewish Theological Seminary honored Slonim for his years of service. Slonim died January 20, 2000, at his home, a victim of a stroke and Alzheimer’s disease. He was 85. He had been in ill health for the past year, according to his daughter, Rena Tsur. His wife, Reta, predeceased him by six years. ==Other writing== In addition to his two memoirs, Slonim published In the Steps of Pope Paul (1965), an account of Pope Paul's visit to the Middle East; Both Sides Now (1972) summarizing his career at the Toronto Telegram, and Family Quarrel: The United Church and the Jews (1977) chronicling disputes over Israel between the Jewish community and the United Church. ==References== Category:2000 deaths Category:Illinois Institute of Technology alumni Category:Albany Law School alumni Category:Canadian Conservative rabbis Category:1914 births ","title":"Reuben Slonim"},{"id":"56913902","text":"Trinidad and Tobago Ship Quinam Damen Group, a Dutch shipbuilding firm, has a record for designing a range of patrol vessels, the Damen Stan patrol vessels, that includes the Damen Stan 5009 patrol vessel.

Animal cognition is largely studied by observing behavior, which makes studying extinct species difficult. The definition of cognition varies by discipline; psychologists tend define cognition by human behaviors, while ethologists have widely varying definitions. Ethological definitions of cognition range from only considering cognition in animals to be behaviors exhibited in humans, while others consider anything action involving a nervous system to be cognitive. == Methods of study == Studying the evolution of cognition is accomplished through a comparative cognitive approach where a cognitive ability and comparing it between closely related species and distantly related species. For example, a researcher may want to analyze the connection between spatial memory and food caching behavior. By examining two closely related animals (chickadees and jays) and/or two distantly related animals (jays and chipmunks), hypotheses could be generated about when and how this cognitive ability evolved. == Animals with high levels of cognition == Higher cognitive processes have evolved in many closely and distantly related animals. Some of these examples are considered convergent evolution, while others most likely shared a common ancestor that possessed higher cognitive function. For example, apes humans, and cetaceans most likely had a common ancestor with high levels of cognition, and as these species diverged they all possessed this trait. Corvids (the crow family) and apes show similar cognitive abilities in some areas such as tool use. This ability is most likely an example of convergent evolution, due to their distant relatedness. *Humans possess possibly the highest level of cognitive function on earth. Some examples of their cognitive function include: high levels of motivation, self awareness, problem solving, language, culture, and many more. *Cetaceans (dolphins and orcas) have shown higher levels of cognition including: problem solving, tool use, and self recognition. *Hyenas live in highly cognitive social groups. Hyenas have also demonstrated the behavior of feigning death to avoid conflicts with predators. *Apes have shown cognitive abilities such as: problem solving, tool use, communication, language, theory of mind, culture, and many more. *Canids have shown high level cognitive abilities such as: object permanence, social learning, and episodic memory. *Elephants display many high cognitive behaviors, including those associated with grief, learning, mimicry, play, altruism, tool use, compassion, cooperation, *Corvids demonstrates many high functioning cognitive abilities such as: problem solving, spatial temporal memory, mental time travel, and a particularly wide variety of tool usage. *Parrots have displayed cognitive functions such as: tool use, problem solving, and mimicry of human speech. == Selection favoring cognition  Social living === Social living is thought to have co-evolved with higher cognitive processes. It is hypothesized that higher cognitive function evolved to mitigate the negative effects of living in social groups. For example, the ability to recognize individual groups members could solve the problem of cheating behavior. If individuals within the group can keep track of the cheaters, then they can punish or exclude them from the group. There is also a positive correlation between relative brain size and aspects of sociality in some species There are many benefits to living in social groups such as division of labor and protect, but in order to reap these benefits the animals tend to possess high levels of cognition. === Sex, mating, and relationships === Many animals have complex mating rituals require higher levels of cognition to evaluate. Birds are well known for their intense mating displays including swan dances that can last hours or even days. Higher levels of cognition may have evolved to facilitate the formation of longer lasting relationships. Animals that form pair bonds and share parental responsibilities produce offspring that are more likely to survive and reproduce, which increases the fitness of these individuals. The cognitive requirements for this type of mating include the ability the differentiate individuals from their group and resolve social conflicts. === Finding, extracting, and protecting food === Another hypothesis for the evolution of cognition is that cognition allowed individuals access to food and resources that were previously unavailable. For example, the genetic mutation for color vision allowed for a greatly increased efficiency in finding and foraging fruit. Food caching behavior displayed in some birds and mammals is an example of a behavior that may have co-evolved with higher cognitive processes. This ability to store food for later consumption allows these animals to take advantage of temporary surpluses in food availability. Corvids have displayed incredible abilities to create and remember the locations of up to hundreds of caches. In addition, there is evidence that this is not just an instinctual behavior, but an example of future planning. Jays have been found to diversify the types of food they cache, possible indicating they understand the need to eat a variety of food. Some supporters of this hypothesis suggest that higher cognitive processes require a large brain to body ratio. This higher brain to body size ratio in turn requires a large metabolic input to function. The idea is that the two processes (greater access to food and the brain's growing need for energy) may have snowballed the evolution of these two features. === Technology, tools, innovation, and culture === The cognitive ability to use tools and pass information from one generation to the next is thought to have been a driving force of the evolution of cognition. Many animals use tools including: primates, elephants, cetaceans, birds, fish, and some invertebrates. Tool use varies widely depending on the species. For example, sea otters have been observed using a rock to break open snail shells, while primates and New Caledonian crows have demonstrated an ability to fashion a new tool for a specific use. The ability to use tools seems to provide animals with a fitness advantage, usually in the form of access to food previously unavailable, which allows a competitive advantage for these individuals. Some animals have demonstrated the ability to pass information from one generation to the next (culture) including: primates, cetaceans, and birds. Primates and birds can pass information of specific tool use strategies on to their offspring who can, in turn, pass it on to their offspring. In this way, the information can remain in a group on individuals even after the original users are gone. One famous example of this is in a group of macaque monkeys in Japan. Researchers studying this species observed these monkeys feeding behavior in a population in Japan. The researchers witnessed one female, named Imo, realize that by washing potatoes in the nearby river you could remove much more sand and dirt then by simply wiping it off. Over the next few generations the researcher saw this behavior begin to appear in other individuals throughout the group. == See also == * Animal Cognition * Anthropomorphism * Bird intelligence * Cetacean intelligence * Cephalopod intelligence * Deception in animals * Dog intelligence * Fish intelligence * Human-animal communication * Theory of mind in animals * g factor in non- humans == References == Category:Cognition ","title":"Evolution of cognition"},{"id":"56913991","text":"Agelanthus rondensis is a species of hemiparasitic plant in the family Loranthaceae.

The Sabana Grande district is divided into several middle class neighborhoods located in the Parroquia El Recreo of the Libertador Municipality, in the geographical center of the Metropolitan District of Caracas and owes its name to the old town of Sabana Grande. == History of Sabana Grande  Foundation and early years === Originally, the area where today stands the commercial and financial sector Sabana Grande, was an agricultural town in which there were some coffee plantations, such as Hacienda Ibarra, which extended to the Central University of Venezuela and part of the neighborhoods Colinas de Bello Monte and Las Mercedes. At first, the town of Sabana Grande was connected to the agricultural community of Chacao. Hacienda Ibarra was expropriated during the government of Isaías Medina Angarita to modernize the city and part of the previous house is still conserved in the campus of the Central University of Venezuela. The main house of this hacienda was located in Bello Monte of the financial district Sabana Grande, and this house no longer exists. The town of Sabana Grande was the communication route between Caracas to the large plantations (haciendas) located on the outskirts of the city. Although PDVSA La Estancia has done a research, they have no consensus on the date of foundation of Parroquia El Recreo. Some say that around 1852, the area was elevated to a foreign parish by the Caracas authorities, which served to overcome its status as a hamlet, given the significant number of inhabitants and buildings.Hernández V, José G. Anécdotas Hípicas Venezolanas presenta Sabana Grande: Cuna del Hipismo en Venezuela (1895–1896) Others say that, Parroquia El Recreo was created on November 22, 1864 and not in 1852. According to the historian Manuel Landaeta Rosales (1847-1920), El Recreo was founded on November 22, 1952 as a civil parish. Later, on February, 22, 1964, it was founded as an ecclesiastical parish. On November 4, 1870, the area was integrated into the city of Caracas by the Caracas authorities in the government of Antonio Guzmán Blanco and was named \\"The Immaculate Conception and San Jose del Recreo\\" by the presbyter Jose Botel Peraza. Over time, Sabana Grande became a popular summer destination for college students and that's why the area was known as \\"El Recreo\\". Sabana Grande was definitively separated from Chacao when it was annexed as the eastern parish of Caracas. === 19th century === Towards the end of the 19th century, the Hippodrome of Sabana Grande (Las Delicias area), run by the Jockey Club of Caracas, operated in the area, and its executives included the prominent artist Arturo Michelena. This hippodrome was the first in Caracas and worked in the area until 1906 when the racecourse was moved to El Paraíso neighborhood.Veloso Saad, José. 1976: La Caracas de aquellos tiempos.

Oficina de las Repúblicas Americanas. 1993: Venezuela 1899. Ediciones de la Presidencia de la República. Caracas. 279p. This important commercial district of Caracas also had the first two commercial centers of Caracas: The East Shopping Center (on Casanova Avenue) and The Gran Avenida, formerly known as Fifth Avenue Shopping Center. The first one is still open on \\"Avenida Casanova\\" and the second one was located at the exit of the Metro Plaza Venezuela, where the bus stop to San Antonio de Los Altos is located. The East Sabana Grande Shopping Center was built by the architect Diego Carbonell, with a ring of shops around a central parking lot separate from the street, which meant that some stores had double access. === Caracas Metro === In the eighties, the construction of Sabana Grande station of Caracas Metro brought more people to the financial district of Sabana Grande. Since then, Sabana Grande became a place of mass recreation. The financial district of Sabana Grande has three metro stations: Plaza Venezuela, Sabana Grande and Chacaíto. This district is the best covered by the Caracas Metro. The boulevard of Sabana Grande was built from the surroundings of \\"La Previsora Tower\\" to the Plaza Brión de Chacaíto. The Plaza Brión de Chacaíto was built according to the commercial and financial district of Sabana Grande, despite belonging to Chacao Municipality today. As a result of the problems of authority between the Caracas Metro and the Libertador Municipality, the Sabana Grande district lost maintenance and surveillance in the 1990s. In 1994, the Caracas Metro finally granted the administration of the Boulevard of Sabana Grande to the Libertador Municipality of Caracas. == See also == *Boulevard of Sabana Grande *Altamira (Caracas) *City Market Shopping Mall *El Rosal, Caracas *Las Mercedes (district in Caracas) *Libertador Municipality == References  External links == * Youtube: Sabana Grande in 1987 * The administrative division of the Libertador Municipality of Caracas (includes the zoning plans of the Sabana Grande district) * Sabana Grande Online – Listado de comercios, Imágenes y noticias acerca del boulevard * Boulevard de Sabana Grande diagnóstico integral para su rehabilitación * Proyecto de Rehabilitación Integral Bulevar de Sabana Grande * El Nacional: Narran las historias mínimas de Sabana Grande Emyly Avendaño. 24 de marzo de 2013 * Youtube: Antes y ahora en el Bulevar de Sabana Grande (Caracas – Venezuela) Category:Neighbourhoods of Caracas Category:Shopping malls in Venezuela Category:Tourist attractions in Caracas Category:Buildings and structures in Caracas ","title":"Sabana Grande, Caracas"},{"id":"56914050","text":"Italy competed at the 2003 World Championships in Athletics in Paris, France from 6 to 14 August 2005. The nation sent a delegation of 49 athletes (27 men and 22 women) and won one medal at the competition. Alex Schwazer was the bronze medallist in the men's 50 kilometres race walk and he achieved a national record of 3:41:54 hours in the process. It was an unexpected medal, as Schwazer knocked nearly twenty minutes off his previous best that year.Kirdyapkin walks tall to 50km title. IAAF (2005-08-12). Retrieved 2018-03-20.

The building was developed by Irwin Molasky's company, The Molasky Group. Construction began in 2005, and the building was topped off in July 2006, before opening in August 2007. The Molasky Corporate Center is a green building designed with energy efficient features which earned it a Gold certification from the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). The Southern Nevada Water Authority is a major tenant in the building, and owns five of the building's office floors. ==History== In December 2004, developer Irwin Molasky was planning a $75 million office building in downtown Las Vegas through his company, The Molasky Group. The project, known as Parkway Center, would be located on property at the intersection of Grand Central Parkway and F Street (later renamed City Parkway), directly south of Highway 95 and Interstate 15. The vacant property was worth $2 million, and the city gave Molasky the land on the condition that he use it for the construction of extensive office space to generate substantial property taxes for the city. The 14 ½-story building would include a 6 ½-story parking garage topped by eight floors of office space. The project, designed by Howard F. Thompson & Associates, would include of office space. Later in December 2004, the Southern Nevada Water Authority (SNWA) approved plans to lease at least five floors of office space in the building, totaling , with the option to lease further space in the future. SNWA would be the first major tenant in the new building, which would become SNWA's new headquarters. Molasky's company would be headquartered on the top floor, and discussions were underway with other tenants interested in leasing the remaining office space not used by SNWA, which signed a 20-year, $63.3 million lease for seven floors in the new building, totaling . The lease included the option for SNWA to purchase the entire building at the end of its lease. Parkway Center was expected to open in 2007, and would be one of the largest office buildings in Las Vegas. The building was expected to generate $500,000 annually in property taxes for the city. In February 2005, The Molasky Group sold its 17-story Bank of America Plaza building in downtown Las Vegas for $72 million, which the company planned to use to finance other projects, including Parkway Center. Construction began in 2005, with Marnell Corrao as the general contractor. By April 2006, the project was known as the Molasky Corporate Center, with 16 stories planned. The building was topped off in July 2006. By October 2006, the 1,400-space parking garage was nearly complete. The Class A office building was 80 percent pre-leased up to that point. Notable tenants, in addition to SNWA, included the Las Vegas Valley Water District, Bank of Nevada, a Jason's Deli restaurant, and a 24 Hour Fitness gym. Construction was nearing completion in March 2007, by which point two major law firms had signed on as tenants: Ballard Spahr Andrews & Ingersoll; and Brownstein, Hyatt, Farber, Schreck. The building opened in August 2007, when the first SNWA employees began working in it. It was the first new office tower in downtown Las Vegas in nearly 40 years and it helped to revitalize the area. It is also the only building by Irwin Molasky to feature his name. The building, located at 100 City Parkway, was built at a cost of $107 million. In December 2007, SNWA approved plans to purchase five of the seven floors that it leased in the building, at a sale price of $34.6 million. SNWA had the option to gradually purchase remaining parts of the building over the next 15 years. In May 2012, SNWA approved a lease for its first tenant in of its unused office space, which would be occupied by a firm specializing in public relations and government affairs. SNWA had an additional of vacant space on its five floors. As of April 2015, the Molasky Corporate Center was the only Class A office building in the Las Vegas Valley with zero vacancy. ==Architecture== The Molasky Corporate Center is a 17-story green building and was designed with energy efficient features. Upon opening, it was Las Vegas' only Class A green office tower. The building includes of space, including of office space. The building is made of glass and steel, qualifying it as Class A office space. The building includes energy efficient glass solar panels that create electricity for the building, and air vents are situated on the floor instead of the ceiling, providing cleaner air to people inside. Chilled water used for the air conditioner is recaptured and used for the building's landscaping. The building's insulation consists of shredded, recycled blue jeans. The building was constructed with 97 percent recycled steel, and countertops in the building's retail area were made with 95 percent recycled steel and crushed glass. The building's office space includes special tiles that have computer and electrical outlets which can be moved around with ease. Much of the interior is lit by sunlight. At night, the building is lit with green accent lighting and a yellow crown. Initially, Molasky sought a Silver Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification for the building from the U.S. Green Building Council. Ultimately, the building received a Gold certification instead. As of 2007, the building was among approximately 200 in the world to receive the Gold certification. It was the first green office building in Las Vegas to receive a Gold rating. Between $5 million and $7 million was spent on the building to bring it up to Gold LEED standards, and as of 2007, the cost was not expected to be redeemed for 12 to 15 years. The building uses 35 percent less water and 37 percent less electricity in comparison to a similarly sized, non-LEED certified structure. In December 2007, footage of the building was filmed for a six-part PBS documentary about green buildings in Nevada. The building helped Nevada become the top U.S. state in 2011 for the construction of green buildings. In May 2014, judges for the Building Owners and Managers Association awarded the building The Outstanding Building of the Year (TOBY) Award, praising the building's environmental design features and writing that the building \\"is impressive\\" and \\"leaves no doubt to its quality. The staff is well-seasoned and experienced.\\" ==References *Official website Category:Buildings and structures in Las Vegas Category:Downtown Las Vegas Category:Office buildings in Nevada Category:Office buildings completed in 2007 Category:Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design gold certified buildings Category:2007 establishments in Nevada ","title":"Molasky Corporate Center"},{"id":"56914241","text":"rightPatrick Nordström (1870-1929) was a Swedish-Danish ceramist.

It was released on October 21, 2018. ==PlotOpening sequence=== The episode starts in Fogburyport, birthplace of Green Clam Chowder. The Simpson family arrive there because a book stated it's a place to visit before they die. However, it was revealed to be a trap and that they will be devoured by Cthulhu. However, Homer states that he was promised an oyster eating contest against Cthulhu, and Homer beats him. Cthulhu pukes and asks what Homer wants as a reward. Homer whispers \\"I want to eat you.\\" Cthulhu is seen in a giant cooking pot and the Simpsons (except Lisa) enjoy a hot dog made of Cthulhu's tentacles. ===Intrusion of the Pod-y Switchers=== The segment begins at the underwater base of Mapple, where Steve Mobbs (on a screen) tells about the new Myphone and the new unfunny version of himself to an excited audience. When everyone is on their phone, the unfunny Steve is revealed to be a plant alien on a mission. Now on the plant planet, they shoot spores to Earth (going right next to the Futurama ship with a cloth saying \\"BRING BACK FUTURAMA\\" and then getting blown up by The Orville). In Springfield, everyone turns into plant versions of themselves. The transformed citizens are transported to a utopian plant planet with no technology. The Plant People see the citizens with pods (Mapple products) and ask where they found those. Bart says they found it under the living Christmas tree. ===Multiplisa-ty=== After a sleepover at Milhouse's, Milhouse, Nelson, and Bart find themselves in a cell, trapped by Lisa, suffering from dissociative identity disorder (similar to James McAvoy's character from Split), then closes them in again after they do not ask for an encore on her performance. Lisa attacks and kills Milhouse and Nelson, before Bart asks her what happened to her to which Lisa tells the story: Bart grabbed Lisa's spelling test, changing her answers, mocking Miss Hoover and granting her a F. Lisa has a last change and gives Bart a last chance to save himself and he redeems himself, saving himself from being killed by trash, while Milhouse was transformed into a \\"paper boy\\". ===Geriatric Park=== In a parody of Jurassic Park, Mr. Burns opens up a Jurassic-themed retirement home, a park filled with elders rejuvenated mixing their DNA with dinosaurs. He brings Springfielders to the park, showing them the new \\"retirement home\\". At first they are all human, healthy and feeling young again, with incredible strength too. Once Homer raises the temperature after Grandpa complains about the temperature being too cold with Homer also quoting \\"I can't read, I'm on vacation\\" after seeing the warning sign, they transform into dinosaur versions of themselves. Visitors and Mr. Burns are killed by the elders, Agnes Skinner as a Ludodactylus eats off Principal Skinner's arm, Jasper as a Dilophosaurus bites off Kirk Van Houten's head, and the Simpson family are threatened by Grandpa and Jacqueline Bouvier (turned into an Indominus rex-like theropod and a Parasaurolophus respectively). Lisa courageously confronts Grandpa and find out they all just needed to be cherished and respected. In the end, the Simpson family escape alive and unharmed, though their helicopter is being flown on the back of the transformed Agnes. ==Reception== Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode 3 out of 5 points ranking, stating \\"Ultimately this is a disappointing Halloween installment, not horrifyingly though. We rely on The Simpsons' 'Treehouse of Horror' stories to be the high point of any season. They have consistently been immediate classics. But \\"XXIX\\" is only lukewarm. The series has been edging closer to the \\"clever\\" side of humor over the irreverently silly, and the laughs are increasingly muted. This episode hosts some of the largest creatures of the world of terror, dinosaurs and Cthulhu. It's a shame the laughs aren't bigger. Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C+ ranking, stating \\"It’s tempting after a dully serviceable outing like this to say it’s time to bury the ‘Treehouse of Horror’ concept as an unnecessary annual disappointment. But then you’d have to say that of the series itself, which, okay, some of you do. I’d maintain that The Simpsons’ decades-long role as pop cultural ‘not as good as it used to be’ punching bag could be reversed with some new creative blood in the form of those writers raised on The Simpsons who want nothing better than to jolt the lumbering comedy behemoth back to life. But, as the show plods on, it seems that that’s the one thing those in charge of the shambling enterprise are truly afraid of.\\" Jess Scheden of IGN gave the episode a 5.6 out of 10 points ranking, stating \\"It almost never feels like there's enough room for the writers to really take advantage of these horror parodies. The result is a lot of easy, surface level gags. More and more I find myself wondering if the series would be better off switching to an hour-long format or, better yet, devoting the entire special to one story.\\" “Treehouse of Horror XXIX” scored a 1.3 rating with a 6 share and was watched by 2.95 million viewers, making “The Simpsons” Fox’s highest rated show of the night. ==References * Category:2018 American television episodes Category:The Simpsons (season 30) episodes Category:Treehouse of Horror Category:Television programs directed by Matthew Faughnan ","title":"Treehouse of Horror XXIX"},{"id":"56914272","text":"Richard Joseph Devereux (1829–1883) was an Irish Liberal politician.

In 1630 the Muscovite government began to hire mercenary officers in Sweden, the Netherlands, and Scotland to train a new, \\"foreign formation force\\" (\\"inozemskii stroi\\") in the new tactics. Six regiments of infantry (\\"soldaty\\"), a regiment of heavy cavalry pistoleers (\\"reitary\\"), and a regiment of dragoons (\\"draguny\\") were formed from Muscovite peasant militiamen, Cossacks, service class cavalrymen and free volunteers from various social categories. Unlike the traditional formation troops, the new regiments were outfitted and salaried at treasury expense. == Formation == After the Smolensk War most, but not all of the expensive \\"foreign formation regiments\\" had been disbanded. A few thousand \\"foreign formation\\" infantry and dragoons had manned the Abatis Line, but in 1646 the government decided to make \\"foreign formation\\" units an important permanent element in the army. A number of officers were hired abroad, especially in the Netherlands; a \\"war manual\\" on the exercise of musket and pike was translated into Russian, to help in training Muscovite infantry; a new census was conducted to levy troops by household (one from every 20-100 homes); and Tsar Alexis placed thousands of \\"state serfs\\" along the border in standing service as ‘settled’ dragoons and infantry, drilled in their villages year-round under foreign officers. == Organization == During military reforms in 1648 four types of professional regiments were formed: * Reiters, recruited from noblemen and hereditary servicemen. Heavy cavalry, armed with carbines, pistols, and sabers. * Dragoons, recruited from Cossacks, Streltsy and peasants. Mounted infantry, armed with muskets, swords, and spears. * Infantry (\\"soldaty\\"), recruited from \\"state serfs\\". Musketeers were equipped the same as Streltsy(muskets and bardiches), with the addition of swords and helmets. Pikemen wore helmets and breastplates but were discarded after 1660. * Hussars emulated Polish Winged Hussars. Heavy cavalry, armed with pistols and lances. Reiters and Hussars wore Western-style armor, at first imported, but after 1654 manufactured in Tula. == Combat Service == During Russo-Polish War (1654–1667), the number of the foreign formation troops grew (7 percent of the Muscovite army in 1651, 79 percent in 1663). With the exception of the better-trained Reiter regiments, the \\"soldat\\" infantry was still of limited use on the battlefield. More importantly, though, these infantry regiments were conscripted from serfs and commoners, so it was easier to rebuild them than damaged units of traditional hereditary servitors-Landed cavalry and Streltsy. == References == Category:Regiments of the Russian Federation ","title":"New Order Regiments"},{"id":"56914372","text":"Condate angulina is a moth in the family Erebidae.

He defends the idea that such a plurality reaches to unity thanks to the divine perspective. This book is completed by an examination of the rationality of faith and its legitimate contribution to philosophy with 'Philosophy of Faith' - Philosophie de la foi (2015). In religious matters proper, he addressed the question of the plurality of religions and the central role of Christianity in Volume II of 'Heaven and the Forest (Christianity and Other Religions)' - Le Ciel et la Forêt (Le christianisme et les autres religions) (2000). As regards Time, his basic book is 'Time, History, Eternity' -Temps Histoire Éternité (2006). This book relates the diversity of human conceptions of time to the eternity of God, thus offering a reflection on the meaning of personal destiny and of history. From the religious perspective, he examines the issue of Christian Revelation and the development of Christian doctrine in history, considering it as an expression of eternity in time in 'Christian revelation or eternity in time', 2018 - La révélation chrétienne ou l’éternité dans le temps. === Political dimension === His reflection on politics questions the relationship between plurality, which is inherent to the political debate, and the idea of truth, as a norm for morality. His book, 'The Future of Democracy' - L’Avenir de la Démocratie (2011) focuses on the complexity of the concept of democracy and the tormented history of its emergence. He emphasizes that alongside the political system and the rule of law, a central role has been played by what he calls democratic ideology, which is in fact a paradigm of normative neutrality, based on the rejection of the collective search for a common and objective idea of good, and favoring mere procedures confronting individual choices. He doubts such a regime can be sustainable in the long run. This book has been completed and developed in 2019 by Pour un grand retournement politique : face aux impasses du paradigme actuel . In his book 'Survival Guide to an Unstable, Heterogeneous and Unregulated World' -Guide de survie dans un monde instable, hétérogène, non régulé (2017), the multiple effects of this lack of common reference in a fragmented world such as ours, is discussed from various angles: geopolitical, military, financial, economic, political and cultural, and he questions the possible ways to overcome the failures of the Western model. Pierre de Lauzun is particularly interested in the political role of the nation : in his book 'Nations and Their Destiny' - Les nations et leur destin (2005), he shows both that nations are rooted in their cultural and linguistic characteristics as much as in their history, and their essential role for the constitution of real democracy. 'Christianity and Democracy' (2003) - Chrétienté et démocratie deals with the complex relations in history between Christianity and politics, particularly with democracy (2003). === Economic and financial dimension === 'The Gospel, Christians, and Money' (2004) - L’Évangile, les Chrétiens et l’Argent deals with the general question of economics from a Christian perspective, drawing on the Gospel and Catholic social teaching.https://www.famillechretienne.fr/livres/litterature/essais/l-evangile- le-chretien-et-l-argent-158566 'Economics and Christianity' (2010) - L’Économie et le christianisme (2010) extends and broadens this perspective by emphasizing, on the one hand, the central role of ethics in economics, and on the other hand the importance of the question of risk, a basic limit to human action, which can find a counterweight in the trust in divine providence At the same time, 'Christianity and economic growth' (2008) - Christianisme et croissance économique (2008) historically shows the key role of Christianity in the economic growth of the Western world 'Finance, a Christian Perspective' (2013) - Finance, un regard chrétien (2013) traces, still from the Gospel, the reflection and experience of the Catholic Church in financial matters, highlighting the incompleteness of finance itself and its need for an ethical perspective. For this book the author was awarded the international prize of the Centesimus Annus Foundation of the Vatican. It is followed by L'Argent, Maître ou serviteur (2019) dedicated to our relationship to money . This same question is taken up again without appealing to explicitly Christian references in 'Can Finance serve Man?' (2015) - La Finance peut-elle être au service de l’homme ?, which is completed by reflections on the role of regulation, particularly in view of the 2008 crisis. Finally, a small book on the euro raises the question of currency in general, and more particularly the difficulties posed by this single currency : 'Euro: The end of the single currency?'

He and his wife, Victoria Toensing, are partners in the Washington, D.C., law firm diGenova and Toensing. He is known for promoting conspiracy theories about the Department of Justice and the FBI. He frequently appears on Fox News and Fox Business channels. == Career in law and politics == DiGenova was an aide to Republican Senator Charles Mathias of Maryland, eventually serving as Mathias' legislative director. After Republicans won the U.S. Senate in the 1980 elections, DiGenova was named chief counsel and staff director of the Senate Rules Committee and counsel to the Senate Judiciary, Governmental Affairs, and Select Intelligence committees. === U.S. attorney === As a U.S. attorney, diGenova led the prosecution of Jonathan Pollard, who pleaded guilty in 1987 to spying for Israel. He also led investigations into corruption in the administration of Washington, D.C., Mayor Marion Barry that led to convictions of 12 officials, including two deputy mayors. === Counsel investigations === DiGenova later served as Independent Counsel investigating the 1992 preelection search of then-candidate Bill Clinton's passport file by officials of the George H. W. Bush administration. DiGenova concluded that the passport search had been \\"stupid, dumb and partisan,\\" but not illegal, and that the government should apologize to the officials who ordered the search. DiGenova and his wife, Victoria Toensing, started their Washington law firm, diGenova & Toensing, in January 1996. In 1997, diGenova was named Special Counsel to investigate the International Brotherhood of Teamsters; afterward he was named to an independent review board to monitor the Teamsters. == Trump presidency  Scooter Libby === DiGenova called on President Trump to pardon Scooter Libby, adviser of Dick Cheney, who was found guilty of perjury in an investigation revolving around leaks of sensitive classified material. DiGenova is married to Libby's lawyer, Victoria Toensing. Trump pardoned Libby on April 13, 2018. ===Russian interference in the 2016 election=== DiGenova, who frequently appears as a commentator on Fox News, has accused FBI officials of trying to \\"frame\\" President Donald Trump for \\"nonexistent\\" crimes. On March 19, 2018, he and his spouse, Victoria Toensing, were hired to serve on Trump's legal team for the Special Counsel investigation. However, Trump backtracked the hires several days later due to potential conflicts of interest. The president hoped diGenova could function as a stand-in for him on television and spearhead the attacks on Mueller and the investigation. In April 2018, diGenova called for the firing of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said that special counsel Robert Mueller's team investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election were \\"legal terrorists\\" and called former FBI Director James Comey \\"a dirty cop\\". In May 2018 tweet, Trump quoted diGenova as saying \\"The recusal of Jeff Sessions was an unforced betrayal of the President of the United States.\\" On February 21, 2019, diGenova stated in the podcast of Laura Ingraham that the US is in a civil war and that he advises friends to prepare for total war by voting and buying guns. === Kavanaugh appointment === On September 18, 2018, diGenova discounted charges that U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, while drunk, had sexually assaulted a 15-year-old Christine Blasey Ford at a party. The allegations referred to a time when Kavanaugh was attending Georgetown Preparatory School. On Fox News, diGenova said if Ford testified, \\"...she's going to look like the loon that she is.” === Ukraine investigations === In the summer of 2019, diGenova and his wife, Victoria Toensing, were hired by the Ukrainian oligarch Dmytro Firtash, to defend Firtash from extradition to the United States on corruption charges related to a mining permit in India. Firtash, as middleman for the Russian natural gas giant Gazprom, was known for funneling money to campaigns of pro- Russia politicians in Ukraine and is also a onetime business partner of Paul Manafort, a Trump 2016 campaign chairman. In August 2019, diGenova and Toensing met with Attorney General William Barr to argue against the charges for Firtash. Barr declined to intercede, according to sources who talked to The Washington Post. In October 2019, Lev Parnas, a businessman who was working for diGenova and Toensing's firm as an interpreter in the Firtash case, was one of two men arrested at Dulles International Airport and accused by federal prosecutors of funneling foreign money into U.S. elections. In November, 2019, Joseph Bondy, the lawyer for Lev Parnas, told The Washington Post that Parnas had been part of \\"a group that met frequently in spring 2019 at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., to discuss the Biden matter, among other topics. The group, according to Bondy, was convened by Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney, and included Parnas, his business associate Igor Fruman, as well as journalist John Solomon and the husband-and- wife legal team of Joe diGenova and Victoria Toensing.\\" DiGenova and Toensing worked with Rudy Giuliani on opposition research from Ukraine to be used against the 2020 Democratic candidate Joe Biden, according to Fox News Sunday. All three were working off the books, outside the administration, according to Fox News. “The only person in government who knows what they were doing is President Trump,” Fox host Chris Wallace said. DiGenova called the story \\"categorically false.\\" DiGenova and Toensing are lawyers for John Solomon, a conservative columnist who has written stories favorable to Trump on scandals involving Ukraine and Russia. “John Solomon has been a client of our firm for a very long time,” diGenova told Politico. In November 2019, in an appearance on Fox News, diGenova claimed that George Soros \\"controls a very large part of the career foreign service of the United States State Department\\" and \\"also controls the activities of FBI agents overseas who work for NOG's, work with NGO's. That was very evident in Ukraine.\\" The Open Society Foundation, founded by George Soros, described diGenova's claims as \\"beyond rhetorical ugliness, beyond fiction, beyond ludicrous\\" and requested that Fox News provide an on- air retraction of diGenova's claims, and stop providing diGenova with a platform. ==References * diGenova & Toensing * Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century American lawyers Category:21st-century American lawyers Category:People from Wilmington, Delaware Category:University of Cincinnati alumni Category:Georgetown University Law Center alumni Category:United States congressional aides Category:United States Attorneys for the District of Columbia Category:Washington, D.C.

Lewis was a 1st Round selection (#12 overall) of the Philadelphia 76ers in the 1971 NBA Draft out of the University of Tulsa. ==Early life== In 1966, Dana Lewis moved with his mother from New York City to Newark, New Jersey. He attended Weequahic High School in Newark. There he played basketball and was a teammate of future NBA player Mo Layton in a highly successful program. In 1966-1967 Weequahic went undefeated and won the Group 4 State Championship, defending their title from the year before. Weequahic High School in 1965–66 and 1966–67 had each of the five starters go on to play college basketball. Two reached the National Basketball Association. The five were Layton, Lewis, Leroy Cobb, George Watson and Bill Mainor. Layton played with Phoenix and Portland in the NBA after a college career at the University of Southern California. Mainor played at Fordham, and Cobb and Watson played at Southern California with Layton. “Yes, that was quite a ballclub,” reminisced Les Fein, the Weequahic coach. “Not only were the boys excellent players, but they were gentlemen.” ==College career== Following his high school career, Lewis was heavily recruited. The Associated Press release on April 19, 1967 read as follows: \\"NEWARK, N.J. (AP) Dana Lewis, Wcequahic High School's 6-foot-10 All-America basketball player, rejected the recruiting efforts of virtually every major college in the country and announced that he will attend Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Okla., for religious reasons. Oral Roberts, which is only two years old, is named after and administered by the world-famed evangelist, acknowledged spiritual leader of the Pentecostal Church, to' which Lewis' family belongs. Lewis led Weequahic to 40 straight victories and two New Jersey State championships.\\" As a 6’10\\" Center playing for Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma as a freshman, Lewis averaged 16.0 points and 10.2 rebounds in 24 games. Lewis' mother had influenced him to attend Oral Roberts University for his first collegiate season, and after one season he wished to transfer. Deciding to stay in town and transfer to the University of Tulsa, Lewis needed a release from ORU to be eligible. While awaiting a release, Lewis stayed in Tulsa and got a job hauling hay. He eventually paid his own tuition the first semester at Tulsa by working a construction job. Finally, Oral Roberts himself wrote a handwritten release for Lewis to be able to play for Tulsa. At Tulsa, Lewis averaged 20.3 points and 11.9 bounds in 1969-1970 and 23.3 points and 13.5 rebounds in 1970-1971, while playing under coach Ken Hayes. In 1970, Lewis was named the \\"Missouri Valley Conference Newcomer of the Year.\\". In 1970-1971, Lewis led the Missouri Valley Conference in scoring and was First- Team All-MVC in both Tulsa seasons. Lewis still holds the Tulsa record for Rebounds in a game with 26, vs. MacMurray College, on Dec. 27, 1969. Overall, in 52 games for Tulsa, Lewis averaged a double-double of 21.8 points and 12.7 rebounds over his two seasons. After graduating from Tulsa, Lewis was selected for the World University Games, where Team USA earned a bronze medal, losing to USSR in the final. George McGinnis was a teammate on the USA team. ==Professional career== Lewis was drafted in the 1st Round (12th overall) of the 1971 NBA Draft by the Philadelphia 76ers on May 9th 1971. Lewis was also drafted by the Virginia Squires in the 1971 ABA Draft. He chose to sign with the 76ers. Originally signing a 6-year $500,000 mostly guaranteed contract, Lewis was cut by the 76ers on Sept. 27, 1972 after the third game of the season, before appearing in an NBA game. Lewis went on to play four seasons in the Eastern Basketball Association. He played for the Hartford Capitols (1971-1974) and the Cherry Hill Pros (1974-1975).

It was written and developed by Ivan Gerenčir and Milan Pavičević, with graphics done by artist Igor Kordey. The game is notable for being the first Yugoslav adventure game with full color graphics, as well as the first adventure game from Croatia. The game depicts the daily life of Srećko, and his family, who are preparing for a trip to their summer vacation on the coastlineSvet Kompjutera, #8, Avgust 1985, Igre, Aleksandar Radovanović, and as such portrays the daily life in the former country.http://planb.hr/yu-gamer/ It was published simultaneously in Serbo- Croatian and Slovenian language and retailed at 900 Yugoslav dinars.http://retrospec.sgn.net/users/tomcat/yu/ZX/TextAdv/Html/VrocePocitnice.php ==Plot== The protagonist, Srećko, lives a daily life with his family in an economically unstable Yugoslavia and is at some point asked by his wife, Milica, to prepare a summer vacation for them to the coastline. He then embarks on an adventure going through daily life attempting to survive and support his family thus running into many obstacles along the way. ==Gameplay== First scenes in the Slovenian and Serbo-Croat versions of the game The game's display is divided in three sections, where the first two sections provide the first-person perspective image of the player's location, with the last third conveying text information such as descriptions, current date and time as well as a console for the player to give commands. The gameplay is based on real-time method, the plot features 13 major autonomous NPCs which move from one area to another depending on time, and an open world, aspects already established in previous adventure games. It also introduces hunger and fatigue as parameters which greatly affect the player potentially resulting in his death. These factors also depend on each other, for instance \\"run to the store before it closes to get food so you don't starve to death, but your fatigue prevents you from running\\". The player can travel both by foot or by car. Financial planning of food, car gas, gifts and vacation is also mandatory for the player's progression, as it could end the game through bankruptcy. You get several sources of income (piggy bank, monthly salary, savings etc.) which you need to spend during the course of the adventure without fully depleting it. ==Reception== It was praised by the Slovenian computer magazine Moj mikro as easily one of the better Yugoslavian programs in its November issue.Moj Mikro, November 1985, Matej Gašperič Another prominent magazine Svet Kompjutera, favourably compared it to other games of the genre such as The Hobbit, Sherlock, and Eric, even praising it as having better and more humorous solutions than the aforementioned games. It particularly noted its very fast routine for image display and the large span of words that could be used during play. ==References * *Vruće Ljetovanje on World of Spectrum Category:1980s interactive fiction Category:1985 video games Category:Adventure games Category:Video games developed in Croatia Category:ZX Spectrum games Category:ZX Spectrum-only games ","title":"Vruće Ljetovanje"},{"id":"56914941","text":"Monte Tchota (also: Monte Txota) is a mountain located in the central part of Santiago Island in Cape Verde.

Wildin joined Notts County's academy in 2014 having previously played for youth team Highfield Rangers. He signed his first professional contract with Notts County in May 2016, and spent the 2016–17 season on loan at Northern Premier League club Grantham Town. He was released by Notts County at the end of the campaign and subsequently joined Nuneaton Town of the National League North in July 2017, where he spent one season. Wildin joined Stevenage for an undisclosed fee in May 2018. He has also represented Antigua and Barbuda at senior level. ==Club careerNotts County=== Wildin began playing football at the age of seven with his local Sunday League youth team Highfield Rangers. He was part of a \\"very successful young side\\" at Highfield Rangers that stayed together for close to ten years. Wildin stated that at the age of 14 he realised he was excelling at Sunday League level and wanted to try and play at a higher standard. He subsequently had unsuccessful trials at Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa, before being scouted by Notts County in an U16 match in 2014. He had a one-week trial at Notts County, which proved successful, and he signed a two-year scholarship to join the club's academy. Despite having not made a first-team appearance, Wildin signed his first professional contract at Notts County in May 2016. A month into the 2016–17 season, on 19 September 2016, Wildin joined Grantham Town of the Northern Premier League on an initial one- month loan deal in order to gain first-team experience. The loan deal was later extended until the end of the season. Wildin made his debut for Grantham in a 4–0 victory over Stratford Town in the FA Trophy on 1 November 2016, coming on as a 77th-minute substitute in the match. He established himself as a first-team regular from then on, scoring his first goal for the club when he gave Grantham the lead in an eventual 2–1 away win over Coalville Town on 11 April 2017. Wildin made 42 appearances in all competitions during the loan spell, scoring twice. ===Nuneaton Town=== Whilst still on loan at Grantham, Wildin was told that his one-year contract at Notts County would not be renewed and he subsequently left the club at the end of the 2016–17 campaign. He signed for National League North club Nuneaton Town on 14 July 2017, joining the club alongside his brother, Courtney Wildin. He made his debut for Nuneaton in the club's 1–0 win over Kidderminster Harriers on 8 August 2017. Wildin became the first player signed up to Jamie Vardy's V9 Academy on 14 February 2018, a week-long academy that takes place at the end of the season to help non-league footballers into the Football League. He scored his first goal for Nuneaton on 27 February 2018, his second-half strike proving the winner in a 2–1 away win against AFC Telford United. Wildin made 38 appearances during the season, scoring twice. ===Stevenage=== Wildin signed for League Two club Stevenage for an undisclosed fee on 16 May 2018. The move reunited Wildin with Stevenage manager Dino Maamria, who had previously managed him at Nuneaton. He made his Stevenage debut in the club's opening match of the 2018–19 season, a 2–2 draw with Tranmere Rovers at Broadhall Way. Wildin scored his first Stevenage goal in the club's 2–1 away defeat at Newport County on 13 October 2018. He was the club's first choice right back throughout the season, making 41 appearances in all competitions as Stevenage finished in tenth position in League Two, one point off of the play-off places. ==International career== Wildin qualified to play for Antigua & Barbuda through his family heritage. His older brother, Courtney, was called up to the senior team in May 2016 and the national association (ABFA) asked him if he had any brothers.

It officially sits within the village of Whiteparish, but is more closely associated with the village of Alderbury, which the tower overlooks. Built in 1606 by Giles Eyre, the folly is a three-storey hexagonal tower constructed of brick, although the entrances and windows have since been blocked up. The building's original purpose is unknown, though theories include that it was built to provide Eyre with views of Longford Castle or to provide local landowners' wives, including Eyre's wife Jane, a lookout tower to watch the hunt. The tower is considered one of the oldest follies, and was designated a Grade II listed building in 1960. It is currently owned by the National Trust. ==Origins and purpose== Although the official grade listing dates The Pepperbox to the early 18th century, it is accepted that the tower was built in 1606 by Giles Eyre of Brickworth House, hence the alternate name \\"Eyre's Folly\\". Eyre is known for being the father of settler John Eyre and grandfather of Giles Eyre, a judge. The original purpose of the tower is unknown. One story is that Eyre was envious of the surreal Longford Castle, built by Sir Thomas Gorges, and built the Pepperbox to overlook the castle. Indeed, the epitaph on Eyre's gravestone describes him as \\"a man much oppressed by publick power.\\" Another story is that the tower was built as a hunting stand, perhaps so the local landowners' wives – including Eyre's wife Jane, whom he married in 1603 – could watch the hunt in comfort without being exposed to public gaze. In their book Follies, Grottoes and Garden Building, authors Gwen Headley and Wim Meulenkamp consider the hunting stand theory to be \\"saner\\" given that the tower lacks a \\"folly atmosphere.\\" One account writes that: \\"It can be counted as a folly but may have been used a lookout so that ladies could follow the progress of the hunt, away from the rain and mud.\\" ==Description and location== The Pepperbox in 2008 The Pepperbox is a hexagonal, three-storey tower constructed of English bond brick, with a low, pyramidal Welsh slate roof that was rebuilt around 1900, topped by a weather vane. The ground floor's doorways are segmental-headed, meaning the building originally stood on open arches. The first floor features 3-brick plat bands, while the second floor features a stepped cornice with windows boasting timber lintels. Nonetheless, the building's doorways (one per face) and windows (one per face on the first and second floors) are all bricked in, a process that happened at an unknown time. The name \\"The Pepperbox\\" came about due to the tower's resemblance to a pepper pot or pepper box, used in the 17th and 18th centuries, and consequently also inspired the name of the hill that it stands on. The tower bears some similarities with the influential, octagonal Tower of the Winds in Athens, Greece, as does the 1782 folly of the same name at Mount Stewart, although the Pepperbox predates Nicholas Revett and James Stuart's recording of the Athens tower by some 150 years. The folly stands at the highest point on Pepperbox Hill, the peak of a chalk ridge southeast of the city of Salisbury, Wiltshire. It officially sits within the village of Whiteparish, located some 7.5 miles southeast of Salisbury, but is more closely associated with the village of Alderbury, which the tower overlooks. The hill has views far reaching views both east and west, including over Salisbury. Author Gwen Headley suggests that the tower was built in the open countryside at such a location because Eyre believed that the land which the hill overlooks would \\"last forever,\\" and that this potential impetus has been obscured by the changing of the landscape in the subsequent centuries. The folly is surrounded by a diverse habitat boasting many uncommon species including juniper, orchids and yew woodland. ==Later day history== The Pepperbox in 2007 In the early 18th century, the Pepperbox was allegedly used as a haunt by highwaymen, who would attack carriages as they reached the summit of Pepperbox Hill, this being due to the vulnerability of the horses and carriage occupants who were worn out by their climb up the hill. The tower was also used as a lookout post by the local Home Guard during World War II. It was designated a Grade II listed building with the formal name \\"The Pepperbox\\" on 23 March 1960, and today, both the folly and the hill it stands on are property of the National Trust. Despite the theory that the Pepperbox was used as a lookout tower, the tower is today considered one of the earliest follies, and has been accepted as such before the term \\"folly\\" was first used. The Pepperbox and the three other follies in and around Salisbury, including the arch in the city itself, are regarded as the four oldest follies in Wiltshire. Regarding the Pepperbox, Headley writes that due to the tower being \\"isolated, unprotected, enigmatic and blank,\\" the sudden sight of the \\"strange, anonymous small building\\" provokes questions from unfamiliar passers-by. She notes that the tower is considered a folly because it is a \\"misunderstood building.\\" In their 1976 book Wiltshire, writers Nikolaus Pevsner and Bridget Cherry consider the Pepperbox as one of several early 17th century \\"oddments\\" in the county, alongside the two triangular gatehouses of Amesbury, built in 1600 and 1607, and the Newhouse in Redlynch, built in 1619 by the aforementioned Gorges and, as with the Pepperbox, a brick building with a hexagonal centre. The Pepperbox is listed in Peter Long's book The Hidden Places of England. ==See also== *Longford Castle *Fonthill Abbey *Pepper Pot, Brighton (also named in reference to its pepper pot-style shape) ==References== Category:Folly towers in England Category:Buildings and structures in Wiltshire Category:Tourist attractions in Wiltshire Category:Grade II listed buildings in Wiltshire Category:National Trust properties in Wiltshire Category:Observation towers in the United Kingdom Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1606 ","title":"The Pepperbox"},{"id":"56915260","text":"Herborg Oline Finnset (born 28 March 1961 in Sørreisa, Troms) is a Norwegian prelate of the Church of Norway who is the Bishop of Nidaros as of 2018.\\"HERBORG OLINE FINNSET\\", Church of Norway.

The introduction and rapid expansion of solar technology has brought with it a number of occupational hazards for workers responsible for panel installation. Guidelines for safe solar panel installation exist,Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA): Solar Construction Safety. (Dec. 2006). Retrieved from http://www.coshnetwork.org/sites/default/files/OSEIA_Solar_Safety_12-06.pdf however the injuries related to panel installation are poorly quantified. There is concern for long term health effects acquired from prolonged ultraviolet radiation and from lifting heavy panels. The lack of data regarding these concerns makes increasing awareness for worker safety more challenging. ==Exposures and health effects== With regard to PV occupational safety, there are differing exposures depending on the stage of involvement in Solar energy production. This can be broken down into four stages. Exposures and their impacts on worker health intricately depend on the PV life-cycle stage, as well as depth and duration of system involvement by the individual. There is a wide variety of tasks required by the PV industry. These include scientists and engineers for material development, workers who pilot manufacturing facilities, miners and millers, factory manufacturers, power electronics, planners, developers, installation crews who work with electrical grids, transportation jobs, and recycling industry. === Raw Material Mining and Processing === Hazards in this stage are mainly chemical in nature. They include crystalline silicon, amorphous silicon thin film, cadmium telluride thin film, copper indium selenide, copper indium gallium selenide, and gallium arsenide.Coalition, S. V. T. (2009). Toward a Just and Sustainable Solar Energy Industry. San Jose: Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition. These are highly toxic and flammable; hazardous exposures can come via chemical burns, explosions, and inhalation of gaseous fumes. Other routes can include hand-to- mouth contact or accidental ingestion. Most solar cells start as quartz, which is later refined into elemental silicon, which risks lung disease silicosis amongst miners. === Construction and Assembling === During the manufacturing process, workers are exposed to a variety of toxic chemicals. Some of these chemicals such as telluride, cadmium telluride, gallium, and germanium are still under study. Other chemicals like chlorosilanes and hydrogen chloride are not only toxic but highly volatile and explosive when mixed with water.Concerns, H. a. (2010). Retrieved from State Smart Transportation Initiative: https://www.ssti.us/wp/wp- content/uploads/2016/09/Health_and_Safety_Concerns_of_Photovoltaic_Solar_Panels_2010_OR.pdf In crystalline silicon solar cell production, workers may be exposed to hydrofluoric acid, or other acids and alkalis used for cleaning purposes, dopant gases and vapors (POCl3, B2H6) due to improper ventilation, or the flammable nature of silane and byproducts from silicon nitride deposition and fabrication of x-Si layers. Other fire-hazard risks arise from the use of extremely flammable SiH4 gas. Exposure to cadmium compounds can be carcinogenic, as Cd is considered a lung carcinogen and is regulated by OSHA. === Installation/Operation === Installing solar panels Falls from heights are a significant risk for panel installers. Fatal falls from the installation phase have been reported from California and in France. Health effects associated with falls from roofs include, but are not limited to: skeletomuscular injuries, brain or spine injuries, concussions, lacerations, bruising, swelling, long-term disability, and/or mortality. Falls are more likely when roofing is old or damaged, or when panels are located close to edges, skylights, and vegetation. Other injury factors include lack of fall protection, proximity to overhead power lines, and unguarded skylights. It has been argued that incorporating PV technology into roof membranes, roof shingles, wall panels, or windows would reduce fall risk. Installation effectively combines three high risk industries in one: roofing, carpentry, and electrical work. There is a risk of electrocution from installation or nearby power lines, as well as ergonomic risks from heavy loads or a lack of lifting equipment. Cold or heat stress and sun exposure can also occur. Solar Farm There may also be a risk for infectious disease spread amongst PV employees. Solar farm construction requires soil-disruptive work, which can precipitate exposure to soil-dwelling organisms. Such cases have been documented in San Luis Obispo County, California between 2011-2014, where 44 workers came down with coccidioidomycosis while constructing solar power- generating facilities. Coccidioidomycosis (or \\"Valley Fever\\") is an infection caused by Coccidioides fungus spores and causes flu-like symptoms, as well as more serious complications such as meningitis, osteomyelitis, or cutaneous lesions. These can be fatal if not treated. In response to these isolated cases, the California Department of Public Health issued numerous recommendations, including improved worksite dust-control measures, equipping earth-moving equipment with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, and respiratory protection for workers such as respirators with specialized particulate filters. Occupational hazards may be exacerbated in settings with fewer worker protection policies in place, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations. PV manufacturing has moved from Europe, Japan, and the U.S. to countries such as China, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Taiwan, with nearly half of the world's photovoltaics made in China as of 2014. === End of Life Cycle and Recycling === End-of-life recycling is also a source of hazardous chemical exposures for workers. Green recycling requires increased material handling and manual separation, which can demand two to three times more individual handing of materials. This can present a risk for strains, sprains, and punctures. PV end-of-life materials can include lead from electronic circuits, as well as brominated flame retardants (BFRs), polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs), and polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs) used in circuit boards and solar panel inverters. These are considered toxic and potential estrogen disrupters, as PBDEs bioaccumulate in fatty tissues. ===Other hazards=== Many solar PV technologies use extremely toxic material that have unknown health and environmental consequences including new nano- materials and processes. There is limited data on specific air emissions and liquid or solid effluents from PV cells and processing. ==Policy== Research is currently underway exploring the possibility of replacing a number of the more hazardous chemicals workers are exposed to, such as cadmium and hydrofluoric acid, with less toxic chemicals. Regarding policies related to solar panel installation, OSHA requires employers to implement and provide safety training for workers, including information on how to assess the worksite for potential hazards, safely perform required action such as heavy lifting, and what to do should an accident occur. This type of protection falls on the tip of on the hierarchy of controls as the least effective measure to ensure the safety of workers.The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). (2016, July 18) Hierarchy of Controls. Retrieved March 28, 2018, from https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/hierarchy/ Hierarchy of Controls (By NIOSH) In recent years the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health launched the Prevention through Design (PtD) initiative. This initiative strives to improve the health and safety of workers by taking a comprehensive approach to eliminate hazards and control risks earlier in the process. In 2013, SEIA introduced the Solar Industry Environmental & Social Responsibility Commitment, a voluntary set of guidelines for the solar industry. Companies can choose to sign and agree to adhere to general best practices, including those for worker safety. == References == Solar Category:Solar energy Category:Photovoltaics ","title":"Occupational hazards of solar panel installation"},{"id":"56915336","text":"The 2nd Pavlograd Life Hussar Regiment () was a cavalry regiment of the Imperial Russian Army. The regiment was originally formed in 1783 as the Pavlograd Light Horse Regiment from the Dnepr and Yekaterinoslav Regiments of Pikemen, although it traced its seniority back to the establishment of both regiments in 1764. It became the Pavlograd Hussar Regiment in 1801, and fought in the Napoleonic Wars, distinguishing itself at the Battle of Schöngrabern during the War of the Third Coalition. The regiment also fought at Austerlitz, Eylau, and Friedland, but served in a secondary theatre during the French invasion of Russia, although it fought in the Battle of Berezina in the latter. Subsequently, it took part in the Russian campaign in Europe, fighting at Leipzig, Craonne and Saint-Dizier. The regiment went on to fight in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829, the November Uprising, the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, the Crimean War, and the January Uprising. == Origins == The Pavlograd Hussar Regiment was originally formed on 28 June 1783 from the Dnepr and Yekaterinoslav Regiments of Pikemen as the Pavlograd Light Horse Regiment, with six squadrons. Both of the Regiments of Pikemen had been established on 9 July 1764, which was celebrated as the regimental day. The Dnepr Regiment of Pikemen fought in the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774 from 1769, participating in the Storming of Bender on 16 September 1770 and the campaign of Pyotr Rumyantsev on the right bank of the Danube in 1771. The Yekaterinoslav Regiment of Pikemen was formed as the Donetsk Regiment of Pikemen and fought in the Russo-Turkish War. On 29 November 1796 it was named after its chef, Brigadier Karl Bour, who was promoted to major general on 27 January 1797 and to lieutenant general on 6 September 1798, as a result of Paul I's reorganization of the regiments. == Napoleonic Wars == c. 1912 postcard depicting Pavlograd Hussars setting fire to a bridge in 1812 Uniform of a trooper of the regiment in 1812 The regiment fought in the Swiss expedition in 1799 during the War of the Second Coalition, with Army of Condé. On 26 September of that year the regiment fought in the repulse of the French attack on Constance. On 31 March 1801, the regiment was redesignated as the Pavlograd Hussar Regiment, with five squadrons, when Alexander I restored the previous naming of regiments. During the 1805 War of the Third Coalition, the regiment formed part of Pyotr Bagration's column. On 27 September it reached Braunau, before fighting in the Battle of Lambach, the Battle of Amstetten, and the Battle of Schöngrabern during the retreat of Kutuzov from Krems to Znaim, distinguishing itself in the latter two. For its actions at Schöngrabern, the regiment was granted one white and nine green St. George standards on 13 June 1806. It fought on the right flank at the Battle of Austerlitz, covering Bagration's retreat. Bour was replaced by Major General Yefim Chaplits on 23 July 1806, who was later promoted to lieutenant general on 31 October 1812. The Pavlograd Hussars subsequently fought in the Battle of Czarnowo, the Battle of Ostrołęka, the Battle of Golymin, the Battle of Eylau, the Battle of Heilsberg, and the Battle of Friedland during the 1806–1807 War of the Fourth Coalition, and in the advance into Galicia during the Austro- Polish War of 1809. From 1810 to 1814 Colonel Spiridon Zhevakhov served as regimental commander; he was promoted to Major General on 15 September 1813. At the beginning of the 1812 French invasion of Russia, the active squadrons of the regiment, numbering 1,116 men, were part of the Sergei Kamensky's corps in the Third Reserve Army of Observation, positioned in Volhynia. The reserve squadrons, formed in the Novgorod-Seversky Recruitment Depot, were planned to form part of the 14th Cavalry Division, but were instead used as replacements. The Pavlograd Hussars fought in the Battle of Kobryń and the Battle of Gorodechno , suffering casualties of eighteen men in the latter. At the end of September, the regiment's eight squadrons numbered 939 men. Subsequently, as part of Chaplits' detachment, the regiment distinguished itself in the Slonim affair and fought in the Battle of Berezina. On 27 December, when the Russian cavalry were reorganized, the Pavlograd Hussars became part of the 3rd Hussar Division, with six active and one reserve squadrons. During the 1813 campaign in Saxony, the regiment fought in the Siege of Toruń, the Battle of Großbeeren, the Battle of Dennewitz, and the Battle of Leipzig. It fought at the Battle of Craonne and the Battle of Saint-Dizier during the 1814 Campaign in north-east France. On 19 November 1814, for their actions between 1812 and 1814, the Pavlograd Hussars were awarded shako badges for distinction. == 1815 to 1918 == The Pavlograd Hussars fought in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829, besieging Silistra and fighting in the Battle of Kulevicha. After marching through the Balkans it fought in the Battle of Sliven. The regiment participated in the suppression of the Polish November Uprising in 1831 at Minsk and Stanisławów. It gained two more active squadrons when a battalion of the abolished Pereyaslavl Horse Jaeger Regiment was merged into the regiment on 21 March 1833. On 1 April 1838, then-Tsesarevich Alexander Nikolayevich became ceremonial chef of the regiment, and it was accordingly redesignated as His Imperial Highness the Heir Tsesarevich's Hussar Regiment. To suppress the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, the regiment was sent to Hungary as part of the detachment of General Mikhail Cheodayev. It fought in the battles at Geremboli and Felsh-Zoltsa on 12 and 13 July, and participated in the occupation of Tokaj. During the Crimean War, the regiment fought in actions at Giurgiu and Slobozia in the initial occupation of the Danubian Principalities. On 19 February 1856, after Alexander Nikolayevich took the throne as Alexander II, the regiment was renamed as His Majesty's Life Hussar Regiment, and on 19 March 1857 it returned to the Pavlograd designation. It was reorganized with four active and two reserve squadrons on 14 May 1860. The 6th squadron was abolished in 1863, while the 5th squadron transferred to the reserve and separated from the regiment. In the same year it fought in the suppression of the Polish January Uprising, participating in fighting in what became Łomża Governorate. On 25 March 1864 it was numbered as the 2nd His Majesty's Pavlograd Life Hussar Regiment. In honor of its centenary, the regiment received a new St. George standard on 9 July, with the added inscription 1764–1864 and Alexander jubilee ribbon. Grand Duke Tsesarevich Alexander Alexandrovich (later Alexander III) became second chef of the regiment on 26 February 1874. It was redesignated as a dragoon regiment and renumbered as the 6th on 18 August 1882. After the death of Alexander III, the regiment was named in honor of him on 2 November 1894, being redesignated as the 6th Imperator Alexander III Pavlograd Life Dragoon Regiment. The regiment became a hussar unit numbered 2nd again on 6 December 1907. Emperor Nicholas II appointed himself chef of the regiment on 14 May 1911. It was dissolved in early 1918. == In popular culture == War and Peace film series In Leo Tolstoy's novel War and Peace characters Nikolai Rostov and Vasily Denisov are depicted as officers in the regiment. For narrative purposes, Tolstoy depicted the regiment as fighting in the Battle of Ostrovno, which it did not participate in. == References  Citations = Bibliography === * * * Category:Cavalry regiments of the Russian Empire Category:Hussars Category:Military units and formations of Russia in World War I Category:Military units and formations established in 1907 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1918 ","title":"2nd Pavlograd Life Hussar Regiment"},{"id":"56915348","text":"Dusty May is an American college basketball coach.

It is a compulsion similar to those seen in humans suffering from OCD and it can be quite disruptive to the lives of the dogs themselves, as well as their owners. Some causes have been suggested, including genetic factors, and environmental factors that vary depending on the individual dog. Furthermore, treatment options include drugs that decrease the frequency of tail chasing by targeting the underlying mechanisms, and behavioural changes regulated by the dog's owners. == Problematic behaviour == It is common for problems to arise when dogs compulsively chase their tails. One case study described a dog who began to lose weight, demonstrated aggressive behaviour when its owner attempted to stop the chasing, and became uninterested in enjoyable daily activities, such as walks and eating. Another case study described a dog with similar symptoms but who also injured its tail and head while chasing its tail. Furthermore, with increased tail chasing behaviour, the injuries become more serious, such as fractures from the animals often banging into things while chasing their tails, getting skin abrasions and infections from creating open wounds on the tail, and abrasions on the pads of their feet. The most serious cases can result in amputation or even euthanasia if other treatments are unsuccessful. Surveys from owners suggest that tail chasing diminishes quality of life for the dog and usually interferes with the relationship between dog and owner. == Parallels with human disorders == Dog chasing tail === OCD === Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) in humans is characterized by the onset of intrusive, repetitive thoughts and urges (obsessions), that are typically eased through a certain behaviour (compulsions). In addition, it can present early in life or later. One study also found that OCD has a high comorbidity with other disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Dogs who chase their tails are often described as having Canine Compulsive Disorder (CD), as they seem to compulsively chase their tails, it has been described as appearing as early as two months old, and the behaviour can worsen or become more frequent when the animal is stressed. === ASD === Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has also been known to develop early in life and a common symptom is repetitive behaviours. It has also been shown that most of the children with ASD were also hard to distract from any task they were focused on. Tail chasing has been compared to autism as it usually starts with random outbursts and then as the compulsion progresses, it becomes more frequent and more difficult to distract the dog from doing it. == Causes and treatments  Causes === Bull Terrier, one of the most common tail chasers Tail chasing and other compulsive behaviours in dogs, such as fly snapping and blanket suckling, have been associated with breed, stressful situations, seizures, and possibly the CDH2 gene. Tail chasing behaviour is most common in bull terriers and German Shepherds, but can also be seen in other breeds, like Dobermann Pinchers and Shiba Inus. A study in Japan found significant effect of breed on tail chasing, while another found bull terriers and German Shepherds had the earliest onset of the behaviour. In regards to stressful situations, case studies have shown that common triggers for tail chasing are situations in which the dog is uncomfortable, such as meeting new people or anticipating a stressful event. Another study showed similar findings in that about 30% of owners reporting that stressful or frustrating situations triggered tail chasing. Seizure activity has also been associated with tail chasing. A correlation between tail chasing and seizure activity was insignificant, but it was higher than the correlations between tail chasing and sex, trance-like behaviour, noises, and skin allergies, which are all also associated with tail chasing. Further, a case study showed seizure activity localized in the lateral hypothalamus or cerebellum as one of the diagnosing criteria in a dog who problematically chased its tail. In terms of genetic contributions, there is some debate, as one finding suggests that all compulsive-type behaviours are linked to higher expression of the CDH2 gene, while another found no such correlation between gene and tail chasing behaviour. Other potential causes have been suggested in addition to those listed above. One study suggests a possible influence of where the dog was bought (pet store or breeder), saying that dogs bought from pet stores were more likely to chase their tails, and they also suggested the possibility that being homed with other dogs may be a trigger. Another study found that tail chasing was more common in males than in females, suggesting a possible sex difference. === Treatments === Treatment for tail chasing is usually a combination of drug and behavioural therapy that is suited to the cause of tail chasing for the specific animal. Fluoxetine, an SSRI used to treat compulsive disorders, is a common drug used to treat CD and tail chasing. One study did find that hypericin was more effective at treating tail chasing than fluoxetine. Other drugs used to treat tail chasing include sedatives such as acepromazine, for those who are triggered by stressful or fearful situations, and anti-seizure medication such as gabapentin, for those who have seizures that could be increasing the behaviour. Behavioural treatment for tail chasing mainly involves physically inhibiting the dog from completing the behaviour (e.g. with a muzzle) by preventive measures or interrupting the behaviour. It is also important to keep a regular daily routine that includes walks and regular feeding times, and playing, while avoiding potential stressors, such as loud noises and strangers. In addition, it is also common to gradually return the dog into potentially stressful situations in a controlled manner to habituate them to normal activities while preventing triggering an episode. == References == Category:Dog training and behavior ","title":"Tail chasing"},{"id":"56915534","text":"The 1997 Vuelta a Murcia was the 13th edition of the Vuelta a Murcia cycle race and was held on 5 March to 9 March 1997.

She cycles through the different live images of people she finds online using her laptop then begins to paint often using bright artificial colours. The works were first exhibited in 2014 and titled with the subject's country and the date she encountered them. Hempton sees this series as subverting the male gaze and uses her position as a woman to confront the taboo of painting a penis. The piece was included in Omar Kholeif's exhibition 'Electronic Superhighway (2016-1966) at the Whitechapel Gallery. Her paintings vary in size, sometimes mimicking a mobile or laptop screen, other times taking up a large scale.

The Church of Our Lady of the Rosary of Black Men was a Roman Catholic church located in Pirenópolis, in the Brazilian state of Goiás. It was built between 1743 and 1757 by a fraternity of black men, since Afro-Brazilians were forbidden from attending other local churches. It was demolished in 1944 by order of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Goiás. It was located where today stands the Praça do Coreto, which has a memorial in its honor. Of all the churches in the city, Our Lady of the Rosary of Black Men contained the most altars; seven in total. According to journalist Jarbas Jayme, these altars were \\"artistically carved and of costly and beautiful architecture\\". Its main altar is now located within the Mother Church of Our Lady of the Rosary and its two lateral altars are now located in the Church of Our Lady of Carmo. ==History== Our Lady of the Rosary of Black Men. This image once belonged to the church, but is now in the Church of Our Lady of Carmo. The Church of Our Lady of the Rosary of Black Men was built between 1743 and 1757, according to the two documents available. It was built by thousands of slaves at a time when mining was the main economic activity of the city. It had a colonial style and its main altar had enthroned the image of Our Lady of the Rosary, now housed by the Church of Our Lady of Carmo. The two niches of this altar had images of Saint Raphael and Saint Benedict. Both images are now in the Mother Church of Our Lady of the Rosary. The right side altar was dedicated to Saint Sebastian, whose image was taken to the Church of Bonfim and stolen from there in 1978. The left side altar was dedicated to Saint Benedict the Moor, whose image is now in the Mother Church of Our Lady of the Rosary. With the end of the Brazilian Gold Rush in the late 18th century, the local economy began to base itself in agriculture and the city became impoverished. Nevertheless, the Fraternity of Our Lady of the Rosary of Black Men strove to preserve the church for the next centuries. For over a century after its construction the church had only one tower, on the west side. In 1870, a second tower was built in its east side. At the same time, restoration work was conducted on the roof and walls. In 1886 the old clock of the Mother Church – the first public clock in Pirenópolis – was transferred to the Church of the Rosary. After the signing of the Golden Law in 1888, the Black population of the city grew increasingly poor and in lack of funds to keep the church clean and well maintained. In the early 20th century the church suffered from a series of alterations in its original aspect. Its towers, sacristy and consistory were destructed, and its façade was altered from its colonial style to a neo-Gothic one. The church was demolished in 1944 by order of then Bishop Emanuel Gomes de Oliveira. Its two lateral altars, along with its main altar, were taken to the Church of Our Lady of Carmo, while its bell was taken to the Church of Our Lord of Bonfim. Images, implements, vestments, furniture and other belongings of the church were distributed among the three other churches of the city. In 2002, after a fire partially destructed the Mother Church of Our Lady of the Rosary, the main altar of Our Lady of the Rosary of Black Men was set up in that church. ==Bibliographic references== * Jayme, Jarbas (1895-1968).

The younger brother of Georg Jensen's third wife, he joined the company at 17 as a chaser's apprentice but later became one of the company's leading designers in the 1920s and 1930s and Jensen's closest colleague, One of his most well-known designs being the pyramid flatware pattern. In the early 1950s he headed the company's apprentice school and in 1958 became its artistic director. ==Early life== Nielsen was born in Bårse, Vordingborg Municipality, the youngest child of parish priest Søren Nielsen and Lydia Kold. His father died when he was just one year old and his mother then moved the family to Copenhagen. He had aspirations to become a painter but the family's difficult economic situation did not allow it. His eldest sister, Johanne, married Georg Jensen in 1907. In 1909, Nielsen began an apprenticeship as a chaser in his brother-in-law's silver workshop. The company paid for his drawing lessons with Carl V. Meyer. ==Career== Still an apprentice, Nielsen created the drawings for one of the workshop's catalogues. He briefly made another attempt to become a painter but was shortly thereafter once again employed by Georg Jensen, creating drawings based on Jensen's and Johan Rohde's sketches for the silversmiths to work after. He also began to create his own designs, developing his own style. He received the K. A. Larssens Legat in 1921. He was appointed to deputy director of the company in 1958. He retired in 1962 but remained an artistic consultant until 1967. ==Works== Silver by Harald Nielsen Nielsen mostly designed hollow ware. His works are well-proportioned and characterized by a refined sense of style. He also designed two sets of cutlery, Pyramid (1927–29) and Dobbeltriflet (1947) as well as a few pieces of jewellery. ==Exhibition== His works were part of Georg Jensen's contribution to the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in Paris in 1925 and he was also represented at all other Georg Jensen exhibitions over the next decades. His 60 years birthday in 1932 was celebrated with a special exhibition at Georg Jensen & Wendel in Copenhagen.

It uses sine wave-based Frequency Modulation (FM) synthesis. It has two FM tone generators and a 32-voice Random Access Memory (RAM), 32 user voices and 128 Read Only Memory (ROM) factory preset sounds. As a programmable synth, it enables users to create their own unique synthesized tones and sound effects by using the algorithms and oscillators. The instrument weighs 8 kg (17.6 lbs). On its release, it sold for $795. ==Keyboard== The keyboard has 61 keys which are not velocity-sensitive to harder or softer key presses. It can produce eight note polyphony, which means up to eight keys can be pressed at once. In split keyboard mode, the polyphony limit is still eight notes, but there is a maximum of four for the lower half and four for the upper half. In mono mode, the DX21 can play only one note, unless the keyboard is split; if the keyboard is split, the DX21 can do one mono voice for the lower split and one mono voice for the upper split. ==MIDI and jacks== The DX21 is MIDI compatible, which enables performers to use the DX21 to control other digital instruments (e.g., a drum machine or other synth), or use other MIDI- compatible controllers or devices to play the DX21's sounds. The DX21 has 1/4\\" jacks for plugging in a sustain pedal, a portamento pedal, and a volume expression pedal and an input for a BC1 breath controller. The DX21 has MIDI in, out and thru jacks, which enable the instrument to be connected to a computer, drum machine, sequencer, or other MIDI-compatible device. The CPU is a HD63803XP Hitachi. The sound generation chip is the YM2164. The DAC is a YM3012. The instrument has an un-backlit LCD panel which indicates the name of the voice or sound and provides information on the status of the instrument. A split point can be set on the keyboard, to enable part of the keyboard to be used with one sound and part for another sound. For example, a bass sound could be put on the left side of the keyboard, and a flute sound on the other half. The DX21 also has a modulation wheel and a pitch bend wheel. The two tone generators are output via two output jacks. Thus to hear tone generator A and tone generator B, a user would need to plug in two cables into a stereo keyboard amplifier, PA system, or other audio gear. ==Sounds and effects== The 128 RAM preset voices can be grouped into 16 categories: piano; electric piano; organ; strings; brass; plucked strings; \\"comping\\" (accompanying instruments); percussion 1; percussion 2; lead synth; other keyboards; wind reeds; bass; and three sound effect categories, which include sounds such as \\"racing car\\", \\"helicopter\\", \\"whistling\\", and basic sounds such as \\"LFO noise\\". Users can save their own newly-created synth tones to an external cassette recorder. It has an onboard chorus effect. The low frequency oscillator (LFO) has modulators for amplitude and pitch, using saw, square, triangle wave shapes. For attack-decay-sustain-release (ADSR) control, also called \\"envelope\\", there are four envelopes. ==Users== Notable users include: Hardfloor, Level 42, Brother Beyond, Astral Projection, Technotronic, Vangelis, and Norman Cook (Fatboy Slim). ==DX100== The DX100 was also released in 1985. It uses similar electronics to provide a keyboard with 49 minikeys that is smaller and easier to carry. The DX100 is a digital 4-operator FM synthesizer that is monotimbral. It has no filters or effects. It has 192 preset voices and 24 user-programmable voices. It has MIDI capabilities and MIDI in/out and thru jacks. It has a single mono output, a single footswitch jack for a sustain pedal or portamento pedal and a BC1 breath controller jack. ==Comparison with DX7== The DX21 has 4 operators and 8 algorithms.

Their first game was a platformer game called Lurid Land. Their second title, Léto s Oskarem, was the last game Vochozka Trading made, afterwards most of their staff went to work for Illusion Softworks. While the game was released in 1998, it was originally meant to be released sooner; Excalibur argued the delay was due to the developers promising many features and benefits never-before-seen in adventure gaming, a claim the magazine argued was never fulfilled. Databaze-her notes the title was \\" postponed several times and many of the previously announced improvements were not implemented in \\". The team were inspired to continue the tone set in earlier humor-focused games from Vochozka such as 7 days and 7 nights. The game was developed primarily for MS-DOS and ran in a VGA resolution of 640×480, later they began working on a Windows version as the game developed; these floppy disk versions came without sound, while a later CD-ROM edition had full dubbing. The game contained background music but no sound. According to an interview with the author of the game Pavel Širůček for Score magazine, the initial sketches of the game were made by Tomáš Svoboda on paper, which was subsequently scanned into a computer.https://is.muni.cz/th/thka4/Vizualny_styl_ceskych_a_slovenskych_adventur_medzi_rokmi_1990_az_1999.pdf The development team was four-person strong. Pavel Širůček was author and creative director. Sounds and music provided by Pavel Olšanský. The graphic designer was Tomáš Svoboda, who also created the comic book in the enclosed manual; he also contributed to the previous game Hidden & Dangerous 1, and would later work for Pterodon. Programming of the game itself led by Petr Bělík. The characters are performed by professional actors from the Goose on a String Theater (Husa na provázku) \\\\- 1998 was the year ullt professional dubbing hit Czech adventure gaming. Léto s Oskarem was one of the few titles Petr Vochozka developed in his own office, his main business was in publishing games created by other developers and localising Polish games. == Plot and gameplay == In this \\"a typical Czech comedy\\" adventure, the player takes control of Oskar Sláma, who is so bad at school that his parents send him off to live with his grandparents in a rural village of Kotěhůlkách. He reluctantly accepts in order to receive his inheritance. The game is a classic point and click adventure game. The inventory is located in the top part of the screen. The dialogue screen offers three ways for the player to react: charming, rude, or altruistic. The humour is in the vein of Leisure Suit Larry. The game is very short, and contains many animations. It contained background music but no sound effects. The game contains eight locations, 80 game screens, and around 30 characters. Each clickable element has a humorous note attached. The game has an average of 5 animations per screen, including animations triggered from prolonged inactivity and those independent to player's actions. == Critical reception == Bonusweb.cz felt the game was \\"ever-stagnant\\". Excalibur noted that the game is obscure when compared to contemporary Czech adventures, and was less commercially successful. In addition, the magazine argues it's one of the less difficult Czech adventures, and that the game contains outdated humour on groups such as women and homosexuals. Excalibur thought the game was a failure due to failing to deliver on their promised features and for being graphically outdated at the time of release. Databaze-her thought the game was \\"characterized by lower difficulty and certain technological obsolescence\\". Vision Game deemed Oskat Slama a mixture of America's Leisure Suit Larry and Polish character Agent Mlíčňák. Shark felt the game was a \\"total flop\\". Gamifique argued that the game was Petr Vochozka's way of supporting Czech production. Tiscali notes that 1998 was a significant year for the Czech game scene as the year íolda, Horké léto, Léto s Oskarem, and Brány Skeldalu were released. Level felt the game's graphic design was \\"at the level of games several years old, and concluded: \\"It is a typical Czech product, created with an idea and taste, it just wanted better crayons and probably a bigger investment\\". Various magazines compared Horke Leto to this title, due to them coming out at a similar time and having similar themes; they however would favour Horke Leto, with Score commenting that the game was \\"a good plaster for wounds caused by Léto s Oscarem [sic]\\". Bonusweb felt it was a \\"pity\\" the title was released in an unfinished state. Doupe felt the game was a cult classic, still enjoyed and fodly remembered by many players. Vizuálny štýl českých a slovenských adventúr medzi rokmi 1990 až 1999 felt that while the game often goes for visual realism, it sometimes slips into cartoony graphics in the style of 7 dní a 7 nocí, and noted that the game mechanics were far from the quality of foreign titles such as Broken Sword 2 (1997) or Monkey Island 3 (1997). == References  External links == * Preview in Score *Level preview *Riki review *Pareniste interview *Podcast about obscure Czech games Category:1998 video games Category:DOS games Category:DOS-only games Category:Point-and-click adventure games Category:Video games developed in the Czech Republic ","title":"Léto s Oskarem"},{"id":"56916215","text":"The 1965–66 Știința Craiova season is the 18th season in the club's history, and the 2nd consecutive in Divizia A, the top league of Romanian football. ==CompetitionsOverview=Divizia A=== League table Results summary Positions by round Matches ===Cupa României=== AS Aiud (Div.

It was scheduled for a release in the second quarter of 2008. It was a collaboration between House of Dragonflies and Cinemax, and contained the work of graphic designers Erik Sille and Boris Sirka. The game's plot would have seen the monk Severin be trapped between medieval Europe, and futuristic world guided by Plato's philosophy of perfect States. The game was inspired by the works of PKDick, W. Gibson, and T. Giliam's film productions. It was a 3D point-and-click adventure with a non-linear story, while featuring limited RPG elements. The game was reported as being make completely in Czech, including its dubbing. It promised to touch on historical themes and insights into philosophy, religion, mathematics, and cybernetics.

For example, FHPP was attempted for the first time to repair cracks in space shuttle external components of high-strength aluminum alloys. FHPP is also considered in repairing surface cracks in steam turbine rotors of a high- strength, high-temperature-resistant steel (grade 26NiCrMoV14-5) (Ref). Alternative methods such as fusion welding processes for in-service repairing of cracks in components of these high-strength steels remained difficult because of their high hardenability and mandatory need of pre-heating and post-weld heat treatment. In contrast, initial FHPP trials could achieve joint strengths up to 90% of the base materials in high-strength steel components, especially those used for petrochemical and thermal power plants. In particular, pressurized pipes and vessels of AISI 4140 steel are widely used in the power generation, oil and gas, and petrochemical industries. Initial studies on FHPP of this alloy have showed promising results. Fusion welding of AISI 4140 steel is usually recommended in annealed condition and with low hydrogen diffusible filler wires of relatively lower strength, e.g., ER70S-2 and ER80S-D2, because of the very high hardenability of Cr-Mo steels. Careful pre-heating and post weld heat treatments procedures must be followed to avoid cold cracking, reduce residual stresses and decrease impairment of HAZ properties in fusion welding of Cr-Mo and high carbon steels. Since FHPP is a solid-state joining process, several of the aforementioned issues can be alleviated. A systematic analysis of FHPP of Cr-Mo and Carbon steels is therefore needed but scarce in the literature. An increase in stud force led to faster plastic flow of the stud and therefore reduced the overall processing time and peak temperature. However, the effect of the reduced processing time and lower peak temperature on the joint properties were not well addressed in the literature. Improper selection of the stud force often led to \\"lack of filling\\" defects near the crack hole bottom in FHPP of high- strength steels. FHPP is also attempted under the water to reduce the peak temperature in components of high-strength line pipe X65 steels (Ref). However, the resulting joint exhibited a full martensite structure due to higher cooling rates. A fairly uniform hardness distribution across the joint was reported in FHPP of C-Mn steel especially at lower stud forces (Ref). Although these studies provided an insight into FHPP of steels, a quantitative understanding of the effect of process variables on the temperature field, cooling rate and resulting joint hardness distribution remained scarce in FHPP of high-strength steels. ==References== Category:Welding ","title":"Friction hydro pillar processing"},{"id":"56916456","text":"is the former head coach of the Kagoshima Rebnise in the Japanese B.League. ==Head coaching record== -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Renova Kagoshima  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2008-09  14311 style=\\"text- align:center;\\"7th in JBL2---  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"- -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Renova Kagoshima  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2009-10  21615 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"6th in JBL2---  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"- -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Renova Kagoshima  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2010-11  231112 style=\\"text- align:center;\\"4th in JBL2---  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"- -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Renova Kagoshima  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2011-12  27189 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"3rd in JBL2202  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"4th in JBL2 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Renova Kagoshima  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2015-16  36630 style=\\"text- align:center;\\"9th in NBDL---  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"- -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Kagoshima Rebnise  FFCCCC\\" \\"text-align:left;\\"2016-17  60753 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"6th in B2 Western---  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"relegated to B3 - ==References== Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:Japanese basketball coaches Category:Kagoshima Rebnise coaches Category:Kyushu University alumni ","title":"Toshihide Sameshima"},{"id":"56916496","text":"Spalangia cameroni is a species of parasitic wasp in the genus Spalangia that feeds on houseflies.

Based on an eponymous actor-turned-detective who embarks on several adventures solving murders, the titles include Piposh, Piposh 2, Halom SheItgashem (spinoff), and Piposh 3D: HaMahapecha. An English version of Piposh entitled Piposh: Hollywood was published in 2002. The series, which began in 1999, was created at a time when the Israeli video gaming industry was at its peak, particularly in terms of adventure gaming, and served as a notable example of a work targeted specifically at the young local market, with aspects such as inside jokes relating to Israeli culture. The games became very popular within Israel, although never becoming financially successful, and its developers struggled to live off the proceeds. Piposh evolved into a franchise, with a television series, a comic book, and an album being created. The series continues to have a dedicated fanbase, and Piposh conventions have been regularly held as a way for fans to celebrate the games together. While the titles have often been criticized for their amateurish visual style and clunky game mechanics, they are looked at fondly by critics who see Piposh as a source of Israeli pride and a key milestone in the advancement of the local industry throughout the 21st century. In November 2018, it was announced a reboot was in development, with the first part of a four-part game to be released in September 2020. == Plot and Gameplay == The series consists of point and click adventures, requiring players to interact with an inventory and with characters in order to complete puzzles and advance the story. The main character is intended to be a caricature of the arrogant Israeli, with a worldview that \\"the whole world is an idiot – and that talk can not be done quietly, only with shouting\\". The plot of Piposh follows the quirky adventures of its main character, flawed actor Hezi Piposh and \\"morbidly tactless guy in his attempts to reach Hollywood and make it big\\". In the first game, he boards the wrong boat and has numerous antics, including being caught up in a murder. He can interrogate characters, break into their rooms, and accuse them of murder. In Piposh 2, Piposh finds himself trapped on an island populated by dwarves, who help him assemble an aviation device to escape. Halom SheItgashem is focused on eight strange acquaintances who are invited to the castle of an eccentric man. Piposh 3D revolves around a political revolution that ensues because the entire country decides to become vegetarian, replacing meat with tofu. ==History Conception and In the Interest of Ratings (1997–98) === In the late 1980 while Ronan Gluzman was at the age of 13, he began his computer gaming career by creating games and animations on Macromedia Mac Director software. After he left the Israeli army and while his brother Roy was still a member, they set up a small graphics business in Pardes Hanna (פרדס חנה), where they did routine projects for commission. In 1997, one of their projects reached the desk of the CEO of video game distributor Hed Artzi Multimedia (הד ארצי מולטימדיה), the multimedia arm of Israeli record label Hed Arzi Music, who liked the illustration style of the duo and suggested they create a Hebrew-language computer game. He gave them NIS 10,000 in return for 50% of the future profits from the sales. Despite having no experience in the video gaming industry, the team went to work and after nine months of development, released In the Interest of Ratings (בתככי הרייטינג), a title which focused on the incompetent detective Elimelech Egoz (voiced by Moshe Ferster), who goes on holiday at the fictional Nofei Hadera Hotel only to be greeted by a bizarre murder case. The game contained intertextuality, inside jokes, irony, and cynicism. In the Interest of Ratings received negative reviews in the press, including in Internet Captain (קפטן האינטרנט), the technology/multimedia branch of the leading Israeli newspaper Haaretz; however it received positive reviews in youth-oriented newspapers. Ultimately the game was relatively popular, though it was not financially successful. But it led the duo to decide to try to develop a second video game, which would become Piposh, under their new development company Guillotine (גיליוטין). === Piposh (1998–99) === The Gluzman brothers wrote the text and the code, drew the backgrounds and characters, and created the animations; in addition they convinced actors Shai Avivi, Amos Shuv, Anat Magen, Ilan Peled, Dudu Zar, Meni Pe'er, and Ilan Ganani (as Piposh) to voice characters voluntarily. The game was developed by four people in a garage, at a time when the computer gaming industry in Israel was considered practically non-existent. Glutzman recalls that Guillotine was not particularly well managed, lacked business planning and didn't have a financial focus, and instead consisted of a naive team who wanted to simply make something \\"fun and cool\\". Ynet asserts the duo was irrational for choosing set up a development company for Israeli games that only appealed to the local market. Ronen would later describe the contemporary Israeli video gaming industry as an imaginary thing to pursue, for four young developers working from their garage. During development, Ronan used the program Macromedia Director 4, and he created each game screens from scratch. At the time of the game's release, Ronan published his phone number to allow stuck players to phone in for help. After a year and a half of development, Piposh was released; it became a hit among teenagers and sold 6000 copies over a period of one year in retail sales, and would ultimately sell or over 7000 copies. They achieved this without reducing the original selling price. Haaretz asserts that many thousands more probably illegally pirated it. The game reached 5th place on the sales charts, and for a few weeks was competitive with the best-selling games from abroad. Some of Piposh's royalties were donated to the animal rights and welfare organizations. The game originally had text and voice-work in Hebrew, though a few years later it was made available in both English and Russian, and due to its success Guillotine was able to distribute the games to the United States and Russia. Due to the title's low minimum requirements, it was able to be played on computers with weaker processing power. The game was deemed an adventure gaming success aimed primarily at the local market, having been developed independently, almost underground. While not officially a Piposh title, In the Interest of Ratings has a link to the series; within Piposh, the main character – a flawed actor – claims to have played Egoz in the previous game. === Rest of the series (2000–04) === Roy left the series during production of the second game, believing that in addition to piracy, the distribution networks weren't as efficient at bringing video games to stores as other products like Israeli music. According to Ronan, his brother did not have prowess in the business and marketing side to succeed in the industry. After leaving, Roy moved away from sensationalist nature of the entertainment and gaming industry, and instead focused in personal creative projects. On his own Ronan began to suffer financially, which would continue for years while making the Piposh games. By 2003 he was living on 30 shekels a day. He would later explain that at the time, to be a video game developer in Israel, one was expected not to make money. While the first game took 1.5 years to make, the team spent a year making Piposh 2, and a year making Halom SheItgashem. Each time the developers made a game, they did it independently and without external funding. Once a title neared completion, Guillotine spoke to their distribution company to print discs and send them to stores. However, as the distribution company was very large they didn't have time to invest into a small local game like Piposh so the games ended up being sent out two weeks later than intended, once the advertising and buzz had died down. For each title, Ronan produced advertising materials such as posters, business cards and funny stickers. Piposh 3D was the series' first foray into 3D graphics, after using traditional animation for the previous games; this title was directed by Roy Lazarowitz. By this point the developers had grown tired of their distributor and sought to use Indogram, which represented fewer games and could therefore invest more time into each. It was developed using the A5 engine, which Guillotine had purchased specifically for this title. 2004 saw the English release of Piposh entitled Piposh Holywood, which was to be published by The Phantom after Phantom Entertainment bought the distribution rights electronically. Ynet noted that if successful, it would have been a notable achievement for the industry, seeing the first Israeli video game released on console, but noting the unclear outcome of this venture. Guillotine had aimed to translate their first Piposh game to break it into the international market, however the text and dubbing translations became an astronomical task due to the original game having a badly-constructed programming interface. The foreign adaption of the first game is known worldwide by its English title. The games were not intended to meet the technological standards of the global industry, particularly in terms of graphics. They were not targeted at a worldwide audience, instead appealing to Israeli teenagers who were not necessarily gamers, but who wanted immature content with cultural references they would understand. Haaretz contends that despite the development team tapping into the minds of local youth, the rampant pirate copying phenomenon prevented them from making a living of their games. Piposh saw numerous opportunities for franchise expansion over its history. The team gave up a NIS 20,000 offer by Burger Ranch to distribute the games because they were vegetarians. Soon after the release of Piposh, the duo started creating a weekly comic section in the local youth newspapers Rosh 1 and Maariv LeYanar, and also created a comic book which was published by Hed Artzi, released under the title \\"Piposh and Other Vegetables\\" (פיפוש ושאר ירקות), which could be purchased from the official Guillotine site. They also lectured to youth at an animation and comics festival at the Tel Aviv Cinematheque. In 2000, the developers thought of porting Piposh to mobile phones, having already set up documents such as an instillation guide; however this never came to fruition. A spin-off television series named Batheshet Moav (בטשת מואב) – ten episodes in length and about five minutes per episode – first aired on the Beep channel in either 2001 or February 5, 2002. A previous concept for the show – where viewers could interact by choosing which of two outcomes they wanted to watch – was offered to Fox Kids. While Fox wanted to sign a contract, Guillotine refused as they did not want to give up the rights and the artistic freedom, for instance they would be censored from using the swear word קיבינימט and from mentioning that Piposh's father drowned in the Yarkon River. An album featuring music, interviews, and other content entitled At the Piposh Tavern was released by Guillotine and the Tag Group in 2004. A fourth game (excluding the spinoff) was to be released but this was eventually cancelled. Running until at least 2004, 'Piposh Congresses' have been held as national meeting for all the fans of Piposh and Guillotine. The developers sold an \\"I'm Pipposi Proud\\" game package, which included 5 game discs including the first three titles, plus a demo of Piposh 3D and a disc with rare files and documents. === Aftermath (2005–17) === The last title developed by Guillotine was the network-strategy nonsense game Vajimon, which saw players fight against each other over the internet using a variety of vegetables. Around 2003–4, the company's operations were terminated and its managers retired. Ronen left the industry soon after due to the financial and mental burden the series had given him, and became a yacht skipper. He earned money as a writer of games for interactive TV and cell phone in a leading high tech company. In 2005, the brothers lectured for a Gameology course at Beit Berl College as part of the first Israeli curriculum course for video game development. The program was started by Dr. Diana Silverman Keller who discovered while writing her thesis that there was no formal education in the field of game creation in the country. She noted that \\"Despite the success of Israeli high-tech, the Israelis do not excel at developing games\\". Keller contacted Ronan, who at the time was known as the \\"spiritual father of the Israeli gaming community\\", and he soon became a central figure in the program. On May 7, 2008, on Israel's 60th Independence Day, all Guillotine games were re-released free to download on the Internet. Ronan Gluzman noted that the games were unplayable unless the player had a Windows 95 computer, and commented \\"I felt that I had to do this, in order to save the game from falling into the abyss\\". By this time, it was impossible to get the games anymore, and there were no orderly backups. He noted it was strange to revisit these games after having not touched them since the series ended in 2003. Tal Dinovich, a fan of the series who had volunteered for years on the site and answered phone called from stuck players, helped locate all the game files and create updated versions that would work on Windows XP. While Ronan has since moved on from the series, he did create a Facebook group for the fans who had grown up with the series and wanted to reminisce. According to Calcalist, the series released 7 games, 4 of which are available for free download. As part of the campaign, Ronen aimed to print special nostalgic shirts, as this was a common fan request. In December 2008, a group of Piposh fans, believing that it had died prematurely, started a campaign to create a new chapter of the series and started looking for volunteers. The game, to be developed through their company Sellotape (סלוטייפ) was entitled Piposh 2.5 and the Stolen Vase. The official website of the project wrote that while the developers were unable to reach the quality level of the official games, they hoped to emulate it as much as possible. Their aim was to \\"remember, save, and enjoy\\" the Piposh series. The plot, taking place immediately after Piposh 2, saw the protagonist try to find the magic 'vase of life' that can be used to resurrect characters that died in the prequel. The producer/director was Ben Werchizer, the artist/designer was Daniel Avdo, the music and dubbing producer was Itay Jeroffi, and the writer was Shahar Kraus; they were looking for professional programmers in Director or Flash as well as voice talent. Their site contained a \\"build your own character\\" minigame from the series as a flash game, and a forum dedicated to the resurrection of Piposh. The project was discontinued around 2010. Video game archivist and founder of the Movement for Preservation of Games in Israel Raphael Ben-Ari got in touch with the series' creators and detailed the story behind its development process and in a documentary film. The documentary was uploaded to YouTube on Ben-Ari's Oldschool account. Ben- Ari believes the work boosted the Piposh community in Israel and introduced the series to many new people. In 2015, Renard was given the \\"Half Life\\" award at the 2015 GameIS Awards.due to his work on the series having a \\"significant impact on the short history of the Israeli gaming industry\\", thereby helping it to flourish. During this time, Piposh was surrounded by a loyal fanbase who held onto the franchise even while no games were in active development. Writing a game quote in one of the Piposh Facebook groups would be met with relevant written responses and memes, and links to legally download the games. Over the years, the large community of fans who love and reminisce over the series \\"ran Facebook groups, organized events and constantly asked for a new game\\". === Comeback (2018–Present) === In 2018, Piposh creators announced they would produce a reboot of the game, due for release in September 2019. == State of Israeli industry == Despite having a weak presence overall, the Israeli video gaming industry was at its peak in the 1990s, with several companies creating games, developing engines, and trying to become successful both at home and abroad. One example is Machshevet (מחשבת), which began as an importer and translator of games to the Israeli market. In the mid-1990s, the company would create children's video games based on popular legends and fairytales called 'CD F'doph' (סי.די פדוף\\"). Created during the golden age of the point and click adventure games, two of Machshevet's popular titles are: Dimension Commander: The Adventures of Wonderland (שליט המימדים: מסע ההרפתקאות המופלא) (1996) and Armed & Delirious (1997). Compedia (קומפדיה), while primarily a technologies, platforms and systems developer, also created educational computer games which were distributed to over 40 countries, including the Advanced Thinking Skills series (1992–93), the Timmy series (1994–95), the Gordy series (סדרת גורדי), the Itamar series (סדרת איתמר), Gordy in the Movie Adventure (גורדי בהרפתקה מהסרטים), In Search of the Lost Words (בעקבות המילים האבודות 1996/1998), and Julia: Back to the Sweet 60's (2001). Other notable Israeli video games of the time include: Xonix (1984), Intifada (אינתיפאדה 1989), and The Sea Dealer (סוחר הים 1989), Bonus (בונוס), Avish (אביש 1993), Duvalle (דובל'ה 1993-1997), Jane's IAF: Israeli Air Force (1998), and You Think You're Smart (אתה חושב שאתה חכם 1998-2001). Throughout the 1990s, Israeli developers also created various \\"silly little games...to promote children's food products\\" such as Vered Hagalil and Bamba. Factor believed that while the 80s and 90s saw the serious development of games within Israel, with the country being at the peak of its video gaming industry, it was still defined by a level of inferiority on the world stage, which had only started to improve in the early 2010s with social and casual gaming apps. Makorrishon wrote that Piposh was created at a time when it was generally accepted that to make good games one had to work abroad in a large company. Video game developer Adiel Gur thinks that Guillotine's did not have many contemporaries because of a lack of interest from high-tech companies to make games, a belief from producers that the sector is unprofitable, a lack of resources and tools for developers to make professional games, and the difficulty in amassing a team of workers from different fields (graphic artists, programmers, scriptwriters etc.). Ynet wrote that considering the number of Israelis studying computer science and the reputation of the country as a hub for high-tech entrepreneurs, it was surprising \\"how much an Israeli gaming industry does not exist\\", describing it as a \\"local vacuum\\". Roy explained that in his opinion: \\"People who have the ability to develop computer games prefer to develop navigation applications and worm software that will sabotage the reactor in Iran\\". In one case, the developers of Ballerium (2001) had to first present a comprehensive business plan in order to lure potential investors. In 2001, Ynet wrote that it was difficult to name Israeli games that were not children's edutainment, and though able to recall some popular titles, with exception to Jane's IAF: Israeli Air Force called them \\"negligible in terms of scope and technicality\\" and non-competitive in the global market. In 2008, the site asserted that until recently, apart from children's edutainment developer Compedia and the Piposh series, there was no video gaming industry in Israel, though expressed hope that the action game Rising Eagle would change that. Meanwhile, in 2008 Eser wrote: \\"It's not that I think there is no future for the Israeli computer games industry, and that there is no need to nurture it\\". == Critical reception == The games became a cult hit in Israel, known for their unique humor, original characters and a satirical look at Israeli society. Ronen is notable for being one of a few Israelis who have managed to develop a computer game within the country and distribute it in Israel. According to Timeout, the games are hilarious and brave. Eser felt that Piposh was a \\"semi-decent adventure game\\". Bikorate felt the title had a \\"fascinating plot and humor ahead of its time\\". The student newsletter Factor thought the game was \\"more funny, more ingenious, and generally more universal\\" than In the Interest of Ratings had been a year earlier, and felt the two games were \\"exemplary examples of Israeli creativity\\". Sport5 listed the game in their article There is honor: the greatest Israeli computer games ever, rating it 10/10 and praising its unique crazy and sharp sense of creativity and humour, as well as for sparking one of the \\"most cohesive computer game communities ever in the country\\". Haaretz deemed it ultimately a failed initiative to establish the Israeli video gaming industry, despite its significance. Vgames deemed the series \\"the most daring attempt to create computer games for Israeli audiences only\\". In 2001, Ynet asserted that the few games of Israeli origin such as Piposh were \\"quite negligible in terms of scope and technicality\\", and were \\"not close to being competitive in the global market\\", however in 2003 the site saw the series as a source of Israeli pride. The site would later come to feel that the series offered some of the most \\"bizarre, funny and hallucinatory quests\\" to come out of gaming, noting that the first title is widely regarded as a cult game, and that many peculiar moments from the series are etched into the minds of players. Bikorate thought Piposh 2 surprised with its \\"witty and satirical jokes about Israeli society\\". The Hebrew site Eser, despite having sympathy for Israeli game developers, who are \\"forced to work in almost impossible conditions\\" when compared to their American and European colleagues, gave Piposh 3D a scathing review; while calling its premise amusing, and noting that the patient Piposh fanbase would overlook its inferior graphics the site felt the game was very bad, likening it to a \\"singer singing without makeup\\". Ynet criticised 3D's graphics and interface, though noted its humour and charm might make up for the experience. Ben-Ari feels a sense of patriotism toward the game as a piece of video gaming software that is proudly and unabashedly Israeli. Factor thought the series attempt to enter the 3D market was an \\"utter failure\\". Even though Walla thought Piposh 3D was a bad game, it thought the game looked like a masterpiece in comparison with Dangerous Vaults, a Lara Croft parody that forces players to have sex with animals. When news of a fan-made Piposh 2.5 was brought to Nana 10, the site made an emotional appeal to its readers, hoping to attract anyone who could \\"help this promising project take shape\\", while hoping it would be the first of many. Meanwhile, 2all.co.il wished the developers success. Noting a recent campaign to name a road in Israel \\"Lara Croft street\\", Nana 10 hoped that soon there would be a \\"Piposh street\\" to honour the series. The paper believed Piposh to the possibly the most successful and profitable Israeli computer gaming project, deeming Guillotine a champion of the local industry. Makorrishon deemed Guillotine a \\"stubborn pioneer\\" due to persisting with making a game in Israel, though noted that despite their bravery, the company did close down a mere 6 years later. Looking back at the games in 2008, Ronen was impressed at how the humour held up, and noted ultimately that Piposh is \\"not a game of technology, but of people, behavior and relationships\\". Comedy Children listed the original title as the only Israeli entry in an article entitled \\"The Most Funny Games\\".http://comedychildren.com/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%97%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%9E%D7%A6%D7%97%D7%99%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%9D/ According to Gadgety, the games have \\"earned cult status among Israeli players\\". Calcalist deemed it \\"most important series of games - well, the only one - that was done in Israel in this millennium\\". Additionally, it argued that the series' humor that combined the nonsense of LucasArts and Sierra with the experimental weirdness of Channel 2. Ronen has said that \\"What Piposh is good at is being crazy, being delusional and telling a good story with an emphasis on humor and Israeliness\\". ==References External links == * Renan (Renard) and Roi Gluzman are hosted at the Magnet (Channel 6) (Hebrew video) * A rare interview with Renard and Roi Gluzman (Hebrew video) * Interview with Moshe Ferster in Zumbit (Hebrew video) * Renard and Roy in Zumbit (Hebrew video) * The funniest game in Hebrew (and how it was developed) – Oldschool (Hebrew video) * A search in a balloon (Hebrew video) * Miyazaki interview (Hebrew podcast) * Google Drive of game documents * Piposh 3D review (Hebrew) * 1999 notes by Guillotine 2 Category:1999 video games Category:Adventure games Category:Video games developed in Israel Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games ","title":"Piposh"},{"id":"56916579","text":"Sandra Božić (; born 15 October 1979) is a politician in Serbia.

Inspired by research in neurologic diseases, he interned at the Duke University Hospital and was accepted into the Research Training Program in Molecular Biology at Duke University Medical School. He then spent two years in a Neurology residency at University of Miami - Jackson Memorial Hospital. Barry is married to Kansas City artist, Shea Gordon. ==Career== During the Vietnam War era, he spent his military requirement doing research at the Medical Neurology Branch of the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Blindness in Bethesda, Maryland. At NIH he established a new laboratory, the Muscle Membrane Biochemistry Laboratory, branching into novel state-of-the-art research in the field. In 1976, he was recruited to the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC) to establish a clinical neurology service and the Neurobiology Research Laboratory at the Kansas City VA Medical Center. During the course of 35 years researching, he was awarded the Medical Investigator Research Award and won other awards. During that time he was inducted into the American Society for Clinical Investigation, the American Neurological Association, and the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. He has published more 200 scientific articles and edited three books. He retired from the VA in 2010 and founded pHLOGISTIX, a neurodiagnostic and therapeutic biotech company, while still a professor at KUMC. ==pHLOGISTIX== Dr. Festoff's career has involved translational research into neurologic diseases, especially the relationship between neurotrauma and its evolution to neurodegeneration. His lifetime of research has led to the founding of pHLOGISTIX, a company that focuses on blood-based biomarkers as companion diagnostics for neurotrauma and neurodegenerative diseases such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in order to harness neuroinflammation and improve functional outcomes following trauma to the central nervous system (CNS). The ultimate goal is to provide a validated panel of nucleic acid and protein biomarkers in a novel analytic approach to allow the identification of patients with CTE and AD before symptoms develop, i.e., preclinical, while still at the stage of mild cognitive impairment, especially after early detection of concussions. == References == Category:1940 births Category:Living people Category:University of Florida alumni Category:University of Miami alumni Category:University of Kansas faculty Category:American neurologists Category:Duke University staff ","title":"Barry Festoff"},{"id":"56916760","text":"The Abraham Ditto House, at 204 Elm St. in West Point, Kentucky, is a historic house built in 1823.

Many of them were since replaced by modern hardware. Joanne Urioste (born c. 1952) and George Urioste (born c. 1937) are American rock climbers, who made over a hundred first ascents, in Red Rock Canyon. George Urioste, also known as Jorge Urioste, was born in Chile, to a Bolivian father, and holds citizenship in both countries. Jorge became a Jesuit priest, and moved to the United States to study at Cornell University. There he met and started climbing with Joanne. Joanne grew up in Brooklyn and worked on her bachelor's degree in life science at Cornell, while George was working on his PhD. In 1974, having just finished their studies, they married and moved to Las Vegas,; History chapter where George began teaching anthropology and linguistics at University of Nevada, Las Vegas. In the next decade, they established over a hundred new routes, many of which, such as Crimson Chrysalis, Epinephrine, Dream of Wild Turkeys and Levitation 29 are now some of Red Rock's most famous and popular climbs. The popularity of Urioste routes stems from the fact that most are long multi-pitch routes, following striking lines, and which were made relatively safe by placing bolts in blank sections. That resulted in some climbs which were strongly opposed by some local climbers at the time (mid 1970s to mid 1980s), who emphasized bolt-free boldness in their ascents. In 1984 Joanne wrote a climbing guide book, called The Red Rocks of Southern Nevada and in 1986, after the arrival of their children, they retired from climbing for ten years, during which Joanne took up ultra distance running, especially through wilderness and mountains, having completed six one hundred mile races, as well as 165 miles on the John Muir Trail (Whitney Portal to Red's Meadow; in 1996) in five days flat, solo, and self supported. After their ten-year retirement from climbing, they returned and are continuing to establish a number of significant routes in Red Rock, some of which are 1500 to 2400 feet long (Inti Watana, Gift of the Wind Gods, Woman of Mountain Dreams, Twixt Cradle and Stone, and Slim). George taught anthropology and linguistics at University of Nevada for over 35 years and is fluent in English, Spanish, Italian, French, Quechua, Catalan, and some German. Joanne has been working as a registered nurse since 1999.

Proctor Hospital, 562 U.S. 411 (2011), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States, in which the Court held that employers are still liable under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act if they fire an employee based on the recommendation of a subordinate who is acting out of hostility towards the employee's military obligations, even if the firing employer is not aware of or does not hold those discriminatory views himself. ==BackgroundStatutory provisions=== The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) was passed by Congress in 1994 to guarantee to military reservists a return to their civilian jobs after their deployments. The law also offers protection against termination or other retaliation against current and former military members because of their military obligations. USERRA says, in part, that: ===Lower court proceedings=== The case arose when Vincent Staub, the plaintiff, was terminated from his job as a radiology technician at Proctor Hospital in Illinois in April 2004. Staub was a member of the Army Reserve and was periodically required to take time off of work for training. According to Staub, Janice Mulally and Michael Korenchuk, two of Staub's supervisors, were openly hostile towards him and belittled his military obligations. In 2004, Korenchuk advised the hospital's vice-president of human resources, Linda Buck, that Staub had broken a rule about remaining in the hospital while not seeing patients, despite the fact that Staub had merely visited the hospital's cafeteria and Staub had left a note for his supervisors explaining his absence after he could not contact them directly. Staub was fired from his job for the alleged breach of the minor infraction. He sued the hospital, claiming that the complaint against him was a sham, and that the real reason he had been fired was due to the hatred of military members demonstrated by his supervisors. The jury sided with Staub and awarded him damages, but the hospital appealed the judgement. The Seventh Circuit reversed the jury's decision, and found in favor of the hospital. Staub appealed, and was granted certiorari by the Supreme Court. ==The Supreme Court's decision== The Supreme Court reversed the decision made by the Seventh Circuit in a unanimous 8-0 vote on , with Justice Elena Kagan recusing herself. In the Court's opinion, written by Justice Antonin Scalia, the Court opined that \\"since a supervisor is an agent of the employer, when he causes an adverse employment action the employer causes it; and when discrimination is a motivating factor in his doing so, it is a 'motivating factor in the employer's action.'” Therefore, if a biased supervisor tries to get an employee fired, and that employee is in fact fired as a result, then the fired employee can sue the employer for employment discrimination, \\"even if the biased supervisor is not the final decision maker and even if the final decision maker is unbiased.\\" ==See also== *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 562 ==References * Category:2011 in United States case law Category:United States employment discrimination case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court ","title":"Staub v.

He sat on the Legislative Yuan from 1996 to 1999, was a member of the National Assembly in 2005, and served on the Control Yuan between 2008 and 2014. ==Career== Chou attended National Taiwan University (NTU), and completed graduate studies at Columbia University. He was a reporter for the China Times and United Daily News, then taught at NTU and National Chengchi University. Chou was elected to the Legislative Yuan in 1995 from Taipei 1. He represented the New Party and was the party's caucus convener. After stepping down from the Legislative Yuan, Chou returned to NTU as a political analyst. In this position, he spoke to the media regarding foreign affairs, public opinion, the political nomination process, and constitutional reform. Though it was reported that Chou had accepted a nomination from the People First Party in the legislative elections of 2001, he was not elected to the Legislative Yuan for a second term. Instead, he represented the New Party in a case before the Central Election Commission regarding the joint nomination of Wang Chien-shien. He continued teaching at NTU, and also served as an advisor to the Control Yuan. Chou was elected to the National Assembly in 2005, and attended the legislative body's final meeting prior to its suspension. By 2007, he had joined the faculty of Chinese Culture University, and, backed by the New Party, launched an unsuccessful bid for the Legislative Yuan. Shortly thereafter, Chou was nominated and confirmed for a seat on the Control Yuan. In July 2009, Chou and began investigating the Miaoli County Government's decision to remove kilns in Houlong Township in favor of urban redevelopment. Chou aided other probes regarding infrastructure, public land use, and immigration. In November 2010, Chou motioned to impeach Hu Chen-pu for misusing government funds. In January 2011, Chou disputed Lai Shin-yuan's statement that Taiwanese citizens have free choice with regard to the future because the Constitution of the Republic of China mandates unification with the mainland. That year, Chou participated in reviews exploring the possibility of simultaneous presidential and legislative elections for 2012, the South China Sea territorial disputes, and the average age of Taiwanese diplomats. In August, Chou and Ma Hsiu-ru's report on management practices at the Central News Agency led to the censure of the Government Information Office and Executive Yuan. Three months after the action against the GIO, Chou launched an investigation into Vanessa Shih, Taiwan's representative to Singapore. Upon completing the report in July 2012, Chou advocated for its conclusions to be declassified. Chou's agency eventually decided against his proposal. Though the United Daily News speculated that Chou would resign over this disagreement, he did not do so. Chou ended 2012 by finishing probes into social services for indigenous people and air pollution, while commencing an investigation into the construction of Miramar Resort Village on Shanyuan Bay in Taitung. In April 2013, a report authored by Chou pushed authorities to declassify documents relating to the 228 Incident. Controversially, this report quoted , who stated that Lee Teng-hui was of Japanese descent. That July, a report written by Chou and Ma Hsiu-ru led to the censure of the Ministry of Culture. Chou left the Control Yuan at the end of his six-year term in 2014, and later joined the faculty of National Quemoy University. ==References== Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:National Taiwan University alumni Category:National Taiwan University faculty Category:Columbia University alumni Category:Chinese Culture University faculty Category:National Chengchi University faculty Category:Taiwanese journalists Category:New Party Members of the Legislative Yuan Category:Taipei Members of the Legislative Yuan Category:Members of the 3rd Legislative Yuan Category:Taiwanese Members of the Control Yuan ","title":"Chou Yang-shan"},{"id":"56917145","text":"Byodo-ji (Byodo Temple literally: Equality Temple) (Japanese: 平等寺) is a Koyasan Shingon temple in Anan, Tokushima Prefecture, Japan.

It is associated with the place to which the cloak of the Prophet Muhammad was brought and with a visit from Ali, the son-in-law and cousin of Prophet Muhammad, who would become the fourth Caliph and first of the Twelve Imams. The shrine is located at the foot of the Asmayi Hill, now better known as Television Hill. To its north and west is the Sakhi Cemetery. It is believed that the shrine marks the spot where the cloak of Prophet Muhammad was kept on its way to its present location in the Shrine of the Cloak in Kandahar. The cloak is said to have been woven by Muhammad himself with the help of his daughter Fatima, her husband, and Muhammad's cousin, Ali, and their sons, Hasan and Husayn. Before Muhammad died, he bequeathed his cloak to Uwais al-Qarani, telling Ali and Umar that Uwais should be given the cloak on his death. After the Prophet's death, Uwais took the cloak to the Cave of Hira on Jabal al-Nour, where Muhammad received his first revelation. It is believed to have remained in the cave until it was taken to Baghdad by Shaykh al-Uliya Qutba al-Atqiya. Timur would later seize it and take to his capital of Samarqand, where is would stay until 1076/1665-66. The cloak was then taken to India, from where it was taken to Balkh, in the west of today's Afghanistan, by the then governor of the city, Mir Yar Beg. He built a fort in Juzgun, Badakhshan, to house the garment securely. Following the move of the cloak to Juzgun, the settlement became known as Fayzabad. The cloak would remain there for seventy-nine years. In 1181/1767-8, Ahmad Shah Durrani decided to move the cloak to his capital of Kandahar. He entrusted the move to Shah Wali Khan E'temad al-Dawla. The cloak was taken on its journey by a group of the most pious men. Kabul was on the route south from Fayzabad, and it was near the edge of the town that the group stopped to rest and allow local people to view the cloak. One day, the men carrying the cloak noticed a man wearing green praying by it. On the third night, they dreamt that the man in green came to see the cloak once more. When he removed his sword from its sheath and placed it on a nearby rock they noticed that its blade had a double tip. They recognised the sword as Zulfiqar and its owner as Imam Ali. The rock on which Ali is believed to have placed his sword is now encompassed by the shrine building. When the men awoke, they knew that a shrine should be built on this spot. Ahmad Shah patronised the building of the first structure, with one dome over the rock. The cloak remained here for eight months, before continuing its journey south to Kandahar, where it remains today. It was notably brought out of its shrine and worn by Mullah Omar in 1996. A second dome was added to the shrine by the mother of Amanullah Khan in 1919. The four additional domes were added during renovations which took place between 2008 and 2016.This history of the cloak of the Prophet and the Sakhi shrine is taken from the history given in an inscription on the wall inside the men's side of the shrine. The shrine is decorated with glazed tiles in a neo-Safavid, Iranian style. The building bears many inscriptions, including dedicatory texts, Qurʾanic excerpts, prayers, Hadith, and poetry. Every year, a popular Nowruz celebration is held outside the shrine, during which a large banner is raised in remembrance of Imam Ali, who was the standard-bearer of the Prophet. A small underground shrine can be accessed from the women's side of the building. Cut into the bed rock, a tight staircase leads down to a small cavelike chamber were women now leave petitions and votive offerings. On the men's side, there is a hand-print relic. The shrine is visited mainly by Hazaras, a Shiʿi community. Largely due to this, the shrine has been victim to a number of significant attacks, including the March 2018 Kabul suicide bombing. == References == Category:Shrines in Afghanistan Category:Mosques in Afghanistan ","title":"Sakhi Shrine"},{"id":"56917439","text":"Franco Nicolás Pérez (born 1 January 1996) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for Independiente Rivadavia. ==Club career== Pérez began in Newell's Old Boys' youth, before appearing for the first time in the first-team in September 2015 for a victory away to Estudiantes.

It has also been referred to as murder mystery. It was released on 6 April 2018. Missing marks the directorial debut of Mukul Abhyankar. Along with acting in it, Bajpayee also co-produced the film under his eponymous film production banner, which is also the banner's first co-produced film. Last seen in Ghaath, Bajpayee and Tabu are reunited in this film after eighteen years. Annu Kapoor learnt French for the character of a Mauritian cop he played in the film. ==Plot== The film opens with Sushant Dubey preparing to go for a business trip. He arrives at a resort in Mauritius with his wife Aparna and their 3-year-old daughter Titli. Sushant persuades the resort's receptionist Naina to upgrade his single room to a double room. They settle in after a while and Sushant and Aparna make love. The man in the room below is shown to be creeping about and peeping into rooms. When Titli goes missing in the middle of the night, this man is shown to be the main suspect. It is revealed that Sushant and Aparna are not married to each other. They met on the ferry to Mauritius. Sushant is in an unhappy marriage and Aparna is divorced. They talk and bond and Sushant invites Aparna to spend the next couple days with him. That is how they came to the resort. When Titli suddenly goes missing Aparna throws a fit. Sushant does not want their liaison to become public and the resort manager does not want to invite police scrutiny upon the resort. They try their best to find Titli but their efforts to contain the situation are foiled when Aparna calls the police. Police inspector Buddhu begins the investigation. The CCTV footage first points to the creepy neighbor who has since checked out of the hotel. Over the protests of the resort manager the photograph of the neighbor is flashed on television and he is soon spotted about town with a little girl. When he is hauled in, Aparna finds that the girl is not Titli, and the man reveals that the girl is his own daughter. His ex-wife now has custody and the man visits the daughter once a month. Buddhu calls in a sketch artist who draws two sketches based on the descriptions given, separately, by Aparna and Sushant. The sketches turn out to be completely different. Under intense grilling, Sushant discloses that Aparna could not bear children and the strain led to a mental breakdown. Titli is a hallucination, a figment of Aparna's imagination. Later in his room, Sushant tells Aparna that he cannot carry on the charade any more. Sushant later confesses to Buddhu that he and Aparna are not married and that they merely had an affair at the resort. He did not see Titli's face. Back in his room, Sushant tells Aparna that he has kidnapped Titli at the behest of his friend who is Aparna's ex-husband. He threatens Aparna and rushes her out of the resort. As they run through the forest Aparna stops for a breath and asks for Titli. Sushant reveals that he did not know or kidnap Titli. Aparna now reveals that he was right. There was no 3-year-old but Titli does exist. An old man arrives at the resort and asks after his daughter Titli. Buddhu is puzzled. The old man shows a photograph of Titli, who turns out to be Aparna. It is revealed that she is a dangerous mental patient who managed to escape from an asylum. As the old man, Titli's natural father, reveals the story of how Titli ended up in the asylum, the film ends as the deranged Titli attacks and kills Sushant with a meat Cleaver in the middle of the forest. ==Cast== * Tabu as Aparna Dubey ' Mrs. Dubey * Manoj Bajpayee as Sushant Dubey a.k.a.

Her interests included the poor, minorities, women, education, and the arts. She co-authored two books discussing medical studies on sex adjustment and sex education with Robert Latou Dickinson, and a noted memoir of growing up in turn-of-the-century Marshfield, Maine. She was the long-time companion of Louise Stevens Bryant. ==Early life and education== Lura Beam was born in Marshfield, Maine, in 1887. After graduating from the area high school in 1904, she attended the University of California at Berkeley for two years before transferring to Barnard College. She graduated from the latter institution in 1908. In 1907 she earned a master's degree from Columbia University. ==Career== Beam started her working life with the American Missionary Association. She worked as a teacher in black-only schools in Wilmington, North Carolina, and Memphis, Tennessee, for three years and then became an administrator with the organization, serving as Assistant Superintendent of Education in the Deep South. She went on to work for other non-profit institutions such as the Association of American Colleges and Universities (1919–1926), the National Committee on Maternal Health (1927–1933), the General Education Board in New York City, the Interchurch World Movement, and the American Association of University Women (1937–1952). As head of the arts department of the American Association of University Women in the 1940s, Beam helped assemble a series of traveling art exhibitions that circulated among AAUW branches. These exhibits, attended by more than 770,000 viewers, presented \\"artwork based on themes such as the artwork of Colorado or Mexican children, trends in American painting, and African sculpture\\", as well as modern art and reproductions by Picasso, Matisse, Klee, and Roualt. Beam retired in 1952 but continued to write and organize art exhibitions; she also assembled research on aging and retirement. ==Works== Beam co-authored two books with physician Robert Latou Dickinson, A Thousand Marriages: A medical study of sex adjustment (1931) and The Single Woman: A medical study in sex education (1934). In these books, Beam \\"adopted a feminist perspective by focusing on the changing historical context that affected women's lives between 1895 and 1930, as well as by analyzing the dominant-submissive relationship between the male physician (Dickinson) and his female patients\\". Beam is best known in her home state for her 1957 work A Maine Hamlet, which one review called \\"the book that a generation of readers treasured as the most perceptive account of traditional life in Maine ever written\\". Beam wrote vividly about growing up with her grandparents in Marshfield, Maine, at the turn of the century, describing the residents, institutions, lifestyle and community tenets. ==Personal life== Beam was the long-time companion of Louise Stevens Bryant, whom she met while working for the Committee on Maternal Health in the 1920s. Their relationship spanned nearly 35 years. Bryant was the one who encouraged Beam to write her memories of small-town life in her book A Maine Hamlet (1957). After Bryant's death in 1957, Beam prepared her biography in the work Bequest from a Life: A biography of Louise Stevens Bryant (1963). Beam died in 1978. Her papers are held by the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University. ==Selected bibliography== Beam's works include: *, republished 1970 (with Robert Latou Dickinson) *, republished in 1987 (with Robert Latou Dickinson) * *, republished in the mid-1980s and in 2000 * * ==References *\\"A Thousand Marriages: A medical study of sex adjustment\\" (full text) Category:1887 births Category:1978 deaths Category:20th-century American women writers Category:Writers from Maine Category:Barnard College alumni Category:Columbia University alumni ","title":"Lura Beam"},{"id":"56917818","text":"River Delta Law firm is an international law firm, headquartered in Shanghai.

The alloys contain two to five metals. Some scholars believe that methods similar to those involved in irogane production may also have been used in ancient Egypt and the Roman world, as well as China (wu tan) and Tibet (dzne- ksim).Tokyo, Japan, Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music, 1983: Hachiro Oguchi, \\"Japanese Shakudo\\"Merano, Italy, 2016: Giumlia-Mair, \\"Technology Transfer from Ancient Egypt to the Far East?\\", p. 1, \\"The materials discussed ... are artificially patinated copper-based alloys containing small amounts of precious metals such as gold and silver ... treated in aqueous solutions, so as to achieve various surface colors. ... some artificially patinated alloys in different colors ... similar to other modern Japanese alloys ... were identified on Western objects dating to Roman times\\" – also referencing Craddock (1982), etc. ==History== Raw copper with natural impurities, including yamagane, and highly refined copper (akagane, motogane) have been known from early times, and the alloys can be traced back between 300–900 years, or possibly as much as 1200. Shakudo, for example, may be referenced back to at least the 12th century.Tokyo, Japan, Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music, 1983: Hachiro Oguchi, \\"Japanese Shakudo\\": \\"shakudo finds mention ... Japanese swords of the Edo period ... the sword owned by a military commander of Genji (Nasuno-Yoichi ... in the 12th century) was ornamented with shakudo\\" Shibuichi has a history of 550–750 years, with samples known from the 1630s. Due to the precious metal content, shakudo and shibuichi were always used sparingly, for small fittings on weapons, doors, small containers, or furniture.Tokyo, Japan, Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music, 1983: Hachiro Oguchi, \\"Japanese Shakudo\\": \\"shakudo was utilised in various works of art, but found special application in the ornamentation of swords and their accessories, especially sword guards (tsuba), in metal catches (hikite) of sliding doors ... and in the decoration of metal boxes and other items\\" The single most common historical usage was on the fitting known as a tsuba that is fitted below the pommel of the swords carried by samurai and the shōgun, and in fact the banning of ceremonial sword-wearing under the Meiji Restoration had a material impact on production of the irogane metals. ==Etymology== Irogane, or iro-gane, simply means \\"coloured metals\\". The same kanji character (金) is sometimes used for metal (\\"kane\\" or \\"gane\\"), gold (\\"kin\\") and silver (\\"gin\\"), and aside from the name irogane itself, these are elements of some of the irogane metal names. Others involve a combination of name elements from component metals and colours, for example, and one a reference to alloy composition proportions. ==Nature== The better known irogane metals include: ; Shakudo or shaku-do (literally \\"red copper\\")Oxford, Butterworth-Heinemannm 1993: La Niece and Craddock, eds, Metal Plating and Patination: cultural, technical and historical developments – Chap. 7, Murakami, Ryu, \\"Japanese Traditional Alloys\\": an alloy of copper and gold, usually with 3-6% gold, but sometimes as low as 1% and as high as 10%,New Haven, CT, USA: The American Journal of Science and Arts, Series 2, Vol. 42, eds. Sillman and Dana, et al., 1866: Raphael Pumpelly, \\"on Japanese alloys\\" or higher. Tin is also sometimes also added, among other metals. In raw form, shakudo looks very like plain but slightly darkened copper, but depending on the patination process used, the final colour can be a lustrous purple to violet black, or a shade of purple (some shades are described as \\"like dark grapes\\"). Variations include shi-kin or kurasaki-kin, \\"purple gold\\", and u-kin, \\"cormorant gold,\\"London, 1915: The Transactions of the Japan Society, vol. XIII: \\"Metals and Metal-working of Old Japan\\" as presented by Prof. Wm. Gowland, A.R.S.M., F.R.C, F.I.C., F.S.A. or \\"karasu-kin.\\" In earlier times, there were perhaps fifteen different grades of shakudo. A pseudo- shakudo with no gold content was also produced at least once by the Japanese Imperial Mint. ; Shibuichi or shibu-ichi: an alloy of copper and silver, with the silver percentage usually between 15% and 40%, but varying as widely as 2% to 60%. The name means one quarter, a reference to one common formula. The raw alloy is of gun-metal grey or very pale bronze colour, while final colours include a wide range of greys, especially suitable for precious metal inlay work, but also browns, greens and even shades of blue-green. A variation with added gold is known as kuro shibuichi, and another is obore shirogane, \\"white metal with the colour of the veiled moon.\\" There are also related compounds, such as sambogin and hojigin. ; Kuromido or kuromi-do: a mix of copper and arsenic, which some sources believe might have been equivalent to nigurome (ni-kuromi-do), mentioned in earlier accounts, and sometimes described as a substitute for shakudo, and sometimes used as a component in making further alloys instead of raw copper ; Akagane or suaka: refined copper, often with a naturally-occurring small percentage of zinc or lead, which patination leaves somewhere between light orange and dark red ; Yamagane, \\"mountain metal\\": is raw copper, often containing some of one of more of tin, lead, silver and arsenicTerminology (glossary) of swords – Yamagane accessed 31 March 2018 ; Sentoku: an alloy of copper, zinc, tin and lead, final colour yellow to brown ; Shinchu: a brass-like mix of copper, zinc and lead, usually 75–84% copper, and just 1–5% lead ; Karakane: a bronze-like mix of copper, lead and tin, usually 77–93% copper, and 2–8% tin According to William Gowland, a professor and senior member of the Japan Society in London (who was for a time Director of the Imperial Japanese Mint), aside from copper with natural impurities, the Japanese craftsmen would sometimes add a \\"pseudo-speiss\\" (a mix including some arsenic and / or antimony) to copper ore to make a base for production alloys. ==Finishing== The colouring and finishing of irogane surfaces generally involves polishing and cleaning, and chemical patination, and might include some final waxing or other treatment. ===Patination=== The chemical colouring of the surface is the key to irogane metals, and the details of the processes, and especially the compositions of the materials used to bathe the metals, are passed on within Japanese craft circles, and not widely documented, though some information was written down from the middle of the Edo period, and published more generally, in Japanese, in the early 20th century. Some simple recipes have been circulated, and some analysis of treated surfaces done in an attempt to understand the topic further, with considerable but still partial success. This process, an instance of soft-metal patination, known as niiro(-eko), or nikomi-chakushoku, and involving rokushō, has a history of at least 600 years but given references to at least one irogane metal, shakudo, go back 900 or more years, some similar process must have a like history. Many of the patination processes involve boiling the metal in the modifying solution, and the final colour can depend on the duration of the boiling period, which may range from minutes to hours. Suaka, for example, may advance from a light brown after 2–4 hours, to orange-brown after 6 hours, to red towards 10 hours. Notably, the traditional patination methods affect each metal differently, and have little or no effect on silver and gold elements, allowing for interesting effects when an object comprising multiple metals is patinated in one go to produce multiple final colours. Other effects are created by cutting through layers of patination to let underlying surfaces show through partly. ==See also== * Mokume-gane * Corinthian bronze and hepatizon (Black bronze) * Electrum * Orichalcum * Panchaloha * Tumbaga ==References== ","title":"Irogane"},{"id":"56917975","text":"Voices is a studio album by American bassist Gary Peacock featuring pianist Masabumi Kikuchi, percussist Masahiko Togashi and drummer Hiroshi Murakami.

The encounter was filmed by police video cameras and by a Sacramento County Sheriff's Department helicopter which was involved in observing Clark on the ground and in directing ground officers to the point at which the shooting took place. The officers stated that they shot Clark, firing 20 rounds, believing that he had pointed a gun at them. Police found only a cell phone on him. While the Sacramento County Coroner's autopsy report concluded that Clark was shot seven times, including three shots to the right side of the back, the pathologist hired by the Clark family stated that Clark was shot eight times, including six times in the back. The shooting caused large protests in Sacramento, and Clark's family members have rejected the initial police description of the events leading to Clark's death. The Sacramento Police Department placed the officers on paid administrative leave and opened a use of force investigation. Police have stated they are confident that Clark was the suspect responsible for breaking windows in the area prior to the encounter. On March 2, 2019, the Sacramento County district attorney announced that the Sacramento police officers who killed Clark would not be charged and that they had probable cause to stop Clark and were legally justified in the use of deadly force.The New York Times, No Charges in Sacramento Police Shooting of Stephon Clark, March 2, 2019 == Stephon Clark == Stephon Clark (born Stephan Alonzo-Clark, August 10, 1995 – March 18, 2018) an African American, graduated from Sacramento High School in 2013, where he was on the football team. He was 22 years old at the time he was killed. According to The Los Angeles Times, Clark lived in a \\"tough neighborhood\\" characterized by tense relations with the Sacramento Police Department. His older brother, Stevante Clark, told KOVR that he and Stephon had come from \\"underprivileged, broken homes\\". Their 16-year-old brother was killed in a shooting in 2006. Stephon had been released from county jail about a month before the shooting and was staying with his grandparents on and off. His brother said, \\"He was arrested before, but he's been different lately. He really changed his life.\\" Sacramento County court records show that Clark had a history of convictions for robbery, domestic abuse, and a prostitution-related offense. At the time of his death he was on probation for a 2014 robbery conviction. According to the investigation, Clark had searched online for ways to commit suicide.The New York Times, No Charges in Sacramento Police Shooting of Stephon Clark, March 2, 2019 A toxicology report also released by police found traces of cocaine, cannabis, and codeine in Clark's system. Codeine and hydrocodone were found in Clark's urine. Multiple leaders in the community opined that Clark's criminal record was immaterial to his death. == Probation violation and search for Clark == On March 16, a neighbor called the police to report on behalf of Salena Mohamed Manni, the mother of Clark’s child, to report that the two had been arguing and the argument had turned violent. When police arrived at their apartment, Clark was not present, but officers found Manni with extensive injuries to her face and a hole in the wall of the apartment. Clark, on probation from two domestic violence convictions and one conviction of assault with a deadly weapon, evaded police in the days leading up to the shooting. == Shooting == The Sacramento Police Department stated that on Sunday, March 18 at 9:18 p.m., two officers responded to a 9-1-1 call that an individual was breaking car windows. In a media release after the shooting, police stated that they had been looking for a suspect hiding in a backyard. They said the suspect was a thin black man, in height, wearing darkly colored pants and a black hooded sweatshirt. A sheriff's helicopter spotted a man at 9:25 p.m., in a nearby backyard and told officers on the ground that he had shattered a window using a tool bar, run to the front of that house, and then looked in an adjacent car. Officers on the ground entered the front yard of Clark's grandmother's home, and saw Clark next to the home. Vance Chandler, the Sacramento Police Department spokesman, said that Clark was the same man who had been breaking windows, and was tracked by police in helicopters. Chandler said that when Clark was confronted and ordered to stop and show his hands, Clark fled to the back of the property. Police body camera footage from both of the officers who shot Clark recorded the incident, though the footage is dark and shaky. In the videos, officers spot Clark in his grandmother's driveway and shout \\"Hey, show me your hands. Stop. Stop.\\" The video shows that the officers chased Clark into the backyard and an officer yells, \\"Show me your hands! Gun!\\" About three seconds elapse and then the officer yells, \\"Show me your hands! Gun, gun, gun\\", before shooting Clark. According to the police, before being shot, Clark turned and held an object that he \\"extended in front of him\\" while he moved towards the officers. The officers said they believed that Clark was pointing a gun at them. The police stated that the officers feared for their safety, and at 9:26 p.m., fired 20 rounds, hitting Clark multiple times. According to an independent autopsy, Clark was shot eight times, including six times in the back. The report found that one of the bullets to strike Clark from the front was likely fired while he was already on the ground. Body-cam footage shows that after shooting him, the officers continued to yell at him as one shined a flashlight at him and they kept their guns aimed at him. One officer stated in one of the body-cam videos, \\"He had something in hands, looked like a gun from our perspective.\\" Three minutes after the shooting, a female officer called to him and said \\"We need to know if you're OK. We need to get you medics, so we can't go over and get you help until we know you don't have a weapon.\\" They waited five minutes after shooting Clark before approaching and then handcuffing him. Clark was found to have an iPhone, and was unarmed. Clark's girlfriend later said the phone belonged to her. After more officers arrived, one officer said \\"Hey, mute\\", and audio recording from the body camera was turned off. The Police Department stated on March 19, one day after the shooting, that Clark had been seen with a \\"tool bar\\". On the evening of that day, police revised their statement to say that Clark was carrying a cell phone, and not a tool bar, when he was shot. Police added that Clark might have used either a concrete block or an aluminum gutter railing to break a sliding glass door at the house next door to where he was shot, and that they believed Clark had broken windows from at least three vehicles in the area. == Investigation == The Sacramento Police Department began a use-of-force investigation and placed both officers on paid administrative leave. On March 27, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said that his department would provide independent oversight into the investigation, and separately would scrutinize the police department's use-of- force policies and training procedures. Prior to the release of the county coroner's report, the family requested a second, independent autopsy, results of which were released March 30, 2018. The pathologist, Dr. Bennet Omalu, said Clark had been shot eight times from the back or side, adding \\"You could reasonably conclude that he received seven gunshot wounds from his back.\\" The Sacramento County Coroner's report was subsequently released to the public on May 1, 2018. The county autopsy, conducted by forensic pathologist Dr. Keng- Chih Su, indicated that Clark had been shot once in the front of the left thigh, three times directly to the side, and three times in the right side of the back. The Coroner's office had Dr. Su's autopsy reviewed by \\"the county’s chief forensic pathologist, and two county coroner pathologists, in addition to\\" forensic pathologist Dr. Gregory Reiber. On June 7, 2018, a New York Times team published an analysis also based on videos made by two police body cameras and by an overhead, heat-sensing helicopter camera. During the investigation, it was discovered that Clark's phone records showed that he had called Salena Mohamed Manni 76 times leading up to the shooting, causing her to block his phone number. Clark also attempted to get ahold of his probation officer in the 48 hours after he was reported for domestic violence, but was unable to do so. Clark had also received text messages from Manni telling him that he would be sent back to prison for the domestic incident and that he would not see his children for a long time. Clark also texted other ex- girlfriends seeking drugs, as well as texting Manni that he was going to commit suicide. An examination of his internet search history also showed that he had been researching websites about suicide. On March 2, 2019, Sacramento County District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert announced that her office would not be filing criminal charges against the police officers involved in Clark's death. Schubert stated that the officers had probable cause to stop and detain Clark and that they were legally justified in using deadly force against him. On September 26, 2019, US Attorney McGregor Scott and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced there was \\"insufficient evidence\\" to bring federal civil right charges against the officers. The Sacramento Police Department also said the department's investigation found no policy or training violations related to the shooting. The officers were cleared to return to active duty after they had been assigned to desk duty. == Officers == The Sacramento Police Department initially stated that they would release the names of the officers who shot Clark within 10 days of the event. Sources leaked what they alleged were the names of the shooters; however, the Sacramento Police Department did not confirm the validity of the names citing fears for the officers' safety. In March 2019 shortly after the district attorney decided to not press charges against them, the two officers came forward and revealed their identities (Terrance Mercadal and Jared Robinet), and opened up about their experience during the shooting in an interview with The Sacramento Bee. == Protests == There were numerous public protests in Sacramento after the killing. On March 22, 2018, Black Lives Matter led a march that shut down Interstate 5 and prevented NBA fans from entering a Sacramento Kings game, resulting in a delay of the game. One week after the shooting, the Sacramento Kings and Boston Celtics NBA teams wore shirts with Clark's name and the words \\"Accountability\\" and \\"We are One\\" during warm-ups and the national anthem. On March 31, after an independent autopsy had concluded that Clark was shot eight times, mostly in the back, hundreds of protesters gathered in downtown Sacramento. The peaceful protest was led by retired NBA player Matt Barnes, who announced that he is starting a scholarship fund for Clark's sons. Local activist Wanda Cleveland was struck by a Sacramento County Sheriff's Department vehicle at a rally. Video of the incident shows that a number of protesters converged on official vehicles and were ordered over loudspeakers to step away. One sheriff's vehicle hit Cleveland and knocked her down while she was standing in front of the car. According to Cleveland the vehicle was accelerating and \\"never even stopped\\" when it hit her. She was hospitalized with bruises on her head and arm and released the next morning. Members of the progressive advocacy group National Lawyers Guild who were present during the protest said the vehicle \\"accelerated very fast\\" as it hit Cleveland and then \\"sped off\\". According to the sheriff's department, \\"A collision occurred while the patrol vehicle was traveling at slow speeds.\\" The California Highway Patrol is investigating the matter. At a press conference, Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones blamed \\"paid professional protesters\\" and \\"professional instigators that infiltrate the protests for their own purposes\\" for the incident. Protest organizers denied the allegation and were outraged by his comments. Sociology and political science professor David Meyer said Jones's allegation was not realistic. PolitiFact concluded that Jones did not provide evidence to his claim, and rated his claim as false. == Responses  Elected officials and political activists === Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg, initially said he would not second-guess decisions made by officers on the ground. Following public backlash, Steinberg stated the videos of Clark's shooting made him feel \\"really sick\\" and that the shooting was \\"wrong,\\" however declined to comment whether the officers should be charged. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi stated that Clark \\"should be alive today\\". Reverend Al Sharpton stated that he was alarmed by the story, which he said had not received enough media attention. On March 26, White House spokesman Raj Shah stated that he was unaware of any comments from President Donald Trump regarding the incident. Two days later, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders stated that Trump is \\"very supportive of law enforcement\\" and that the incident was a \\"local matter\\" that should be dealt with by the local authorities. === Clark family === Clark's mother, Se'Quette Clark, receives a hug from US Senator Kamala Harris with attorney Benjamin Crump looking on in 2018. Civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, who represents the Clark family, stated that the autopsy finding was inconsistent with the official narrative that Clark was charging toward the police officers when they fired. Clark's family expressed skepticism of the police version of events. Clark's brother, Stevante Clark, said of police statements: \\"They said he had a gun. Then they said he had a crowbar. Then they said he had a toolbar ... If you lie to me once, I know you'll lie to me again.\\" Clark's aunt Saquoia Durham said that police gave Clark no time to respond to their commands before shooting him. According to Crump the officers did not identify themselves as police when they encountered Clark. The police have stated that the officers who confronted Clark were wearing their uniforms at that time. In January 2019, Clark's two underage sons filed a civil lawsuit against Sacramento and the two officers who shot Clark, seeking $20 million in damages. In September 2019, the city settled the lawsuit for $2.4 million; each son will receive $900,000 tax-free when they turn 22. === Policing experts === University of South Carolina criminology professor Geoffrey Alpert stated that it might be hard for officers to justify their conclusion that Clark was armed, since they had been told he was carrying a toolbar. Peter Moskos, assistant professor of Law and Police Science at John Jay College, said that the officers appeared to think they had been fired upon following the shooting. Alpert, Clark's family, and protesters questioned officers' decisions to mute their microphones. Police Chief Daniel Hahn said he was unable to explain the muting. Cedric Alexander, former police chief in Rochester, New York, and former president of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, said that the muting did not appear to violate any policy, although the action would reflect poorly on the officers. He also stated that it is not unusual for police to mute their body cams and that attorneys advise the police to mute conversations to prevent recording any comments that could be used in administrative or criminal proceedings. === Policy changes === In April 2018, the city of Sacramento enacted a policy that generally prohibits police officers from shutting down their body cams and audio recording devices. In July 2018, the Sacramento Police Department changed its foot pursuit policy, requiring officers to assess the danger chasing a suspect poses to officers and to the public. == See also == * Lists of killings by law enforcement officers in the United States * Police use of deadly force in the United States * Shooting of Joseph Mann == References == Category:2018 deaths Category:2018 in California Category:Deaths by firearm in California Category:Filmed killings by law enforcement Category:Law enforcement controversies in the United States Category:History of Sacramento, California Category:Race and crime in the United States Category:March 2018 events in the United States Category:2018 controversies in the United States Category:African-American-related controversies Category:Black people shot dead by law enforcement officers in the United States Category:Law enforcement in California ","title":"Shooting of Stephon Clark"},{"id":"56917998","text":"1977 Japanese Super Cup was the inaugural Japanese Super Cup competition.

As natural region major unit no. 404 the Regen Depression belongs to the Upper Palatine-Bavarian Forest and covers an area of 667 km². It separates the Anterior Bavarian Forest in the southwest from the High Bavarian Forest in the northeast. In the northwest it is adjoined by the Cham-Furth Depression and, in the southeast, the Abteiland. The Regen Depression is a large region, divided into various basins, at a height of 600 to 700 metres above sea level. The Regen flows through this gently rolling terrain in large curves. The river is impounded at the Regener See, Höllensteinsee and Blaibacher See. Heavily eroded, strongly weathered gneisses and granites are common. These are remains of weathered Tertiary platforms and Pleistocene solifluction soils. Compared to other areas of the Bavarian Forest, the climate is relatively mild. At 800 to 1200 mm per year, precipitation is lower than on the surrounding mountain ranges and temperatures are higher during the growing season. In winter, however, pockets of cold air are formed in the valleys. The area is a wooded, increasingly intensively farmed agricultural landscape characterized by grassland. Throughout its length, the Regen is traversed by the Bavarian Pfahl, an unusual geological structure. The largest settlements are the towns of Regen, Viechtach and Bad Kötzting. Much of the landscape is near-natural, especially the around the river, but also parts of the Pfahl with its pine and birch stands. Otherwise grassland dominates, while the hillsides are mainly covered with spruce. The original beech and fir forests have been reduced to small remnants between the farmland and grassland on steeply sloping terrain. Most of the Regen Depression lies within the Bavarian Forest Nature Park, the northwestern part belongs to the Upper Bavarian Forest Nature Park. == Literature == * Ulrich Pietrusky, Günther Michler, Donatus Moosauer: Niederbayern – im Fluge neu entdeckt, Verlag Morsak, Grafenau, 2nd edn. 1982, == External links == *Landscape fact file of the Bundesamt für Naturschutz category:Bavarian Forest category:Regen (district) category:Cham (district) category:Regions of Bavaria !

Sabattini first joined the association after meeting its founder Oreste Benzi in her late childhood and began to work alongside drug addicts and ill people with the dream of becoming part of the medical missions in Africa. It was later on that she became engaged but her life was cut short after being run over in a car accident while going to attend a meeting of the association near Rimini. Benzi pushed and lobbied for her process for beatification to be launched and this permission was granted over two decades later not long before Benzi himself died. The cause opened and she became titled as a Servant of God. Pope Francis confirmed her heroic virtue and titled Sabattini as Venerable on 6 March 2018 while on 2 October 2019 confirming a miracle attributed to her intercession. Sabattini was meant to be beatified in Rimini on 14 June 2020 but the coronavirus pandemic forced the Rimini diocese to postpone it. ==Life== Sandra Sabattini was born on 19 August 1961 in Rimini at the Riccione Hospital as the first of two children to Giuseppe Sabattini and Agnese Bonini; her brother was Raffaele, now a medical doctor working at Ceccarini Hospital in Riccione. The Sabattini's lived in Misano Adriatico before relocating in Rimini in 1965 to the parish church of San Girolamo to live with her priest uncle Don Giuseppe Bonini who was the pastor of the parish. Sabattini's pious nature as a child extended to keeping a journal since 27 January 1972 in order to record her spiritual thoughts. It was around 1973 that she first met the Servant of God Oreste Benzi at one of the several meetings of Benzi's Associazione Comunità Papa Giovanni XXIII that her uncle organized in his parish. In summer 1974 she took part in a summer program for teenagers at the Madonna delle Vette house in Canazei (Trento) for people with disabilities. This experience left her with a profound spiritual enthusiasm that upon returning home she told her mother: \\"We worked till we dropped but these are people I'll never leave\\". In 1980 she completed her high school examinations in Rimini before beginning her education in medicine at the college in Bologna. Sandra Sabattini was known for having achieved excellent results in each of her examinations. But within her was the desire to become part of the medical missions in Africa to work alongside the poor and ill. On the weekends and in the summer breaks of 1982 and 1983 she tended to drug addicts in the association's rehabilitation centers. Sabattini got up each morning to meditate in the church in the dark before the Eucharist and loved to do so on the floor to demonstrate her meek and humble nature; she sang in a choir and learned the piano. Sabattini later met Guido (who was a bit older than her) at a Carnivale event. The two started dating and were later engaged to be married though both decided to lead a chaste engagement. To their delight both wanted to become missionaries in Africa after getting married, but her father – who knew of the couple's dreams – advised his daughter to take things at a slow pace rather than to rush into things. In late April 1984 the association prepared for their meeting in Igea Marina near Rimini. On 29 April at 9:30 am she arrived there via car alongside her fiancé and her friend Elio. Just as she got out of the car both she and Elio were struck by a passing car, placing her into a coma from which she never recovered. Less than a week later, on 2 May, Sabattini died from her injuries at Bellaria Hospital in Bologna. Her funeral was celebrated on 5 May in the San Girolamo church in Rimini and she was buried outside the S. Andrea church of Misano Adriatico. In 1985 Benzi edited the first edition of her journal and did so again in 2003 alongside notes on her life. Father Benzi once said that \\"Sandra should not be sought among the dead\\" alluding to potential exhumation. Benzi's musings proved correct for in 2009 (after Benzi died) an exhumation took place but no remains were found. This was attributed to the fact that she wished to be buried in bare earth which meant corrosion of the casket was most probable following interment. ==Beatification== The Emilia-Romagna Episcopal Conference expressed on 30 January 2006 their favorable opinion to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints to initiate the proceedings for the cause of beatification for Sabattini. This was something that Don Oreste Benzi lobbied for after she had died. The C.C.S. provided their assent on 11 July 2006 after declaring \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections) and titling Sandra Sabattini as a Servant of God. The diocesan process of investigation was launched on 27 September 2006 and was closed on 6 December 2008. The Positio dossier was submitted to the C.C.S. for evaluation; theologians confirmed the cause and C.C.S. members followed on 6 March 2018. It was also on 6 March that Pope Francis confirmed that Sabattini lived a model life of heroic virtue and named her as Venerable. On 2 October 2019 the pope confirmed a miracle attributed to her intercession which would allow for her beatification. The Rimini diocese announced on 1 November 2019 that the beatification would take place on 14 June 2020; the coronavirus pandemic forced the Rimini diocese on 6 April 2020 to announce that the beatification would be postponed until further notice. The current postulator for this cause is Monsignor Fausto Lanfranchi. ==See also== * Oreste Benzi ==References * Hagiography Circle * Associazione Comunità Papa Giovanni XXIII * Find a Grave Category:1961 births Category:1984 deaths Category:20th- century Italian people Category:20th-century Roman Catholics Category:20th- century venerated Christians Category:Beatifications by Pope Francis Category:Italian Roman Catholics Category:Pedestrian road incident deaths Category:People from Rimini Category:Road incident deaths in Italy Category:Venerated Catholics by Pope Francis ","title":"Sandra Sabattini"},{"id":"56918116","text":"Valeriy Berezovskiy (born 23 July 1975) is a retired Kyrgyzstan international football player. ==Career statisticsInternational=== {   - !colspan=3Kyrgyzstan national team - !Year!!Apps!!Goals - 199730 - 199800 - 199920 - 200030 - 200160 - 200200 - 200300 - 200461 - 200500 - 200610 - 200740 - 200820 - !Total271 } Statistics accurate as of match played 9 May 2008 ===International goals=== :Scores and results list Kyrgyzstan's goal tally first. {  style=\\"font-size:95%;\\" ! # !!

Initially not admitted to the university, two years later he applied to and got admitted to Eötvös Loránd University [ELTE], where he studied Hungarian language and literature as well as art history at the Faculty of Arts, completing his studies in 1967. He wrote his thesis on the construction of the Avenue [Sugárút], which is now called Andrássy Avenue [Andrássy út] – making him the first in his profession to write about this grandiose enterprise in Hungarian eclectic architecture which transformed the Budapest cityscape. He maintained his interest in Hungarian and international architecture later on in his career. Kenessei's articles, papers on art, and reviews have been published in journals as well as culture columns in daily papers and weekly magazines (i.e., Budapester Rundschau, Élet és Irodalom, Művészet, Népszabadság, Ország- Világ, Rakéta Regényújság, Tükör, Új Tükör) since 1964. Since 1966, he has also written literary pieces, which have regularly appeared on the pages of leading literary journals, such as Kortárs and as well. Having graduated from university, Kenessei made a living as a freelance writer for several years. During that time, he interned as an editor at the publishing house Magvető Könyvkiadó and worked as a journalist for various weeklies. He later worked for the Hungarian Record Company [Magyar Hanglemezgyártó Vállalat], compiling prose recordings and jazz albums released by the record company. Between the summer of 1977 and May 1992, Kenessei worked for the daily newspaper Magyar Hírlap as a member of the editorial team responsible for culture and foreign affairs. Starting out as a correspondent, he was later appointed to be deputy column editor and, subsequently, senior newspaper contributor. Having written numerous highly professional reviews, characterized by both empathy and bold bluntness, he was commissioned by the ballet director and choreographer of the Hungarian State Opera House [Magyar Állami Operaház], László Seregi, to write papers to be published in the program booklet for all three of his Shakespeare ballet productions. The pieces written by Kenessei for the daily Magyar Hírlap encompass several journalistic genres, ranging from articles, accounts, interviews, reports, and feature pieces, to reviews on films, theatre productions, radio and television shows, concerts, books, and recordings. In addition, over the course of the last third of his fifteen years as a member of the editorial staff, he found an increasing interest in the economic aspects of culture. This interest was maintained even after he left the newspaper, and, for many years, he wrote weekly articles on aesthetically and economically relevant issues pertaining to the art-dealing scene in Hungary and abroad, with his pieces being published in the newspaper's business supplement, entitled Pénz Plusz Piac (Money Plus Market). It was around this time that he also took an interest in the stock market. Starting in the early 1980s, Kenessei worked as a contributor on several cultural radio shows broadcast on Hungarian National Radio [Magyar Rádió], most notably contributing to the weekly cultural review show Láttuk, Halottuk [Seen and Heard], hosted by András Kepes. From 1986, he made numerous television news pieces as a correspondent for TV-híradó [TV News], interviewing nationally and internationally prominent figures in the world of culture and art for the daily news program produced by Endre Aczél for Hungarian National Television [Magyar Televízió]. Kenessei wrote a radio play, entitled Terézvárosi hazugság [The Lie in Terézváros District], which aired on Hungarian National Radio in 1979. In addition, the television adaptation of his family saga Százezer ős [Hundreds of Thousands of Ancestors], directed by Erika Szántó, was broadcast on Hungarian National Television in 1991. In 1989, Kenessei took up art dealing and focused on art-dealing- related communication, writing numerous articles, essays, accounts, and reviews about art and art dealing for daily newspapers, such as Magyar Hírlap, Népszabadság, and the business daily Világgazdaság (Zöld Újság), and also for various weekly magazines, thereby establishing a new genre in Hungarian journalism. The Hungarian National Federation of Retailers [Kiskereskedők Országos Szervezete – KISOSZ] invited him to hold specialized lectures on art dealing as part of the federation's first training course on art dealing, also commissioning him to write the textbook used in the course. In 1991, Kenessei founded the art-dealing journal Műtárgy – Régiség [Artefacts – Antiquities], working as its publisher and editor until 2009, when it ceased publication. The founding of the journal coincided with the one-day conference held by Sotheby's in Budapest, which Kenessei organized at Fészek Művészklub, a renowned club for artists, in cooperation with the head of the company's Budapest office, Soraya Gräfin von Stubenberg. The conference saw six of Sotheby's department heads give presentations to Hungarian art dealers. From 1998, Kenessei produced and hosted a television show dedicated to art dealing, entitled Licit [The Bid]. Concurrently, from 2000, he was in charge of the regular art-dealing segment of the radio show Chaplin kalapja [Chaplin's Hat], produced by János Simkó, and he also worked on the weekly show Tőzsdevilág (Stock Market World). Since 2000, Kenessei has been living in both Vienna and Budapest, organizing and managing exhibitions of the works of contemporary Hungarian painters with his common-law partner, the Austrian citizen Katalin Herscovici, showcasing Hungarian paintings in Austria and Hungary. He continues to write reviews in Hungarian, publishing his pieces on visual arts and dance primarily on online sites. Additionally, between 2005 and 2007, he was a senior correspondent for Gazdasági Rádio, a business radio station, which aired his daily reports on the stock exchange as well as his sixty-minute weekly interviews. Kenessei's main fields of interest are the visual arts, music, and literature, collectively, along with contemporary Hungarian visual and applied arts as well as 20th century architecture and urban architecture. He has authored approximately 1,500 articles, papers, essays, portrait pieces on artists, and interviews. == Family == Parents: Tibor Kenessei (1911–1976), Ilona Szűcs (1912–1975) Siblings: János (1943), István (1947) Child: Dávid (1981) == Books == * Esős szeptember [Rainy September] (crime story) (Albatrosz, Magvető Könyvkiadó, Budapest, 1969) – Published under the pen name Albert Harald * Történetek és kitalálások [Stories and Confabulations] (short stories) (Szépirodalmi Könyvkiadó, Budapest, 1972) * Szeretők ideje [A Time for Lovers] (novel) (Móra Kozmosz Könyvkiadó, Budapest, 1979) * A nyomozást abbahagyni!

It advocates for Sexual Reproductive Health Rights (SRHR) of young people between the ages of 12–24 years including HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention. RAHU works with the goal of increasing access to information and services relating to SRHR for young people so as to empower them live healthy, focused and productive lives. == Overview == Reach A Hand Uganda was established in 2011, drawing inspiration from the personal life of Humphrey Nabimanya who is the Team Leader and the founder of the organization. Having been raised by HIV positive guardians, Humphrey was exposed to discrimination and stigma at a very early age by his fellow students and school staff who assumed he was HIV positive like his guardians. Through this struggle, he visualized the urgency to address the misconceptions that were caused by the information gap that was existing. Humphrey was compelled to educate not only his peers but also other young people about HIV/AIDS. Because of the great conviction and the activities he had engaged in, Humphrey conceptualized the idea of Reach A Hand Uganda, then, as a weekend outreach program to interact and inform other young people about HIV/AIDS. With the increasing need to inform young people about HIV/AIDS, Humphrey expanded RAHU to an officially registered organization in July 2011 as a fully youth immersed organization. Reach A Hand Uganda today, is still a youth fronted and youth concentrated organization focusing on youth empowerment programs with an emphasis on Sexual Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR), HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention. == Initiatives  The Peer Educators Academy === The Peer Educators academy is an initiative organized annually by RAHU. It serves as a platform to train and equip young people not only with comprehensive information about Sexual Reproductive Health and Rights but also life and Entrepreneurship skills as well. === The Young Achievers Awards === The Young Achievers Awards look to recognize and celebrate outstanding youth who have greatly impacted on the Ugandan society positively. The Awards inspire individual initiative and competitiveness among young people in various realms such as the Arts, Entrepreneurship, Media and Journalism, Philanthropy, Innovation, Sports among others. === SAUTIplus === The SAUTIplus initiative is an information channel created by RAHU that combines an interactive web portal and various social media platforms to enlighten youth on information regarding Sexual Reproductive Health and Rights. It provides content about HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention, relationships, life skills, teenage pregnancy, child marriages and sexuality among others. === Empowerment through Music === The initiative seeks to inspire young people through music and songs laced with SRHR information. The songs and performances under this initiative are carried out by RAHU cultural icons like Geosteady, Mun G, Allan Toniks and Nutty Neithan among others in an effort to inspire and motivate the young people through familiar avenues like music. == Partners == RAHU works in partnership with the Ministry of Health Uganda and various international organizations and foundations on various youth empowerment programs.

He was born in Beirut and spent most of his life in Lebanon. ==Personal life and education== Haddad was born in Beirut's Ain El Mraiseh neighborhood. He was raised between here and the Haouz Sa'atyeh (حوز سعتيه) neighborhood. His mother, Lamia Morcos (1896–1994) raised Haddad along with his five siblings. The son of Sami Ibrahim Haddad, a doctor and writer, Haddad's dreams did not fall far from the proverbial tree. He attended primary school at the Collège Protestant Français from 1928 to 1935 and secondary school at the International College of Beirut. He received both his Bachelor of Arts in 1944 and his M.D. in 1948 from the American University of Beirut. Haddad subsequently completed his surgical residency at the Orient Hospital. He then began his neurosurgery residency under Wilder Penfield at the Montreal Neurological Institute on July 1, 1950. There, he completed fellowships in neuropathology, neuro-anatomy, and electroencephalography. He returned to Lebanon in 1955 as \\"the first neurosurgeon certified by the American Board of Neurological Surgery to practice in the Middle East and... the entire Arab world.\\" In 1956, he married Aida Nasir, and together they raised six children of their own: Georges, Souheil, Fadi, Nabih, Labib, and Janane—two of whom are practicing neurosurgeons. ==Career== Upon his return to Lebanon, Haddad joined the faculty at the American University of Beirut and served the university until 2012. All the while, he kept a private practice where he \\"received patients from the Gulf States, Saudi Arabia, the Levant, North Africa, Turkey, and Iran.\\" The Lebanese Civil War began in 1975, making it difficult for American University of Beirut students to pursue a medical residency in the United States of America. Even before this era, Haddad saw a need and filled it with a neurosurgical residency program that remains successful to this day. Furthermore, on November 24, 1963, Haddad and his brother, Farid Haddad, were the founding members of the Lebanese Chapter of the American College of Surgeons. Both contributions to organized medicine in Lebanon marked great successes for practicing and future doctors who survived the war. Even during wartime, Haddad remained in Beirut as the only neurosurgeon serving the 450-bed American University Medical Center. \\"On a memorable spring weekend in 1976, he had to perform 13 craniotomies in a row for craniocerebral wounds. For 60 long hours he stood in the operating room mending the brain wounds of those unfortunate casualties.\\" Near the end of the war, Haddad was able to serve as a visiting professor in schools such as the University of Chicago, the University of Iowa, the Cleveland Clinic, the University at Albany, SUNY, and the University of Arkansas. Haddad retired on February 1, 2012. =='Life under Fire'== In 1988, Haddad was invited to address the 38th Annual Meeting of the Congress of Neurological Surgeons on the state of neurosurgery in the Middle East. Haddad explains the differences in disease, as tuberculosis ravaged much of Iran while it was far less prominent, and therefore a lower diagnostic priority, in the United States. Additionally, Haddad addresses differences in societal stability, since he had spent much of his career working under fire during the Lebanese Civil War. He notes how the absence of telephone communication and electricity (at times for two to three weeks) made surgeries and post-operative care exceptionally difficult. Haddad then shares that there exist more Lebanese surgeons in São Paulo, Brazil than in Lebanon. Lastly, to defend his reasons for staying in Lebanon while healthcare providers fled, he leaves no room for doubt that his heart, and hands, are dedicated to the people of Lebanon. He finishes his address with a story and a firm commitment to the people of Lebanon: > A further example is that of a veiled woman who entered my empty office on > one of the worse days of the fighting. I wondered what brought her to me > when everybody else, including my own secretary, was looking for shelter > from bombs and snipers. Said she, ‘Doctor, I know these are trying days and > everything is scarce. I have baked a few loaves of bread and thought you and > your family might do with some of them.’ Indeed we had gone without bread > for 3 or 4 days, with a family of six children. She offered me three loaves > and left. She had walked over 5 miles to bring this bread to me. As long as > there are people like these in Lebanon, I will stay to serve them, no matter > what the price is, and I am confident that, like the phoenix who rose from > his ashes, Lebanon will and shall rise. ==Honors== *Holder of the Lebanese Golden Order of the Cedar – Commander (1988) *Distinguished Service Award from the American University of Beirut Alumni Greater Baltimore Chapter (April 1998) *Golden Medal of the Lebanese Order of Physicians (March 10, 1999) *Distinguished Service Award from the Lebanese Order of Physicians (December 22, 2005) *Distinguished Award from the Lebanese Boy Scout Association (February 12, 2006) *Gold Medal from the Collège Protestant Français (May 19, 2006) *Medal of the Pioneer, in recognition of leadership, achievement, and promotion of skull base surgery from the Asian-Oceanian Skull Base Surgery Society (October 2, 2006) ==References *Researchgate: Fuad Sami Haddad *Professor Dr. Fuad Sami Haddad, BA, MD, FRCS (C), FACS Category:1924 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Lebanese neurosurgeons Category:Writers from Beirut ","title":"Fuad Sami Haddad"},{"id":"56918434","text":"Father Sergius () is a 1978 Soviet drama film directed by Igor Talankin based on the eponymous story by Leo Tolstoy. ==Plot== Prince Stepan Kasatsky, an officer, ardent, proud young man is a big admirer of the king.

The building has been a Grade I listed building since 1951 and comes under the Diocese of Exeter. Norman font dates to about 1160 Elizabethan pulpit Standing on the site of a Saxon church, the Norman church was enlarged to its present size in 1322, and the tower incorporated inside the building. Built of mostly random rubble slate walls, some rendered, with limestone dressings, the church has one of the finest wagon-roofs in the West Country dating from the 15th-century which is richly carved with bosses, angels, figures and five Green Men in a row. At the East end of the nave above the former rood screen is a ceilure or Glory, with three bays enriched by cross-ribs and much decoration. The chancel ceiling is modern by George Fellowes Prynne in 1899. The square baptismal font is Norman of about 1160 and is decorated with three rosettes and ears of wheat on each face with a scalloped underside. It was moved to its present position in 1861 during the 1861-1864 restoration by John Hayward. The Elizabethan pulpit has arched columns and panels containing floral motifs. The lychgate and the vestry date from 1894 and are by Henry Wilson, the best pupil of J. D. Sedding.The Pilgrim's Guide to Devon's Churches, Cloister Books (2008) pg 103Nikolaus Pevsner, The Buildings of England: North Devon, Penguin Books (1952) pgs 104-106 The 'Glory' ceiling is 15th-century The base of the 14th- century tower The first recorded Rector was Oliver de Tracey in 1263, which is also the approximate date of the first stone building on the site. Little remains of this church, ordered to be enlarged in 1321 by Walter de Stapledon, Bishop of Exeter when the nave was lengthened and the aisles added. The tower is 14th-century and is the oldest part of the building: it is low, single stage and very plain with a pointed north door and a lancet window and a low unmoulded arch opening into the nave. It is located in a north transeptal position, frequent in early North Devon churches. The north and south aisles are separated from the nave and chancel by eight bays of chamfered arches, four on each side on stunted octagonal piers; these are mid-to late 14th- century, while a piscina of the same date can be found in the chancel. The chapel in the north of the chancel is early 15th-century, while the aisle windows are from the Perpendicular Period. In the early 15th-century a North chapel was added. The stained glass is 19th-century and includes examples by Kempe (window in North aisle); Hardman (East window); Willement (south aisle East window) and Ballantyne (Stabb Memorial window). The church has numerous monuments but none are of any historical interest.

ACAPS was created in 2009. The analysis is based on evidence and needs and is free of operational agenda. It is freely provided to the NGOs, UN agencies and donors to help them better understand the humanitarian crises, make more informed decisions and respond more effectively to disasters. ACAPS established the Syria Needs Analysis Project – SNAP in 2012. For about three years SNAP delivered over 40 products related to the humanitarian impact of the conflict. ACAPS provides of independent, multi- sectoral humanitarian analysis. ACAPS is also known for having developed a severity ranking of humanitarian crises. Another ACAPS contribution to the humanitarian system is advocating for the importance of better collecting secondary data (instead of only collecting primary data) and the importance of better analysing fewer data rather than compiling a maximum of information without making sense of it. It employs around 30 professionals based in Geneva and in the field. ==History== ACAPS (initially known as \\"The Assessment Capacities Project”) was established in 2009 to improve the assessment of humanitarian needs in complex emergencies and crises, at a time where there were no single approach, nor consensus on needs assessments and where evidence- and needs-based approaches were not standard. It was created by a consortium of three INGOs: HelpAge International, the Norwegian Refugee Council and Merlin, which then merged with Save the Children. Through the development of methodological tools, the delivery of training and operational support (such as Bangladesh in 2012 and Nepal Earthquake in 2015) ACAPS contributed to shape norms and standards around coordinated needs assessment and advocated for more meaningful and evidence-based data. ACAPS was a contributor to the MIRA process (Multi-Cluster/Sector Initial Rapid Assessment) which is a joint needs assessment tool that can be used in sudden- onset emergencies. Between December 2012 and 30 June 2015 ACAPS and MapAction ran the Strategic Needs Analysis Project — SNAP (initially the Syria Needs Analysis Project). The aim was to support the humanitarian response in Syria and the region with independent analysis and coordinated assessments. For almost three years, SNAP pursued these goals with a combination of independent information products, technical support and capacity building for humanitarian assessments. Its data and products were broadly used by humanitarian workers and also journalists, such as BBC and the New York Times. After the SNAP project ACAPS ran several other field projects, such as the Ebola Needs Assessment Project (ENAP) in 2014-2015, the Refugee/Migrant Crisis in 2015-2016 , together with MapAction, the Caribbean response to the Hurricane Irma and Maria, and more recently the support to the Rohingya crisis. In 2014 ACAPS together with the Emergency Capacity Building Project (ECB) launched \\"Humanitarian Needs Assessment — The Good Enough Guide ”, a tool dedicated to ease field staff carrying out assessment after a humanitarian crisis. This guide received praise for enabling field-based staff and national responders ‘to provide the critical information needed to inform the wider humanitarian community.”Jan Egeland Secretary General, Norwegian Refugee Council, Humanitarian Needs Assessment — The Good Enough Guide, Foreword In 2016 ACAPS, together with six other INGOs, joined the Mixed Migration platform (MMP), a joint NGO initiative providing quality mixed migration-related information for policy, programming and advocacy work, as well as critical information for people on the move. ACAPS contributes to the MMP with analytical capacity, scenario-building expertise, and online data collection and analysis. Over the years, ACAPS centred its core services on humanitarian analysis and the provision of secondary data. Although ACAPS still undertakes and supports field needs assessments (and primary data collection) and produce needs assessment tools, the majority of its work is dedicated to support the humanitarian community by providing up-to-date information on more than 40 key crises around the globe. The ACAPS website, and its related app, CrisisAlert, released in 2017, are the main platforms to present this analysis to the humanitarian community. At the recent World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul, \\"joint and impartial needs assessments” were promoted as one of the 10 key commitments of the Grand Bargain giving ACAPS new opportunities to play a central role and contribute to change the humanitarian sector. ==ActivitiesCrisis analysis=== ACAPS performs crisis analysis, monitoring and updating current crises on a daily basis. They rank the severity of world humanitarian crises on a weekly basis. Tailored reports, such as the Briefing Notes for the START Fund, are also released. ===Forecasting=== Since 2015 ACAPS has developed a range of products and services to better anticipate events and humanitarian developments. These services should contribute to inform timely contingency planning and preparedness measures. ACAPS writes risks reports, anticipatory briefing notes and organizes scenario building workshops, such as the one for IFRC, held in April 2017. The result of this exercise is a report with a set of key scenarios including an overview of events that could trigger the scenario, humanitarian consequences and impact, estimated caseload, operational constraints and recommended actions. Every year, in December, ACAPS releases its annual publication, the \\"Humanitarian Overview”, identifying key crises and corresponding needs to look at in the upcoming year. ===Methodology development=== ACAPS has developed material around humanitarian assessments and analysis, which ranges from decision-making to initial planning of analysis work. The importance of better collecting secondary data (instead of only collecting primary data) and the importance of better analysing fewer data rather than compiling a maximum of information without making sense of it are some of the changes ACAPS made into the humanitarian system. ACAPS is also known for having developed a severity ranking of humanitarian crises. Categories are: severe humanitarian crises, humanitarian crises and situation of concern. This ranking is based on 5 indicators. More than 100 methodological tools and guidance have been produced by ACAPS. ===API/webservices=== ACAPS is currently openly sharing its data with various organizations, through an API service. Among them, the Crises App from ReliefWeb uses the ACAPS \\"Crisis Overview” section for each crisis displayed on its own app. ==Funding== Since its launch ACAPS has been funded by various institutional donors. The project is currently funded by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), the UK Department for International Development (DFID), and The Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO). ==References * Category:Non-profit organisations based in Norway Category:Humanitarian aid organizations ","title":"ACAPS"},{"id":"56919027","text":"The Dallara P217 is a sportscar prototype built by Dallara Automobili to the 2017 FIA/ACO regulations for the Le Mans Prototype LMP2 class. The car also meets the regulations for the Le Mans Prototype 2 Class of the IMSA WeatherTech Sportscar Championship. It currently is active in the FIA World Endurance Championship, and the European Le Mans Series. The prototype made its debut at the 2017 4 Hours of Silverstone. == Development == The car is a result of the bid made by Dallara, for one of the four licenses to build the new for 2017 Le Mans Prototype 2 cars. It is also the first LMP constructed by Dallara since the original Audi R18 TDI. The car was first spotted testing at the Autodromo Riccardo Paletti in Northern Italy in late early October, by the Italian magazine Autosprint. During the 2017 racing season, the car was discovered to have a fundamental issue with a critical element of the sprint kit which was firmly homologated and carried over in the Le Mans low-drag kit. Resulting in major balance issues for the car which first surfaced at Le Mans. With the car being noted for its speed on the long straights, such as the Mulsanne Straight, but also for its lack of pace in the twistier sections of the track. This element was later revealed to be the splitter. The car was subsequently fitted with an Evo kit for the 2018 racing season to resolve issues with the car. With a new splitter for the Standard High Downforce Aero package and a revised Le Mans Low Drag Kit. Ahead of the homologation of the Evo Package, the revised car was revealed to have undergone testing at the Algarve International Circuit, in the hands of customer team Cetilar Villorba Corse. The car has also been known for its relative similarity to the Porsche 919 Hybrid. == Cadillac DPi-V.R == Action Express Racing's Mustang Sampling Racing Cadillac DPi- V.R. at the Petit Le Mans. A Daytona Prototype International variant of the car, has been developed in partnership with General Motors (under its Cadillac marque), as well as Wayne Taylor Racing. It was unveiled on the 30th of November and is a successor to the successful Corvette Daytona Prototype that was fielded in the Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series, as well as the IMSA WeatherTech Sportscar Championship. It is powered by a LS based GM small-block engine, originally a 6.2L V8 designed, developed, and produced by ECR Engines, mated to a 6 Speed Xtrac transmission, producing 600 hp. In this guise, the car was extremely dominant, with the car winning on its debut at the 2017 Rolex 24 at Daytona, where Wayne Taylor Racing leading a 1-2 with Action Express Racing, while also winning 8 of the 10 races in the calendar. In 2018, the displacement of the LS engine was changed to 5.5L, again built by ECR Engines and producing 580 hp, following a series of BoP adjustments during 2017 to slow down the car the previous season, that had made the car hard to drive, with most notably a tall first and second gear mandated after the low-end torque became an advantage against the turbocharged four and six-cylinder engines. == References == Category:24 Hours of Le Mans race cars Category:Le Mans Prototypes Category:Sports prototypes P217 ","title":"Dallara P217"},{"id":"56919034","text":"Jagnjić Dol is a settlement (naselje) in the Sveta Nedelja administrative territory of Zagreb County, Croatia.

He was a Founding Fellow of St Catherine's College, Oxford (1959-1995), the initiator of the Oxford Study Groups with Industry in 1968 (which developed into the European Study Groups with Industry), a driving force behind the foundation of the European Consortium for Mathematics in Industry (ECMI) in 1985 and President of ECMI (1989), and the first Director of the Oxford Centre for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (OCIAM) (1989-1994). == Personal life == Alan Tayler was born in Mitcham, Surrey on 5 September 1931 and died in Ducklington, Oxfordshire on 29 January 1995. In 1955 he married June Earp and they had four daughters, one of whom pre-deceased him. == Education == Alan Tayler was a scholar at King's College School, Wimbledon, London. Then we went up to Brasenose College, Oxford in 1951 where he gained a First in Mathematics and then, after a brief period in industry, a DPhil on \\"Problems in Compressible Flow\\" under the supervision of Professor George Temple in 1959. == Career == Alan Tayler was a distinguished applied mathematician who made important contributions in a wide range of areas (notably lubrication theory, surface gravity waves and viscous dissipation), but his key contribution to science was as the driving force behind the establishment of what is often called \\"mathematics-in-industry\\" or \\"industrial mathematics\\" (i.e. the application of mathematical approaches to the modeling and analysis of a wide range of real-world problems) as a recognized scientific discipline in its own right. His philosophy is perfectly exemplified by the Oxford (now European) Study Groups with Industry which he and Professor Leslie Fox created in 1968 and are still going strong today. His approach to mathematical modelling is described in his seminal monograph \\"Mathematical Models in Applied Mechanics\\" (Oxford University Press, 1986), and is commemorated by the annual Alan Tayler Lecture held at the St Catherine's College, Oxford in November each year. During his career he supervised the DPhil research of several notable applied mathematicians, including Professor John Ockendon FRS and Professor John King. In 1959 Alan Tayler became a University Lecturer and Tutorial Fellow at St Catherine’s Society, Oxford, and was involved in its transformation into St Catherine’s College, Oxford in 1962, where remained for the rest of his career. He was devoted to the College, and held several of its major offices, and also to the Oxford University Rugby Football Club, of which he was President (1990-1995). ==Other work== He was on the governing body of Abingdon School from 1964-1983 and was the Vice-chairman of the Governors from 1972-1981. == Awards == In 1982 Alan Tayler was jointly awarded (with Professor Sir James Lighthill, FRS) the Gold Medal of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) for his services to applied mathematics, and in 1993 he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1993 for his services to applied science and industry. ==References== Category:20th-century English mathematicians Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:1931 births Category:1995 deaths Category:Governors of Abingdon School ","title":"Alan B.

He is recognized as the catalyst for the Wŏnsan Revival (1903) and also inspired the Great Pyongyang Revival (1907) in what is now North Korea. == Early life and education == Hardie was born on June 11, 1865, in Haldimand County, Ontario, south of Toronto. Of Scottish descent, he was the first of six children born to James and Abigail Hardie. Both his parents died before he was ten years old. Hardie was then raised by his aunt and uncle, Thomas and Fannie Shaw. He attended a school in Seneca, Haldimand County, earning a teacher's certificate in 1884, and worked as a teacher in Seneca for two years. In 1886, Hardie enrolled at the Toronto School of Medicine. On December 27, 1886, he married Margaret \\"Matilda\\" Kelly of Hamilton, Ontario. As a medical student, Hardie studied under Oliver R. Avison, who later travelled to Korea as an evangelist. Hardie graduated from University of Toronto with a Bachelor of Medicine degree in 1890. == Career  Physician to missionary === In the summer of 1890, Hardie moved his family to Korea to serve as an independent and nondenominational medical missionary. The Toronto University Medical Student's YMCA (MS–YMCA) had funded his endeavour for the next eight years. For six months in late 1890 and early 1891, Hardie served as a physician in the Chaejungwon (Extended Relief House: Royal Hospital) in Seoul. On April 14, 1891, Hardie moved to Pusan and was later joined by his wife Margaret and two daughters at his residence which also served as the location of his medical practice. In 1892, the Hardies briefly moved to Nagasaki, Japan, on account of his poor health; they returned to Pusan later that year. When Canadian missionary James Scarth Gale ended his association with his supporters from the University College's YMCA (UC–YMCA) in order join the American Presbyterian Mission, the UC–YMCA lost its only representative in Korea. At Hardie's suggestion, the MS–YMCA and UC–YMCA joined forces to form The Canadian Colleges' Mission (CCM) with Hardie as their representative and beneficiary in Korea. However, he faced competition from other missionaries in the Pusan area and financial hardship due to the limited support from Toronto. In November 1892, Hardie decided to move his mission to Wŏnsan, where Gale and Malcolm C. Fenwick were then located. In Wŏnsan, Hardie began to emulate Fenwick's methods for self-sufficiency by supplementing his living with farming, \\"feeding cattle and growing fruit\\". The Hardie family stayed in Wŏnsan until 1896. In July 1896, Hardie relocated his family to Canada, and returned alone to Wŏnsan in October 1897. In 1898, Gale moved to Seoul, and Hardie joined the American Methodist Episcopal Church, South, when his contract of support from the CCM ended. With the American Methodist mission, Hardie was first tasked with establishing a medical practice in Songdo, Hwanghae Province, in present-day North Korea. He remained there for less than a year before relocating again to Seoul in August 1899\\\\. It was in Seoul, on November 11, 1900, that Bishop Alpheus Wilson ordained Hardie as a deacon in the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. === Revival movements === Sometime after 1900, Hardie stopped practicing medicine to concentrate on his missionary work. From 1902 to 1909, Hardie was charged with the task of proselytising to the people of Wŏnsan and the greater Kangwon Province. In August 1903, during a Bible study with six other missionaries, Hardie spoke of prayer and the Holy Spirit, confessing his low spirits and disappointment with his efforts to proselytise the Kangwon Province. During later meetings with larger congregations across northern Korea, Hardie made similar confessions that inspired many western missionaries and native Koreans alike to confess their own sins, leading thousands of congregates to accept the missionaries' Christian teachings. From 1901 to 1909, there were almost 100,000 new Korean converts to the Christian faith. Hardie's confessions became the catalyst for the Wŏnsan Revival which later inspired the Great Pyongyang Revival of 1907 in northern Korea. His expression of the feeling of \\"humiliation\\" at his failings in evangelizing people in the Kangwon Province had the paradoxical effect of inspiring a religious awakening that spread through out the entire nation. Alfred Wasson, an American Methodist missionary to Korea, wrote in Church Growth in Korea (1934): === Academic career === In 1905, Hardie started a mobile theological school named Sinhakdang (Hall of Theology). The school initially had no defined physical location as he travelled between Inchŏn, Kongju, Pyongyang, and Seoul to teach several months-long sessions. In 1909, he moved to Seoul and began teaching at the Pierson Memorial Bible School and the Methodist Biblical Institute. In 1913, Hardie founded the Hyŏpsŏng sinhakkyo (Union Theological School) in Seoul. He served as the president of the school until 1922 and left the school in June 1923. From 1916, he also published a magazine entitled Sinak saekye (The World of Theology). In 1923, Hardie became the editor-in-chief of the Chosŏn Yesukyo Sŏhoe (now known as the Korean Christian Literature Society). == Family and later years == When the Hardies arrived in Korea, they had with them a two-year-old daughter named Eva, their second child. Their first son Arthur Sidney had died as an infant in 1888. Their second daughter Annie Elizabeth was born in Seoul during the first year of their missionary life. The Hardies' third daughter Marie Mabel died only a day old but they had two more daughters, Gertrude Abigail and Sarah Grace, who lived to adulthood. Their seventh child Robert and youngest daughter Margaret Joy died at eleven and six years old, respectively. The Hardie family also adopted a Korean girl named Chuponia. In 1935, Hardie retired from missionary work and moved with his wife to Lansing, Michigan, to live with their daughter Grace. In total, he had served as a medical and then an evangelical missionary for about 45 years of his life. Margaret died in 1945 and Robert on June 30, 1949. == References  Further reading == * * Category:1865 births Category:1949 deaths Category:19th-century Canadian physicians Category:20th-century Canadian physicians Category:Canadian Methodist missionaries Category:People from Haldimand County Category:University of Toronto alumni Category:Canadian emigrants to Korea Category:Canadian emigrants to the United States ","title":"R.

She studied textile art at the Arts and Crafts School under Franka Rasmussen (1962–66). She later attended the Danish Theatre School where she studied scenography (1972–76). With Sven Poulsson, whom she married in June 1967, she had a son, Kasper Salto, who became a furniture designer. The marriage was dissolved in 1969. In December 1989, she married the designer and silversmith Allan Scharff but was divorced in 1995. In June 1995, she married the auctioneer Jens Christian Thygesen. ==Career== Salto began to weave while young, adopting both traditional and experimental techniques after opening her own workshop in 1966. She used increasingly vivid colours, depicting motifs from Nordic mythology as well as the sea. Her interest in scenography was reflected in her modern tapestries, some representing pictorial images, others adapted to church decoration. By the 1990s, she had initiated new approaches to textile art in Denmark. She also created works in stained glass. In later years, she moved from tapestry to painting. Salto was one of the artists who contributed to Haandarbejdets Fremme (Danish Handcraft Guild) which became the main focus for textile art in Denmark. Examples of her work can be seen in Holmen's Church, Copenhagen, and the Carl Nielsen Museum in Odense. She created the stage curtain depicting the \\"Tree of Life\\" in the National Museum of Denmark. In 2006, her work was exhibited in Kunsten, Aalborg together with that of her father Axel and her son Kasper. Naja Salto died on 3 March 2016. ==References * Examples of Salto's work with lists of exhibitions and decorated buildings from Galleri Krebsen Category:1945 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Artists from Copenhagen Category:Danish textile artists Category:Danish women artists Category:Danish painters Category:Danish women painters Category:Women textile artists ","title":"Naja Salto"},{"id":"56919497","text":"Bernhard W Roth 2019 Bernhard Wilhelm Roth (born 13 November 1970) is a German experimental physicist. == Scientific career == From 1992 to 1997 Roth studied physics at the Universität Bielefeld from where he obtained his diploma in physics.

It was introduced by trade unionist Lee Cheuk-yan in the colonial Legislative Council on the eve of the handover of Hong Kong in April 1997 but was soon repealed by the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) in October 1997. ==Contents== The bill was introduced by the pro-labour legislator Lee Cheuk-yan of the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions (CTU). Under the bill, employees were given rights to representation and consultation through a trade union representative and to be covered by a collective agreement negotiated by a \\"representative\\" trade union. A trade union can also request employer recognition if its membership constitutes more than 15 per cent of the employees and represents more than 50 per cent of these employees. Further provisions included the establishment of collective bargaining and the imposition on employers of a duty to allow trade union representatives paid time-off for representation, consultation and collective bargaining activities. The Labour Department, employers and the pro-Beijing Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) and the Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions (FLU) opposed to the bill, mainly on the grounds that collective bargaining was not a tradition in Hong Kong where employers and labour enjoyed a \\"harmonious relationship\\". The bill was passed by the Legislative Council on 20 June 1997 with the support of the pro-democracy camp in the council. It was gazetted on 30 June 1997, the last day of the colonial rule. ==Repeal== After the transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong, the ordinance was first frozen by the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) on 17 July 1997 on the basis of the review of the Labour Advisory Board (LAB), a tripartite body appointed by Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa. A majority of the LAB members deemed it inappropriate to bring the collective bargaining into operation. It was frozen with three of the six other ordinances passed by the colonial Legislative Council as private members' bills also on the ground that these laws were hastily passed during the last week of the legislature in June 1997 without adequate discussion in bill committees and public consultation. On 30 October, the ordinance was repealed by the Employment and Labour Relations (Miscellaneous Amendments) Ordinance, along with the Employment (Amendment) (No. 4) Ordinance 1997 passed by the Legislative Council on 29 June 1997. It has become the subject of the labour issue in Hong Kong, in which the pro-democrats used it as an attack on the FTU which supported the repeal of the collective bargaining. ==See also== * Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance * Minimum Wage Ordinance ==References== Category:1997 in Hong Kong Category:Hong Kong labour law Category:Hong Kong legislation Category:1997 in labor relations Category:1997 in law Category:Trade union legislation ","title":"Employee's Rights to Representation, Consultation and Collective Bargaining Ordinance"},{"id":"56919513","text":"Črečan is a settlement (naselje) in the Sveti Ivan Zelina administrative territory of Zagreb County, Croatia.

It is a locally listed Art Deco building, located on London Road, around east of St Albans Cathedral. Originally built in 1931 as the Capitol Cinema, the current building stands on the site of an earlier film theatre, the Alpha Picture Palace. This former cinema was of particular historical significance as it was opened in 1904 by the film-making pioneer Arthur Melbourne-Cooper and is considered to have been the first cinema in Hertfordshire. ==History== The Odeon St Albans in 2004, prior to restoration Arthur Melbourne Cooper was born in St Albans in 1874 at 99 London Road. As a teenager, he was inspired to go into the new art of moving photography when he became acquainted with Birt Acres, and he became a noted figure in the history of early cinema as a pioneering filmmaker. Cooper founded his Alpha Trading Company in 1906 to make short films, animations and newsreels. He set up the Alpha Production Works in Bedford Park Road, later moving to larger premises at Alma Road. Among the pioneering films he shot in St Albans was the animated fantasy, Dreams of Toyland (1908). Cooper wanted to establish a film theatre to present his productions to the paying public, and acquired a public hall building on London Road that had originally been designed for a social institute in 1903 by the local architect Percival Blow (1873–1939). On 27 July 1908, Cooper opened the Alpha Picture House, Hertfordshire's first permanent cinema. The building was fitted out with a restaurant, swimming pool and hairdressing salon as well as the 800 seat cinema. The cinema failed inspection following the passing of the 1910 Cinematograph Act and was sold through liquidation to George Arthur Dawson the following year. The cinema continued to run as the Poly until 1926 and was destroyed by fire the following year. In 1911, Cooper sold his studios and the London Road cinema. It changed hands several times, taking on different names. In 1918, it became the Poly Picture Palace. In 1923, the cinema underwent another refurbishment by Percival Blow, which involved the installation of a balcony with boxes and a cinema organ, and a dance hall and workshop in the basement. From 1926 it was known as The Regent Picture House. On 15 December 1927 The Regent was gutted by a large fire caused by a dropped cigarette. Plans were drawn up the following year to erect a replacement cinema and a new building was designed by Percival Blow and James Martin Hatfield with internal decorations designed by Robert Cromie. The new cinema featured a seating capacity of 1,620 with a 20-foot-deep stage, a two-manual Compton theatre organ, a café and dressing rooms. Because of the sloping site, patrons entered the cinema at balcony level and ten descended to the stalls. Now called The Capitol Cinema, it opened to the public on 3 December 1931. In 1932, the Capitol was sold again, this time to the D.J. James Cinema Circuit, and in 1934 the cinema underwent a major extension and refurbishment by the architect firm Kemp & Tasker, expanding the seating capacity to 1,728. The cinema changed hands again in 1937, when D.J. James was bought by Eastern Cinemas, part of the General Cinema Finance (GCF) group, and in 1943, GCF was in turn taken over by the Rank Organisation, who rebranded the Capitol under their Odeon Cinema Circuit name on 1 January 1945. Despite the increasing attraction of television in the 1950s and 60s, the St Albans Odeon continued to run a successful business, showing new Cinemascope films to attract audiences. Audiences declined in the 1970s, and the Odeon was divided into three smaller screens in 1973. It re- opened on 21 January with a screening of A Clockwork Orange in Screen 1. ===Closure=== By the 1990s, cinema chains had shifted their focus to large, out-of-town multiplexes and divested themselves of smaller town cinemas. With the opening of the new cinema complex at Jarman Park in Hemel Hempstead in 1995, Rank decided to close the St Albans Odeon. Despite the efforts of a local campaign to save the cinema, it closed to the public on 20 August 1995. The last film screened was Waterworld. After closure, the building was stripped of its fixtures and fittings. ===Re-opening=== The building was derelict for many years. It was purchased by a property developer who proposed demolishing it to make way for flats. A campaign to preserve the cinema by the local civic society failed to garner support from St Albans City and District Council, who voted to have the cinema demolished. The Odyssey in 2012, during restoration with the exterior repainted. In November 2009, the old cinema building was purchased by local entrepreneur James Hannaway, with a plan to refurbish and re-open it as a cinema. Hannaway had previously led a project to re-open another historic Art Deco cinema, The Rex, Berkhamsted, around west of St Albans. A fundraising campaign was started to restore the cinema to its original 1930s glory and a new name – The Odyssey – was chosen following a public competition. It was named after 2001: A Space Odyssey, in honour of director Stanley Kubrick, who had family connections with St Albans. Restoration work began in 2013 and the cinema re-opened to the public on 30 November 2014 as an independent, single-screen, arthouse cinema with seating for 500 and a café and bar. ==Architecture== The building is noted for its Art Deco styling.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-30428185 ==External links== * * ==References== Category:Cinemas in Hertfordshire Category:Art Deco architecture in England Category:Theatres completed in 1931 Category:Locally listed buildings in St Albans Category:Buildings and structures in St Albans Category:Tourist attractions in Hertfordshire Category:History of St Albans ","title":"Odyssey Cinema, St Albans"},{"id":"56919523","text":"Goričanec is a settlement (naselje) in the Sveti Ivan Zelina administrative territory of Zagreb County, Croatia.

Anna Mae's parents have a difficult relationship, which culminates in Zelma walking out with her eldest daughter Alline, leaving Anna Mae to be brought up by her grandmother, Gran Georgeanna. Some years later, Anna Mae is invited to join Zelma and Alline in St Louis, and she goes with Gran Georgeanna's encouragement (\\"Don't Turn Around\\"). In St Louis, Alline introduces Anna Mae to the night life (\\"Shake a Tail Feather\\"), eventually crossing paths with Ike Turner and his band, the Kings of Rhythm (\\"The Hunter\\"). One night Anna Mae joins Ike on stage to sing (\\"Matchbox\\"), and the success of the performance leads Ike to ask Zelma for permission for Anna Mae to join his band (\\"It's Gonna Work Out Fine\\"). Ike gives Anna Mae the stage name \\"Tina Turner\\" despite her protests. Although Tina enjoys performing with him, she's aware of Ike's vicious temper (\\"A Fool in Love\\"), and has to hide her love affair with Raymond, a member of Ike's band (\\"Let's Stay Together\\"). After touring successfully for some time, Ike asks Tina to marry him, since people already think they are because of her stage name. Tina agrees, despite being pregnant with Raymond's child; in response, Raymond leaves her (\\"Better Be Good to Me\\"). Tina keeps performing with Ike and his band, through Ike's infidelities, violence, and demands of Tina's health despite her having another child (\\"I Want to Take You Higher\\"). Ike's road manager, Rhonda Graam, advises Tina to leave him, but she refuses. Ike gets a recording deal with Phil Spector, but is angered when he wants to record Tina solo (\\"River Deep Mountain High\\"). Ike is dismissive of Tina's ability as a solo artist, and during an argument attempts to hit her son, Craig. Tina almost walks out, but Ike apologises and begs her forgiveness (\\"Be Tender with Me Baby\\"). Tina overdoses and is sent to hospital, but is forced to check out for a performance (\\"Proud Mary\\"). Backstage, Tina and Ike get into another violent fight, which is the final straw and causes Tina to run away. Bruised and bleeding, she asks a hotel clerk for a room to stay, using only her stage name as a promise to pay later since she doesn't have any money (\\"I Don't Wanna Fight\\"). ===Act II=== Tina, free from Ike, has been performing in Las Vegas with the help of Rhonda, now her manager. They're struggling to make ends meet because no record label wants to sign a black woman who's nearing forty years old, and Ike has claimed copyright over all songs from the \\"Ike & Tina Revue\\", preventing her from singing the songs she's known for (\\"Private Dancer\\"). While dropping off a demo tape at Capitol Records, they meet Roger Davies, a young Australian music producer who's a fan of Tina. Roger goes to Vegas to watch Tina perform (\\"Disco Inferno\\") and afterward asks to be her manager. Rhonda is upset about being put aside, but Tina insists that she needs to try something new, and that she needs Rhonda more as a sister than a manager (\\"Open Arms\\"). Tina travels to London for Roger's recording session. Among the people she meets is Erwin Bach, a German music executive. Tina wants to reinvent herself and transition to rock and roll, but she struggles with Roger's advice, and dreams of Ike watching her (\\"I Can't Stand the Rain\\"). Erwin visits her hotel room to provide comfort, and the pair kiss. While preparing a performance showcase for the record label, Tina rails against Roger's instructions, refusing to be anyone's puppet any longer. Tina asks everyone to leave, and performs her Buddhist mantra to calm herself. She has a vision of her younger self and Gran Georgeanna encouraging her (\\"Tonight\\"). The showcase is a success, but the record label still refuses to sign her out of racism. Roger decides to promote her himself through touring performances back in the United States. Erwin asks her to stay in London and declares his love for her, but she rejects him. Tina's performance of the new material is a success (\\"What's Love Got to Do with It?\\"). Capitol Records begs her to sign with them, and she agrees only on her own terms. Alline arrives with news Zelma is dying. Tina visits Zelma at the hospital, where Ike has been visiting Zelma as well. Zelma encourages them to reconcile; Tina demands that Ike apologise, but he can't and leaves. Zelma and Tina have an emotional confrontation, after which Zelma dies. Tina and Alline mourn their mother (\\"We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)\\"). Riding high, Tina prepares for a concert before 180,000 people in Brazil. Erwin arrives, having flown over to be with her. The pair reconcile, which leads into Tina's walking on stage for the concert (\\"The Best\\"). For the finale and encore, Tina and her band perform reprises of \\"Nutbush City Limits\\" and \\"Proud Mary\\". ==Cast== {  style=\\"width:1000;\\" - ! Character ! West End (2018) !

Michael Billington of The Guardian described the \\"whirlwind performance\\" of Warren as \\"astonishing\\", and concluded on the production: \\"As bio-musicals go, this is as good as it gets.\\" Similarly Dominic Cavendish of The Daily Telegraph described Warren's performance as a \\"tour de force\\" and considered the show \\"slickly choreographed, beautifully designed and roof-raisingly well-sung\\". Adam Mattera in Echoes noted \\"the production plays fast and loose with catalogue chronology... it's a crowd-pleasing decision meaning all the solo mega-hits aren't squeezed into the final act, but simultaneously it derails the dramatic reveal of Tina's 80s rock'n'roll reinvention,\\" while concluding \\"it’s so resounding joyous you don’t care.\\" Will Gompertz of the BBC criticised the script as \\"rather disappointingly two-dimensional\\", but thought the musical \\"elegantly staged\\" with Warren a \\"24-carat, all singing, all dancing, bona fide star\\". Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter noted that while its grand finale contains \\"stilted, corny elements\\", \\"the production becomes a full-blooded rock show that is \\"roof-raising\\" and \\"life-affirming\\", with a climax that \\"swept the crowd to its feet. Pure button-pushing melodrama, maybe. But irresistibly uplifting entertainment, too.\\" ==Awards and nominations Original West End production === {  ! style=\\"width: 5%;\\" Year ! style=\\"width: 20%;\\" Award ! style=\\"width: 40%;\\" Category ! style=\\"width: 25%;\\" Nominee ! style=\\"width: 10%;\\" Result -  rowspan=\\"3\\" 2019  rowspan=\\"3\\" Laurence Olivier Awards  colspan=\\"2\\" Best New Musical  -  Best Actress in a Musical  Adrienne Warren  -  Best Actor in a Musical  Kobna Holdbrook-Smith  } ===Original Broadway production=== {  !Year !Award !Category !Nominee !Result -  rowspan=\\"29\\" 2020  rowspan=\\"12\\" Tony Awards  colspan=\\"2\\" Best Musical  -  Best Book of a Musical  Katori Hall, Frank Ketelaar and Kees Prins  -  Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical  Adrienne Warren  -  Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical  Daniel J.

He played 186 matches in the first league of Romania, most of them for Oțelul Galați, being also the captain of the club in the 1990s and a legend of the red, white and blue side. Captain of a generation, considered by many supporters to be the most beautiful in Oțelul's history, with players such as: Cătălin Tofan, Costin Maleș, Tudorel Pelin, Viorel Tănase, Gigi Ion or Viorel Ion, Ștefan surprised many fans by the fact that, despite he was a defensive profile player, scored a lot of goals, many of them decisive for \\"the Steelworkers\\". As a matter of fact, he was the first player who fight for the Liga I top scorer award, as the player of Oțelul. In the 1997–98 season, Vali Ştefan was the 4th in the table, with 14 goals scored. In the 2011 IFFHS top of the best defensive profile scorers in the history of football, Ștefan was on the 63rd place, over players like: Fernando Hierro, Laurent Blanc, Roberto Carlos or Franz Beckenbauer. As proof of attachment the fans even made him a song, which began with the phrase: Vali Ştefan-căpitan, ca Baresi la Milan! (\\"Vali Ştefan-captain, like Baresi at Milan!\\"). He also played for CSM Reșița and outside Romania in Cyprus, for Omonia and Anagennisi Deryneia. ==International career== Valentin Ștefan played in 1 match for Romania, an 8-1 victory against Liechtenstein and in 24 matches for Romania B, where he also scored a goal. ==After retirement== Valentin Ștefan retired in 2000 and for a period he was the vice-president of Oțelul Galați, then in 2006 he left Romania and moved in Cyprus where he works as baker and football coach. In 2014 on the occasion of the Oțelul's 50th anniversary he was included by the Dunărea Bătrăna publication in the top 50 legends of Oțelul, together with his 1990s teammates. In 2016 he became a \\"socios\\" member of Oțelul. On 16 July 2018 he was named as the general manager of Oțelul Galați. ===Manager career=== As a football coach, Vali Ștefan worked for Omonia U-17 and Olympiakos Nicosia U-17 squads. He won two U-17 national titles, one with each team and with Olympiakos U-17, also a second league title.

It starts off Stanford-le-Hope and finishes off the Three Daws public house in Gravesend on the London River (River Thames) and is open to spritsail rigged Thames sailing barges, it uses the same course and rules as were used in the first match in 1863. ==The first matches== The swim-headed barge ( the swimmie) was convenient for river work, slow to windward, fast off the wind but performing abysmally in heavy weather in the seaway. In the 1840s the swim head gave way to the rounded bow that was soon replaced by a straight stem (the stemmie). Competition from the railways was causing barge builders to experiment. \\"The Golden Dustman\\", William Henry Dodd, organised the first race in 1863, giving cash prizes for the first barges in the stumpie and topsail classes. The second race in 1864 attracted 40 barges. Of the 16 stumpies and the 22 topsail barges entering in 1865, six were still in service in 1931. They sailed from Erith to The Nore and back in 5hr 47min and 5hr 14min. The Stumpies commonly raced at this time with a bowsprit. The owner of the leading 1867 stumpies, Lee, painted Invicta, the white horse of Kent on his black mainsails The races were to induce the barge owners to improve the standard of equipment, and raise the status of the crews.

Developed by Czech studio Maxon, it was published in 1998 by JRC Interactive. A sequel, entitled Horké léto 2: Majer se vrací, was developed by Centauri Production and published in 1999 by JRC Interactive. Žhavé léto 3 ½ is an action/adventure/driving game developed by Centauri Production and CINEMAX, published by Akella in 2006, which although unable to use the characters and titles of the first two games was related and rounded off what was effectively a trilogy. Žhavé léto 3 ½ was published in English as Evil Days of Luckless John and in Russian as Сорвать Куш. ==Production== The graphics for the video game were created by Marek Píša. Píša and Viktor Bocan also participated in the screenplay writing. Sound and music were created by William Foldes. Most characters, excluding some female ones, were voiced by comedian Zdeněk Izer, a notable Czech impersonator. The game shares a humorous style that can seen across several Czech adventures, such as Polda. Horké léto was the first Czech game with professional dubbing. The game's most famous quote comes in its opening scene: \\"I am an ordinary kid. Guys call me Rambo and girls [call me] asshole. Otherwise, I'm Majer. Honza Majer\\". Like many other domestic video games of the era, Horke Leto was intended to appeal directly to Czech and Slovak players. The game became a phenomenon upon its release and it immediately ranked among the most popular Czech adventures. In 2003, however, Petr Ticháček wrote that the fan base of the game had heavily diminished. ==Sequels== According to Miroslav Mrňa, the idea of a sequel was brought up by JRC, an exclusive distributor for the first game. The developers found the proposition interesting and decided to pursue it. Initial work on the sequel began in late December 1998. The team consisted of one scriptwriter, two programmers, three graphic artists and two musicians. Mrna described the development and production process of the game in detail for iDNES.cz. A watercolour-style design was used for the backgrounds of Horke Leto 2; it was painted by hand and then scanned into a computer. The images were inspired by the works of painter Jan Štěpánek. By mid-November, the game was expected to be released in time for the Christmas season. The game was planned to be released around the same time as Polda 2 and there was a friendly rivalry between the two titles. Horke Leto 2 caught the attention of Bonusweb during development, who devoted a considerable amount of airtime to the game. This included a series of news articles where they observed the game's development; gave a preview and review; provided a tutorial; published an interview with project leader Miroslav Mrňa and finally gave away a demo. IDEA Games completed a conversion of the game for iOS and Android platforms in 2012; players could access a 30-minute episode before having to pay in order to complete the rest of the adventure. The game was re-released with updated graphics. While developers from Centauri Production wanted to create a second sequel to the game, they were unable to obtain the rights for the name \\"Horke Leto\\" or the main character Honza. The original title for the third in the series was intended to be Raiders of the Lost Casino, but this was only used for international distribution purposes. In May 2005, the third title was announced as being prepared for release in the third quarter of that year. Subsequently, the game was scheduled to be released in the first few weeks of 2006. This was later pushed to February that year. Akella demonstrated the game as a work-in-progress at E3 2006. Akella planned an English release for the end of 2006. A French version was made and released 24 August 2007. The game's visual style is both cartoon-like and gritty. ==Plot and gameplay== In Horké léto the player takes control of teenager Honza Majer, who must rescue his family after they are captured by cannibals. In Horké léto 2, Honza Majer must retrieve an artifact—the Purple Salamander—from the bandit, One-Eye Dingo. Žhavé léto 3 ½ sees the player take control of Honza's grandfather, the hapless protagonist Johnny Majer, who must compete with the Mafia in the age of the prohibition. Set in the gangster age of the 1930s, the player takes control of the handsome street rat Johnny who inherits a casino, only to discover that there is a plot to take it off him. The first two games are point and click adventures controlled by the mouse. The third is mainly a point and click adventure with elements of stealth, fighting, driving, and shoot ‘em up. ==Critical receptionHorké léto=== Refresher.cz deemed Horké léto an average game, but noted that it didn't stop the game from becoming a domestic hit. Doupe.cz wrote that the game was one of the best Czech adventures, one that every gamer should play. Excalibur stated that while the graphics and gameplay were nothing special, it was the dubbing into local languages that captured the imagination of Czecheslovakia. PC Tuning deemed it one of the 10 best Czech games of all time. Refresher thought it was the 20th best Czech title, praising the game's amusing dialogues and first- class dubbing. ===Horké léto 2=== In a preview, Bonusweb hoped that the game's humour would outweigh its average graphics and animations making it an above- average Czech title. Bonusweb.cz compared the title to Polda 2, and ultimately decided that despite its limitations it was worth a play. ===Žhavé léto 3 ½=== Žhavé léto 3 ½ received mixed reviews from critics who enjoyed the game's artistic style and story but disliked its gameplay and interface. Hexus disliked the clunky interface, though the review praised the game's graphics. Adventure Classic Gaming felt the game was a disappointing attempt to recapture the classic point and click adventures of the late 20th century. Adventures Planet noted the strange mix of genres, that saw arcade-style gameplay be followed by Myst-style puzzles. Bonusweb felt that despite the game's limitations, it was genuinely surprising. Game Watcher deemed the title \\"pretty poor\\". Game Slave found John to be a great idea that was poorly executed. 4 Players felt a lot of the humour fell flat. Jeux Video described the game as a funny and endearing experience. Adventure Treff felt the game was more likely to induce annoyance than fun. PC Guru thought the game was fun despite its graphics. Bonusweb compared the game favorably to Polda 5. Tiscalo felt the game's screenshots were reminiscent of Full Throttle. ==References== Category:1998 video games Category:Point-and-click adventure games Category:DOS games Category:DOS-only games Category:Video games developed in the Czech Republic Category:2006 video games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Video game prequels Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games ","title":"Horké léto"},{"id":"56919838","text":"Prilesje is a settlement (naselje) in the Vrbovec administrative territory of Zagreb County, Croatia.

He was heavily involved in the development of Tasmania's telegraphy and telephony networks, and subsequently their integration into those of the Commonwealth. Notable for his participation with William Philpot Hallam's early wireless radio experiments. ==Early life and family== Bowden was born at Launceston in August, 1860, a son of the late John Gibson Bowden. He spent by far the greater portion of his life at Hobart, for his family removed from Launceston and came to the capital of Tasmania when he was six months old and he was at Hobart ever since. He received his education at private schools. In the first place he attended a school kept by a Mr. Cairnduff (popularly known as \\"Plummy\\") in Brisbane-street, and afterwards was a scholar at Mr. E. D. Oldfield's Academy at the corner of Argyle and Brisbane streets in those days. At 12½ years of age he said good-bye to school, and made his first venture in the business world at Fletcher's stationery warehouse, then situated in Liverpool St, next to Mr. R. A. Mather's establishment. \\"Young Bowden,\\" as he then was styled, left the stationery business in order to enter the postal service — and there found his niche. He was married in 1891, at Port Cygnet. In 1925 his wife had passed some years prior. He had three sons and three daughters. His eldest son, Eric Bowden, was an equipment engineer in the Postmaster-General's Department at Hobart and went on to become the Tasmanian Wireless Inspector. Frank Philip Bowden, his second son, was taking his B.Sc. degree in 1925, and was demonstrator in physics at the Tasmanian University, and the third son. Mr. J. G. Bowden, was associated with the electrical firm of Messrs. Medhurst and Sons. ==Professional career== Bowden took up the duties of telegraph messenger on 1 April 1875, the telegraph department at that time being a separate branch of the post office. Fred A. Packer was Superintendent of Telegraphs at the time, with J. J. Macdonald the chief operator. Morse recorders were then in use, he explained, either \\"embossers\\" or \\"inkers,\\" and the received telegrams were transcribed at sight from the tape by hand on to the forms for delivery. Various systems were adopted subsequently. At first the recorders were replaced by sounders, messages received being taken by sound. That was followed by the duplex system, worked two ways, two messages being simultaneously received and sent on the one wire. The successor to this system was the quadruplex system, which enabled four messages — two sent and two received — to pass on one wire at the same time. The next development was the introduction of the Wheatstone automatic duplex system. This was run on both cables to the mainland of Australia. By the system, on each cable, received messages are taken on tape which is gummed on to forms and transcribed for delivery. The \\"sent\\" business was punched on a Gell or Kleinschmidt keyboard perforator and despatched through a transmitter to the distant station, where Morse signals appear on the tape. The Murray multiplex system then came into vogue, but was still in the experimental stage in Tasmania. Bowden served as a messenger for nine months, and in 1870 was appointed as operator. In 1887 he became chief operator, in succession to Mr. Macdonald, and in 1891 received the appointment of manager of the telegraph office at Hobart. Some four years later he found himself installed as chief clerk and operator, telegraph branch, under the scheme by which the postal and telegraph departments were amalgamated, and in 1899 was appointed manager of the telegraph branch, each successive step re-presenting promotion. In 1919 Bowden was temporarily transferred as Commonwealth Electoral Officer for Tasmania to conduct the Federal elections in that year, and after the elections he resumed his duties in the Postmaster-General's Department, the following year, as manager of the telegraph branch. It may be noted that telegraph and telephone duties were combined as from the inception of the telephone system in 1883 until May, 1922, when a separate telephone branch was created with Mr. P. N. Ferris as telephone manager. Bowden's duties at various times included jurisdiction over the telegraph traffic throughout the State, as distinct from the management of the telegraph office at Hobart. Bowden retired from the public service at age 65 on 18 August 1925, having served for some 50 years and three months. At retirement he noted that the former Deputy Postmaster at Hobart, Mr. H. L. D'Emden, who retired in August, 1923, William Philpot Hallam, who left the service in August, 1924, and himself were all three telegraph messengers, having entered the service together. ===Development of Telegraphy=Development of Telephony=Wireless experiments=Post Federation integration=Personal life== As a boy chorister in St. David's Cathedral he first sang the solo, \\"I was glad when they said unto me we will go into the house of the Lord\\" and extent for the few years he spent as a member of the choir there. He had been a parishioner of Holy Trinity Church. He sang in the choir at Holy Trinity when about 10 years of age, during the rectorate of the Ven. Arch-deacon Davenport, and it was when St. David's Cathedral was opened that with other boy choristers from various parish churches he assisted with his voice in the opening ceremony, and with other boys remained there for a time. In 1900 Bowden returned to Trinity Church, was appointed choirmaster some three years later, and has held the position till 1925. His name is musically remembered as having been associated with the Mohawk Club and the Orpheus Club. For more than 20 years he was secretary to the Philharmonic Society and other musical organisations, and his tenor voice was on many occasions heard as a soloist in \\"The Messiah\\" and other works. He was also associated with the introduction of the popular \\"Waltzing Matilda\\" in connection with local community singing. He supplemented his many activities in church life by serving on a number of Diocesan church committees, was a member of the Synod and Diocesan Council, and vice-chairman of the Church of England Men's Society. An enthusiastic Mason, Mr. Bowden joined the Pacific Lodge at Hobart 35 years ago, and has passed through various Grand Lodge offices. In 1925 he held the rank of Past Deputy Grand Master and president of the Board of General Purposes. The Pacific Lodge made him an honorary life member, and when the rank of Past Deputy Grand Master was conferred on him the mother lodge presented him with a handsome set of regalia. Bowden was a particularly keen bowler and also a fisherman. For 40 years he spend his annual holidays on the East Coast for bream fishing at Swansea and Swanport, and has been a member of the Derwent Bowling Club since its inception. ==Late life and legacy== Jenvey retired from the Postmaster-General's Department in 1910 after 40 years of service. ==ReferencesArtifacts== * Museums Victoria Jenvey's Coherer, used for communication with St. George, 1901 Museums Victoria ==Publications== * Jenvey, H.

Born on a mountaintop farm in Virginia, Hess without formal theological training was ordained in the Methodist Protestant church in 1896 and immediately served two small congregations in West Virginia. Later, after completing his formal theological and university education, Hess served as president of the Methodist Protestant institutions of West Lafayette College, Ohio and Adrian College, Michigan. After leaving Adrian College in 1917 Hess returned to church pastoral duties ministering to Methodist Protestant, Congregational and Unitarian-Universalist churches. Hess made nationwide news in 1927 when he changed the traditional wedding vow of “until death us do part” to “as long as this union shall last.” Hess believed in the separation of state and church. Although his church granted divine sanction for a civil ceremony, state law retained provisions for marriage annulment regardless of the words used in the wedding ceremony. Hess also dropped the use of the word “obey” from the wedding service. Rather, he solicited a promise given freely to provide, protect and keep pure and unspotted. Hess concluded his reasoning saying, “I would not under any circumstances perform a ceremony where these conditions were not agreed to. I never ask if they will ‘obey.’ What's the use?” == Early life and education == Hess was born December 8, 1874 in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. He was the only child of John A. Hess and Mary E. Hess (nee Thomas). When Hess was five years old, his mother died. His father later remarried, giving Hess an immediate family of seven half brothers and sisters. In a 1926 newspaper interview, Hess recalled that his father, a hardscrabble mountain farmer, was not an educated man. Growing up Hess attended only local public schools and had few experiences outside that of a farm boy. === Randolp-Macaon Academy and correspondence course === Hess expanded his early mountain education with a two-year course of study at Randolph-Macon Academy in Front Royal, Virginia. Hess graduated from this preparatory school in 1895. Afterward, Hess returned to West Virginia where he completed a four-year (1896–1900) correspondence course (also known as a conference course) “under state-authorized facility and examiners.\\" === Westminster Theological Seminary === In 1900 or 1901 Hess started formal theological studies at Westminster Theological Seminary in Westminster, Maryland. Hess also simultaneously took additional courses at Western Maryland College that shared a common campus with the seminary. Upon graduation from theology school in 1903, Hess was 29 years old, married and had two children. === University of West Virginia === Hess continued his studies (1903–1908) at the University of West Virginia (UWV). Hess enrolled as a “special” student, as were many others. In 1906 he was awarded a “special” A.B. (Artium Baccalaureus – Bachelor of Arts) degree and in 1907 he was awarded a “special” A & S degree (it is not known what this degree is). Newspaper accounts also indicate that Hess was a teacher at the university and a part-time minister for the Methodist Protestant Church in Morgantown, West Virginia. In August 1908, Hess resigned his part-time pastorate and his West Virginia University teaching position to accept a one-year teaching assignment at Kansas City University, Missouri. == Denominational and educational career  Early pastorates === Hess's ministerial career pre-dates his formal theological education. He was ordained in the Methodist Protestant denomination around 1896 in Harrisville, West Virginia. He later held pastorates in two West Virginia churches; Nestorville (1896–1897) and St. Mary's (1898–1900). Following his pastorate in St. Mary's, Hess, as noted earlier, devoted time from 1900 to 1908 on academic studies. From 1903 to 1908 Hess was also a part-time pastor to the Methodist Protestant Church in Morgantown, West Virginia. During his time in Morgantown, Hess became engaged in Methodist Protestant denominational affairs. At the 1908 Methodist Protestant quadrennial conference, Hess was successfully nominated to serve on the board of governors of his alma mater, the Westminster Theological Seminary. Hess, however, was unsuccessful in his bid to be secretary of the board for the Young People's Work organization, the denomination's effort to harness youth engagement. Hess also served on the conference's standing education committee. At the next quadrennial conference in 1912, Hess again was successfully nominated to the board of governors of the Westminster Theological Seminary. He was also assigned to the Revisions Committee of the conference. === Methodist Protestant Church in Buckhannon, West Virginia === Following his one-year assignment in Kansas City in 1909, Hess accepted the pastorate of the Methodist Protestant Church in Buckhannon, West Virginia. Hess extended his denominational activities to the local level allowing his name to be offered for the presidency for the West Virginia Methodist Protestant Conference. Hess led on early balloting, but when notified by telegram that his ill wife had taken a turn for the worse, he withdrew his name from consideration. === College president === Two years later in 1911, Hess resigned his pastorate in West Virginia and moved to Ohio to accept the position of president of West Lafayette College. West Lafayette College, incorporated in 1900, was the newest of the educational institutions maintained by the Methodist Protestant Church. In the public announcement of Hess's appointment as the college president, a Ph.D. academic credential was associated with Hess. No earlier public record had reported that Hess had achieved such a degree. It is assumed that the college conferred an honorary degree to the incoming president. Among the actions taken by Hess as president at West Lafayette College was his proposal to consolidate his college with the Michigan-based Adrian College, another Methodist Protestant Church educational institution. The West Lafayette College trustees, however, voted to surrender control of the college to the General Conference of the Methodist Protestant Church for liquidation. At the 1916 Methodist Protestant quadrennial conference, the matter was resolved with the decision to consolidate the two colleges to Adrian, Michigan. Hess was appointed as Adrian's new president. Hess remained at Adrian College until he resigned in 1917 to resume pastoral duties at the First Congregational Church of Manistee in Michigan. === First Congregational Church of Manistee === There is little in the public record on Hess's pastorate in Manistee (1917–1921). The only contemporary comment on Hess's pastorate is offered in a history written of the Manistee church. “The Reverend Dr. A. F. Hess was a man with a ‘brilliant mind and an eloquent tongue.’ He made patriotic addresses all over the country. He formed a group of around 100 men to discuss the war and other questions of the day. He gave a series of lectures on psychology.” During his Manistee pastorate, Hess was also recognized by the American City bureau as one of America's 100 best speakers in the United States. === First Methodist Protestant Church=== Hess’s next pastorate was at the First Methodist Protestant Church (1921–1925) in Fort Worth, Texas. This pastorate was the result of a decision made by the Methodist Protestant Home Mission to send a minister to the Dallas – Fort Worth area to help build up the church in that area. Unfortunately, the public record of Hess's endeavors is silent. What is clear is that in 1925 he departed Fort Worth as well as left the Methodist Protestant denomination when he assumed the pastorate of the First Congregational Church in Beaumont, Texas. === First Congregational Church in Beaumont === The pulpit in Beaumont became vacant following the resignation of the church’s founder Dr. Samuel Holden, who after two years accepted an appointment to the office of the assistant superintendent of the Congregational Church in the central south region. In founding the church Dr. Holden said, “In the record of our Lord’s life He gives us in clear language, so plain that He cannot be misunderstood or misinterpreted, at least four tests of a Christian disciple.” Those tests were loyalty to the truth, love of humanity, doing good and cross-bearing or, as Holden noted, the totality of life is summed up in what good we may do in life. Hess's sermon topics in his inaugural year reflected both his desire to prepare his flock to be Christian disciples and his belief that religion includes the embrace of the human experience. Those topics include: “The Appeal and Response of Christ's Love as Revealed in Human Relationships,” “Shall We Cease to Think in Matters of Religion or Adopt a Policy of Blind Faith” and “The God of Human Experience.” Hess extended his ministry beyond his Sunday pulpit to what was described in the local newspaper as a “Miniature University.” The Tuesday morning Woman's Lecture Club was devoted to a series of lectures by Hess on the philosophy of religion that explored world religions. Wednesday night classes offered lectures on general psychology. Friday night classes were designed for parents with lectures on child psychology. Three of these lectures also aired on the local KFDM radio station. A Boy's Science Club was also conducted with the purpose of explaining, as Hess said, “the what and why” of things to the church youth. A large advertisement for the First Congregational Church in the Beaumont Enterprise newspaper reflected both Hess's and the church's character, “This is a distinctive church with a distinctive aim. It has no creed and values truth more highly than belief. It is emphatically opposed to ignorance, prejudice, religious bigotry, injustice and desecration of human values.” Hess's pastorate in Beaumont ended in 1930 when he accepted a call to the United Liberal Church in Atlanta, Georgia. === United Liberal Church, Atlanta === Hess's call to Atlanta was the result of outreach by Hess to Rev. George F. Patterson, executive vice president of the American Unitarian Association in Boston, Massachusetts. In a November 29, 1929 letter from Hess to Patterson, Hess followed up on a conversation the two gentlemen had had at the Southwestern Federation of Religious Liberals held in Lawrence, Kansas, early that year regarding Hess's desire to fellowship with the Unitarians. Hess's new pastorate (1930–1935) at the United Liberal Church inserted him into a religious environment that was distinctively unique. The United Liberal Church was the result of a 1918 decision by local Atlanta Unitarians and Universalists to merge into a single congregation. This local merger pre-dates the national merger of the two denominations in 1961. The 1918 merger was intended to be “a temporary merger to last for the duration of the war (World War I) and help win the war by saving fuel and light.” However, the merger continued until 1950 when internal and external conflicts over racial and political issues resulted in the collapse of this joint Unitarian Universalist congregation. Hess assumed a pulpit in Atlanta that had been vacant for nine months following the resignation of Rev. Clinton Lee Scott. Scott had been a popular minister who had provided the joint congregation a sense of unity and achieved a sense of financial stability that had long eluded the congregation. Hess wrote to Rev. George F. Patterson one month after arriving in Atlanta stating that he had not yet acquired a “definite knowledge as to the real conditions of the Atlanta Church.” Hess's sermons continued to have a familiar ring, “The Kingdom of God Is Within You,” “Christianity As It Was and Now Is” and “Jesus As He Must Have Been.” Hess did not, however, reprise his miniature university concept in Atlanta. Atlanta home to several universities, libraries and arts venues was a more cosmopolitan environment than Beaumont. Additionally, the Atlanta church had long had an active men's and women's organizations that had been well-established venues for social and cultural exchange opportunities. Since the founding of the church in 1884, Hess was only the third minister to serve five or more years in the pulpit. His ministry ending only by his unexpected death in October 1935. == Personal life == In May 1897 Hess married Sabina Francina “Bina” Livesay in West Virginia. Into that marriage four children were born; Aubrey W. (1899–1929), Adrian T. (1900–1939), Robert LD (1903–1992) and Wanda L. (1908–1997). The eldest child Aubrey W. served in France in World War I. After the war, Aubrey W. and his brother Adrian formed an aircraft manufacturing company in Michigan. In 1919 it was announced that the Rev. Aubrey F. Hess had been appointed the president of the aircraft company, Alliance Aircraft. This position was assumed to be honorific. Aubrey W. died in October 1929 when an aircraft he was testing caught fire and crashed. Hess's marriage to Bina ended sometime in the mid-1920s. Hess subsequently remarried Jean Markley (née Van Horn). The only child of that marriage was Jean Cathlean who was born in 1928. Rev. Hess died at 8 o’clock in the morning on October 27, 1935, of a heart attack in the lobby of the Waldo Hotel in Clarksburg, West Virginia. Hess had just attended the general convention of the Universalist church in Washington, D.C., and was en route to Cincinnati, Ohio to attend the general convention of the Unitarian church. Hess's death was widely reported in newspapers. The December 1935 issue of The Universalist Herald ran a cover story on Hess's death publishing his last sermon “What is a Man Without Honor” and the sermon of Rev. John Rowlett delivered at Hess's funeral service. In his funeral sermon, Rev. Rowlett said, \\"A great and good man has gone. Our whole denomination and the cause of liberalism has lost something great.\\" Rev. Rowlett continued, \\"He was a true liberal. He had a free mind. His mind was open to the four corners of the earth, ready, willing and eager to welcome truth from whatever direction it might come. He demanded an idea no passport of tradition but only the passport of truth.” ==Legacy== His widow Jean Hess remained an active member of the United Liberal Church until that congregation collapsed in 1950. Jean Hess continued her active membership in the rebirth of the new Unitarian Universalist congregation under the ministry of Rev. Edward Cahill. That new congregation gave rise to the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Atlanta (UUCA) in the early 1960s. Due to growth and overcrowding in the late 1960s at UUCA, a new Unitarian congregation spun off from UUCA called Northwest Unitarian Church. The widow Jean Hess and her daughter joined that new church. Jean Wells (née Hess) was a Charter Member of that church. == Footnotes == Category:American Methodist clergy Category:American Congregationalist ministers Category:American Christian theologians Category:People from Virginia Category:American Unitarian Universalists Category:1874 births Category:1935 deaths Category:Westminster Theological Seminary alumni Category:West Virginia University alumni ","title":"Aubrey Franklin Hess"},{"id":"56920046","text":"Malwande Zamo (born 9 January 1997) is a South African cricketer.

The sites include that of a late 19th-century synagogue, and the remains of a creamery complex operated by local Jewish dairy farmers that was located nearby. It was one of the first rural Jewish settlements in the state, supported financially by the Baron de Hirsch. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. ==Description== The New England Hebrew Farmers of the Emanuel Society Synagogue and Creamery Site is located southwest of the junction of Routes 161 and 85 in the village of Chesterfield. It consists of several parcels, and is partially bisected by Powers Brook, which originally provided power for the creamery. The site is wooded, except for an open grassy area where the synagogue stood. This area is now marked by a commemorative stone plaque. In the woods nearby are foundational remnants of the creamery building and other buildings related to the Jewish community that thrived here around the turn of the 20th century. The Jewish community in Chesterfield was established in the 1890s as part of an effort by the Baron de Hirsch, a prominent Jewish philanthropist, to resettle Jews fleeing pogroms in Eastern Europe in the United States. Most of the original Jewish settlers in this area were Orthodox Jews who had first settled in Brooklyn, New York. Farmland in southeastern Connecticut was inexpensive at the time, and its purchase was supported financially by de Hirsch and others. A Jewish congregation was formally established in 1890, and was called Society Agudas Achim. A modest wood-frame synagogue was built on this site in 1892, and the creamery was built the same year as a cooperative venture of the congregants as an outlet for the milk they produced. Later buildings include a small powerhouse and a mikvah. The creamery only operated for about twenty years, before changing trends in dairy consumption led to its demise. The building was eventually repurposed as an inn, but was destroyed by fire in 1950. The synagogue was also damaged in the fire, and was also eventually abandoned. It was destroyed by an arsonist in 1975. Descendendants of some of the original settlers formed a historical society in the 1980s to preserve and remember the legacy of the settlement, resulting in the placement of the commemorative marker, and the site's listings both as a state archaeological site and on the National Register of Historic Places. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in New London County, Connecticut ==References== Category:Montville, Connecticut Category:Archaeological sites in New London County, Connecticut Category:National Register of Historic Places in New London County, Connecticut Category:Archaeological sites on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut ","title":"New England Hebrew Farmers of the Emanuel Society Synagogue and Creamery Site"},{"id":"56920086","text":"Olávio Vieira dos Santos Júnior (born 21 November 1996), commonly known as Juninho, is a Brazilian footballer who plays for G.D.

Certain structural features of functional importance, particularly relating to metabolism and reproduction, are often conserved through geologic time. Early proteins consisted of simple amino acids, with more complicated amino acids being formed at a later stage through biosynthesis. Such late-arising amino acids included molecules like: histadine, phenylalanine, cysteine, methionine, tryptophan, and tyrosine. Ancient enzymatic proteins performed basic metabolic functions and required the presence of specific co-factors. The characteristics and ages of these proteins can be traced through comparisons of multiple genomes, the distribution of specific architectures, amino acid sequences, and the signatures of specific products caused by particular enzymatic activities. Alpha and beta proteins (α/β) are considered the oldest class of proteins. Mass spectrometry is one analytical method used to determine the mass and chemical makeup of peptides. Ancestral sequence reconstruction takes place through the collection and alignment of homologous amino acid sequences. These sequences must bear a sufficient amount of diversity to contain phylogenetic signals that resolve evolutionary relationships and allow for further deduction of targeted ancient phenotype. From there a phylogenetic tree can be constructed to illustrate the genetic resemblance between various amino acid sequences and common ancestors. The ancestral sequence is then inferred and reconstructed through maximum likelihood at the phylogenetic node(s). From there, encoding genes are synthesized, expressed, purified, and incorporated into the genome of an extant host organisms. Functionality and product properties are observed and experimentally characterized. Using a greater degree of variance in representative monomeric proteins will increase the overall precision of the results. ==History== In 1955, Philip Abelson published a short paper that laid out what has become, through several cycles of technical advances, the field of palaeoproteomics or ancient protein research. He was the first to propose that amino acids, and therefore proteins, were present in a fossil bone millions of years old which gave clues about the evolution of very early life forms on our planet. Only a few years later, Hare and Abelson (1968) conducted another pioneering analysis on shells and found out that amino acids degrade or change their internal L to D configuration progressively over time, and that this could thus be used as dating tool, in what is called amino acid dating or amino acid racemization. This dating approach was later shown to be a very capable tool for dating periods extending further back than the limits of radiocarbon at ca. 50,000 years. == Structure and evolution == Ecological and geological events that changed the conditions of Earth's global environment effected the evolution of protein structure. The Great Oxidation Event, triggered by the development of phototrophic organisms like cyanobacteria, resulted in a world-wide increase in oxygen. This pressured various groups of anaerobic prokaryotes, changing the microbial diversity and global metabolome, as well as altering enzyme substrates and kinetics. Certain areas of proteins are more prone to undergo evolutionary change at a rapid rate, while others are unusually tolerant. Essential genes - or sequences of genetic material responsible for protein architecture, structure, catalytic metal co-factor binding centers, or interaction - will experience little change compared to the rest of the genetic material. Portions of this material will be confronted with genetic mutations that affect amino acid sequencing. These mutations laid the ground for other mutations and interactions that had major consequences towards protein structure and function, resulting in proteins with similar sequences serving entirely different purposes. Joseph Thornton, an evolutionary biologist, researched steroid hormones and their binding receptors to map their evolutionary relationship. He inserted DNA molecules, equipped with reconstructed amino acid sequences from ancient proteins, into in-vitro cells to make them synthesize ancestral proteins. The team discovered that reconstructed ancestral protein were capable of reconfiguration in response to multiple hormones. Additional studies conducted by other research teams indicate the evolutionary development of greater protein specificity over time. Ancestral organisms required proteins - mainly enzymes - capable of catalyzing a broad range of biochemical reactions to survive with a limited proteostome. Subfunctionalization and gene duplication in multifunctional and promiscuous proteins led to the development of simpler molecules with the ability to perform more specific tasks. Not all studies concur however. Some results suggest evolutionary trends through less-specific intermediates or molecules bearing two high-specificity states or decreased specificity altogether. A second apparent evolutionary trend is the global transition away from thermostability for mesophilic protein lineages. The temperature at which various ancient proteins melt was correlated with the optimum growth temperature of extinct or extant organisms. The higher temperatures of the Precambrian affected optimum growth temperatures. Higher thermostability in proteinaceous structures facilitated their survival under more critical conditions. Heterogeneous environments, neutral drift, random adaptations, mutations, and evolution are some of the factors that influenced this non- linear transition and caused fluctuation in thermostability. This led to the development of alternative mechanisms of surviving fluctuating environmental conditions. Certain ancestral proteins followed alternative evolutionary routes to obtain the same functional outcomes. Organisms that evolved along different pathways developed proteins that performed similar functions. In some cases, changing a single amino acid was enough to provide an entirely new function. Other ancestral sequences became over-stabilized and were incapable of conformational changes in response to shifting environmental stimuli. ==Associated fields Palaeoproteomics === Palaeoproteomics is a neologism used to describe the application of mass spectrometry (MS)-based approaches to the study of ancient proteomes. As with palaeogenomics (the study of ancient DNA, aDNA), it intersects evolutionary biology, archaeology and anthropology, with applications ranging from the phylogenetic reconstruction of extinct species to the investigation of past human diets and ancient diseases. === Other fields === Zooarcheology uses mass spectrometry and protein analyses to determine the evolutionary relationship between different animal species due to differences in proteinaceous mass, for instance collagen. Techniques such as shotgun proteomics allows researchers to identify proteomes and the exact sequences of amino acids within different kinds of proteins. These sequences can be compared to other organisms within different clades to determine their evolutionary relationships within the phylogenetic tree. Proteins are also more preserved in fossils than DNA, allowing researchers to recover proteins from the enamel of 1.8 million year old animal teeth and mineral crystals of 3.8 million year old eggshells. == Applications and products == Combined genome and protein sequencing research has allowed for scientists to further piece together narratives of archaic environmental conditions and past evolutionary relationships. Research into the thermostability of protein structures permits predictions of past global temperatures. Ancestral sequence reconstruction further reveals the origins of human ethanol metabolism and the evolution of various species. An example of this would be the identification and differentiation of Denisovan hominids from modern Homo sapien sapiens through amino acid variants in collagen obtained from the former's teeth. The study of ancient proteins has not only helped to determine the evolutionary history of viral proteins but facilitated the development of new drugs. == Benefits and limitations == Understanding protein function and evolution provides new methods of engineering and controlling evolutionary pathways to produce useful templates and byproducts - more specifically, proteins with high thermostability and broad substrate specificity. Multiple limitations as well as possible sources of error must be taken under consideration, and possible solutions or alternatives put into place. The statistical construction of ancient proteins is unverifiable and will not have identical amino acid sequences to ancestral proteins. Reconstruction can also be affected by multiple factors including: mutations; turnover rates - as prokaryotic species are more prone to genetic change than their eukaryotic counterparts, making it harder to determine their proteomic past; amino acid distribution; and limited resources of fully sequenced genomes and amino acid sequences of extant species. Ancestral protein reconstruction also assumes that certain homologous phenotypes actually existed within ancient proteinaceous populations when in fact the data recovered is but an estimate consensus of the total pre-existing diversity. Inadequate taxonomic sampling can lead to inaccurate phylogenetic trees due to long branch attraction. Proteins can also get degraded overtime into small fragments and have modern proteins incorporated into them - making identification difficult or inaccurate. Last but not least, fossilized remnants contain minuscule amounts of proteins that can be used for further study and identification and actually provide less information regarding evolutionary patterns compared to genome sequences. Additional concerns regarding ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) method would lie in the underlying bias in thermostability due to the usage of maximum-likelihood in obtaining data. This makes ancient proteins appear more stable than they actually were. Using alternative reconstruction methods - for instance the Bayesian method that incorporates and averages over the level of uncertainty - could provide a comparable reference regarding ancestral stability. However, this method performs poor reconstructions and may not accurately reflect actual conditions. == See also == * Epistasis == References == Category:Proteomics Category:Omics Category:Proteins Category:Paleobiology ","title":"Ancient protein"},{"id":"56920216","text":"Bathyphantes weyeri is a species of sheetweb spider in the family Linyphiidae.

There can hardly be any doubt that the classification of the species of Neptis, especially of the thetis group, will be modified in many respects as our knowledge of the geographical distribution and seasonal variation increases. At present one has to be content with a grouping which is the more probably correct classification according to one's personal opinion.

Any of the chords of equal length cuts the curve and the enclosed area into halves. Figure 2: Examples of Zindler curves with a = 8 (blue), a = 16 (green) and a = 24 (red). A Zindler curve is a simple closed plane curve with the defining property :(L) All chords, which cut the curve length into halves, have the same length. The most simple examples of a Zindler curve are the circles. The Austrian mathematician Konrad Zindler discovered further examples and gave a method to construct them. Herman Auerbach was the first, who used (in 1938) the now established name Zindler curve. Auerbach proved that a figure bounded by a Zindler curve and with half the density of water will float in water in any position. This gives a negative answer to the bidimensional version of Stanislaw Ulam's problem on floating bodies (Problem 19 of the Scottish Book), which asks if the disk is the only figure of uniform density which will float in water in any position (the original problem asks if the sphere is the only solid having this property in three dimension). Zindler curves are also connected to the problem of establishing if its possible to determine the direction of the motion of a bicycle given only the closed rear and front tracks. == Equivalent definitions == An equivalent definition of a Zindler curve is the following one: :(A) All chords, which cut the area into halves, have the same length. These chords are the same, which cut the curve length into halves. Another definition is based on Zindler carousels of two chairs. Consider two smooth curves in R² given by λ1 and λ2. Suppose that the distance between points λ1(t) and λ2(t) are constant for each t ∈ R and that the curve defined by the midpoints between λ1 and λ2 is such that its tangent vector at the point t is parallel to the segment from λ1(t) to λ2(t) for each t. If the curves λ1 and λ2 parametrizes the same smooth closed curve, then this curve is a Zindler curve. == Examples == Consider a fixed real parameter a. For a>4, any of the curves :z(u)= x(u) +iy(u)=e^{2iu}+2e^{-iu} +ae^{iu/2}\\\\; , \\\\ u\\\\in [0,4\\\\pi]\\\\; , is a Zindler curve.W. Wunderlich: Algebraische Beispiele ebener und räumlicher Zindler- Kurven. Publ. Math. Debrecen 24 (1977), 289–297.(S. 291). For a\\\\ge 24 the curve is even convex. The diagram shows curves for a=8 (blue), a=16 (green) and a=24 (red). For a\\\\ge 8 the curves are related to a curve of constant width. Figure 3: Sample curve with a=4 is NOT a Zindler curve, because there are desired chords, which intersects the curve at a third point. Proof of (L): The derivative of the parametric equation is : z'(u)=i\\\\Big(2e^{2iu}-2e^{-iu} +\\\\frac{a}{2}e^{iu/2}\\\\Big) \\\\; and : z'(u)^2=z'(u)\\\\overline{z'(u)}= \\\\cdots =8+\\\\frac{a^2}{4}-8\\\\cos 3u \\\\; . z'(u) is 2\\\\pi-periodic. Hence for any u_0 the following equation holds : \\\\int_{u_0}^{u_0+2\\\\pi} z'(u) \\\\, du = \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} z'(u)\\\\,du \\\\; , which is half the length of the entire curve. The desired chords, which divide the curve into halves are bounded by the points \\\\;z(u_0)\\\\; ,\\\\;z(u_0+2\\\\pi)\\\\; for any u_0 \\\\in [0,4\\\\pi]. The length of such a chord is z(u_0+2\\\\pi)-z(u_0)= \\\\cdots =2ae^{iu_0/2}=2a \\\\; , hence independent of u_0. ∎ For a=4 the desired chords meet the curve in an additional point (see Figure 3). Hence only for a>4 the sample curves are Zindler curves. == Generalizations == The property defining Zindler curves can also be generalized to chords that cut the perimeter of the curve in a fixed ratio α different of 1/2. In this case, one may consider a chord system (a continuous selection of chords) instead of all chords of the curve. These curves are known as α-Zindler curves, and are Zindler curves for α = 1/2. This generalization of Zindler curve has the following property related to the floating problem: let γ be a closed smooth curve with a chord system cutting the perimeter in a fixed ratio α. If all the chords of this chord system are in the interior of the region bounded by γ, then γ is a α-Zindler curve if and only if the region bounded by γ is a solid of uniform density ρ that floats in any orientation. == Notes  References == * Herman Auerbach: Sur un problème de M.

Twice a finalist in the competition for the Prix de Rome, he won the first grand prize in 1872 for a natural history museum project. He stayed at the Académie de France in Rome from 1873 to 1877. The principal design he sent from Rome consisted of an ambitious restoration of the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus (1877).Mead 1996. Back in Paris in 1878, he joined the government bureaucracy as an architect for the Conseil Général des Bâtiments Civils. He succeeded as the architect of the École des Beaux-Arts in 1890. In addition to maintaining the buildings erected by Félix Duban between 1832 and 1864, he also built there a monument to Duban which paraphrased Duban's architectural style. Salle Favart in Paris Bernier's major work is the Opéra- Comique theatre, the Salle Favart, which needed to be rebuilt following an 1887 fire. He obtained the commission by winning a competition judged by five winners of the Grand Prix de Rome (including Charles Garnier), which ensured the design would reflect academic and official tastes. Because of disputes within the profession, more avant-garde architects did not participate.Ayers 2004, pp. 60–61. Built from 1893 to 1898, the theatre is typical Beaux-Arts architecture. The facade is an adaptation of Garnier's design for the Opéra, and the elaborate exterior and interior decoration shows the influence of both Garnier and Daumet. In 1898, Bernier was elected to the Académie des Beaux- Arts (in seat number 3 of the architecture section). He led an official workshop of the École des Beaux-Arts from 1905 to 1919 and was president of the Société Centrale des Architectes Français from 1911 to 1914. Grave at Cimetière du Père-Lachaise. Bernier died in Paris and is buried at Père- Lachaise Cemetery (68th division). A bibliophile, he bequeathed his collection of ancient works to the Musée Condé located at Chantilly, Oise.

He was one of well-known Thai poet and artist. == Biography == He was born on 1 May 1934 to a poor, Chinese family in the area of the Somdet Chao Phraya Market, Thonburi, across the river from Bangkok. As a young boy, he studied at the Pitchaya Yatikaram Temple School, until the effects of World War II on his family’s financial situation forced him to end his education. After Chang left school, he developed an interest in artistic expression and used found pieces of charcoal and chalk to draw on the streets and the walls of his home. With funds received from his work as a menial labourer, he bought paper, paint and pencils and with these began drawing portraits of his family members and neighbours. He continued this practice until he was able to open a stall at a local market to undertake portraits professionally. After that, Chang began painting watercolour landscapes of the areas around his house. In 1960, one of these paintings, a landscape featuring the house of Pratuang Emjaoren, a well- known Thai artist and a close friend of Chang’s, became the first of his works to be included in an exhibition. In the late 1950s, Chang began producing the first of his gestural abstraction paintings for which he is best known. According to the artist, these paintings were the result of a series of experimentations undertaken with the aim of developing a style that reflected Buddhist and Daoist principles, while also offering an alternative to the cubistic and impressionistic works that dominated Thai art circles of the period. These works were exhibited for the first time in 1966 at the Pratumwan art gallery, but were not received favourably by Thai audiences. In 1968, when the artist was 34 years old, he self-published a book featuring his ‘concrete poems,’ which dealt with social themes as well as more personal meditations on nature and family life. Unlike his paintings, these works garnered interest from Thai literary circles, gaining popularity within counterculture movements that were gaining traction in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Throughout his career, Chang positioned himself outside of mainstream art circles dominated by Silpakorn University and its National Exhibition of Art. Instead, he preferred to hold exhibitions of his and his student’s works at his own home. Similarly, Chang generally refused to sell his works, preferring instead to gain income through other means. Chang died in August 1990 at the age of 56, and was survived by his wife, four sons and three daughters. == Arts Exhibition & Poetry  1960 === *“The Thai-Chinese Art Exhibition of Thailand”, Bangkok. === 1966 === *“Contemporary Artists” Invitational Show\\", the 1st contemporary art exhibition initiated, organized and participated by leading contemporary artists, at Pathumwan Art Gallery, Bangkok. === 1967 === *“Thai Contemporary Art Exhibition”, Singapore. *“Thai Contemporary Art Exhibition” , Malaysia. *“Five Contemporary Artists”, the 3rd contemporary art exhibition, at Pathumwan Art Gallery, Bangkok. === 1968 === *“Tang Chang, his students and children” Art Exhibition, King Kaew Orphanage in Chiengmai province, a benefit show. *“Tang Chang and Children”s Art Exhibition”, Gallery 20, Bangkok. === 1969 === *“Invited Artist”, invited by the School of Art and Crafts (Poh Chang) to participate in its special exhibition of contemporary art, Bangkok. *“Tang Chang and Children”s Art Exhibition”, the 1st of its series ever staged at Tang Chang\\"s home in Bangkok. === 1970 === *“Tang Chang’s Paintings and Poetries Exhibition”, the 2nd of its series held at Tang Chang\\"s home, Bangkok. *“Tang Chang: His Art and Poetry”, a collection of his selected drawings, paintings and poetry (covering a full decade of accomplishments from 1960-1970), the 3rd of its series exhibited at Tang Chang\\"s home, Bangkok. *“An Introduction to Tang Chang: Poet, Artist and Philosopher”, a special exhibition on his contemporary drawings and paintings, poetry, and philosophical writings, at the Embassy of the United States of America, Wireless Road, Bangkok. === 1971 === *Art Exhibition “Tang Chang, his students and children’s poetry”, the 4th in the series held at his home in Bangkok. === 1972 === *“Tang Chang, His Students and Children”s Art Exhibition”, at the foyer of the Warners Theatre, Bangkok. *“Contemporary Poetry”, a public recital as invited poet at Kasetsart University, Bangkok. === 1973 === *“Tang Chang, His Students and Children”s Art Exhibition”, an open air contemporary art exhibition staged along the footpath around the huge Phramane Ground (Sanam Luang), next to the Royal Grand Palace and the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, Bangkok. === 1974 === *“Tang Chang and His Children”s Art Exhibition”, at Suan Kularb College, Bangkok. *“Tang Chang: His Art and Writings”, a special exhibit staged at the main auditorium of Thammasat University. *“Tang Chang and His Children”s Art Exhibition”, an Invitational show organized and sponsored by the Goethe Institute-Bangkok. === 1980 === *“Mother”, a public display of his writings, and poetry recital of his concrete poetry, sponsored by the Buddhism Studies Club, Thammasat University. *“Thai-Chinese-English Poetry Society of Thailand”, a special forum of cultural exchange through poetry written in 3 different languages, “Invited Poet” participating in public poetry recital, the National Library, Bangkok. *“Tang Chang: His Concrete Poetry”, an invitational show of his concrete poetry, reciting his works to the audience, at Silapakorn University. === 1981 === *“The 27th National Art Exhibition”, participated as an Invited Artist, Bangkok. === 1985 === *Poetry Recital, at the A.U.A.

Influenced by artists like James Ensor and the early works of Vincent van Gogh, it was a distinct contemporary of German Expressionism. Contrary to the more rebellious and erotic nature of many German Expressionist works, the Flemish art of the School of Latem was more oriented towards the farming life, and was expressed in earthy colours and vigorous brushwork. It was also in general more oriented towards France and Brussels than to Germany, and incorporated elements of Fauvism and Cubism, for example the interest in \\"primitive\\" art, of both the ethnic and folk traditions. Flemish Expressionists like Spilliaert were more influenced by Ensor and Symbolism, or like Wouters were closer to the vibrant colours used by the Fauvists. The main proponents were Gust De Smet, Constant Permeke and Frits Van den Berghe. ==Development== The movement originated with Albert Servaes, member of the first artist colony at Sint-Martens-Latem, who gradually moved from Symbolism to a new style from 1905 on. From 1911 on, his influence became visible in the work of Constant Permeke, who is usually considered the foremost master of the movement. It was centred around an art colony in Sint-Martens-Latem, an idyllic village on the banks of the river Lys in East Flanders, near Ghent. Permeke had studied art in Ghent, together with Gustave de Smet and Frits Van den Berghe. Before the First World War, emerging Belgian Expressionists such as Frits Van den Berghe, Gustave De Smet and Constant Permeke were inspired by Fauvism and to some extent by Cubism, emulating the bright Impressionist approach of Émile Claus and Théo van Rysselberghe. Rik Wouters in particular was attracted by the Fauvists but he died in 1916 after suffering from a serious illness. During World War I, most painters from Sint-Martens-Latem fled Belgium: Gustaaf Van de Woestijne, Léon de Smet and others lived in London, where they continued working in a late Impressionistic style. Permeke also lived in England but already painted in a monumental, dark expressionism. Gustave De Smet and Frits Van den Berghe lived in the Netherlands, where in about 1916 they changed their style from a melancholy Impressionism to the new Expressionism, influenced by Dutch painters like Jan Sluyters, the German Heinrich Campendonk, and the French cubist Henri Le Fauconnier who also lived in the Netherlands during the war. This version of Flemish Expressionism, influenced by constructivism, futurism and cubism, continued after the war in the short-lived art colony in Blaricum, where van den Berghe and De Smet joined Jozef Cantré. After the war, most artists went to live in and around Sint-Martens-Latem, establishing what has been called the second school of Latem. In the 1920s, while Permeke, De Smet and Van den Berghe painted in Ghent, at the European level it was Brussels which became closely associated with the evolving Flemish Expressionist scene. By 1930, Van den Berghe had been attracted by Surrealism while Realism had influenced the work of De Smet. On the other hand, Edgard Tytgat developed his Expressionist style rather later than the others. Concentrating on story telling, he presented a somewhat satirical view of mankind, especially in his paintings of men and women. Flemish Expressionism has been called \\"Belgium's most important contribution to modern art\\". ==Artists== *James Ensor (1860-1949) (more a precursor and influence than a real member of the movement) *Hippolyte Daeye (1873-1952) *Gustave De Smet (1877-1943) *Edgard Tytgat (1879-1957) *Prosper de Troyer (1880-1961) *Léon Spilliaert (1881-1946), mixed Symbolism and Expressionism in his art *Gustave Van de Woestijne (1881-1947) *Léon De Smet (1881-1966) *Rik Wouters (1882-1916) *Frits Van den Berghe (1883-1939) *Albert Servaes (1883-1966) *Jean Brusselmans (1884-1953) *Constant Permeke (1886-1952) *Albert Saverys (1886-1964) *Oscar Jespers (1887-1970) *Ramah (1887-1947) *Floris Jespers (1889-1965) *Frans Masereel (1889-1972) *Jozef Cantré (1890-1957) ==Gallery== File:Gustave Van de Woestyne (1881-1947) - Fuga - MSK Gent 17-03-2009 12-07-23.JPGGustave Van de Woestijne, Fuga, 1925, Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent File:Leon Spilliaert (1924) - De handelsdokken te Oostende.jpgLéon Spilliaert, The Docks of Ostend, 1924, now in the Mu.ZEE in Ostend File:Rik Wouters - Zittende vrouw bij het venster.JPGRik Wouters, Woman sitting at the window, 1915, Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent File:Van Den Berghe - Sitting Pink Nude.jpgSitting Pink Nude by Frits Van den Berghe, 1928, Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent File:Ramah (1887-1947) De schilder (1922) MSK Gent 22-10-2017 11-33-11.JPGRamah, The Painter, 1922, Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent ==Notes== Category:Expressionism Category:Belgian art movements Category:Flemish art ","title":"Flemish Expressionism"},{"id":"56920801","text":", is an anime film based on Chitose Kobayashi's autobiographical novel of the same name, produced on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the Japanese Movie Center. It narrates the vicissitudes suffered by the Kobayashi family after the armed conflict of the World War II, focused according to Chitose's vision at the time. It was produced by TV Tokyo, animated by Madhouse and directed by Toshio Hirata; its premiere in Japan was on July 10, 1993. == Plot == Chitose Kobayashi, a 7-year-old Japanese girl, raised in the Sinuiju of Korea occupied by Japan during World War II, completely ignored what it meant to be at war, but unfortunately she soon discovered that it affected the soldiers so much that they fight on the mountain front like the civilians living far away from the battlefield. The World War II begins for her the day her father receives a letter that forced him to enlist in the army and leave for the front. Subsequently, a series of devastating events that mark her childhood occur. Miko, the younger sister of Chitose dies a victim of typhoid; Ohana, her Korean servant girl and friend is fired after committing imprudence and Japan surrenders to the allies. Upon returning from her father, already in times of peace, the Russians invaded North Korea and the whole family was forced to leave that country. After unearthing the ashes of Miko, they must board a train that will take them further south of the 38th parallel, where the Americans are. However, they are forced to abandon it halfway to escape an inspection of the North Koreans. Another of the setbacks with which they have to face is the disorientation to walk on unknown roads, which causes them to move in circles throughout the day, but manage to follow the map drawn by the stars in the sky. As they progress, the difficulties will increase until they reach an emotional outcome. == Broadcasting  Voice cast == * Yoshino Takamori as Chitose Kobayashi (Chiko) * Hideyuki Tanaka as Kazuhiko Kobayashi * Keiko Han as Masuko Kobayashi * Kenichi Ogata as Takeshi * Chika Sakamoto as Michiyo Kobayashi (Miko) * Reiko Suzuki as Shigeko * Tomoko Maruo as Ohana * Shinpachi Tsuji as Sano * Hideyuki Umezu as Takayashi * Chafurin as Village Chief * Yuka Ohno as Yohko * Issei Miyazaki as Yong-Il * Michiko Neya as Hatsue * Junji Kitajima as Guide * Koji Ishii as Interpreter * Eiji Itô as Station Staff * Yuuko Sumitomo as Yukiko * Nariatsu Nomura as Officer == References  External links == * Category:1993 films Category:1993 anime films Category:Japanese films Category:Japanese-language films Category:Madhouse (company) Category:Films set in North Korea ","title":"Rail of the Star"},{"id":"56920803","text":"Doriopsilla aurea is a species of dorid nudibranch, a colourful sea slug, a shell-less marine gastropod mollusc in the family Dendrodorididae.MolluscaBase (2018).

Founding members included Lucy Lippard, Poppy Johnson, Brenda Miller, Faith Ringgold and later, Nancy Spero. The group's specific focus was to address the under-representation of women in the Whitney Museum's Painting and Sculpture Annual, the precursor to what is now known as the Whitney Biennial. During the months leading up to the exhibition in December of 1970, the Ad Hoc Committee of Women Artists staged numerous protests and interventions at the museum circulating their demand that 50% of artists represented in the upcoming exhibition be women. Coinciding with the opening of the 1970 Sculpture Annual, they printed fake tickets and distributed a forged press release stating that \\"half the artists in the exhibition would indeed be women, with a proportional percentage of black, Asian, and Puerto Rican artists,\\" forcing the director of the museum to issue a statement to the contrary. The group's actions had quantifiable results--the number of women represented rose from 4.5 to 22 percent in one year. In the winter of 1970-71 the group established the Women's Art Registry, a slide collection of work by female artists, which served as a model for later registries like West-East Bag (W.E.B.). The registry was housed by several galleries, including cooperatives 55 Mercer and A.I.R., before going to Special Collections and University Archives at Rutgers University in New Jersey, where it is now archived. In 1972, the Committee (on the colophon listed as: Maude Boltz, Loretta Dunkelman, Joan Snyder, Nancy Spero, May Stevens and Joyce Kozloff) published the Rip-Off File. The 'dossier' was based on responses they received when Spero and Kozloff sent letters to 800 women in the art world asking for stories about their experiences with sexism and discrimination.

The surname is better known in its derivative form, Rullianus, from Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus, one of the greatest statesmen and generals of the Roman Republic, who as a young man defied the orders of the dictator Lucius Papirius Cursor by engaging the enemy while his commander was away, winning a famous victory, but was then obliged to beg the Roman people to spare his life, when Cursor declared it forfeit.Livy, viii. 31–36. Chase classifies Rullius among those gentilicia that either originated at Rome, or cannot be shown to have come from anywhere else.Chase, pp. 111, 131. ==Praenomina== The main praenomina of the Rulii were Gaius and Gnaeus, although there are also instances of Servius and Sextus. Servius was an uncommon name, although not especially rare; it tended to run in families. All of the others were quite common throughout Roman history. ==Members== * Rullia, named in an inscription from Tusculum in Latium.. * Alaucus Rullius, probably a slave, named in an inscription Canusium in Apulia.Grelle & Pani, Le Epigrafi Romane di Canosa, 66. * Servius Rullius C. s., a slave named in an inscription from Canusium.Grelle & Pani, Le Epigrafi Romane di Canosa, 65. * Rullia Ɔ. l.

Inspired by both coarse Polish techniques and patterns and materials from the Orient, she has been successful in creating textiles for industrial furniture manufacturers (Cotil, Paustian), as well as for domestic use (Royal Copenhagen). She is recognized as one of Denmark's leading figures in Danish modern textile art. Her silver jewellery designs have been marketed by Georg Jensen A/S. ==Biography== Born in the Frederiksberg district of Copenhagen on 24 June 1940, Karen-Margrethe Naver is the daughter of the book dealer Rasmus Peder Pedersen Naver (1894–1976) and Christine Paula Claudia Oehlerich Petersen (1900–53). After matriculating from Øster Borgerdyd Gymnasium, in 1959 she moved to Paris where she studied history of art at the École du Louvre. On returning to Denmark, she attended Skolen for Boligindretning (Interior Design School) where she decided she wanted to make a career in textiles. In 1962, she became an apprentice with Lis Ahlmann, one of the most distinguished weavers of the day. A talented student, Naver mastered the various sewing and embroidery techniques so quickly that she was able to exhibit work at the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition in 1963. The same year, she married the actor Peter Steen, giving birth to her first child Morten in 1964. She continued her education with Vibeke Klint, progressing to the stage where she was able to open her own workshop in 1966. The designs she had created as an apprentice were brought by the textile company Cotil for commercial production. Naver went on to win the Cotil Prize in 1969 and the Lunning Prize in 1970. Around that time, Naver began experimenting with the coarser Polish weaving styles which had gained popularity, adopting new colours and widening her freedom of expression. In 1973, she met her second husband, the architect Mogens Breyen. Together they travelled to the Far East where she was inspired to adopt the intricate patterns and fine materials she discovered there. Her subsequent work, exhibited in a solo exhibition at the Danish Design Museum, initiated a new trend in decorative Danish textile art. In the late 1970s and the 1980s, Naver served on several influential boards, including the Danish Arts Foundation, the School of Applied Arts and the Danish Handcraft Council. She was also a consultant to Haandarbejdets Fremme which played an important role in promoting Danish textile design. She also contributed textile designs to Royal Copenhagen and created silverware for Georg Jensen. Among Naver's most important works are her five large tapestries in Danmarks Nationalbank, complementing Arne Jacobsen's architecture (1979), and the circular flat-woven rug she designed for A.P. Møller's headquarters (1980). ==Awards== Among Naver's many scholarships and awards are the Thorvald Bindesbøll Medal and the Order of the Dannebrog. ==References== Category:1940 births Category:Living people Category:Artists from Copenhagen Category:Danish textile artists Category:Danish women artists Category:Danish designers Category:Knights of the Order of the Dannebrog Category:Women textile artists ","title":"Kim Naver"},{"id":"56921034","text":"Andrea Peana (born 12 February 1986) is an Italian football player.

There have not been any further excavations since then. According to Conrady the castrum is made of stone, has a size of about 88 x 63 metres and a surface of about 0,6 hectares. This is the normal size of a castrum for a numerus.Das Kastell Trennfurt. Ausgegraben und beschrieben von Kreisrichter a. D. (Wilhelm) Conrady. Sonderabdruck aus dem Werke: Der Obergerm.- Raet.

Heidelberg 1900. p. 3 - 8 It is unknown when the castrum was erected and how long it was occupied. It only can be dated from the 2nd to 3rd century AD. Conrady examined a Roman votive stone, which was found in Trennfurt in the 18th century and which is walled in now inside the parish church of the village. He deciphered the inscription as \\"I(ovi) o(ptimo) m(aximo), Silvano cons(ervatori) Dianae Aug(ustae) vixill(atio) leg(ionis) XXII Anton (initianae) p(rimigeniae) p(iae) f(idelis) ag(entium) in lignari(i)s sub cur(a) Mamertini Iusti opt(ionis) d(edicavit) (duobus) Aspr(is) co(n)s(ulibus)\\".

At the time of Conrady the branch already had vanished, but its traces still could be seen on the ground.Conrady: Das Kastell Trennfurt p. 7 File:Kastell Trennfurt - Grundriss.jpgPlan of the Roman fort in Trennfurt File:Römerstein in Trennfurt - Inschrift.jpgInscription on the Roman votive stone of Trennfurt The castrum is protected as an archeological monument by Bavarian law.protected area It has the monument number D-6-6221-0050.list of monuments ==External links== * Trennfurt on the site of the German Limes Commission * Trennfurt on the site of the Main Limes Museums == References == Category:Roman frontiers Category:Roman fortifications in Germania Superior ","title":"Trennfurt Roman Fort"},{"id":"56921052","text":"The Men's singles Squash event of the 2018 Commonwealth Games was held at the Oxenford Studios, Gold Coast.

With content delivered mostly online, Purdue University Global's programs focus on career-oriented fields of study at the associate's, bachelor's, master's, and doctoral level. The university also has six physical classroom locations and an online law school. Purdue Global was created in April 2018 from Purdue University's acquisition and rebranding of the former private for-profit Kaplan University. Kaplan continues to offer non-academic support services such as recruitment, admissions, human resources, marketing and technology support by contract, under the supervision of Purdue University. PG's academic headquarters are in Chicago, Illinois; its main campus (for accreditation purposes) is in Indianapolis, Indiana; and its online support centers are in Chicago and in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. ==History== Following several years of significant enrollment decline, Graham Holdings sold Kaplan University to the Purdue University system for one dollar in March 2018, and who rebranded the institution as Purdue University Global. In exchange, Purdue agreed to employ Kaplan, Inc. as the exclusive provider of nonacademic functions, and Kaplan, Inc. agreed to assume responsibility for liabilities resulting before the transaction. According to the contract terms, Kaplan receives 12.5 percent of the university's revenue, as long as funds are available after all operating expenses and guaranteed payments to Purdue have been covered. Purdue University president, Mitch Daniels, announced the intent to acquire Kaplan University in April 2017. From 2017 to January 2018, the school's temporary placeholder name was NewU. Purdue University Global's lineage is rooted in a series of for-profit colleges: American Institute of Commerce (1937–1999), Quest College (1999–2000), and Kaplan College (2000–2004), later renamed Kaplan University (2004–2017). In the years prior to its sale to Purdue University, Kaplan University's parent company, Kaplan Inc., closed or sold several schools, including Kaplan College (a primarily brick and mortar vocational school, not to be confused with the online university that became Kaplan University in 2004), and Kaplan Career Institute, which were purchased by Education Corporation of America in 2015. Kaplan University was the last accredited higher education institution owned by Kaplan, Inc. In February 2020, Purdue University announced that Purdue Global would be holding a virtual reality component to its Los Angeles graduation ceremony. In March 2020, Frank Dooley replaced Betty Vandenbosch as chancellor of Purdue University Global. In May 2020, Jon Harbor took over as provost of Purdue Global and Marilyn Wideman, dean of the School of Nursing, announced her retirement. == Academic relationships within Purdue System == Purdue Global operates as a separately accredited institution within the Purdue University system, and is the only institution in the system operating as a public-benefit corporation. Each campus of the Purdue University system has its own accreditation, leadership, faculty, programs, and admissions policies. As a result, transfers between the campuses are highly limited. Purdue Global is classified by the U.S. Department of Education as a four-year public university but it does not receive state tax dollars due to its benefit corporation status, and it is exempt from some of the public records disclosure requirements of public universities in Indiana. According to the 2017 law that enabled Purdue or any other Indiana university to create an affiliated education institution, it still must report financial, academic and student success data to Indiana regulators, and any decisions made by the traditional side of Purdue or emails received by Purdue's administration remain eligible to the open records law, even if they pertain to Purdue Global. With the exception of Purdue Global, all degrees from all Purdue University campuses and Purdue degree programs offered through Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis and Purdue Polytechnic Institute share a similar diploma bearing the name of the institution granting the degree and the city in which it is given. Purdue Global graduates receive a diploma that uses the name \\"Purdue University Global\\" instead of the system name, and bears the Purdue Global logo in place of the Purdue University seal. Purdue University and Purdue University Global share the same alumni association. In July 2019, Purdue Polytechnic Institute announced it had received a $12 million grant from the US Department of Labor to enable 5,000 students to go through a cybersecurity apprenticeship program over the next four years. The Polytechnic Institute will partner with Purdue Global to offer online instruction nationwide for \\"nontraditional students\\" seeking work in the cybersecurity industry. ==Campus and learning site locations== Purdue Global operates primarily online, though its main campus is in Indianapolis, Indiana. Purdue Global has additional learning sites in Iowa (Cedar Rapids, Davenport, and Des Moines), Maryland (Rockville), and Nebraska (Lincoln). At least five Purdue Global physical locations have closed or are in the process of closing since Purdue took over from Kaplan. ==Finances== In 2017, Purdue president Mitch Daniels stated that the Purdue University deal with Kaplan incurred \\"virtually no financial risk\\", and had a \\"strong upside potential.\\" Critics and analysts disagreed with Daniels' assessment, and in order to obtain regulatory approval the U.S. Department of Education required Purdue to assume responsibility for Kaplan University's debt and liability \\"whether they are known or unknown, and whether they accrue prior to, or after the closing of the transaction\\" noting the debts and liabilities backed by Purdue “constitute an instrumentality of the state of Indiana for the purpose of the department’s regulations\\". In the acquisition agreement Kaplan agreed to assume responsibility for liabilities resulting before the transaction, however the U.S. Department of Education \\"ultimately holds Purdue and the state of Indiana responsible for liabilities resulting from the operation of Kaplan University.\\" Through the acquisition, Kaplan guaranteed Purdue priority payments of $10 million a year for the first five years following the transaction, of which $20 million was paid upon closing. Global receives revenues from student tuition, tuition from corporate partners, grant or scholarship aid, Title IV funds, GI Bill funds, and Department of Defense Tuition Assistance. Title IV funds include Pell Grants and federal student loans. The 2017–18 statistics are: *Federal student loans: $78,642,648 *Grant or scholarship aid: $64,847,510 *Pell Grants: $55,790,475 According to Purdue University, Purdue University Global had an $18 million loss in FY 2018, its first year of operation. Purdue University Treasurer Bill Sullivan said in regards to the 2018 finances, \\"losses are likely to continue another year, maybe two\\" and this was \\"a deliberate strategic choice and was, importantly, prefunded by Kaplan Higher Education (KHE) through the assets it brought to Purdue at acquisition\\" valued at more than $66 million in cash. Sullivan also stated that he expected \\"elevated startup costs to continue into 2019 and more modestly in 2020\\". Graham Holdings Company, reported that it recorded $16.8 million in service fees with Purdue Global in 2018, based on an assessment of its collectability under the Transition and Operations Support Agreement. In April 2019, Purdue spokesman Tim Doty stated that Purdue University \\"has invested over $1 million so employees and their families can continue, complete or further their education” through Purdue University Global in the form an employee benefit that offers free tuition to all Purdue employees and their families. In June 2018 it was estimated that Kaplan Higher Education would spend about $200 million on 'back office services' and $100 million in marketing for Purdue Global. The Century Foundation claims that in 2016–17, before the change of management, the school spent 18 cents for instruction for every dollar of tuition received. Although Purdue Global has not stated the current ratio publicly, CFO Bill Sullivan dismissed such claims, saying lower costs are \\"the nature of the internet age. It also costs Amazon less to operate than Target and iTunes or Pandora less than your local record store.\\" In July 2019, Graham Holdings reported that Kaplan Higher Education's quarterly income had declined by 76 percent from the same period in 2018, caused by a combination of the sale to Purdue, Kaplan not qualifying for full reimbursement for it services from Purdue Global, and increased spending on marketing to support the launch of Purdue University Global. In January 2020, Purdue University reported Purdue Global's 2019 fiscal year numbers, showing a $43 million loss due to what it called \\"a deliberate one-time, $28.5 million marketing investment\\" as it launched the new university as well as \\"$9 million in accrued but unpaid KHE fee that won’t need to be paid until the cash flow is positive.\\" According to the university, only \\"$5.5 million was a loss from operations.\\" Purdue Global projects that it will have an operating surplus in 2020. In February 2020, Graham Holdings Company reported that Purdue University Global owed Kaplan Higher Education $68.4 million for services and deferred fees and $18.6 million for an advance from the Kaplan University transaction.In May 2020, Graham Holdings Company reported that Purdue University Global owed Kaplan Higher Education $82.0 million for services and deferred fees and $18.7 million for an advance from the Kaplan University transaction. In June 2020, Purdue Global owed a reported $89.6 million to Kaplan in addition to $19.1 million for the advance. == Offerings, enrollment, and student body == Prior to Purdue's acquisition of Kaplan University, Kaplan had undergone several years of significant enrollment decline from a high of 60,000 students in 2015 to just 32,000 students enrolled in April 2017. By the time, Kaplan University became Purdue University Global in April 2018, enrollment was \\"approximately 30,000\\". In 2019, President Daniels explained that due to an \\"overall market slowdown\\" Purdue Global was not yet “achieving the growth that we thought we might\\". As of January 2020, following a $130 million marketing spend, the university claimed to have begun to reverse the enrollment decline in its first year of operation, growing 5 percent or 1,422 students to a total of 31,042 enrolled with 11 percent growth for bachelor's and graduate students, along with a 17 percent decline in certificate students, and a 5 percent decline in associate degree students. Indiana residents are offered discounted tuition and Purdue employees and their families are offered free tuition. It is mainly an online university, but also has locations in Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Nebraska, and Maine. Following the management change that put Purdue in charge, six physical classroom spaces were closed in 2019, including Hagerstown, Maryland; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; St. Louis, Missouri; Cedar Falls, Iowa; Mason City, Iowa; and Omaha, Nebraska. Purdue Global is academically organized into seven schools: *School of Business and Information Technology *Concord Law School Concord Law School is not accredited by the American Bar Association, which does not accredit online universities. As such, California is the only state allowing Concord's graduates to take the state bar exam. Concord's pass rate for the July 2018 sitting of the California bar exam was 29% for first-time takers and 9% for repeat takers, compared to 55% and 16% overall pass rates, respectively. *School of General Education *School of Health Sciences *School of Nursing Purdue University Global had a 91 percent NCLEX pass rate for registered nurse candidates in 2019. The pass rate was 58 percent in 2014 and 74 percent in 2017. The number of registered nurse candidates taking the NCLEX exam was 127 candidates in 2014, 159 candidates in 2017, and 94 candidates in 2019. *Open College *College of Social and Behavioral Sciences According to Purdue University President Mitch Daniels, the contrast between the typical Purdue West Lafayette student and the targeted Purdue Global student is \\"stark.\\" Around the time Kaplan transitioned into the Purdue system, approximately 12 percent of Purdue Global's student body were full-time students. The demographics of the student population were 71 percent female, 49 percent white, 29 percent black, 12 percent Hispanic, 1 percent Asian, 1 percent Pacific Islander, and 1 percent Native American. According to Purdue Global, 60 percent of Kaplan's students were over age 30, and the mean student income at enrollment was $22,323. For 55 percent of the students, neither parent attended college. While the socio-economic diversity of Purdue University is 17 percent, the federal government has not yet reported a diversity number for Purdue Global. According to Purdue Global Chancellor Betty Vandenbosch, more than 28 percent of the student body is affiliated with the military, 52 percent are the first in their family to pursue a higher education degree, and 63 percent have a child or other dependent. === Corporate partnerships === In February 2019, Papa John's Pizza announced that all its employees would receive free tuition at Purdue Global. In June 2019, Walmart announced that Purdue Global would be one of six schools in their Live Better U education benefit program. The program is being marketed with the \\"chance to get a degree for the cost of a dollar a day.\\" In June 2019, security services firm Securitas announced an arrangement to cover at least 90% of the tuition costs toward four custom certificate programs developed in partnership with Purdue Global. In October 2019, ManTech began offering its employees tuition-free access to Purdue Global's bachelor of science in analytics degree. In January 2020, Disney Aspire added Purdue University Global to its Network of Educational Providers. Other organizations that have announced partnerships with Purdue Global to offer their employees a tuition-free or reduced-tuition college degree include New Balance. In September 2020, Purdue Global announced an agreement with Gallup \\"to develop and deliver an academic program to support Gallup’s Straight to Business initiative...an undergraduate microcredential, aligned with and stackable into bachelor’s degree opportunities in analytics, business administration, communication, and industrial/organizational psychology.\\" == Academics == Purdue University Global offers both traditional programs and standardized competency-based learning. This allows Purdue Global to offer college credit to students who can demonstrate they have mastered certain learning outcomes through professional and military training. Members of the US Army, National Guard, Reserves, and veterans can obtain an AAS degree in small group management with six courses, a bachelor's degree in liberal studies with seven additional course and a master's in management with 10 additional courses. Following the acquisition, all Kaplan faculty became Purdue Global faculty which now include approximately 320 full-time faculty and 1,590 part-time faculty. Purdue University faculty are expected to become increasingly involved in launching programs and courses in the Purdue Global online system. To date, three new programs have been approved to be created in collaboration with Purdue's West Lafayette faculty including programs in pharmacy, and aviation. Like Purdue's other campuses, Purdue Global is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. Specific degree programs are accredited by the ACBSP, ABET, CCNE, AHIMA, NALA, and others. Its Master of Science degree in finance is also registered with the Certified Financial Planner board and qualifies graduates to sit the CFP examination. Purdue Global's law school,Concord Law School, is the only fully online law school in the country. Given that the American Bar Association does not accredit online universities, the school is unaccredited but students may still sit for the bar in California, or pursue an executive JD, designed for executives and others who seek graduate level training in law but do not wish to become attorneys. As of the first quarter of 2019, the pass rates of Purdue University Global nursing graduates exceed national averages, a new development since the takeover of Purdue of Kaplan University. More than three years after its ownership change, the US Department of Education's College Scorecard has not assessed Purdue University Global's online campus. Past scores of Kaplan University, conducted prior to the takeover by Purdue University, placed Kaplan's on-time graduation rate at 23 percent, similar to other Indiana schools serving non-traditional students such as Ivy Tech and Vincennes University. In the same era, the typical Kaplan student had on average 3.7 risk factors proven to lead to lower student outcomes, including being older than age 22, attending school part-time, filing taxes as an independent, having a GED, working full-time, having legal dependents other than a spouse, or being a single parent. Most Kaplan students enrolled were entirely online but of those enrolled at a physical campus, 26 percent had begun repaying their loans by 2018 after leaving school in 2015. To date, the College Scorecard only reports Kaplan data from brick and mortar programs. Data is not available for students who enrolled while under Purdue's management as Purdue Global. According to the College Navigator, Purdue University's graduation rate is 6 percent for first-time full-time students and 40 percent for part-time, non-first time students. == Leadership and administration == Mitch Daniels is the president of Purdue University Global. He reports to Purdue Global's board of trustees, which is appointed by the Purdue University board of trustees. Five of Purdue's University's trustees also serve on the Purdue Global board. Dr. Betty Vandenbosch serves as chancellor of Purdue Global and reports to the president of Purdue University and the six-member Purdue Global board of trustees. Vandenbosch previously was Dean of the School of Business and Information Technology at Kaplan University. Christopher Ruhl is the chief financial officer. Ruhl served as the senior vice president, chief financial officer, and general counsel at Ivy Tech Community College from 2012 to 2017. He also was director of the Indiana Office of Management & Budget (OMB), director of the Indiana State Budget Agency, and policy director and general counsel for the Indiana OMB under Governor Mitch Daniels. On March 12, 2020, Purdue announced that Chancellor Betty Vandenbosch had resigned from her position effective April 3, 2020. On March 26, 2020, Purdue announced that Frank J. Dooley, PhD, previously Senior Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning at Purdue University, would take over as chancellor of Purdue University Global effective May 1, 2020. == Relationship with Kaplan Higher Education, Inc. == As a requirement of the purchase of Kaplan University from Graham Holdings, Purdue University Global is required to employ Kaplan Higher Education, Inc., for 30 years as the exclusive provider of \\"marketing and advertising, front-end student advising, admissions support, financial aid and student finance, international student recruitment, test preparation, business office, technology support, human resources, finance and accounting functions\\". The Purdue trustees retain management control and responsibility over these areas. According to the contract terms, Kaplan receives 12.5 percent of the university's revenue, as long as funds are available after all operating expenses and guaranteed payments to Purdue have been covered. Kaplan guarantees Purdue $10 million every year for the first five years. Kaplan will make up the difference if PG revenues are insufficient. At the time of purchase, Kaplan's owners paid $20 million to Purdue, pursuant to that agreement. The agreement also stipulates that if Purdue alters the university's operations in a way that significantly reduces the school's revenues, Kaplan could seek reimbursement for 12.5 percent of the lost revenue. An independent financial analyst would be tasked to adjudicate the issue. Since the acquisition, Purdue's leadership has made several changes including closing at least five physical locations where Kaplan University had operated. If Purdue Global incurs $25 million in cash operating losses for three consecutive years, or total cash operating losses of more than $75 million at any point, either Purdue or Kaplan Higher Education can terminate the contract. Upon termination, Purdue University Global would retain the assets that Kaplan contributed, but would also assume responsibility for any liability arising from the operation of the institution. Bob Shireman of the Century Foundation argues the cost of buying out of the 30-year deal is \\"prohibitive.\\" Kaplan Higher Education is also an online program manager (OPM) of the Purdue University system. ==Praise and criticism== In May 2017, the Purdue University Senate passed a resolution condemning the deal between Kaplan Higher Education and Purdue University. In September 2017, Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) warned that Purdue's acquisition of Kaplan University posed major risks for Purdue University's students and reputation. They added that Kaplan has a “shameful record” as a “predatory” school. Mitch Daniels, president of Purdue University, stated that the two senators were \\"misinformed\\". Regarding criticisms of Kaplan's for-profit days, Daniels quotes former Democratic senator Tom Harkin who led a massive 2011 investigation into the for-profit education sector but praised Kaplan for standing \\"alone among the large, for- profit education companies for having taken what are, in my opinion, real and significant steps to reduce high withdrawal rates and high default rates by implementing the Kaplan Commitment program.\\" In January 2018, the former Under Secretary of Education under Barack Obama, Ted Mitchell, praised the university that would become Purdue Global for its massive investments \\"in a learning platform that is, in my estimation, among the best in the country ... It is a 'lab' whose continued work promises insights not only for [Purdue Global] but for [Purdue University] and the wider field...\\" and that \\"Kaplan has been a pioneer in creating protections for students.\\" Mitchell, the force behind Obama's Gainful Employment rules, also praised Kaplan for strong results and for taking action when they came up short, saying \\"Kaplan’s results have been strong, and where they haven’t, as in the failure of a number of their programs to meet the Gainful Employment thresholds, they have taken action to either remediate or close the programs…That’s how we want institutions to react to troubling outcomes.” Arne Duncan, the former U.S. Secretary of Education under Obama who, with Mitchell, led a crackdown on the for-profit sector, praised the potential behind Purdue's acquisition of Kaplan University, saying “...I’m excited by this opportunity for a world-class university to expand its reach and help educate adult learners by acquiring a strong for-profit college. This is a first, and if successful, could help create a new model for what it means to be a land-grant institution.” Harvard researcher Todd Rogers praised the launch of Purdue Global for its potential to generate “more learning and greater scaled implementation of interventions that help students succeed\\" and that the university had \\"...a genuine commitment to using learning and motivational sciences to improve student outcomes, and to conducting high quality research to become a leader in contributing to those sciences\\". On January 16, 2018, the Purdue Exponent editorial board stated that the Purdue University Global name was \\"downright deceitful\\" for using the Purdue name and not including the Kaplan name. In August 2018, former deputy undersecretary of education Bob Shireman called Purdue University Global \\"a for-profit college masquerading as a public university.\\" Daniels pointed out that Shireman has been accused of misrepresenting facts in his criticisms and had been forced to leave the U.S. Department of Education under a cloud of accusations that he had colluded with short-sellers attempting to reduce stock values in the for-profit sector. PG initially required students to waive most rights to sue the school and submit disputes to arbitration. The American Association of University Professors called this policy “the stuff of predatory for-profit colleges, not a leading public research institution”. The AAUP petitioned the Higher Learning Commission, the school's accrediting body, on this issue. In September 2018, Senators Durbin and Brown called for Purdue to get rid of that policy, which came from the Kaplan rulebook. The policy was eliminated within the first year of the acquisition. In January 2019, the Purdue Exponent stated that faculty were not consulted on the deliberations for the Purdue Global acquisition. Biologist David Sanders, a Purdue professor, university senate member, and local Democratic politician, hypothesized that the deal was enacted to help pay for the tuition freeze at the West Lafayette campus or that \\"'certain people see this as the future. I refer to it as the Walmart-ization of higher education....It’s cheap, it’s fast, but in two years, it’ll be broken. The same thing is true with this sort of education.'\\" Sanders added he was concerned about Purdue University Global's $100 million marketing budget. That same month, professors at Purdue University complained that Purdue Global was enrolling traditional students, which was in opposition to what Global had originally promised. The PG chancellor responded while there was no formal policy that prevented a full-time, traditional student from enrolling in a course as a non-degree seeking student, it was not the university's intent to enroll such students, and that only five of PG's 29,000 students enrolled in a single course in 2018. In May 2019, three professors claimed that Purdue University Global was draining Purdue University's branch campuses, and the deal with Kaplan Higher Education was \\"online folly. Purdue University CFO Bill Sullivan responded that the degree to which the piece \\"misread Purdue's financial statements and distorted both the financial state and mission of Purdue Global is truly disappointing and unfortunate.\\" Sullivan added that \\"In negotiating the acquisition of Kaplan University, we crafted an agreement that provided a nearly impenetrable defense of Purdue's finances. In January 2020, the Chronicle of Higher Education published a report on Purdue Global titled :Purdue Global Has Had a Rocky Start. Is It Growing Pains or a Sign of Trouble?: == References  External links == * Category:Educational institutions established in 2018 Category:2018 establishments in Indiana Category:Distance education institutions based in the United States Category:Purdue University ","title":"Purdue University Global"},{"id":"56921183","text":"Matej Tonin (born 30 June 1983) is a Slovenian politician.

Redouane Lakdim, a 25-year-old French-Moroccan (born 11 April 1992 in Taza, Morocco), shot the two occupants of a car in Carcassonne, killing the passenger and hijacking it. He then opened fire on four police officers, seriously wounding one. Lakdim drove to nearby Trèbes, where he stormed a Super U supermarket, killing two civilians, wounding others, and taking at least one hostage. He swore allegiance to the Islamic State and demanded the release of Salah Abdeslam, the only surviving suspect of the November 2015 Paris attacks. A senior gendarmerie officer, Lieutenant Colonel Arnaud Beltrame, voluntarily swapped places with a hostage. After a three-hour stand-off, Lakdim shot and fatally stabbed Beltrame. A police tactical unit immediately stormed the building and killed Lakdim. He was named a \\"soldier of the Islamic State\\" by the Amaq News Agency, and the President of France called the attacks an act of Islamist terrorism. Five people were killed in the attacks, including the perpetrator, and fifteen were wounded. ==EventsCarcassonne attacks=== Shortly before 10 a.m. (9 a.m. UTC) on Friday 23 March 2018, Redouane Lakdim, armed with a handgun, stopped a car on the outskirts of Carcassonne that was occupied by Renato Silva, of Portugal, and Jean Mazières. Lakdim shot both occupants, killing Mazières and critically injuring Silva, then stole the car and drove off. He appeared to wait outside a military barracks for soldiers, but then drove to a police barracks and attacked four police officers as they were jogging back to their barracks by shooting at and trying to run them over. One of the officers was shot, but the bullet narrowly missed his heart and instead broke a few ribs and punctured a lung. Lakdim then sped off and drove to Trèbes. ===Trèbes hostage crisis=== At around 11 a.m. Lakdim entered the Super U supermarket in Trèbes armed with a handgun, a hunting knife and three homemade bombs. There were about fifty people inside. He shouted \\"Allahu akbar\\", and declared he was a soldier of Islamic State and that he was willing to \\"die for Syria\\". He shot dead two people—a supermarket worker and a customer—and took others hostage, ordering everyone to lie on the ground. Most of those in the supermarket managed to flee and some hid in a cold store. Hundreds of police and gendarmerie quickly arrived, cordoned off the area and helped to evacuate people. They found Lakdim holding several hostages, including a woman whom he used as a human shield. A GIGN unit assembled near the supermarket and Interior Minister Gérard Collomb arrived. Lakdim demanded the release of Salah Abdeslam, a primary suspect in the November 2015 Paris attacks. During the standoff, he briefly came out of the supermarket, threatening to \\"blow everything up\\". Police brought Lakdim's mother and two sisters to negotiate, unsuccessfully. Police negotiated with Lakdim to release the hostages, and Arnaud Beltrame, a 44-year-old lieutenant colonel in the National Gendarmerie, offered to take the place of the final, female hostage, and Lakdim agreed. Beltrame set his mobile phone on a table inside with the phone line open, so the police outside could listen in. After a three-hour stand-off, Beltrame tried to disarm Lakdim and shouted \\"Assault! Assault!\\" loud enough to be heard through the phone. As a result, Beltrame was shot three or four times and fatally stabbed, while GIGN operatives immediately stormed the supermarket at 2:40 p.m. and exchanged gunfire with the assailant, killing him two minutes later. Two of the operatives were wounded. Shortly after, police dogs went into the building, and an ambulance and helicopter arrived in the car park. Beltrame was praised by Interior Minister Collomb and others for his heroism, but later died in hospital of his injuries. Autopsies found that Beltrame died from stab wounds to the throat. ==Suspect== The suspect was identified as Redouane Lakdim, a 25-year-old French-Moroccan man who was born in Morocco. He lived in Carcassonne with his parents and sisters, and regularly attended the Carcassonne mosque. He had been convicted twice for petty crimes, and had served one month in prison in 2016. Lakdim was very active on Salafist social networks and had been on a watchlist of suspected Islamist extremists since 2014. He was a small time drug dealer. He had been under surveillance for his \\"radicalism and proximity to Salafist movements\\" but had showed no signs he was going to carry out an attack. After his death in Trèbes, police raided his home as well as those of his friends and relatives and interviewed neighbours, one of whom described him as a \\"pleasant young man\\". Interior Minister Gérard Collomb believes he acted alone. A search of his home found notes referring to Islamic State, in what appeared to be a will. His girlfriend was known to French security services. ==Aftermath== Renato Silva survived being shot in the head by Lakdim before having his car stolen, and was taken to Perpignan where he went into a coma. On 4 April, he came out of the coma but could not walk unassisted and suffered partial paralysis in the face and deafness in one ear. Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa visited Silva in hospital. He was released on 23 March and returned to his home in Villemoustaussou, Aude. On 19 October 2018, three persons were indicted by French authorities in connection to Lakdim's actions. ===Reactions=== French Minister of the Interior Gérard Collomb, who was briefed on the situation in Trèbes from Saint-Cyr-au-Mont-d'Or, said he was \\"on his way to Trèbes\\" and arrived shortly after. President Emmanuel Macron said the hostage taking \\"appeared to be a terrorist act\\" and that he would return to Paris within hours to coordinate an official response. President Macron later said Arnaud Beltrame \\"fell as a hero\\" and showed \\"exceptional courage\\", in what he described as an act of \\"Islamist terrorism\\". Beltrame's name was the top trending hashtag on the French edition of Twitter on the morning he died due to tributes from France and elsewhere around the world. Gendarmerie stations across France flew flags at half-mast in his honour, and the Élysée Presidential Palace announced that a national tribute would be paid to him. : Prime Minister Theresa May denounced the attack as \\"cowardly,\\" and said the United Kingdom stood \\"in solidarity with our friends and allies in France, just as they always stand with us.\\" : Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the attack, sent condolences and said: \\"The civilized world must unite and work together in order to defeat terrorism\\". President Reuven Rivlin also denounced the attack, saying: \\"The whole free world must stand united and firm against terror: in Jerusalem, in France, and across the world.\\" : Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a statement of condemnation and solidarity against terrorism, and offered condolence on behalf of his citizens to victims' friends and families. : President Donald Trump issued a statement on Twitter, condemning \\"the violent actions of the attacker and anyone who would provide him support.\\" He continued, \\"we are with you @EmmanuelMacron!\\" ==See also== *Hypercacher kosher supermarket siege *List of terrorist incidents in France § 21st century ==References== Category:Aude Category:Crime in Occitanie Category:Hostage taking in France Category:ISIL terrorist incidents in France Category:Islamic terrorist incidents in 2018 Category:March 2018 crimes in Europe Category:March 2018 events in France Category:Mass murder in 2018 Category:Terrorist incidents in France in 2018 Category:Terrorist incidents involving knife attacks Category:2018 mass shootings in Europe ","title":"Carcassonne and Trèbes attack"},{"id":"56921192","text":" HMS Valkyrie was a shore establishment or \\"stone frigate\\" of the Royal Navy located in Douglas, Isle of Man. The establishment was split into two component parts, Valkyrie I and Valkyrie II. ==History== HMS Valkyrie was established as the Royal Navy's No. 1 Radar Training School, its personnel billeted in a number of guest houses which had been requisitioned for the duration and which were situated on Loch Promenade, Douglas. The training was undertaken at a series of buildings on Douglas Head, one being the Douglas Head Hotel, and one of which today is occupied by Manx Radio.Isle of Man Times, Saturday, December 07, 1946; Page: 4 HMS Valkyrie was commissioned in October 1941. Much of the early work involving Radar took place at Douglas Head with investment in the required equipment totaling £3,000,000 (£146,864,930 as of 2018).http://www.in2013dollars.com/1941-GBP- in-2018?amount=3000000 The training school worked in conjunction with a Vought-Sikorsky Chesapeake of the Fleet Air Arm which belonged to 772 Squadron (FAA) and was based at RAF Andreas. The aircraft was employed to provide simulated attack conditions. The Chesapeake was replaced in October 1944, after crashing on Douglas Head, killing the pilot Sub Lieutenant R. S. Paton. During the operation of No. 1 Radar Training School, Douglas Head was closed to the public which meant no access to Port Soderick was available via the Marine Drive, which had been a popular recreational area for tourists before the war.Isle of Man Times, Saturday, March 16, 1946; Page: 4 ===HMS Valkyrie II=== HMS Valkyrie II was commissioned in September 1943, to train signal men and wireless telegraphy ratings for landing craft assembling for D-Day as existing establishments could not provide sufficient personnel in time.Ramsey Courier, Friday, August 24, 1945; Page: 5 To meet this requirement men were transferred from the Army and RAF, and at the peak period 2,500 ratings were under training on a six months course.Ramsey Courier, Friday, August 24, 1945; Page: 5The messing problem of this huge commitment was solved by supplying the food from naval sources and cooking it at the Empress and Palace hotels under the supervision of civilian contractors. The Palace Dance Hall was converted into a vast mess hall where 1,200 ratings could sit down together for a meal. A section of Douglas Beach was closed off to the public for training, much of which necessarily took place outdoors. By the time of the Invasion of France, Valkyrie II's function had ceased and the establishment was paid off in March 1944.Ramsey Courier, Friday, August 24, 1945; Page: 5 Percy Noble KCB, CVO, Commander in Chief Western Approaches, inspecting WRNS during a visit to HMS Valkyrie. ===Decommissioning=== On the cessation of hostilities plans were put in place to decommission HMS Valkyrie. At 16:00hrs on Monday 30 December 1946, the White Ensign at HMS Valkyrie was lowered for the last time. The premises on Douglas Promenade were vacated and this was followed by the premises on Douglas Head which were vacated on 31 January 1947, at the conclusion of the decommissioning ceremony.Isle of Man Times, Saturday, December 07, 1946; Page: 4 During the lifetime of HMS Valkyrie over 30,000 naval ratings passed through the Royal Navy's No. 1 Radar Training School.Isle of Man Times, Saturday, December 07, 1946; Page: 4 ===French Detachment=== HMS Valkyrie was responsible for the training of Radar operators from various countries and in addition it became home to a detachment from the French Navy who underwent Radar training at the establishment.Mona's Herald, Tuesday, March 12, 1946; Page: 6 Under the command of Lieutenant Jean Colin,Mona's Herald, Tuesday, March 12, 1946; Page: 6 the detachment arrived at the commencement of the Valkyrie's commission and from June 1943 over 400 French sailors were trained in Douglas.Mona's Herald, Tuesday, March 12, 1946; Page: 6 ==Notable personnel== * Jon Pertwee: Pertwee served at the establishment during the course of which he was instrumental in the formation of an amateur dramatic society, the Service Players, of which he was made an honorary life member.Isle of Man Times, Saturday, August 19, 1950; Page: 9 ==See also== * HMS St George * HMS Urley * RAF Andreas * RAF Jurby * RAF Jurby Head * RAF Training Flying Control Centre ==References== Category:Royal Navy shore establishments Category:Douglas, Isle of Man Category:Isle of Man Category:World War II sites in the United Kingdom Category:Military training establishments of the United Kingdom Category:Training establishments of the Royal Navy ","title":"HMS Valkyrie (shore establishment)"},{"id":"56921204","text":"The Chinese Taipei national 3x3 team is a national basketball team of Chinese Taipei, administered by the Chinese Taipei Basketball Association.Profile - Chinese Taipei, FIBA.com, Retrieved 13 January 2018.

In 1965-66 he led the team in scoring (15.1) and rebounding (9.7).Georgetown Basketball History: The Top 100 - 34. Steve Sullivan, Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball. Accessed March 24, 2018. \\"Sullivan, who turned down 42 college offers to attend Georgetown, starred at the former Essex Catholic HS in East Orange NJ.\\" In 1966-67, Sullivan scored in double figures in 21 of 23 games, scored 20 or more points 10 times and averaged 18.6 points and 11.8 rebounds a game. That season, Sullivan had 33 and 17 against American University, 26 points with 23 rebounds vs. Syracuse University, and had 18 and 16 vs. Seton Hall in his final game. He is one of only seven Georgetown players ever to lead the team in scoring and rebounding in consecutive seasons. Sullivan graduated from Georgetown as the school's seventh all-time scorer, second all time rebounder, and the highest NBA draft pick to date in program history. Sullivan remained the highest Georgetown NBA pick until Sleepy Floyd was the 13th pick of the 1982 NBA Draft. Both were surpassed when Patrick Ewing was the first pick of the 1985 NBA Draft. Sullivan was selected as a member of the USA Basketball Gold Medal teams of the 1967 Pan Am games and 1968 World University Games. The USA Team for the Pan-Am games captured the Gold medal by going 9-0 with the Gold Medal Game victory over Mexico. The 1967 World University Team also won the Gold Medal, going 7-0, defeating Brazil 91-38 in the Gold Medal Game. Sullivan averaged 7.2 points in the Games. Sullivan's teammates on both squads included his future Detroit fellow draft pick Sonny Dove, Jo Jo White and Wes Unseld. ==Professional career== Sullivan was drafted by the ABA's Pittsburgh Pipers in the 1967 ABA Draft. Pittsburgh had just signed Connie Hawkins at power forward, so Sullivan waited for the NBA draft that summer. Selected 14th in the draft by the Detroit Pistons in an overall draft that included Earl Monroe, Pat Riley, Clem Haskins, Walt Frazier, and Phil Jackson, the Pistons had two of the first four overall picks. The Pistons drafted Jimmy Walker with the first overall pick, then drafted Sonny Dove with the 4th overall pick. The Pistons opted to sign Dove over Sullivan. Later, Sullivan spent nine years professionally playing in Italy and Spain, receiving numerous MVP awards. ==Death== After living and working for 45 years in Spain, Italy and England, Sullivan passed away in London, England on August 27, 2014 surrounded by his family. == References == Category:1944 births Category:2014 deaths Category:American expatriate basketball people in Italy Category:American expatriate basketball people in Spain Category:American men's basketball players Category:Basketball players at the 1967 Pan American Games Category:Basketball players from New Jersey Category:Detroit Pistons players Category:Detroit Pistons draft picks Category:Essex Catholic High School alumni Category:Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball players Category:Pan American Games medalists in basketball Category:Pan American Games gold medalists for the United States Category:Pittsburgh Pipers draft picks Category:Sportspeople from East Orange, New Jersey Category:Sportspeople from Newark, New Jersey Category:Universiade medalists in basketball Category:Universiade gold medalists for the United States Category:Forwards (basketball) Category:Medalists at the 1967 Summer Universiade ","title":"Steve Sullivan (basketball)"},{"id":"56921228","text":"Thursday the 12th is a four-part British television crime drama series, written by Paula Milne and directed by Charles Beeson, that was due to be broadcast on ITV1 in 2000. The series focuses on the Bannister family, whose lives are turned upside down when an unidentified body is found in the grounds of their estate. As an investigative TV reporter takes on the case, Marius Bannister (Ciarán Hinds), a wealthy dentist and politician, his wife Nina (Maria Doyle Kennedy), their troubled adopted teenaged son Martin (Jim Sturgess), and Nina's predatory sister Candice Hopper (Elizabeth McGovern) all come under suspicion. ==Broadcast== The series was originally set to broadcast as two feature-length episodes, but due to local elections taking place on the day the first episode was due to be broadcast, 4 May 2000, the series was pulled from the schedules at the last minute, on the grounds that it may be in breach of rules on political bias. Although it was later rescheduled for broadcast in the winter of 2000/2001, the series was once again pushed back, and was set to premiere in June 2001, although due to the foot-and-mouth outbreak of 2001, the General Election due to take place in May was put back to 7 June, and the series was subsequently pulled from the schedules once more, and remains unbroadcast in the United Kingdom.

Depicting a scene in a room, the painting draws the viewer's focus to the natural landscape outside of the window, away from the figures in the bottom right. The work is currently housed in The Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C. ==Subject and composition== The contrast between the exterior blues and greens and the interior red oranges keeps the viewer's focus away from the black cat and woman at the lower right corner of the canvas. Dogs and cats are a signature that are found in all of his works. It takes a while for the viewer to find the woman's head in chair. Her hair is palish blue like the canvas of the chair and her face the same red as the wall behind. This suggested human presence, like some figure in a dream, became a feature of these inside-outside views that Bonnard painted in the 1930s. The human figure is believed to be Bonnard's wife Marthe de Meligny. Their relationship was a strained one, made worse by Bonnard’s infidelity. The blonde woman in The Open Window may also be Renee Monchaty, with whom he fell in love around 1917 and who committed suicide in 1923, after Bonnard left her to be with his spouse. Many accounts describe Monchaty as being Bonnard's ideal statuesque model for his paintings. Bonnard’s work was painted from memory rather than from life, which accounts for the semi-realistic view of his paintings. Bonnard's studies of the domestic interior and its psychological charge, a reflection upon his private life, is evident in his work. In his interiors, a sense of longing is concentrated in open windows to the outside world. In The Open Window, color and light transfigure a room in the artist’s house in Normandy. The focal point of the painting is the void in the middle, the sky, the foliage, and the outside shadow enclosed by the window despite the painting giving more space to the walls. ==Collection== The painting as of 2018 remains under the curation of the Phillips Collection. ==References== Category:1921 paintings Category:Post-impressionist paintings Category:Cats in art Category:Paintings by Pierre Bonnard ","title":"The Open Window (Bonnard)"},{"id":"56921318","text":"The Very Rev Prof David Ritchie FRSE DD (1763-1844) was a late 18th and early 19th century Scottish minister who served as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland for the year 1814/15. ==Life== St. Andrew's Church, George Street Edinburgh He was born in Methven in Perthshire in 1763.

The lighthouse is the northernmost in Sardinia, on the eastern approach to the Strait of Bonifacio, and is at from the French Lavezzi archipelago. The island is in the municipality of La Maddalena on the Tyrrhenian Sea. ==Description== The first lighthouse was built in 1858 and consisted of a masonry quadrangular tower, high, with balcony and lantern atop a 2-storey keeper's house. The tower and the lantern were painted in white, the lantern dome in grey metallic. The lighthouse was abandoned when it started to ruin and was understood that was too much expensive to renovate it.

From 1961 to 1973, Eryurt worked for NASA, performing research for the Apollo program. She then established the astrophysics department at the Middle East Technical University (METU) in Turkey. She was the Dean of METU's science and literature faculty from 1988 to 1993. ==Early life== Eryurt was born on 29 November 1926 in İzmir, Turkey. Her father was , who was a member of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey for Denizli Province in 1944. Shortly after her birth in İzmir, Eryurt's family moved to Istanbul, and then to Ankara a few years later. After completing her primary education in Ankara, she continued to Ankara Girls' High School. In high school, she had a special interest in mathematics. For this reason, after graduating from high school, she enrolled in the Istanbul University Department of Mathematics and Astronomy. She pursued her interest in astronomy during her university studies. ==Career== After graduating from Istanbul University in 1946, Eryurt worked as an honorary assistant for two years for Tevfik Oktay Kabakçıoğlu. She was assigned to open an Astronomy Department at Ankara University. She continued her graduate studies at the University of Michigan, and in 1953 she completed her doctorate at the Ankara University Department of Astrophysics where she became Associate Professor. In 1959, Eryurt went to Canada for two years on scholarship from the International Atomic Energy Agency. Here she worked with Alastair G. W. Cameron. Although she had learned mathematics in Turkey, she had not worked with computers. She studied books in Canada and the US, teaching herself how to make use of computers for her work. She then went to the US and worked for the Soroptimist Federation of America at Indiana University, and on the identification of stellar models at the Goethe Link Observatory, working with Marshall Wrubel. After this experience, Eryurt worked at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. She collaborated with Alastair G. W. Cameron, on research on solar evolution. During this period, she was the only woman astronomer working at the institution. Eryurt's work at the Goddard Institute revealed some facts about the Sun that were not understood until then. The existing theory that the brightness of the Sun was much lower at its formation, 4.5 billion years ago, was under scrutiny. It was revealed that the Sun was actually much brighter and warmer in the past and decreased to its current level. The studies were important at that time to influence the course of scientific and engineering research aims of new space flights. She was awarded the Apollo Achievement Award in 1969 for her successful work contributing to the achievement of the Apollo 11 mission's first landing on the moon and subsequent lunar exploration, by providing NASA engineers with crucial information for modelling solar impact on the lunar environment. After completing her two year research study at the Goddard Institute, Eryurt continued to work at the institute as a Senior Researcher. The institute sent her to the University of California to work on a research study about the formation and development of main sequence stars. In 1968, she came to Turkey and organised the first National Astronomy Congress with the support of the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK). Between 1969 and 1973, Eryurt continued her scientific research work at NASA. In 1973, she returned to the Middle East Technical University Physics Department and founded the Astrophysics Branch. In 1977, she was awarded with the TÜBİTAK Science Award. In 1988, she was Chairperson of the Physics Department for six months, and then became the Dean of the Faculty of Science and Literature for five years. She retired in 1993. ==Death== Eryurt died in Ankara from a heart attack on 13 September 2012 at the age of 85. ==Posthumous recognition== Eryurt was honoured with a Google Doodle on 20 July 2020 in commemoration of the 51st anniversary of the first manned landing on the moon by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin as part of the Apollo 11 mission. ==References * Dilhan Eryurt (1926–2012) at Rubinero (Portuguese) Category:1926 births Category:2012 deaths Category:People from İzmir Category:Burials at Cebeci Asri Cemetery Category:Recipients of TÜBİTAK Science Award Category:Turkish astronomers Category:University of Michigan alumni Category:Istanbul University alumni Category:Ankara University alumni Category:Indiana University faculty Category:Middle East Technical University faculty Category:20th-century women scientists Category:Turkish women physicists Category:20th-century physicists Category:Women astrophysicists Category:20th-century astronomers ","title":"Dilhan Eryurt"},{"id":"56921431","text":"Alisson Pelegrini Safira (born 17 March 1995), simply known as Alisson Safira on only Safira, is a Brazilian footballer who plays for CRB, on loan from Londrina, as a forward. ==Career statistics== {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"State League !colspan=\\"2\\"Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Continental !colspan=\\"2\\"Other !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - valign=\\"center\\"Foz do Iguaçu 2016 Paranaense colspan=\\"2\\"—105colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—105 - rowspan=\\"3\\" valign=\\"center\\"Londrina 2016 rowspan=\\"2\\"Série B 192colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—192 - 2017 2427111colspan=\\"2\\"—6Appearance(s) in Primeira Liga2386 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Subtotal !43!!4!!7!!1!!1!!1!!colspan=\\"2\\"—!!6!!2!!57!!8 - valign=\\"center\\"Novorizontino 2018 Série D colspan=\\"2\\"—124colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—124 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Career total !43!!4!!29!!10!!1!!1!!0!!0!!6!!2!!79!!17 } ==References * Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Campeonato Brasileiro Série B players Category:Foz do Iguaçu Futebol Clube players Category:Londrina Esporte Clube players Category:Grêmio Esportivo Novorizontino players ","title":"Safira (footballer)"},{"id":"56921433","text":"Çökertme kebabı (pronounced 'Ch'kertme kebab') is a type of kebab eaten in Anatolia, and associated particularly with the Bodrum area of South West Turkey.

Formally organized on New Years Day 1883, SAHS is the oldest continuously operating museum and historical society in Florida. In 1899, the society purchased the Vedder Museum on Bay Street where it exhibited historical and scientific curiosities until losing its holdings in the Saint Augustine Fire of 1914. In 1920, SAHS successfully lobbied for federal restoration of Fort Matanzas, and in 1965, it played a significant role in the restoration of numerous historic sites in preparation for the St. Augustine quadricentennial. The Society has been a primary force in the preservation and care of four historic Spanish colonial homes, including the González-Alvarez House (The Oldest House), the Tovar House, and the Fernandez-Llambias House—all on Saint Francis Street—as well as the Segui-Kirby Smith House on the corner of Aviles Street and Artillery Lane. SAHS publishes El Escribano: The St. Augustine Journal of History, as well as the Society’s newsletter the East Florida Gazette. == The Oldest House Museum == The González-Alvarez House is the oldest surviving Spanish colonial dwelling in St. Augustine, with evidence dating the site's occupancy from the 1600s, and the present house to the early 1700s. The house is located at 14 Saint Francis Street and exhibits both Spanish and British colonial architectural details and styles. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1970. The Oldest House Museum Complex includes the Tovar House, the Webb Museum, the Page L Edwards Gallery, an ornamental garden, and a museum store. First exhibited as a house museum in 1892, the building was acquired in 1918 by the Saint Augustine Historical Society. == Research Library == The SAHS Research Library at the Segui-Kirby Smith House specializes in the history of St. Augustine, colonial East Florida, and Saint Johns County. The collection includes maps, photographs, vertical subject files, church records, circuit court cases, city government records, manuscript collections, circuit court records, and biographical files. It is a closed-stack library with a small reference collection in the main reading room, and is free to the public. The two hundred and thirty year- old building was built as a private residence and was the birthplace of Confederate General Edmund Kirby Smith (1824). It was given in trust to the St. Augustine Library Association in 1895, and was a free public library until Saint Johns County erected a new facility in 1984. == El Escribano == Since January 1955, El Escribano (\\"The Scribe\\") has been the annual publication of SAHS sent to members and libraries. The name is derived from the city's Spanish colonial history: :\\"In Spanish Saint Augustine, the Escribano, which freely translated means scribe or notary, was an important figure. One of the few in the frontier community who could write, he recorded events and testimony, and vouched for its accuracy. To him we owe much of what we know of early Saint Augustine, and it seems fitting, therefore, to name the newsletter of the Saint Augustine Historical Society in his honor.\\" == References  * Category:Historical societies in Florida Category:St. Augustine, Florida ","title":"St. Augustine Historical Society"},{"id":"56921456","text":"John Alden Shoudy was an American businessman and politician, known as an early settler and founder of Ellensburg, Washington. == Early life == Shoudy was born in Illinois in 1841, the son of Israel and Rebecca Shoudy, both originally from the Albany, New York area.

Collaboration would remain a defining (and controversial) aspect of his working methods throughout his career; this was particularly true in the 1960s. One of the most important collaborators during this period was Gerard Malanga. Malanga assisted the artist with the production of silkscreens, films, sculpture, and other works at \\"The Factory\\", Warhol's aluminum foil-and-silver-paint-lined studio on 47th Street (later moved to Broadway). Other members of Warhol's Factory crowd included Freddie Herko, Ondine, Ronald Tavel, Mary Woronov, Billy Name, and Brigid Berlin (from whom he apparently got the idea to tape-record his phone conversations).Colacello, Bob (1990), p. 67. During the 1960s, Andy Warhol groomed a retinue of bohemian and counterculture eccentrics upon whom he bestowed the designation \\"Superstars\\", including Nico, Joe Dallesandro, Edie Sedgwick, Viva, Ultra Violet, Holly Woodlawn, Jackie Curtis, and Candy Darling. These people all participated in the Factory films, and some—like Berlin—remained friends with Warhol until his death. Important figures in the New York underground art/cinema world, such as poet John Giorno and film-maker Jack Smith, also appear in Warhol films (many premiering at the New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre or the 55th Street Playhouse) of the 1960s, revealing Warhol's connections to a diverse range of artistic scenes during this time. Less well known was his support and collaboration with several teen-agers during this era, who would achieve prominence later in life including writer David Dalton, photographer Stephen Shore and artist Bibbe Hansen (mother of pop musician Beck). ==Cafe Au Go Go== The Cafe Au Go Go was a Greenwich Village night club located in the basement of the New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre at 152 Bleecker Street. The club featured many well known musical groups, folksingers and comedy acts between the opening in February 1964 until closing in October 1969. The club was originally owned by Howard Solomon who sold it in June 1969 to Moses Baruch. Baruch closed the club in October 1969. Howard Solomon became the manager of singer Fred Neil.Rockprosopography Retrieved March 24, 2018 The club was the first New York City venue for the Grateful Dead.Grateful Dead at Cafe Au Go Go Retrieved March 24, 2018 Richie Havens and the Blues Project were weekly regulars as well as Harvey Brooks who was bass player in residence, The Stone Poneys featuring Linda Ronstadt played frequently.

They are short herbaceous perennials, growing from a tuber, with small flowers in shades of pink to purple. Many varieties and cultivars are grown in Japan as ornamental plants. The Japanese name for the species is transcribed as uchou-ran or utyouran. ==Description== Ponerorchis graminifolia is a short herbaceous perennial growing from an ovoid tuber. It reaches a height of 10–15 cm (less often 25 cm). It has two to four linear leaves, 7–15 cm long. The inflorescence is a raceme containing 2–15 flowers. Each flower is about 15 mm across, pink to purplish overall. The upper sepal and the lateral petals form a \\"helmet\\". The lip or labellum is about 13 mm long, deeply divided into three broad lobes. A spur is present, 10–15 mm long, shorter than the ovary. Several varieties have been described, some of which vary in flower colour. P. graminifolia var. kurokamiana has reddish purple flowers; P. graminifolia var. nigropunctata has paler flowers with darker spots or spotted lines. Ponerorchis graminifolia (flower s5).jpg Ponerorchis graminifolia (34477576983).jpg File:Ponerorchis graminifolia 1 cropped.jpg ==Taxonomy== Ponerorchis graminifolia was first described in 1852, by Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach; it is the type species of the genus Ponerorchis. The genus name is derived from the Greek πονηρός, meaning \\"wretched\\", \\"worthless\\", \\"useless\\". The specific epithet graminifolia means \\"grass-leaved\\". , four varieties have been recognized: *Ponerorchis graminifolia var. graminifolia – Japan and Korea *Ponerorchis graminifolia var. kurokamiana (Hatus. & Ohwi) T.Hashim. – Japan; only up to 10 cm tall; reddish purple flowers *Ponerorchis graminifolia var. nigropunctata F.Maek. ex K.Inoue (as var. micropunctata in some sources) – Japan; up to 25 cm tall; flowers paler with darker spots *Ponerorchis graminifolia var. suzukiana (Ohwi) Soó – Japan; more and larger leaves (4–6); pale reddish purple flowers ==Distribution and habitat== Ponerorchis graminifolia is native to south Korea and south-central and south Japan (Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu). It grows in mountainous areas, particularly among damp rocks. ==Cultivation== Ponerorchis graminifolia is cultivated as an ornamental plant, particularly in Japan, where many cultivars of uchou-ran have been described with widely differing flower colours and markings, from pure white to darkish purple, with or without spots and markings. In Britain, they can be grown in pots in a gritty compost. Without forcing, they then come into growth in early spring, flower in late spring and early summer, dying down before the autumn, after which they are kept dry and frost-free over winter. Propagation is via tuber division or seed. Hybrids with Ponerorchis chidorii and Ponerorchis gracilis (Amitostigma gracile) have been reported to be in cultivation. ==References== graminifolia Category:Flora of Japan Category:Flora of Korea ","title":"Ponerorchis graminifolia"},{"id":"56921899","text":"Avzalova Alfiya Avzalovna (; 15 January 1933 — 15 June 2017) was a Soviet and Russian Tatar singer.

Throughout history and in many cultures, children have been involved in military campaigns. For example, thousands of children participated on all sides of the First World War and the Second World War.Norman Davies, Rising '44: The Battle for Warsaw, Pan Books 2004 p.603 Children may be trained and used for combat, assigned to support roles such as porters or messengers, or used for tactical advantage as human shields or for political advantage in propaganda. Children are easy targets for military recruitment due to their greater susceptibility to influence compared to adults. Some children are recruited by force while others choose to join up, often to escape poverty or because they expect military life to offer a rite of passage to maturity. ==Pre-20th century== its cadets who died in the Battle of Chapultepec (1847). Throughout history and in many cultures, children have been extensively involved in military campaigns. The earliest mentions of minors being involved in wars come from antiquity. It was customary for youths in the Mediterranean basin to serve as aides, charioteers and armor bearers to adult warriors. Examples of this practice can be found in the Bible, such as David's service to King Saul, in Hittite and ancient Egyptian art, and in ancient Greek mythology (such as the story of Hercules and Hylas), philosophy and literature. In a practice dating back to antiquity, children were routinely taken on a campaign, together with the rest of a military man's family, as part of the baggage. The Roman Empire made use of youths in war, though it was understood that it was unwise and cruel to use children in war, and Plutarch implies that regulations required youths to be at least sixteen years of age. Despite this, several Roman legionaries were known to have enlisted aged 14 in the Imperial Roman army, such as Quintus Postunius Solus who completed 21 years of service in Legio XX Valeria Victrix, and Caecilius Donatus who served 26 years in the Legio XX and died shortly before his honorable discharge. In medieval Europe young boys from about twelve years of age were used as military aides (\\"squires\\"), though in theory, their role in actual combat was limited. The so-called Children's Crusade in 1212 recruited thousands of children as untrained soldiers under the assumption that divine power would enable them to conquer the enemy, although none of the children entered combat. According to the legend, they were instead sold into slavery. While most scholars no longer believe that the Children's Crusade consisted solely, or even mostly, of children, it nonetheless exemplifies an era in which entire families took part in a war effort.

When Napoleon was faced with invasion by a massive Allied force in 1814 he conscripted many teenagers for his armies. Orphans of the Imperial Guard fought in the Netherlands with Marshal MacDonald and were between the ages of 14 and 17.Michael Leggiere, The Fall of Napoleon: The Allied Invasion of France 1813–1814, pg.99–100 Many of the conscripts who reported to the ranks in 1814 were referred to as Marie Louises after the Empress Marie Louise of France; they were also known as \\"The Infants of the Emperor\\". These soldiers were in their mid-teens.Stephen Pope, Dictionary of the Napoleonic Wars, p. 318 One of their more visible roles was as the ubiquitous \\"drummer boy\\". During the age of sail, young boys formed part of the crew of British Royal Navy ships and were responsible for many essential tasks including bringing powder and shot from the ship's magazine to the gun crews. These children were called \\"powder monkeys.\\" Drummer boy John Clem during the American Civil War. During the American Civil War a young boy, Bugler John Cook, served in the US Army at the age of 15 and received the Medal of Honor for his acts during the Battle of Antietam, the bloodiest day in American history.Slinger, P. W. Children at War. New York: Pantheon Books, 2005. Several other minors, including 11-year-old Willie Johnston, have also received the Medal of Honor. By a law signed by Nicholas I of Russia in 1827 a disproportionate number of Jewish boys, known as the cantonists, were forced into military training establishments to serve in the army. The 25-year conscription term officially commenced at the age of 18, but boys as young as eight were routinely taken to fulfill the quota. In the final stages of the Paraguayan War, children fought in the Battle of Acosta Ñu against the Allied forces of Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay. The day is commemorated as a national holiday in Paraguay. During the Boshin War, the pro-shōgun Aizu Domain formed the , which was made up of the 16 to 17-year-old sons of Aizu samurai. During the Battle of Bonari Pass and the Battle of Aizu, they fought the Satcho forces who supported the Imperial cause. A detached unit of Byakkotai was cut off from the rest of the unit and retreated to Iimori Hill, which overlooked Aizu-Wakamatsu Castle. From there, they saw what they thought was the castle on fire. 20 of the detached unit committed seppuku while one was unsuccessful. He was saved by a local peasant. ==World War I== Momčilo Gavrić and another soldier reporting to major Stevan Tucović, 1916. The youngest known soldier of World War I was Momčilo Gavrić, who joined the 6th Artillery Division of the Serbian Army at the age of 8, after Austro-Hungarian troops in August 1914 killed his parents, grandmother, and seven of his siblings.Momčilo Gavrić – najmlađi vojnik Prvog svetskog rata (\\"Večernje novosti\\", 31 August 2013) In the West, boys as young as 12 were caught up in the overwhelming tide of patriotism and in huge numbers enlisted for active service. Others enlisted to avoid harsh and dreary lives. Typically many were able to pass themselves off as older men, such as George Thomas Paget, who at 17 joined a Bantam battalion in the Welsh Regiment. The last surviving combat veteran of the War was Claude Choules, who enlisted in the Royal Navy at age 14 and saw his first action at the Battle of Jutland at 15. In the Gallipoli campaign, otherwise known as \\"Çanakkale\\", children as young as 15 fought in the trenches. 120 children fought in the \\"15'liler\\" or \\"The 15s\\" company, with no known survivors. ==Spanish Civil War== Many child soldiers fought in the Spanish Civil War: ==World War II== Child soldiers during the Warsaw Uprising In World War II children under the age of 18 were widely used by all sides in formal and informal military roles. Children were readily indoctrinated into the prevailing ideology of the warring parties, quickly trained, and often sent to the front line; many were wounded or killed. The lack of a legal definition of a child, combined with the absence of a system for verifying the ages of prospective child recruits, contributed to the extensive use of children in the war. ==After World War II: Historical examples by region== These are historical examples. For instances of children in the military today, see Children in the military. === Africa ===  Algeria  During the Algerian civil war (1991–2002) children were recruited frequently by Islamist armed groups fighting the government. A government- allied militia—the Legitimate Defence Groups (LDG)—also used children, according to some reports. Although the rules for joining the LDG were the same as the army, in which only adults were recruited (by conscription) the LDG applied no safeguards to ensure that children could not join up. The extent of child recruitment during the war remains unknown.  Burundi  Children were kidnapped and used extensively during the civil war of 1993–2005. In 2004 hundreds of child soldiers were in the Forces Nationales pour la Libération (FNL), an armed rebel, Hutu group.Child soldiers global report 2004: Africa Regional overview, Child Soldiers International . Children between the ages of 10 and 16 were also conscripted by the Burundese military.Child soldiers global report 2004: Africa Regional overview, Child Soldiers International . After the Arusha peace accord of 2001 and the Pretoria agreement of 2003 eventually brought the conflict to an end in 2005, the new constitution committed to not using children in direct combat. The parties to the conflict no longer recruited children in large numbers, but many remained active in the FNL, which had denounced the peace accord. By 2006, a reintegration program organized by UNICEF had led to the release of 3,000 children from the military and armed groups. According to Child Soldiers International: > The majority of those [children] who took part in the program returned to > farm and fish in their local communities, but nearly 600 returned to school. > Some 1,800 former child soldiers received occupational training. Health care > was provided for those with special needs and psychosocial support was > provided through individual and group meetings. , Burundi no longer appears on the UN list of countries where children are used in hostilities.  Chad  Between 2007 and 2012, children were used extensively by the Chadian military as participants in armed conflict. They were also integrated into various rebel forces, including the United Front for Democratic Change (Front Uni pour le Changement, FUC), local self-defense forces known as Tora Boro militias, and two Sudanese rebel movements operating in Chad: the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) and the G-19 faction of the Sudanese Liberation Army (SLA). After the government signed an action plan with the United Nations, children were released from service and were no longer recruited. By 2014, Chad had been removed from the UN list of countries that use child soldiers in war.  Côte d'Ivoire  During Côte d'Ivoire's civil war of 2002–2004, \\"children were recruited, often forcibly, by both sides\\", and were also abducted by armed groups fighting the civil war in Liberia between 1999 and 2003. The Patriotic Youth – armed groups that included children in large numbers – received the active support of the government. Thousands of children saw membership of an armed group on either side of the war as a way to earn a living, although they were often unpaid, having to acquire money through extortion or begging. They were provided with automatic weapons, and girls were frequently abducted as sex slaves. Attempts to reach a peace agreement repeatedly failed, and although after 2006 children were gradually released from military groups, approximately 2,000 children remained. After President Laurent Gbagbo refused to recognise the 2010 election result, fighting flared up again and child recruitment increased. Under the new government, however, the UN brokered an Action Plan that included the release of all children and, in 2015, the UN reported that children were no longer recruited in the country.  Eritrea  During its 30-year war for independence with Ethiopia (1961–1991) the Eritrean People's Liberation Front was \\"widely acknowledged\\" to have used children extensively as soldiers, according to the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers (now Child Soldiers International). Once independence had been won, the Eritrean armed forces recruited and used children again during the two-year border war with Ethiopia in 1998. There were many reports of child recruitment and use (including conscription from age 15), but there is little information today about the extent of the practice, which is due in part to the absence of effective birth registration and age-verification system at the time. The UN reported in 2002 that children were no longer being used systematically by the Eritrean armed forces, and the government acceded to the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict in 2005. Child recruitment continued, however; Human Rights Concern Eritrea reported in 2013 that all schoolchildren in 11th grade (approx. age 16) were made to spend the year at a military training camp, after which they were routinely recruited into the armed forces.  Ethiopia  According to the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers in 2001 there were \\"credible reports\\" that the Ethiopian armed forces used thousands of children in its two-year border war with Eritrea between 1998 and 2000: > Testimonies of former child soldiers, NGOs and journalists provide evidence > of child deployment on the front lines and in massive waves across mine > fields... Recruitment reportedly focused on Oromos and Somalis... and on > grades 9 to 12 of secondary schools. Children were also forcibly recruited in groups from public places. The lack of a functioning birth registration system has made it difficult to estimate the number of children affected, but it is clear that the use of children was widespread; for example, most Ethiopian prisoners of war in one large prisoner of war camp in Eritrea were estimated to be aged 14–18. The main opposition group in the 1990s, the Oromo Liberation Front, also systematically recruited children, including by force. In 2008 it was reported that children were no longer used for military purposes in Ethiopia, and in 2014 the government ratified the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict.  Liberia  Unidentified rebel fighters during the Second Liberian Civil War, 1999–2003. In Liberia's civil wars (1989–1995, 1999–2003) all factions abducted children for direct combat, forced labour, and sexual slavery. It was the common practice of commanders to give children drugs and threaten them with execution in order to enhance their obedience; for example, soldiers were frequently given valium before a battle, known as \\"bubbles\\" or \\"10-10\\". Children were often persuaded or forced to commit grave human rights violations against civilians, including rape, torture, and the abduction of other children for military use. Children as young as 10 were used in direct combat. United Nations disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration programs repeatedly failed when children quitted them, often to return to their former military unit, and after fighters rioted in protest at the absence of a financial reward for being disarmed. A chronic lack of resources for reintegration also prompted child soldiers to enrol in other armed groups as a means of gainful employment. By 2004 more than 20,000 children needed to be demobilised and reunited with their communities. However, by October 2004 10,000 children had been released from their military units and were part of reintegration programs. By 2006 children were no longer being used by any military groups in the country, although armed groups from Côte d'Ivoire and Guinea continued to abduct Liberian children. , children were no longer being used for military purposes in Liberia, and its armed forces were recruiting only adults over the age of 18. The use of child soldiers in Liberia was epitomised by The Small Boys Unit, established by Liberian President Charles Taylor. The boys were not provided with sustenance, but were expected to engage in \\"snake patrol\\", looting surrounding villages. Taylor and others were later tried before the Special Court for Sierra Leone because of his involvement in recruiting child soldiers.  Rwanda  Displaced children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo at risk of recruitment by Rwandese armed groups and local armed bandits. An estimated 20,000 children took part in hostilities during the 1990s, including the 1994 Rwanda genocide when many children were involved in committing atrocities. 5,000 children were in the national army, while others, including many street children, joined or were made to join armed groups. After the genocide, 4,500 children were detained on suspicion of participating in atrocities, and were incarcerated for several years without charge or trial; some were sent to the Gitagata Re-Education Centre for males below 14 years of age. In the late 1990s, children were widely recruited again, often by force, to fight in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Initial demobilisation and reintegration programmes failed after many schools banned former child soldiers and a high rate of unemployment rendered them vulnerable to re-recruitment by militia groups. In 2003, as the Rwandan military presence in the DRC reduced, so did the demand for child soldiers. The government introduced new legislation to raise the minimum enlistment age 18 and the armed forces stopped recruiting children. Nonetheless, armed groups continued to do so, albeit to a reduced extent, for their operations in the DRC. Sierra Leone During the Sierra Leone Civil War (1991–2002) thousands of children were recruited by government armed forces and non-government armed groups, particularly the anti-government Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC), and the pro-government Civil Defence Forces (CDF). Children were often forcibly recruited, given drugs and used to commit atrocities. Thousands of girls were also recruited as soldiers and often subjected to sexual exploitation. Many of the children were survivors of attacks on villages, which were routinely ordered to hand over their children to armed groups. By 2001, an estimated 10,000 children were being used for military purposes by government armed forces and various armed groups, particularly the RUF. After 2002, when the war was declared over, an extensive United Nations disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration programme reunited most former child soldiers with their communities, although it drew criticism for neglecting the needs of women and girls. In June 2007 the Special Court for Sierra Leone found three men from the rebel Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) guilty of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and other serious violations of international humanitarian law, including the recruitment of children under the age of 15 years into the armed forces. With this the Special Court became the first ever UN-backed tribunal to secure a conviction for the military conscription of children. , press release from the Special Court for Sierra Leone, 20 June 2007; \\"Sierra Leone Convicts 3 of War Crimes\\" , Associated Press, 20 June 2007 (hosted by The Washington Post); , children were no longer being used for military purposes in Sierra Leone, and its armed forces were recruiting only adults over the age of 18. In his book A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Child Soldier, Ishmael Beah chronicles his life during the conflict in Sierra Leone. In Armies of the Young: Child Soldiers in War and Terrorism anthropologist David M. Rosen discusses the murders, rapes, tortures, and thousands of amputations committed by the RUF Small Boys Unit. The film Blood Diamond is set during the civil war. The issue is also explored in the Bones episode, The Survivor In The Soap. Uganda David Livingstone speaks about his experiences as a child soldier with the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda. Over a period of twenty years the rebel Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) has abducted more than 30,000 boys and girls as soldiers or sex slaves. Joseph Kony began the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in 1987, originally to protect northern Ugandans from the 1986 military coup by the People's National Resistance Army. Stating that he \\"received messages from God\\" Kony began attacking his own people, the Acholi, to establish a new theocratic government in Uganda based on the principles of the \\"Ten Commandments of God\\". This attempt by the LRA to gain control of the Ugandan government via roaming armies used boy- as well as girl-children as soldiers, such as Grace Akallo. The LRA expansion into South Sudan, the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo has used large numbers of children as active combatants and participants in extreme violence. On the 21October 2008 an appeal by the UN Security Council was made asking for the LRA to cease all military action in the DRC immediately. On 14June 2002 Uganda deposited its instrument of ratification of the Rome Statute, and on 16December 2003 the Government of Uganda referred the situation concerning northern Uganda to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC). The ICC investigated the situation and on 14October 2005 issued indictments against Lord's Resistance Army leader Joseph Kony and four other commanders for war crimes: Vincent Otti; Raska Lukwiya (indictment terminated, deceased); Okot Odhiambo; and Dominic Ongwen. The warrant for Kony, Otti and Odhiambo includes the alleged crime of the forced enlisting of children contrary to the Rome Statute Art. 8(2) (e)(vii).Yasmin Anwar Damning report on Uganda war crimes , UC Berkeley NewsCenter The National Resistance Army also made use of child soldiers. Between 2003 and 2007, non-state armed groups fighting the LRA also used children. In 2007 the Ugandan government agreed an action plan with the UN to end the use of child soldiers and in 2008 the country no longer appeared on the UN list of countries that recruit and use children. === Americas ===  El Salvador  Rebel Salvadoran soldier boy combatant in Perquin, El Salvador 1990, during the Salvadoran Civil War. During the civil war between 1980 and 1992 the Salvadoran military and the main opposition group, the Frente Farabundo Martí de Liberación National (FMLN), recruited children extensively. The recruitment was frequently carried out by force and focused on economically suppressed regions. A fifth of the army's personnel were aged under 18, as were a quarter of the FMLN. In a group of 278 former FMLN child soldiers interviewed for a study, the average age of recruitment was 10 years. The large majority of child recruits on both sides were living in poverty, and had been largely deprived of formal education. Many children who were not recruited by force joined of their own volition, mainly either to improve their circumstances or because they believed in the cause. After the civil war came to a close, rehabilitation and reintegration programmes for children mostly failed; the majority of FMLN children were not involved in them, and the large majority of those who were dropped out of them. A decade after the peace accord former child soldiers were still experiencing nightmares, depression, anxiety, and related signs of psychiatric trauma. Today, the Salvadoran military no longer sends children to war, but it still recruits and trains them from the age of 16. === Middle East === Iran Iran-Iraq War, in Ardabil, Iranian Azerbaijan. During the Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988) the armed forces used children widely; the extent of the practice is not known but the number of children involved is thought to be in the tens of thousands. Armed groups associated with the government advertised widely for children from age 14 to join them, and the country's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, urged children to fight at the front. According to the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers (now Child Soldiers International): > Ayatollah Khomeini declared that parental permission was unnecessary for > those going to the front, that volunteering for military duty was a > religious obligation, and that serving in the armed forces took priority > over all other forms of work or study. Various sources reported that > children were indoctrinated into participating in combat. They were given > \\"keys to paradise\\" and promised that they would go directly to heaven if > they died as martyrs against the Iraqi enemy. The children involved were overwhelmingly from slums and poor villages, and some participated without the knowledge of their parents, including Mohammad Hossein Fahmideh. Thousands of children took part in human wave attacks, leading to widespread deaths and injuries. The total number of all Iranian casualties is estimated to be 200,000–600,000,Hammond Atlas of the 20th Century (1999) P. 134-5Dunnigan, A Quick and Dirty Guide to War (1991)Dictionary of Twentieth Century World History, by Jan Palmowski (Oxford, 1997)Clodfelter, Michael, Warfare and Armed Conflict: A Statistical Reference to Casualty and Other Figures, 1618–1991Chirot, Daniel: Modern Tyrants: The Power and Prevalence of Evil in Our Age (1994)\\"B&J;\\": Jacob Bercovitch and Richard Jackson, International Conflict: A Chronological Encyclopedia of Conflicts and Their Management 1945–1995 (1997) p. 195 of which approximately a third were aged 15–19 (and 3 percent under 14), according to one assessment. After the war, the Basij, an official militia organisation, continued to recruit children from age 15, focusing on those living in poverty and sometimes recruiting them by force. In 2004, the Basij was estimated to have as many as a million members of all ages. Ansar-e Hizbollah, an armed group tolerated by the government, also recruited children widely in the 2000s, with no age restriction. , the Iranian armed forces continue to enlist from age 16 and the government has not yet ratified the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict.  Iraq  The government of Saddam Hussein maintained 'boot camps' of civilian youths between the ages of 12 and 17 that involved small arms training and Ba'athist political indoctrination. Iraqi opposition sources and the US State Department reported that children who refused faced punishment. The state incorporated children as young as ten into the Futuwah and Ashbal Saddam youth movements and then subjected them to military training, sometimes for 14 hours a day. P. W. Singer has compared the groups to the Hitler Jugend. In the Gulf War 12-year- old boys fought for the Iraqis. Children also participated in the Iran–Iraq War. In the 2003 invasion of Iraq, US forces fought children at Nasariya, Karbala, and Kirkuk, and the US sent captured child combatants to Abu Ghraib prison. In 2009 a UN report on the post-war Iraqi occupation stated that the Iraqi insurgency had used children as combatants; it noted, for example, a suicide attack against Kirkuk's police commander by a boy aged between 10 and 13. === Asia ===  Cambodia  Child dressed as Khmer Rouge soldier. In the 1970s the Khmer Rouge exploited thousands of desensitised, conscripted children in their early teens to commit mass murder and other atrocities during the Cambodian civil war and subsequent genocide. The indoctrinated children were taught to follow any order without hesitation. After it was deposed in 1979, the Khmer Rouge fought a guerrilla war against the new government, and until at least 1998 relied heavily on child recruits, including forced recruitment by abduction. During this period, the children were deployed mainly in unpaid support roles, such as ammunition-carriers, and also as combatants. Cambodia's state armed forces also recruited children widely. Throughout the 1990s the army was recruiting children from the age of 10 and using them in armed conflict, mainly as porters and spies, and also as combatants. Four percent of the army were children, according to an estimate in the Cambodia Daily. Many children had fled the Khmer Rouge without a means to feed themselves and hoped that joining the government forces would enable them to survive, although local commanders frequently denied them any pay. Children often capitalised on the lack of an effective birth registration system to lie about their age in order to enlist. Other children, some as young as 8, were forced to join. By 2000, the Cambodian government had signed the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict and its armed forces resolved to recruit adults only. Meanwhile, the Khmer Rouge had collapsed with the death of its leader, Pol Pot, in 1998. By 2004, children were no longer being recruited in the country, although the demobilisation programmes were inadequate, according to UNICEF, failing to offer appropriate rehabilitative support to released children.  Sri Lanka  Former child soldiers at a centre for rehabilitation and reintegration into their communities, Sri Lanka. Between 1983 and 2009 Sri Lanka's government fought a civil war with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (Tamil Tigers). For its entire duration the Tamil Tigers and other armed groups made routine use of child recruits, typically aged 14–17 and sometimes under 10.Bureau Report LTTE rebels make child recruitment illegal: Report , Zee News 27 October 2006 Some children enlisted to escape deprivation or racism, or during compulsory military training at their school when they were exposed to recruitment propaganda. Others were recruited by force when walking home from school or after the Tigers pressurised families to surrender one child, as per its policy. In 2001, international sources estimated that 40 percent of Tamil Tiger personnel were children, contrary to official statements insisting that the organisation did not use them. Sri Lankan soldiers nicknamed one unit the \\"Baby Battalion\\", due to the number of children in it. Although state armed forces recruited only adults over the age of 18, they supported the Karuna group, a Tamil splinter organisation opposed to the Tamil Tigers, to recruit children by force. The government also used detained Tamil Tiger children for propaganda by exposing them to the media. The first international initiative to demobilise and reintegrate children into their communities began in 2003, but was halted in 2004 because the Tigers failed to keep their commitment to release children from their ranks. The organisation began to release children in 2004, but continued to enlist several thousand, albeit in progressively smaller numbers, until at least 2007. The Tamil Tigers were defeated in 2009 and all other parties to the conflict stopped recruiting children in the same year. === Europe ===  Chechnya/Russia  During the First Chechen War, Chechen separatist forces included a large number of boys and girls, some as young as 11. According to the UN: \\"Child soldiers in Chechnya were reportedly assigned the same tasks as adult combatants, and served on the front lines soon after joining the armed forces.\\" In 2004 under-18s were still believed to be involved in a range of armed groups in the war against Russia; some allegedly took part in suicide bombings. Child Soldiers International p. 217 United Kingdom In the 20th century, the Royal Navy commonly recruited boy seamen aged from 15 up for active service; boys aged 13 or 14 were recruited for other duties. Children aged 17 were sent to the Falklands War in 1982 (where three were killed) and the Gulf War in 1990–91 (where two were killed). 17-year-olds were also deployed as NATO peacekeepers in the former Yugoslavia during the 1990s. Having initially resisted international negotiations to prevent the deployment of children, the UK agreed to deploy adults only when it signed the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict in 2000, but remained committed to recruiting and training children from age 16. Between 2003 and 2010, 22 personnel aged 17 were sent to Afghanistan and Iraq, reportedly in error. During the Troubles in Northern Ireland (c. 1960s to 1998) it was common for paramilitary groups to recruit and use children, including as combatants. Five children in Republican paramilitary groups, seven in Loyalist paramilitary groups, and five in the British armed forces, died during the conflict. The youngest, Cathleen McCartland, was recruited by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and was aged 12 when she was killed in Belfast. == See also  General === * Child * Children in emergencies and conflicts * Children's rights * Child slavery === Well-known cases of children used for military purposes === * Military use of children in World War II * Grace Akallo, Ugandan * Ishmael Beah, Sierra Leonean * Calvin Graham, American * Mohammad Hossein Fahmideh, Iranian * Omar Khadr, Canadian * Luftwaffenhelfer, German * Lwów Eaglets, Polish * Dominic Ongwen, Ugandan * Returned: Child Soldiers of Nepal's Maoist Army === Documentary film === * Kony 2012, documentary film * \\"La vita non perde valore\\" (\\"Life does not lose its value\\"), documentary film * \\"My Star in the Sky\\" a documentary on the true story of survival, friendship and love between two child soldiers abducted by the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) during the conflict between Uganda and Sudan. === Popular culture === * Blood Diamond, movie * Johnny Mad Dog, movie ==References External links  Reference: Child soldiers worldwide === * Child Soldiers World Index (2018), child soldier world map and statistics * Child Soldiers International, historical reports: ** Child Soldiers Global Report: 2001 ** Child Soldiers Global Report: 2004 ** Child Soldiers Global Report: 2008 ** Louder than words: 2012 Category:Age and society Category:Child labour Category:Human rights abuses Category:Military sociology Category:History of childhood ","title":"History of children in the military"},{"id":"56921938","text":"Sirhi Angami is a village in Kohima district of Nagaland state of India. ==References== Category:Villages in Kohima district ","title":"Sirhi Angami"},{"id":"56921959","text":"Robert Swain Robert Swain (born December 7, 1940) is an American artist working in the field of Color Sensation. == Early life and education == Robert Swain was born on December 7, 1940 in Austin, Texas and grew up in Arlington, Virginia.

White was born Mary Agnes Hoskins, in St. Alban’s, Bay d'Espoir, on the southeast coast of what was then the Dominion of Newfoundland. She was introduced to music by her father, Samuel Hoskins, who played mouth organ, fiddle and accordion. White could play the accordion by the time she was 8 years old, and at 16, when her family moved to the Codroy Valley, she played piano to accompany fiddlers at community dances. In 1937, she married Richard White and they settled in the community of Tompkins. After starting a family, White gave up regular performing for many years. She played piano and organ, but it wasn’t until the 1960s that she returned to the accordion. In addition to playing the tunes she’d learned as a child, she began to compose her own songs, and for 13 years played a regular Sunday afternoon gig at the Starlite Lounge in Tompkins. White composed and arranged music, hired backing bands, and performed on accordion and mandolin. In 1973 Minnie White recorded her first album, Newfoundland’s First Lady of the Accordion. She toured Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, and made television appearances on shows such as The Root Cellar and Canadian Express, becoming part of the Newfoundland traditional music revival of the 1960s and 1970s. She recorded four albums, including Newfoundland Accordion & Mandolin Favourites (1974), Homestead Reels (1978) and The Hills of Home (1994). White was awarded the Order of Canada in 1993. In 1994 she was inducted into the Newfoundland and Labrador Arts Council Hall of Honour, and in 1995 nominated for Instrumental Artist of the Year at the East Coast Music Awards. During the summer of 1998 the community of Upper Ferry declared \\"Minnie White Day\\" in her honour.

Aurelie is the new girl in town, having recently relocated from Washington D.C. with her parents Jim (a former steward for Air Force One) and Jeanne. Jim is attending college on a scholarship to become a physician while Jeanne, now the breadwinner, works at the local chicken shack. Aurelie asks her parents if she can have a permanent to fit in with the \\"Farrah Fawcett\\" types in town. Her parents finally relent and take her to a local beauty school to get her hair processed at a discount. The result is disastrous, making Aurelie look more like orphan Annie than Farrah. She starts school and is immediately teased by everyone. She tries to befriend the only black girl in school, Lydia, but is rebuffed. Aurelie furthers her unpopularity by overly participating in class and is frequently bullied by a group of popular girls. Aurelie reluctantly takes a karate class in order to defend herself. She sees a sign on another beauty shop in town that advertises permanent fixes for $60 and resolves to make the money. Eventually the school holds a poetry reading contest, with a top prize of $75. Aurelie signs up herself and Lydia. Lydia initially does not want to participate. During the poetry contest she panics and recites the lyrics to \\"Feeling Good\\" instead of her assigned poem. Meanwhile, Aurelie is confronted by the popular girls. She uses her karate training to defeat the girls and returns to the contest to see that Lydia has been announced the winner. Lydia offers Aurelie the money to fix her hair, and Aurelie declines saying that she no longer cares. Jim, who wears a hairpiece, has been told by his college counselor that he must take a swimming class in order to receive his scholarship. He returns to the pool several times but cannot bring himself to put his head underwater or be seen without his hairpiece. Jeanne fills unfulfilled by her new life. Jim is unresponsive to her sexual advances, again stating he does not want to ruin his hairpiece or take it off. Jeanne instead becomes emotionally involved with their neighbor Jerry, who volunteers to teach her to be an artist and to help with family counseling. He reveals his true intentions when he comments on her breasts. During a family counseling session, Jim affirms his love and commitment to Jeanne. The film ends with Jim, Jeanne, and Aurelie at the school pool. Jim climbs the high dive, tosses his hairpiece off, and dives into the pool. ==Cast== *Patricia Arquette as Jeanne Dickson *Rainn Wilson as Jim Dickson *Kira McLean as Aurelie Dickson *Jacqueline Jones as Maylene (Beautician) *Michael Greene as Jerry (The Therapist) *Sean Ramey as Pete (Martial Arts instructor) *Nena Daniels as Lydia *Abby Wathen as Mrs. Tripp *Katherine S.

He had ascended to the throne at the age of eighteen and at a time when Odisha was torn apart due conflicts between external powers like the Mughals, Marathas, French and British for control of the territory. He made the last great attempts on his own to revive the lost glory of Odisha and its unique Hindu culture that revolved around the tradition of Jagannath worship. He had defied the authority of the Nizam of Hyderabad and maintained his own sovereignty. He was one of the first rulers who indulged in conflicts with the new European colonists in the eastern part of India. He was also effort bound till the end of his life in framing strategic diplomatic plans to free the ancient land of Odisha from external aggressors and revival of its lost Ganga-Gajapati glory from the past. == Political conditions of Paralakhemundi == alt= After the death of the last Suryavanshi emperor of Odisha Prataparudra Deva in 1540 A.D, most of the Gajapati Empire reduced to a small tiny strip of land in today’s coastal Odisha. The Golconda Qutb Shahi ruler – Quli Qutb Shah had engaged militarily with the last great Gajapati ruler and had managed to acquire southern parts of the Gajapati Empire. By the year 1630 A.D, the whole of Paralakhemundi fell into the hands of the Qutb Shahi rulers and then passed on to Nizam-Ul- Mulk’s control who himself was ruling in southern India as the Subedar or vassal of Mughals in the year 1713 A.D. In the year 1753 A.D, the Paralakhemundi estate passed on to the French along with three other adjoining estates in the Northern Circars when the Nizam gave it to the French under a treaty acknowledging their services rendered to him. The independent ruler of Paralakhemundi, Gajapati Jagannath Narayan Deo II defied the Treaty of Hyderabad and the French authority over his territory as his family had even denied the rule of the Nizam over their estate earlier and functioned as independent rulers. === Administration and the military === The rulers of Paralakhemundi had an efficient way of delivering administration and collecting taxes from their subjects. The area of the heartland estate was 639 square kilometers. The whole estate and the total territory under the control of the rulers were, divided in eleven divisions that were, ruled by the eleven representative Bisoyis of the king. The administrative territory included seven divisions of hilly and mountainous terrain while the rest four comprised the plain areas. The Bisoyis were also in the command of Paika militia units with the help of which they defended their divisions from any external threats. There were further seventeen subdivisions and were controlled by the small militia leaders called the Doras who were selected by the King personally. The Doras collected taxes from the Gumang chiefs of the Savara tribal communities residing in different villages. After Narayana Deo II ascended the throne in the year 1751 A.D, he had openly defied any control by the Nizam and joined hands with other local rulers and landlords of Ganjam and Srikakulam taluk opposing the control by Golconda rulers. As his predecessors, he defied paying revenue taxes to the Nizams. The Nizam in return was also militarily incapable of controlling the further rebellious northern divisions of the Northern Circars. == Military engagements == Jagannatha Narayana Deo II envisioned to pull the ancient land of Odisha and its great Hindu culture out of the greedy clutches of external powers. He sent secret messages to different local rulers for uniting against the enemies, freeing Odisha and reviving the ancient glory of Odisha as a military power in the subcontinent. However, he failed in his effort to persuade his fellow ruling kings to unite for this cause as most of them were either the vassals of Marathas or powerless to challenge the presence of great military powers contesting with each other for complete authority. Enraged by the ineffectiveness of the ruler of Khurda and head administrator of the Jagannath temple at Puri, Virakishore Deva he invaded his kingdom in 1760 A.D. === First battles of Jelmur with Sitaram Raju, the French regent === Prior to this invasion of Khurda the French, who were in control of Ganjam district had appointed the Telugu king of Vizianagaram Sitaram Raju as their regent of their Odia territories. As per the treaty of Hyderabad, Paralakhemundi was submitted to the French by the Nizam in 1753 A.D but Narayan Deo II had defied them like the Nizam. To gain control of the estate, Sitaram Raju continuously invaded Paralakhemundi on behalf of the French. According to the records, the forces of Paralakhemundi and Sitaram Raju had clashed at least twice near Jelmur situated thirty kilometers from Paralakhemundi town, resulting in the defeat of the forces of the French regent but also losing some parts of the estate in the meanwhile. === Invasion of Khurda and Battles of Chatragarh Fort === In the year 1760 A.D, Narayan Deva II invaded the coastal districts of Odisha to defeat the incompetent Bhoi dynasty vassal ruler of the Marathas Virakishore Deva, take control of the Jagannath temple and push the Marathas out of Barabati Fort. He first attacked the fort of Chatragarh in the district of Puri that was controlled by the Khurda forces and laid a seize to it. The king of Khurda was defeated and escaped to Cuttack that was controlled by the Marathas seeking their intervention. The Marathas agreed to support their vassal Bhoi king at the condition of more revenue from the Khurda territory that included Puri and Nayagarh districts of today. The combined army of the Marathas and the Khurda king attacked the Paralakhemundi forces at the fort of Chatragarh. Unable to hold a much larger and well supplied Maratha army, Narayana Deo II decided to retreat to his estate. The Khurda king, Virkishore Deva however was unable to pay the promised additional revenues for this support provided by the Marathas and had to surrender his authority over Limbai, Rehang and Puri to them. === Second Battle of Jelmur with Sitaram Raju === In the year 1761 A.D during the absence of Narayana Deo II from his estate for his expedition on Khurda, the king of Vizianagaram Sitaram Raju had invaded Paralakhemundi with his brother Vijayaram Raju. A battle ensued at the fort of Jelmur where Sitaram Raju again lost to the Paralakhemundi forces who had returned fresh from battle with Khurda. == Second Treaty of Hyderabad and beginning of Paralakhemundi affairs == In year 1759 A.D the French retreated from the Northern Circars as the British forces were threatening Madras. The French governor of Pondicherry, Monsieur Lally had summoned the French troops to fight against the British attack at Madras. Taking the advantage of the French retreat, the people of Paralakhemundi revolted against their regents like Sitaram Raju. After the French were pursued out of Hyderabad, on twelfth of November 1766 the Nizam of Hyderabad Nizam Ali Khan concluded another treaty with the British East India Company in which he surrendered the northern territories to them. The East India Company sent an officer by the name Mr. Cotsford to assess the situation of these territories the next year. On his tour to the regions of Visakhapatnam and Ganjam, Cotsford not only reported the excesses and atrocities carried out by the former French regent Sitaram Raju but also reported about Paralakhemundi as follows: The defiance and series of uprisings by Narayana Deo II is stated as the first phase of Paralakhemundi Affairs and was considered as important matter as the connection between Madras and Calcutta was threatened by the events taking place in Paralakhemundi. === Third Battle of Jelmur with the British === Based on the report presented by Mr. Cotsford, the British dispatched a force under the leadership of Colonel Peach to suppress the defiant king of Paralakhemundi. On the fourth of April 1768 A.D, the forces of Narayana Deo II and the British clashed at Jelmur. Unable to contain the superior British forces, Narayana Deo II lost the battle and hid himself in the Malliah hilly terrains of his estate. After the East India Company came victorious in the region they appointed Ramyogi Patra as the Diwan or the administrator of the estate to collect revenues. The Bisoyis, Doras, Savara tribals and other common people continued to stay loyal and only paid the taxes declaring Narayana Deo II as the legal ruler. The British captured Pratapgiri, Alladigam and Siddheswaram forts on seventeenth of April 1768 A.D. The British later sent Captain Bendinell in 1771 A.D with a contingent to subdue Bhim Deo, the local ruler of Bada Khemundi as he had sided with Narayana Deo II in his activities against the British and had been his trustworthy ally since the times of the Khurda expedition. === Continuation of defiance to the British === After the British left the area towards Visakhapatnam on twelfth of December 1768, Jagannatha Gajapati Narayana Deo II again reappeared from his hiding, ousted the British Diwan Ramyogi Patra with the support of his people and even tried in secrecy to forge an agreement with the Marathas for fighting the colonists. The local rulers of Athagarh and Khalikote sided by him in his effort and actively provided him assistance. When the Marathas conveyed that they would not intervene in the matter of the British East India Company in Paralekhemundi, he attempted repeatedly to establish a connection with the French so that an agreement for assistance against the British could be made. However, Narayan Deo II died on 5 December 1771 without being able to execute his plans. == Personality and historical impact == Paralakhemundi rulers had been great patrons of Odia culture and literature. The ruling Gajapati Narayana Deo II was a highly self-educated and spiritual person himself, had authored the Odia work called Sri Brundabana Bihara after he had returned from a spiritual tour of the Vrindavan and a Sanskrit treatise on Odissi classical music called Sangita Narayana. Paralakhemundi royal court found itself as a place where many renounced scholars of the time like Baladev Ratha were encouraged, rewarded and affiliated by the rulers for their contribution to art, culture and literature. Narayan Deo II was an adherent to the preachings of Sri Chaitanya and was a devoted Vaishnavite. Although the efforts put together by Jagannatha Gajapati Narayana Deo II for the revival of Odisha into its past glory despite multiple external aggressors failed, his activities inspired the next series of revolts against the British by his son and step brother in 1799 A.D also known as the second phase of Pralakhemundi Affairs. There were successive revolts by the local people and the indigenous Savara tribals between the years 1813 A.D-1834 A.D and again in 1851 A.D-1856 A.D that was led by Radhakrishna Dandasena. The seventh in line descendant of Narayana Deo II, Krushna Chandra Gajapati Narayana Dev played a pivotal role in the formation of the state of Odisha in the year 1936, dedicated his life for the cause of Odia language and became the first prime minister of Odisha during the British rule. == References == Category:History of Odisha Category:18th- century Indian royalty Category:History of India by region ","title":"Jagannatha Gajapati Narayana Deo II"},{"id":"56922078","text":"Dr. Christian Guttmann, founder of NAII, Nordic Artificial Intelligence Institute Christian Guttmann is a German-Australian scientist and entrepreneur in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Data Science.

These works were written by Dominican nuns in the first half of the fourteenth century in South Germany and Switzerland. They relate the mystical experiences of sisters within the monastery, and were influential in the development of medieval mysticism. ==Content== Some of the sister-books begin with brief, mostly legendary, outlines of the founding history of the monastery, but less attention is paid to the historical facts than to the sentiments and heroic actions of founders. The central content of the books consists of reports on the lives of deceased members of the convent. The sister-books depict not only convent sisters, but also lay nuns and sometimes also men associated with the convent. The presentation usually concentrates on those events in which the subject has acted in an exemplary manner, especially through visions or mystical experiences. Occasionally, the reverse is also shown, when a person's failure or the loss of graces is reported. Essential aspects of the monastic as well as the individual religious life come up, along with current theological problems from questions of monastic obedience to the doctrine of grace and the Trinity dogma. Other themes include co-suffering with Christ and the question of the soul. ==Literary form== The sister-books are a type of medieval lives literature, in which each work relates the lives of a number of people. These descriptions focus on the person's relationship to God and their behavior in the monastic community. This genre of writing was similar to the Vitae Fratrum of male Dominican orders, which in turn was heavily influenced by the Vitae Patrum, a collection of sayings from early Christian monks.Siehe Gerard de Fracheto: Vitae fratrum Ordinis Praedicatorum necnon Cronica ordinis ab anno MCCIII usque ad MCCLIV. Hrsg. v. Benedictus Maria Reichert. Löwen 1896 (Monumenta Ordinis Fratrum Praedicatorum Historica I). The sister-books are also characterized by both the forms and structures of legendary narrative and the vocabulary and motifs of mysticism; the texts take images and metaphors quite seriously. In addition, note that all but one of the sister-books were written in the German vernacular, while the Unterlinden sister-book was written in Latin. None of the original manuscripts of the sister-books survive to this day; scholars rely on later copies, some of which were done as early as the fifteenth century. ==Significance== While the sister-books were often devalued as products of naive nuns and as an expression of a flattened mysticism in earlier scholarship, today they find new attention as authentic testimonies of a women's monastic writing culture. Since only men were permitted to write theological treatises, highly educated women turned to narrative forms, especially in the form of vision narratives, to explain or discuss concepts of religious thought and action. At the same time, these books are important documents for the history of German mysticism. They show that mysticism in women's monasteries was not just a consequence of Dominican preaching; rather, it preceded it in some monasteries. In the discourse on women's religious experiences, Meister Eckhart, Johannes Tauler, Heinrich Seuse and others developed their mystical theology and pastoral care. ==Works== {  - ! Cloister !!

The English name \\"Solidarity Transport Hub Poland\\" is proposed for the project by its website. The planned launch of the port is 2027. At first the airport is to have two runways, but ultimately four. The port will initially have a capacity of 40 million passengers per year, and ultimately 100 million passengers. Planned train connections will take 15 minutes to Warsaw Central railway station, 25 minutes to Łódź Fabryczna railway station, and 2 hours to most other major Polish cities, such as Kraków, Wrocław, Poznań and Gdańsk. ==Location== Area of the planned airport The airport's planned site is about 40km west of Warsaw, next to the village Stanisławów which is part of Gmina Baranów in Grodzisk Mazowiecki County. The Baranow commune occupies a significant part of the Grodzisk County and, despite its rural character, has an extensive road infrastructure. The A2 autostrada and railway lines run in the immediate vicinity of the potential construction site, and Wrocław (Expressway S8) and Poznań (national road No. 92) is nearby. The choice of the location was made after a number of areas were examined. Before recommending Baranów, the Arup consulting company analyzed a list of potential locations, including: Modlin, Wołomin, Sochaczew, Mszczonów, Babsk, Nowe Miasto nad Pilicą, Grójec and Radom-Sadków. Experts took into account the distance from Warsaw, transport accessibility, land accessibility and environmental restrictions, including noise levels. Analyses showed that Baranów offers an optimal location for the project. ==History== Discussion about a new airport to replace Warsaw Chopin Airport began in the 2000s. On May 12, 2005, the Civil Aviation Office signed a contract with the Spanish consortium Ineco-Sener to carry out a feasibility study of the central airport. Such a study was nevertheless not actually carried out during the next two years, which was interpreted as a sign that the project of a new big central airport was being postponed until an indeterminate future. Nevertheless, a new airport serving Warsaw was proposed in the government's Transport Infrastructure Development Strategy for 2010-2013. After the Law and Justice party regained power in Poland the project gained pace, with the government approving the plan on November 2017. On June 17th, 2018, the residents of the district of Baranów, Grodzisk Mazowiecki County voted down the plan to build the new airport. With 47 percent voter turnout, 84 percent opposed the plan. The referendum was not binding, but Deputy Infrastructure Minister Mikołaj Wild said that the voice of the public would be taken under consideration. In June 2019, the British Embassy in conjunction with the Solidarity Transport Hub Company held architectural workshops, inviting well-known architectural firms to share their preliminary concepts for what the project might look like. The studies are meant to serve as inspiration in preparing the master plan, and the investor is not obliged to use any of the designs. Terminal concepts were prepared by six top-name design studios: Foster+Partners, Grimshaw, Chapman Taylor, Zaha Hadid Architects, Benoy, Pascall+Watson: *Foster+Partners proposed the construction of two terminals: a main one, shaped like a \\"key\\" and with a layout very similar to Chek Lap Kok Airport (another airport project designed by Foster+Partners) plus a supplementary one with a letter \\"X\\" shape, which would be created in the second stage. Thus, the company proposed a modular construction of the airport, which can be expanded in time and adapted to the needs of growing air traffic. Both parts are to be integrated with each other (e.g. through a shuttle line between terminals), with the second one being created when market demand justifies airport expansion. *Grmishaw Architects came up with the concept of a \\"democratic hub\\", trying to invoke the Polish tradition, in particular to political changes after 1989 and to the history of the Solidarity movement. They intended the terminal to be unscaled, rational in size and devoid of the sort of megalomania that characterizes some recently built transport hubs. The idea is to reduce the transfer time and distance for passengers. *The Chapman Taylor concept involves hiding the base part of the terminal under a massive transparent dome to be located between the two runways. As its creators explain, the round dome is a symbol of infinite unity, and thus a reference to the history of Poland. *Zaha Hadid Architects, a highly successful architectural company, prepared three equivalent visions of CPK, which are based on a different approach to connecting the airport with rail. All three projects share good lighting of the airport space, made possible through the use of large-surface transparent elements, as well as the incorporation of lush vegetation into the terminal interior combined with a well-thought-out system for maintaining it in Polish climatic conditions. The first solution situates a railway junction directly below the airport, which would allow travelers to, for example, observe oncoming trains from higher levels. The second concept envisions that just the passenger part of the station will be located directly above the platforms, connecting to other elements of the airport included in the master plan. The designers also proposed a third, more futuristic solution, in which trains approach directly to separate parts of the terminals, on platforms situated at different heights. *The Benoy project emphasizes ecology and sustainable development. They propose to build a solid Airport City around the proposed airport. Creating such an area around the port will be made possible by hiding underground parts of roads and railways in the immediate vicinity of the airport. At the heart of the system will be a glass roof covered with a transfer hub, which will integrate various means of transport and towards which communication routes will lead. *Pascall+Watson is the most general of the concepts presented. Project Director Nitesh Naidoo from Pascall+Watson presented solutions used at airports in Europe and Asia (e.g. in London, Munich, Hong Kong and Abu Dhabi), suggesting which of them should be adapted to the needs of the proposed airport. For the purposes of the presentation, he combined the idea of a \\"megahub\\" (referring to the new airport in Istanbul) and a \\"multi-hub\\" (pointing to Singapore Changi Airport in Singapore). ==References * Category:Proposed airports ","title":"New Central Polish Airport"},{"id":"56922086","text":"Filippo Moscati (born 19 September 1992) is an Italian football player.

She is known for her large scale, brightly colored, seemingly abstract and geometric paintings, that represent statistical data related to human-computer interaction. == Life and work == Hayal Pozanti studied visual arts and visual communication design at Sabancı University in Istanbul and went on to study at Yale University, receiving a M.F.A. in painting and printmaking in 2011. Her work is informed by her ongoing exploration of \\"cyborg anthropology\\", which she describes as \\"a framework for understanding the effects of technology on human beings and culture\\". Her work Ciphers (2015) was a direct rendering of data into a glyph alphabet, and limiting herself to the creation of 31 characters. The paintings from Ciphers (2015) feature layered abstractions of the shapes, and were displayed in the gallery with abstract sculptures of similar shapes. Pozanti revisited this theme of alphabet in her work named Instant Paradise (2017), where again she has invented alphabet of 31 shapes. This lexicon is the source material for her paintings, sculptures, animations and sound pieces. Each shape in Instant Paradise has been assigned a number and a letter from the English alphabet, allowing her to literally 'translate' information through a personalized encryption system. She has created a typeface from her characters, as well as phonemes that she resources for her animations and her sound pieces, respectively. Pozanti's work is in several public collections, including Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum, JP Morgan, Fidelity Investments, and the San Jose Museum of Art. == Exhibitions  Solo exhibitions === * 2018 – Murmurs of Earth, Jessica Silverman Gallery, San Francisco, California * 2017 – .tr, Dirimart, Istanbul, Turkey * 2016 – Fuzzy Logic, Rachel Uffner Gallery, New York City, New York * 2016 – Corpus, Levy.Delval, Brussels, Belgium * 2015 – Deep Learning, Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, Ridgefield, Connecticut * 2015 – Scrambler, Halsey Mckay Gallery, East Hampton, New York * 2015 – Ciphers, Jessica Silverman Gallery, San Francisco, California * 2013 – Passwords, Duve, Berlin, Germany * 2013 – New Paintings, Susanne Vielmetter Los Angeles Projects, Los Angeles, California * 2012 – Co-Real, Jessica Silverman Gallery, San Francisco California === Group exhibitions === Pozanti's work has been featured in group exhibitions at Public Art Fund, Brooklyn Academy of Music, The Kitchen, MCA Santa Barbara, Cornell Fine Arts Museum, and the Sabanci Museum, Istanbul. == References == Category:Yale University alumni Category:21st-century Turkish artists Category:21st-century women artists Category:Living people Category:1983 births Category:People from Istanbul Category:Turkish women painters ","title":"Hayal Pozanti"},{"id":"56922198","text":"Dre'Mont Jones (born January 5, 1997) is an American football defensive end for the Denver Broncos of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Ohio State. == High school career == Jones was named first-team Division-I All-Ohio and U.S. Army All-American as a senior, and graduated from Saint Ignatius High School (Cleveland) in 2015. He was a four star recruit, ranked #7 in the state of Ohio and #170 in the nation. On June 18, 2014 he committed to Ohio State University to continue his football career. ==College career== For his first year of eligibility in 2015, Jones redshirted as a true freshman. During his redshirt freshman season in 2016, Jones joined Dan Wilkinson and Luke Fickell as the only freshmen defensive linemen to start 10 or more games in a season. By the end of the season, Jones racked up 52 total tackles, including 4 tackles for a loss. He earned Freshman All-America honors from the Football Writers Association of America. Jones slightly regressed during his sophomore season in 2017, but still, put up strong numbers. He finished the season with 20 total tackles, including 5 tackles for a loss and one sack. He was selected to the third-team All-Big Ten. After his sophomore season, there was speculation that Jones would declare for the 2018 NFL Draft, with draft analyst Mel Kiper listing him as the 8th best draft-eligible defensive tackle. Despite this speculation, Jones decided to return to school for his junior season. Projected first round pick Nick Bosa went down with an injury against TCU on September 15, leading Jones to take on a larger role on the defensive line. Jones started all 14 games as a redshirt junior for Ohio State, and was selected to the first-team All-Big Ten Conference after breaking out with 8.5 sacks and 43 tackles. Jones became the first defensive lineman in OSU history to score two defensive touchdowns in a single season in 2018. After the season, Jones decided to forego his senior year and enter the 2019 NFL Draft. === College statistics === { class=\\" mw-collapsible\\" ! ! ! ! ! colspan=\\"5\\" Tackles ! colspan=\\"4\\" Def Int ! colspan=\\"2\\" Fumbles - !Year !School !Class !Pos !G !Solo !Assisted !Total !Loss !Sacks !Int !Yds !TD !PD !Recovered !Forced - 2015 Ohio State University FR DT             - 2016 Ohio State University FR DT 12 22 30 52 4.0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 - 2017 Ohio State University SO DT 11 10 10 20 5.0 1.0 0 0 0 2 0 0 - 2018 Ohio State University JR DT 14 26 17 43 13.0 8.5 1 28 1 2 2 1 } ==Professional career== Jones was drafted by the Denver Broncos in the third round (71st overall) of the 2019 NFL Draft.

It is individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a contributing property to the Aberdeen Commercial Historic District. ==History== Drawing of the building from 1889 when it was the Northwestern National Bank The building circa 1912 The Northwestern National Bank formed in Aberdeen in 1888 with Henry Marple as president. In August 1888, the bank purchased the property and general store at 21–23 South Main Street to build a new bank building. Construction took place from 1888 through 1889 with the bank opening in the new location in February 1889. In May 1891, a fire damaged the building and gutted the Kearney and Boyer grocery store. In March 1903, another fire damaged the building, originating in the basement banana room of the Gamble & Robinson grocery store. The building was purchased by Jay Hagerty in 1907, becoming known as the Hagerty Block. In 1920, existing tenant Western Union took over the most prominent space in the building, which then became known as the Western Union Building. Over the years, aside from the bank, the building housed grocery stores and several offices. In 1970, the building was donated to Brown County for a museum, which opened as the Dacotah Prairie Museum that October. By 1980 the museum was the sole occupant of the building. The building was nominated for the National Register of Historic Places as the only remaining 19th century bank building in Aberdeen; it was listed on December 12, 1976. The building is also listed on the National Register as a key contributing property of the Aberdeen Commercial Historic District; the district was listed on May 23, 1988. ==Architecture== The Western Union Building is an example of Romanesque Revival architecture. The structure is a three-story building made of red brick laid in running bond. There are three main entrances, each framed by a large arch and set a few steps above street level. Pilasters extend the full height of the building, separating windows on the first floor and window pairs on the second and third floors. The interior has undergone renovations, but the exterior has changed little over the building's history. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Brown County, South Dakota *List of museums in South Dakota *List of natural history museums in the United States ==NotesReferencesBibliography=== * * * ==External links== *Dacotah Prairie Museum website Category:Buildings and structures in Brown County, South Dakota Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1899 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Brown County, South Dakota Category:Historic district contributing properties in South Dakota Category:Romanesque Revival architecture in South Dakota Category:Museums in Brown County, South Dakota Category:History museums in South Dakota Category:Western Union buildings and structures ","title":"Western Union Building (Aberdeen, South Dakota)"},{"id":"56922260","text":"Brown Betty (known in the United States as Brown Betty II, 1930 - after 1937) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. She was one of the best of an exceptional crop of juvenile fillies in 1932 when she won her last four races including the Cheveley Park Stakes. In the following spring he recorded her biggest victory when she took the 1000 Guineas. She ran disappointingly when fourth in the Epsom Oaks but went on to win the Richemount Stakes and finished second in both the Nassau Stakes and the Park Hill Stakes. She was retired from racing at the end of her second season and exported to become a broodmare in the United States. ==Background== Brown Betty was a bay or brown mare with a white star bred in the United Kingdom by Sir Alec Black. As a yearling she was offered for sale and bought for 1,600 guineas by Cecil Boyd- Rochfort on behalf of the American banker William Woodward Sr.. The filly was taken into training by Boyd-Rochfot at his Feemason Lodge stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. Woodward reportedly named Brown Betty after Boyd-Rochfort's niece, Betty McCall. Physically, Brown Betty was described as \\"a filly of exquisite quality, of great length without being long in the back, and of a hard,dark bay colour that adds materially to her beauty.\\" The French trainer Frank Carter described her as the finest looking filly he had ever seen. She was sired by George V's stallion Friar Marcus who won the Middle Park Stakes in 1914 and went on to become a successful sprinter. Brown Betty was his only classic winner although he was the damsire of Bahram. Her dam Garpal was a granddaughter of Santa Brigida (foaled 1898), a British broodmare who was the female-line ancestor of numerous major winners including Alcibiades, Mid-day Sun and Sun Stream. Garpal was bought by Alec Black for 3100 guineas from he breeder Lord Derby but sustained a fractured pelvis shortly afterwards and narrowly avoided being euthanised owing to the intervention of a veterinary surgeon. ==Racing career1932: two-year-old season=== Brown Betty began her racing career by finishing second to Nun's Veil in the Chesterfield Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse in July. In the Molecomb Stakes on heavy ground at Goodwood, she was beaten three lengths by Lord Astor's filly Betty, but a week later she reversed the form by beating Betty a length in a race at Nottingham. On her next two starts the filly was successful in the Champion Beeders' Foal Plate at Derby Racecourse and a Rous Memorial at Newmarket. On her final start of the season Brown Betty was ridden by Joe Childs in the Cheveley Park Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket and won from Solftara at odds of 2/1. The victory took her winnings for the year to £4198. The 1932 Free Handicap, a ranking of the year's best two-year-olds, was unique in that fillies filled the top three places: Myrobella topped the list with 133 pounds ahead of Betty (130) with Brown Betty third on 129. ===1933: three-year-old season=== On 29 April Brown Betty, with Childs again in the saddle, started at odds of 8/1 in a 22-runner field for the 120th running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket. She won by half a length from Fur Tor with the favoured Myrobella three quarters of a length away in third. Brown Betty was strongly fancied for the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse on 2 June but apparently failed to stay the distance and came home fourth behind Chatelaine, Solfatara and Fur Tor. Brown Betty finished second to Solfatara in the Nassau Stakes at Goodwood and then returned to winning form to take the Richemount Stakes over ten furlongs at Hurst Park. In the Park Hill Stakes over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse she was \\"nursed\\" though the race by Childs in an attempt to preserve her stamina but was outstayed in the closing stages and beaten a neck by Typhonic. ==Assessment and honours== In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Brown Betty an \\"average\\" winner of the 1000 Guineas. ==Breeding record== At the end of her racing career, Brown Betty was taken to the United States by Woodward to become a broodmare. She produced at least two foals: *Gallant Betty, a bay filly, foaled in 1936, sired by Gallant Fox. Unraced. *Dusky Fox, bay colt, 1937, by Gallant Fox. Winner. ==Pedigree== * Brown Betty was inbred 3 × 4 to Ayrshire and Cyllene, meaning that these stallions appear in both the third and fourth generations of her pedigree. She was also inbred 4 × 4 to St Simon. ==References== Category:1930 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 8-g Category:1000 Guineas winners ","title":"Brown Betty (horse)"},{"id":"56922271","text":"Rawle Prince Alkins (born October 29, 1997) is an American professional basketball player for FC Porto of the Liga Portuguesa de Basquetebol (LPB).

PII owners often view PII gathering as a threat and violation of their privacy. Meanwhile, entities such as information technology companies, governments, and organizations use PII for data analysis of consumer shopping behaviors, political preference, and personal interests. With the development of new information technology, PII is easier to access and share than before. The use of smartphones and social media has contributed to the widespread usage of PII gathering. PII is collected anywhere and anytime. The dissemination of personal data makes PII gathering a hotly debated social issue. Recent illegal PII gathering by data collection companies, such as Cambridge Analytica on Facebook of over 87 million users, has caused increasing concern over privacy violation and has renewed call for more comprehensive data protection laws. Major security breaches at Equifax, Target, Yahoo, Home Depot, and the United States Office of Personnel Management impacted personal and financial information of millions of American, with calls for increasing information technology security and protection of PII data by businesses and governmental agencies. == Definition == There is no precise definition for PII gathering. According to the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), PII is defined as: > (1) any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s > identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, > mother’s maiden name, or biometric records and (2) any other information > that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, > financial and employment information. PII gathering is any activity that collects, organizes, manipulates, analyzes, exchanges, or shares this data. == Collectors  Governments === Governments publicly collect PII to extend social and legal benefits, such as improving social services and when fulfilling legal obligations. Depending on a country's governmental archetype, such as democratic or authoritarian, PII gathering is conducted using different methods. Regardless, countries share similar goals with PII gathering, as demonstrated by the example below.  United States  In the United States, PII is gathered through application for assistance, registration of property, tax filing, registration for selective services, application for driver's license, government employment, professional licensure, and other voluntary and mandatory information submission. PII is stored, accessed, and shared between different levels of government, departments, agencies, non-governmental entities, and the public. For example, a potential home buyer can look up if a real estate agent is licensed or not. The Government also gathers PII for crime prevention and national security purposes. Many of the programs are highly controversial among the US public. For example, the National Security Agency (NSA) collects and analyzes PII, including phone calls, emails, and social media interactions, from large numbers of people to uncover potential threats.  China  The Chinese government has made big data part of the governance strategy. The goal is a more efficient and transparent government through the use of digital technology. The government has implemented one of the most technologically advanced surveillance networks on the planet called the “Skynet(天网监控系统)”. The system adopts artificial intelligence including facial recognition. 20 million cameras were installed to cover nearly every single public space in the country. PII protection in China deals with collection by private companies and organizations. There has been no discussion or proposal about limiting government involvement in collecting, gathering, and analyzing PII.  Finland  Even in western democratic systems, there are different constraints on PII gathering. Nations in the European Union adopt stricter regulation on PII collecting than the United States. Similarly, personal data processing in Finland has been protected under comprehensive regulations and laws. The Personal Data Act in 1999 was the main national privacy regulation alongside the 1995 European Union Data Protection Directive. Other data regulations enacted in Finland include the Act on the Protection of Privacy in Electronic Communication, the Act on the Protection of Privacy in Working Life, and the Act on the Openness of Governmental Activities. The Personal Data Act was replaced by European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which will take effect in May 2018. Enforcement of privacy regulations have gotten stricter in recent years after a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights which found that a Finnish hospital failed to safeguard personal data. === Companies === With the rapid growth and development of Internet and mobile technologies, private companies are able to collect personal data more quickly and effectively than before. Companies gather PII by storing of profile information when users register a new account, tracking user's location, tracking user's local storage, and using cookies and other anonymous identifiers. Data brokers, also known as information brokers, are the major dealers of gathering, transforming, packaging, and selling of personal data. They gather PII from these resources: 1) Government documents and records, e.g. registration information, crime records. 2) Publicly available sources: including social media, blogs, and Internet websites. For example, Facebook users frequently post their personal information online and share their preferred links. As the site requires users to register with their real identities as required, it offers the opportunity for data broker to store and analyze the individual's personality and preference. 3) Approved companies, businesses, or services that are authorized by users willingly or sometime unknowingly to access their personal profiles. Similarly, online users are often asked to provide PII in order to register an account on a website. The website will then inform users about data gathering and benefits of storing the data, such as no need to enter the password every time and more effective on personal advertisements. However, these approved companies would sell PII collected and stored to data broker and mostly without users’ knowledge or consent. Facebook and Cambridge Analytica data breach is an example. Cambridge Analytica traced personality traits from potential voters’ activities on Facebook, such as their “likes” and locations, and used this personal information to predict voting behaviors. Cambridge Analytica acquired over 87 million users’ PII. Only about 270,000 consented for their data for academic uses, while all other users’ PII is collected illegally by Cambridge Analytica. === Hackers === Hackers are individuals or organizations that collect PII data illegally. They are driven mostly by financial interests, but sometimes political, such as the hacking of Sony by North Korean hackers. Hackers from North Korea targeted Sony Pictures in retaliation for the planned release of “The Interview,” a movie about the fictional assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. The incident resulted in the release of Social Security numbers, salary information, and medical records of Sony employees. Hackers use spyware, viruses, backdoors, social engineering or other methods to steal and collect PII data from individuals, companies, governments, and other organization. For example, Equifax, one of the largest credit company in the world, its security was compromised by hackers and PII for millions of Americans was stolen. == Related laws == PII gathering is often associated with violation of privacy and is often opposed by privacy advocates. Democratic countries, such as the United States and those in the European Union have more developed privacy laws against PII gathering. Laws in the European Union offer more comprehensive and uniform protection of personal data. In the United States, federal data protection laws are approached by sectors. Authoritarian countries often lack PII gathering protection for citizens. For example, Chinese citizens enjoy legislative protection against private companies, but have no protection from government violation. === European Union === * The General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR) - Regulation (EU) 2016/679 The GDPR will take effect on May 25, 2018 and offers comprehensive privacy protection consistent across all sectors and industries. The regulation applies to all businesses and government agencies in the European Union countries. It also regulates all foreign companies and organizations offering services in Europe. Violation and non-compliance of the GDPR may result in penalties up 4 percent of the business’ worldwide annual revenue. GDPR requires businesses and government agencies to get consent for data processing, make anonymous of collected data, provide quick notifications for data breach, safe handling of data transfer across borders, and appointment of data protection officer. === United States === * The Federal Trade Commission Act The section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act) is used to make companies safeguard collected PII data. A company in the United States is not required to have a privacy policy, but is obliged to comply if the company disclosed a privacy policy. The company also cannot retroactively change its data collection policy without offering an opportunity for users to opt out. The FTC imposed a $100 million penalty on LifeLock for failure to protect customer's PII data, such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, and bank account numbers, and violated the terms of a 2010 federal court order. The FTC also uses the Behavioral Advertising Principe to provide guidelines and suggestions for website operators on data collection practices, activity tracking, and opt-out mechanism. A website operator is requested to obtain express consent before sensitive PII data, such as social security numbers, financial data, health information, and data of minors can collected and used. The Behavioral Advertising Principe also calls for reasonable security to protect the collected personal data and limited length of data retention, but for as long as is necessary to fulfill a legitimate business or law enforcement need. The principle is also self- regulatory and intended to encourage more discussion and further development by all interested parties. * The Financial Services Modernization Act * The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act * The Fair Credit Reporting Act * The Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act * The Electronic Communications Privacy Act == Concerns == PII gathering is usually viewed by the public as a violation of privacy. A major concern is that PII gathering allows for the classification of individual and groups, which leads to discrimination and loss of individual and collective freedom. Other perceived risks include: “(1) monetary risk is the risk associated with potential financial loss, (2) social risk is the risk associated with threats to an individual’s self-esteem, reputation, and/or the perceptions of others, (3) physical risk is the risk associated with bodily injury, and (4) psychological risk is the risk associated with potential negative emotions such as anxiety, distress, and/or conflicts with self- image.” A 2018 Gallup poll indicated that more people are now concerned with invasion of privacy and data gathering after the revelation that personal data of Facebook users was collected and shared with Cambridge Analytica without consent. The survey showed that 43% of Facebook users are “very concerned” compared to 30% in 2011, with similar responses from Google users. There is also increasing concerns that personal data is being collected even if users are not logged in or not using the services. The data is collected to target users with tailored advertising services. Concerns over unauthorized data collection and use has resulted in many users stopping using Facebook or moving to other social media platforms, with increasing call for broad privacy regulation from the government, including the ability for users opt out of data collection completely. == See also == * Personally identifiable information * Data collection * Information security * Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive 2002 (also known as ePrivacy Directive) * Data mining * General Data Protection Regulation(EU) * Privacy law * Privacy in education * Privacy and the US government == References  External links == * www.example.com Category:Privacy controversies and disputes ","title":"Gathering of personally identifiable information"},{"id":"56922300","text":"Péter Kónya (born 19 February 1969) is a Hungarian soldier, journalist, trade unionist and politician, who was a Member of Parliament (MP) from 2014 to 2018.

It was incorporated in December 1933 under the leadership of B. W. Watkins with its headquarters based in Toronto, Ontario. The company was engaged in development of the Cuniptau Mine, a polymetallic ore deposit in Strathy Township of Northeastern Ontario. In later years Cuniptau Mines also acquired the Alexo Mine property in Clergue and Dundonald townships of Cochrane District. ==History and operations== Development of the Cuniptau Mine began in 1933 with the sinking of a shaft and underground drifting on the shaft level. This was followed by deepening of the shaft to , a new level established at , drifting, crosscutting and raising in 1934. Operations in 1935 were confined mostly to surface mineral exploration. In 1936, the smelter was rebuilt to test out the possibilities of making a suitable matte from the mined ore. High-grade quartz vein material from the Cuniptau Silica Deposit in Best Township was used as flux for the ore smelting. Development of the Cuniptau Mine in 1936 consisted of underground drifting, crosscutting and raising, with exploration confined to surface and underground diamond drilling. The mine office was stationed at Goward, a locality now in the municipality of Temagami. Cuniptau Mines reopened the Alexo Mine near Porquis Junction in 1936. Operations at this mining property during the year consisted of partial mine dewatering and sampling. The company shipped two cars of ore from Alexo to the Cuniptau Mine to increase the nickel content of the material being smelted. On January 10, 1937, the shareholders of Cuniptau Mines ratified a proposal to merge the company with the newly formed Ontario Nickel Corporation. Ontario Nickel acquired the Cuniptau and Alexo mines in 1937 from this merge. ==See also== *List of mining companies *List of mines in Temagami ==References== Category:Defunct mining companies of Canada Category:Defunct companies of Ontario Category:Companies based in Toronto Category:Copper mining companies of Canada Category:Nickel mining companies of Canada Category:Gold mining companies of Canada Category:Platinum mining companies Category:Mining in Temagami ","title":"Cuniptau Mines"},{"id":"56922319","text":"Events from the year 1985 in Michigan. ==Top Michigan news stories== The Associated Press (AP) selected the state's top news stories as follows: 1\\\\.

Translation in English - Sarah E. Christopher, Colleen Regalbuto The story is set around the end of the 13th century in a castle perched in the mountains of the Aosta Valley and lasts a year, from the death of the old marquis to the fire in the castle. The only external environment is the wood; the internal environments are the rooms of the castle. == Plot summary == A feudal lord inherits a castle with the condition of maintaining faith in an evil obligation of chastity. Twelve abbots take on the task of watching over the commitment, but they all disappear in a succession of mysterious deaths, victims of banal and emblematic incidents. Beautiful and unscrupulous Madonnas, castellans and priests, philosophers persecuted by the Inquisition, squires and monks, devils and sulphurous spells, testamentary readings and carnal temptations, audacious and holy tetragons and then again ... the beautiful Maravì sleepless in love, nostalgia, evening horseback riding, inventors and transplant surgeons in the odor of heresy and even a child and his cat Miro.

During this time, MacDonald became involved with Struts Gallery and Faucet Media Arts Centre, a local artist-run-centre dedicated to the promotion of emerging visual arts practices and critically engaged contemporary art. After graduating in 2006, MacDonald participated in the critically acclaimed internship program at the Owens Art Gallery in Sackville, under the tutelage of Director Gemey Kelly. Following this appointment, MacDonald moved to St. John’s in 2008 and began working with Eastern Edge Gallery as Assistant Director until 2010. She then pursued a Masters in Curatorial Studies at OCAD University in Toronto, graduating in 2012. MacDonald returned to St. John’s to assume the role of Executive Director at Eastern Edge Gallery, where she worked until 2015. During her time as Executive Director, MacDonald also contributed to the community of St. John’s through independent projects, and volunteer work (for example, MacDonald was the founder of the St. John’s based Girls Rock NL, which seeks to empower self-identified girls and female youth with access to the arts and music programming). Most recently, MacDonald was a curator for Flotilla, \\"the first transnational gathering focusing on nomadic and temporary elements of contemporary artist-run culture in Atlantic Canada\\", held in Charlottetown, PEI in September 2017. MacDonald received critical acclaim for her curatorial work. In 2016, her project Land of Mirrors was presented at Eastern Edge Gallery, and featured the work of Michael Flaherty, Will Gill, Philippa Jones, Jerry Ropson, and Jason Wells. As explained by author Lisa Moore in Canadian Art, \\"There is a subtle ambiguity in the subtitle of this exhibition. It might mean that ongoing experiments are happening in Newfoundland, have always happened there, or it might mean that experiments are happening to the very thingness that is Newfoundland—or was Newfoundland...Either way, a wilful dreaming is evoked. Newfoundland is a malleable idea, constantly being dreamt and reconfigured. The question also hints at the fanciful, mildly surreal aesthetic throughout the exhibit. MacDonald and the five artists, Will Gill, Jason Wells, Jerry Ropson, Michael Flaherty and Philippa Jones, are intent on exploring a new Newfoundland.\\" As a precursor to this exhibition, which considered regionalism, site, and rural art practices, was MacDonald’s project, W(here) Festival, held in Pictou County, Nova Scotia. This project, completed during her graduate studies at OCADU, considered the importance and creative potential for curating within rural communities. As explained by MacDonald, the W(here) Festival occurred over five days and \\"included three visiting artist projects by Marlene Creates, Sheilah Wilson and Site Media Inc, four works by local artists drawn from a call for submissions by Susan Sellers, Raina McDonald, Sharon Nowlan, Linda Little and Sheree Fitch, seven presentations by additional local artists and one musical performance by Al Tuck\\". In an essay to accompany the festival, MacDonald goes on to say: \\"On a curatorial level, I argue that art practices and engagements in rural places teach us how to re-examine the familiar, re-imagine place and make change on a more human-scale. Projects tend to take a long time to develop here and their legacy felt long after. Unlike cities where 20 cultural products come and go almost on a daily basis, here change can be profound, slow and incredibly meaningful. In addition, projects out \\"here\\" can often be over looked, ephemeral. But indeed, the old divide between city and country is a tired one. Instead, the projects, stories and actions of the W(here) Festival suggest new simultaneous territories and methodologies that are rich and complex.\\" When writing about the W(here) Festival in her OCADU thesis paper, MacDonald included a dedication in which she stated: \\"To the communities of Pictou County this project is for you. May it encourage other artists and cultural organizers to be brave in places like yours and for others to listen\\". Such a statement communicates the heart of Mary MacDonald’s legacy in Atlantic Canada and nationally. MacDonald contributed to a number of Arts magazines including Visual Art News, Cuss (editor), C Magazine, and The Overcast. == Activism == MacDonald campaigned against cuts to arts funding and spoke out about the value of artists' work and societal contributions throughout her professional career, such as publishing a list of artists who had left Newfoundland and Labrador in The Overcast newspaper, saying \\"this province lacks vision and the ability to retain young professionals.\\" She spoke out against the Newfoundland and Labrador 2013 budget cuts that led to staffing losses at the St. John's-based museum and gallery The Rooms. That campaign included a public forum she co- organized to discuss the cuts titled ART=WORK, a slogan she pioneered. Tshirts with the ART=WORK slogan have since been sold as fundraiser by the non-profit group Visual Artists of Newfoundland and Labrador, in partnership with the Mary MacDonald Foundation, with proceeds meant to support artists in the province. ==Legacy == MacDonald's death in July 2017 prompted the arts community of St. John’s and Atlantic Canada to reflect on her work, and her efforts to bring contemporary art to rural communities. As stated in a posthumous article in The Overcast (an alternative newspaper based out of St. John's ), Chad Pelley states that \\"She was the kind of bright realistic visionary that imparted critical thinking and influence into her community.\\" In the same article, Pelley states \\"It isn’t even her astounding community impact a lot of us are taking note of and celebrating upon her death. Instead, it’s that light she had in her, that just went out on us all. Whatever that was, it’s something so rare we miss it already.\\" To commemorate her legacy, the Mary MacDonald Foundation has been established to support independent curatorial practices. ==References *Mary MacDonald Foundation *Obituary of Mary MacDonald *Owens Art Gallery *Struts Gallery and Faucet Media Arts Centre Category:1984 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Canadian curators Category:Women curators Category:People from Truro, Nova Scotia Category:Mount Allison University alumni Category:OCAD University alumni ","title":"Mary Florence MacDonald"},{"id":"56922585","text":"Aulocera merlina is a butterfly found in the east Palearctic that belongs to the browns family (Nymphalidae).

He was also known for working, in a primary role, that established the importance of research into the social and behavioural aspects of illness in childhood. ==Life== Donald Court was the son of David Henry Court, a schoolmaster, and his wife Ethel Fanny (née Mayneord). Court was educated at the Haberdashers' Adams and in the local school in Redditch. Court initially studied to be a dentist at University of Birmingham, but switched after three years into Medicine in 1936, winning the Russell memorial prize in neurology. As a resident, Court took a position in Queen's Hospital and Birmingham General Hospital. Positions followed at Great Ormond Street Hospital and later as paediatric registrar at Westminster Hospital. With World War II approaching, Court could have been conscripted but was exempted as he was a member of the Religious Society of Friends and served with the Emergency medical services during the war. After the war in 1946, he joined the department of health as a Nuffield fellow at King's College, Durham University. A year later he was appointed as a Reader to King's College, University of Durham in 1955, later the Newcastle University. In 1955 he succeeded Professor James Spence on his death, to conduct research in the Department of Child Health, becoming the first James Spence professor of child health. In 1972, Court retired from the Chair and became the Emeritus Professor of Child Health in the University of Newcastle. From 1973 to 1976 he was president of the British Paediatric Association, later called the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. He married Dr. Frances Edith Radcliffe, in 1939 and had a daughter and two sons. In 1986, he suffered a serious head injury, from which he never fully recovered, and affected his retirement. ==Thousand Family Study== When Court joined Newcastle University, he became involved in the Thousand Families Study, a large and important epidemiological study, that was started by and among others, James Spence. During the period of the study, Court made over 3000 visits to the homes of families, selected for that study. Courts vision of the child changed during this study, and influenced him throughout his professional life. Instead of the prevailing view, which saw the child as a unit in isolation to be treated, Court now saw the child, as part of a network consisting of the family, the neighbourhood and the wider community, as a cogent whole. Court took a specific interest in the common problems of childhood, including intussusception, Upper respiratory tract infection and the first to take an interest in speech disorders, and whose collaboratory efforts with Speech therapist led to a new University department of speech. ==Awards== In 1961, Donald Court was elected as a Fellow of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists. Court was awarded a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1969. In 1978 was awarded the prestigious James Spence Medal of the BPA, named in honour of his old colleague, James Calvert Spence. Professor Otto Wolff, spoke of the citation when awarding the medal to court, Wolff stated: :James Spence would have approved of our medallist. For many years, they worked together in Newcastle until 1954 when Spence died, and a year later Donald succeeded him, as head of the department, with the title of James Spence Professor of Child Health... Like James Spence, Donald is a superb clinician and a master of delicate art of taking a history. Court was awarded the prestigious Nils Rosén von Rosenstein medal of the Swedish Paediatric Association. A number of honorary fellowships followed over the years, including the Royal Society of Medicine, the Royal College of General Practitioners and the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists, celebrating a very active life. ==Bibliography== * The Medical Care of Children.

Described as \\"an eccentric recluse\\", Dale was found bludgeoned to death in his countryside mansion in Hopton Heath, Shropshire, England. The only suspect, Dale's former wife Baroness Susan de Stempel, was cleared of his murder due to insufficient physical evidence. The case is noted as \\"one of West Mercia Constabulary's relatively few unsolved murders\\". Though the investigation did not finish with any convictions, there were successful charges of fraud against de Stempel, two of their children, and her new husband. The possible existence of £12 million worth of gold bars remains in doubt with no proof of their existence. ==Biography== Simon Dale was born Thomas Simon S Dale on 17 June 1919 in Richmond, Surrey to middle-class parents Beatrice née Pritchard and Thomas Dale, an architect, too. Dale spent some of his architectural career restoring dilapidated country homes. Dale wrote scholarly works centring around Arthurian legend, though none were published. He believed that Hopton Heath was an integral part of the legend and that the Holy Grail was buried in the area. He ignored the scepticism of archaeologists. ===Susan Wilberforce=== Susan Wilberforce, the great-great-grand-daughter of Victorian politician William Wilberforce, was 23 when she met Dale in London, he being fifteen years her senior. They married in 1957, and purchased Heath House two years later, saving the Queen Anne mansion, built in 1620, from likely demolition. The couple had five children but the marriage did not last. His eyesight failing, Dale struggled to find work; they chose for Susan not to find employment. The pair regularly argued and lived in different parts of the 50-room house, finally divorcing in 1972. The couple agreed in their settlement to sell Heath House and split the profits, but the sale proved impossible. For fifteen years \\"unstable house prices\\" and Dale's refusal to leave the house stifled any interest in the property. Correspondence between their solicitors continued but did not make any progress and neither side was able to support their case financially in court. Susan found life after her first marriage to be very difficult and had to rely on handouts from her family, finding home in Docklow, near Leominster. She married Baron Michael Victor Jossif de Stempel in 1984, acquiring the title of Baroness. De Stempel was from a wealthy Russian family, the holders of an ancient Latvian title, and their marriage was part-funded by the sale of her aunt's jewellery. The relationship lasted just a year. ===Death=== Dale lived mostly in the kitchen and one bedroom in Heath House, the remainder of the property left to gather dust. Two of his children, Marcus and Sophia, had been visiting regularly to help tidy the exterior of the house and the surrounding grounds. Susan admitted to having broken into the house to reclaim furniture that she considered to be rightfully hers. During this time Dale is said to have felt besieged, and there were several angry confrontations between the two parties. Dale was found dead in the kitchen on 13 September 1987, food still cooking in the oven, by Giselle Wall, his editorial assistant. Investigations revealed that his head had been bludgeoned with a hard, narrow instrument. Dale's headstone in the churchyard of St Edward's, Hopton Castle, is inscribed with \\"11/12 September 1987\\" as the date of death. ==TrialsMurder=== Susan, Marcus and Sophia were initially arrested on suspicion of murder, but the two children were dropped from the investigation after just a few weeks. Susan was charged with the murder of Dale but was found not guilty in the trial in Worcester Crown Court. The purported murder weapon was a crowbar that had been used by the three during renovations. It had been recently cleaned and there were no signs of blood. The prosecution said that they would accept a verdict of manslaughter, citing that Susan had been provoked by Dale's reluctance to sell the house. The case was presented with insufficient physical evidence and the charges could not be upheld. The case therefore remains as \\"one of West Mercia Constabulary's relatively few unsolved murders\\". ===Fraud=== As part of the murder investigation, police conducted routine financial checks. They became suspicious of the fate of Margaret Illingworth (née Wilberforce), Susan's aunt and the second wife of former cabinet minister Albert Illingworth, 1st Baron Illingworth. Margaret was suffering from dementia and was invited to holiday in the de Stempel home in Docklow in February 1984. While there her fortune, much of it in the form of gold bars and valuable paintings, disappeared. At the same time her money and shares were sold using forged signatures and the contents of her London flat were emptied and sold at auction. It is estimated that Margaret was defrauded out of around £1 million before being placed in the care of a nursing home in Hereford. She died in late 1986 and, as other members of the family were mostly unaware of her whereabouts, few attended her cremation. Margaret's will had been recently changed to remove her request to be buried in the Illingworth family tomb in Bradford. It also named Susan as the main recipient of most of her possessions. While in custody from the murder trial in 1988, Susan remained under investigation for fraud in early 1990, two years later. Shortly before facing trial in Birmingham, Susan changed her plea to guilty of defrauding her aunt out of £500,000. Marcus and Sophia maintained their innocence, claiming to be the \\"unwitting tools\\" of their mother, and her husband Michael was also brought in. The four were found guilty, with the judge declaring Susan a \\"malign and appalling influence\\" on her children. Michael was believed to have used his understanding of banking and wills to aid the fraudulent affair. Susan was sentenced to seven years and Michael to four years. Sophia and Marcus were given 30 months and 18 months respectively. Investigations into the whereabouts of Margaret's thirty gold bars, valued at £12 million, proved fruitless despite a dig in the grounds of Heath House. The existence of the gold has never been proven. ==Books== The history of this case is detailed in The Trials of the Baroness, a 1991 book by Terry Kirby. It is also the basis for the true crime book Blood Money: The Story Of The Baroness de Stempel Scandal by Kate Wharton. ==Previous murder at Heath House== Dale is believed to be the second person to have been murdered at Heath House. In 1968, local GP Alan Beach was shot and killed in his car on the driveway. He had been lured to the house by a man who was unhappy about the supposed late diagnosis of his wife's cancer. ==References== Category:1987 in England Category:1987 murders in the United Kingdom Category:1980s trials Category:20th century in Shropshire Category:Crime in Shropshire Category:Deaths by beating in the United Kingdom Category:Murder trials Category:September 1987 crimes Category:September 1987 events in the United Kingdom Category:Trials in England Category:Unsolved murders in England ","title":"Murder of Simon Dale"},{"id":"56922907","text":"Rano Rahi (Rapa Nui: \\"Many volcanoes\\") is a field of seamounts in the Pacific Ocean. These seamounts in part form a series of ridges on the Pacific Plate pointing away from the neighbouring East Pacific Rise and which were volcanically active until about 230,000 years ago, and possibly even more recently. The origin of these seamounts is unclear. Proposals include the effect of tectonic forces on the Pacific Plate and the presence of mantle flow towards the East Pacific Rise. == Geography and geomorphology == This field lies west of the East Pacific Rise, and covers an area between the Rise and 118° western longitude and between 17° and 19° southern latitude. The Pukapuka submarine ridge extends west of the field towards the Tuamotu islands. The Rano Rahi seamount field consists of several chains of seamounts which emanate from the East Pacific Rise. These chains are lined up in the direction of the motion of the Pacific Plate and the farther away from the East Pacific Ridge the more the seamounts overlap with each other until they form ridges, which reach median lengths of . The seamounts in the field are typically less than wide but several kilometres wide; seamounts that are part of a ridge are between high. The total volume of rocks in the seamount province is about . == Geology == The crust underneath the field is no more than 6.5 million years old, and it has a number of anomalous features in the field, compared to oceanic crust elsewhere. Vigorous hydrothermal activity and shallow magma chambers characterize the neighbouring sector of the East Pacific Rise, showing evidence of larger availability of magma. Acoustic reflectivity indicates that a number of these seamounts were volcanically active in the last 200,000 years, if not within the last 50,000 years. Argon-argon dating has yielded ages between 230,000 years and 4.67 million years on rocks dredged from the seamounts. Paleomagnetism indicates that the volcanoes were active over two phases, separated by long periods of rest, and the first phase of activity occurred when the volcanoes were at distances of about or less from the Rise. Lava flows or landslide deposits appear to surround a number of the seamounts. A number of processes has been proposed to explain the formation of seamounts close to spreading ridges. In the case of Rano Rahi, both line-like sources and point-like sources of magma may be involved, with a common source of magma that results in a tradeoff between the sizes of neighbouring seamount chains. Seismic tomography has identified low-velocity material beneath the seamounts which may be flows in the mantle. The neighbouring Pukapuka ridge appears to be related to the Rano Rahi seamounts, which are located east of its eastern end and form a wedge-shaped extension thereof. Among the theories on the origin of Rano Rahi are: * Flow of mantle material from a hotspot towards the spreading ridge. One variant on this theory states that a \\"river\\" of mantle material flows from the South Pacific Superswell to the East Pacific Rise, forming the Pukapuka ridge above its axis and a \\"delta\\" close to the Rise, with the Rano Rahi seamounts on top of this delta. * Crustal extension caused by changed lithospheric stress patterns after about 6-5 million years ago. == Names == Some of the seamounts and seamount groups have proposed names, like Beraiti, Haka, Hotu Matua, Huri Huri and Paiti; The names are mostly derived from the Rapa Nui language, which also lends the name to the field; it means \\"many volcanoes\\". == Notes  References  Sources === * * Category:Seamounts of the Pacific Ocean Category:Pliocene volcanism Category:Pleistocene volcanism Category:Geology of the Pacific Ocean ","title":"Rano Rahi seamounts"},{"id":"56922933","text":"The William Bush House, at 1927 Tunnel Hill Rd. in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, is a historic house built in 1817.

In 1833, he married Hannah, daughter of wine merchant Joshua Penny, and they five sons—including Robert Alexander, Henry and Herbert—and three daughters. ==Shipping business== Brooks was first apprenticed to Hull timber merchant and shipowner John Barkworth, under whom he travelled as supercargo to Mauritius in 1814, and India between 1818 and 1819, both times Barkworth's Elizabeth. Between the 1830s and 1870s, he became one of the leaders of trade between Britain and Australia, with some connection found between his own career—involving exporting, importing, shipping, finance, banking, and political lobbying including promoting assisted emigration—and the development of the colonial Australian economy. In 1820, he established his own London-based firm and, in 1823, he made his first and only trade voyage to Australia, travelling aboard the Elizabeth, now his ship, to Hobart and Sydney. During the 1830s, he established business connections in eastern Australia and New Zealand, including Robert Campbell junior, John Rickards, and Raine and Ramsay, and became one of the largest importers of Australian wool. In this trade, he became chairman of the New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land Commercial Association, a London wool auction regulator, in 1846. Throughout his working closely with trusted colleagues Ranulph Dacre from 1830 to 1843, Robert Towns from 1843 to 1847, and Charles Dickens' illustrator Octavius Browne from 1847 to 1855.Frank Broeze, Mr Brooks and the Australian trade; imperial business in the nineteenth century, Melbourne University Press, Melbourne, 1993. During his commercial ventures, he built a 12-ship fleet, including a number of whaling vessels, reaching over 5,000 tons but, in the 1850s, his interest in shipping diminished, and new investments in ships were only in those directed by business associates. Instead, he focused on financing the wool trade and other Australian ventures including gold mining. In 1841, Brooks opened a small office in St Peter's Chambers, near Cornhill in the City of London, in 1855, he entered into partnership with Robert Spence, with the firm becoming known as Robert Brooks & Co. Three of Brooks' sons became partners of the firm in the 1860s, before Brooks then retired in 1872. The firm existed long after his death, holding as one of the largest importers of wool to the UK, and remained in family hands, diversifying into management and ownership of tea plantations in Ceylon, until 1968 when it entered liquidation. ==Corporate activities== Outside of his own business, between 1837 and 1876 Brooks was a founding director of the Union Bank of Australia, a forerunner of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, where he was a proponent of private merchants. He was also a director of the London Dock Company, the Southern Whale Fishery Company, and the Great Eastern Steam Navigation Company. He was also a director of a number of insurance and mining companies, and other abortive steamshipping ventures, and actively worked to maintain synergistic relationships between Australian trade companies and colleagues in the City of London. ==Political career== In 1859, Brooks was persuaded by Conservative colleagues to stand for election in Weymouth and Melcombe Regis, who cited his maritime aura as a positive factor. He then won the seat, holding it as a backbencher until 1868 when he did not seek re-election. ==References * Category:UK MPs 1859–1865 Category:UK MPs 1865–1868 Category:1790 births Category:1882 deaths Category:Australian people in whaling Category:British people in whaling Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies ","title":"Robert Brooks (MP)"},{"id":"56922997","text":"Cvetkovski () is a Macedonian-language surname.

It was found in the village of Võ Cạnh, Nha Trang, Khanh Hoa, Vietnam. A replica at Khanh Hoa Museum. Dating back to the first century, Indian culture started making its way into the region of Southeast Asia. The expansion of Indian culture into these areas was given the term Indianization. The term was coined by French archaeologist, George Coedes in his work Histoire ancienne des états hindouisés d'Extrême-Orient (The Indianized States of Southeast Asia). He defined it as the expansion of an organized culture that was framed upon Indian originations of royalty, Hinduism and Buddhism and the Sanskrit dialect. A large number of nations came under the influence of the Indosphere becoming a part of Greater India, the cultural expansion caused the Sanskritization of South East Asia, the rise of Indianized kingdoms, spread of Hinduism in Southeast Asia and the Silk road transmission of Buddhism. Indian honorifics were adopted into the Malay, Thai, Filipino and Indonesian languages. The Indian diaspora, both historical (PIO or Person of Indian- Origin) and current (NRI or Non-Resident Indian), play an ongoing key role in the region in terms of geopolitical, strategic, trade, cultural traditions, and economic aspects, with most Southeast Asian countries having sizable Indian communities alongside often much larger ethnic Chinese minorities. ==The spread of Indianisation== Expansion of Hinduism in Southeast Asia. There are many different theories for how Indianization spread throughout insular and mainland Southeast Asia. These differing theories each argue for a different caste of Indians as being the main propagator of Indian language and culture into Southeast Asia. ===Theory of the Vaishya traders=== The first of these theories focuses on the caste of Vaishya traders, and their role for bringing Indian traditions into Southeast Asia through trade. Southeast Asia was rich in resources that were desired in the Indian sub-continent, the most important of which being gold. During the 4th century c.e. the Indian subcontinent was at a deficiency for gold due to extensive control of overland trade routes by the Roman Empire, and this period is when we see the first evidence of Indian trade in Southeast Asia. Vaishya traders had turned to maritime trade to acquire gold, and they set their sails for Southeast Asia. However, the conclusion that Indianization was just spread through trade is insufficient, as Indianization permeated through all classes of Southeast Asian society, not just the merchant classes ===Theory of the Kshatriya warriors=== Another theory states that Indianization spread through the Kshatriya class of warriors. This hypothesis does a good job at explaining state formation in Southeast Asia, as these warriors came with the intention of conquering the local peoples and establishing their own political power in the region. However, this theory has not attracted much interest from historians as there is very little literary evidence to support it. ===Theory of the Brahmins=== The most widely accepted theory for the spread of Indianization into Southeast Asia is through the class of Brahmin scholars. These Brahmins used the maritime routes established by the Vaishya traders, and brought with them many of the Hindu religious and philosophical traditions to spread to the elite classes of Southeast Asia. Once these traditions were adopted into the elite classes, it disseminated throughout all the lower classes, thus explaining the Indianization present in all classes of Southeast Asian society. Brahmins had influence beyond just the fields of religion and philosophy however, and soon Southeast Asia had adopted many Indian influenced codes of law and architecture. A combination of all three theories can explain the Indianization of Southeast Asia, rather than just choosing one. There was an extensive maritime trade network, which allowed for traders to extract gold and spices from Southeast Asia. Once these trade networks had been established, it paved the way for new classes of warriors to exert military prowess over select Southeast Asian areas. Finally, these extensive trade networks also allowed for the influx of Brahmin scholars, who impressed many Southeast Asian elites with their knowledge of law, arts, philosophy. Thus through the Brahmin scholars many of these Indian and Hindu practices were propagated throughout all social classes Southeast Asia. ==Literature== Scripts in Sanskrit discovered during the early centuries of the Common Era are the earliest known forms of writing to have extended all the way to Southeast Asia. Its gradual impact ultimately resulted in its widespread domain as a means of dialect which evident in regions, from Bangladesh to Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand and additionally a few of the larger Indonesian islands. In addition, alphabets from languages spoken in Burmese, Thai, Laos and Cambodia are a variations formed off of Indian ideals that have localized the language. The utilization of Sanskrit has been prevalent in all aspects of life including legal purposes. Sanskrit terminology and vernacular appears in ancient courts to establish procedures that have been structured by Indian models such as a system composed of a code of laws. The concept of legislation demonstrated through codes of law and organizations particularly the idea of \\"God King\\" was embraced by numerous rulers of Southeast Asia. The rulers amid this time, for example, the Lin-I Dynasty of Vietnam once embraced the Sanskrit dialect and devoted sanctuaries to the Indian divinity Shiva. Many rulers following even viewed themselves as “reincarnations or descendants” of the Hindu gods. However once Buddhism began entering the nations, this practiced view was eventually altered. ==Religion== The effects of Hinduism and Buddhism applied a tremendous impact on the many civilizations inhabiting Southeast Asia which significantly provided some structure to the composition of written traditions. An essential factor for the spread and adaptation of these religions originated from trading systems of the third and fourth century. In order to spread the message of these religions Buddhist monks and Hindu priests joined mercantile classes in the quest to share their religious and cultural values and beliefs. Along the Mekong delta, evidence of Indianized religious models can be observed in communities labeled Funan. There can be found the earliest records engraved on a rock in Vocanh. The engravings consist of Buddhist archives and a south Indian scripts written in Sanskrit that have been dated to belong to the early half of the third century. Indian religion was profoundly absorbed by local cultures that formed their own distinctive variations of these structures in order to reflect their own ideals. ===The Mandala=== The Mandala is a religious symbol representing the universe and is also involved in the political system of Southeast Asia. The center of the Mandala is considered to contain the power while the power then spreads outwards. This replicates the how the political system within Southeast Asia has a powerful center of administration. The Mandala, just like a political system, changes from empire to empire with its relation to the King and the empire. ==Caste System== According Hindu belief system, the caste system divides all people of the world into a hierarchical groups based on their work (karma) and duty (dharma). There is absolutely no evidence of hierarchy in caste systems among Hindus according to Sacred Books. The land workers were called Shudras. The Business workers called Vaishyas. The Warriors or those who maintained social order were called Kshatriyas. Those who memorized key mathematical formulas, philosophical precepts, and other knowledge systems and retained in memory were called Brahmins. The caste system, defined by a non-authoritative book on Hindu law wrote that the system is a basis of order and regularity of society. The Brahmins from the Indian culture spread their religion to southeast Asia. By traveling to these countries they were able to inform others on their beliefs and spark the beginning of the Hindu and Buddhist cultures in Southeast Asia. These Brahmins introduced the caste system to all the countries; however, more so in Java, Bali, Madura, and Sumatra. Unlike India the caste system was not as strict. As a result of all these different writings, there are big speculations that the Brahmins has a big role on their religion. There are multiple similarities between the two caste systems such that both state that no one is equal within society and that everyone has their own place. It also promoted the upbringing of highly organized central states. Although they have some similarities, Southeast Asians did not use the Hindu system enitirely and adjusted what they did use to their local context. The Brahmins were still able to implement their religion, political ideas, literature, mythology, and art ==Historiography of South East Asia== The history of South East Asia was mostly always written from the perspective of external civilizations that influenced the region.The prevalent interpretation caused mainly because of the ontological differences, fundamentally dichotomous histories of Europe and pre colonial Asia, was apparently that the despotism, obscurantism, servile equality of Asian societies along with innovation becoming prey to tyranny had rendered history cyclical, immobile and non-linear. The belief in the idea that South East Asia had never engendered its own civilization, and of indigenous incapacity or external benefaction gained additional support, such was the tremendous evidence of Indian architectural and religious influence in South East Asia and we're fundamentally identified as being derivative and thus Indianization was perceived as occurring more so due to the Indian initiatives rather than the indigenous initiatives of South East Asia. ===Development of caste system=== Another main concern for indianization was the understanding and development of caste systems. The debate was often whether or not the caste systems were seen as an elite process or just the process of picking up the Indian culture and calling it their own in each region. This had showed that the Southeast Asian countries were civilized and able to flourish their own interests. For example, Cambodia's caste system is based on people in society. However, in India, the caste system was based on which class they belonged to when they were born. Based on the evidence of the caste system in Southeast Asia, shows that they were applying Indian culture to their own, also known/seen as indianization. Similar to the caste systems, the cultures were a huge part of determining the legitimacy of indianization. Many argue that only writing could really date the culture and prove indianization. The lives of rulers, daily lives of people, rituals of funeral, weddings and specific customs were a few that helped anthropologists date the indianization of countries. The religions found in India and Southeast Asian countries was another piece of evidence that led anthropologists to understand where the cultures and customs were adopted from. ==Decline of IndianizationRise of Islam=== During the 13th century, Islam began to replace the Hindu religion/culture in much of Southeast Asia. The process of Islam coming to the traditional Hinduism kingdoms began with Muslim Indians merchants spreading their trade all over Southeast Asia. Moreover, as trade became more saturated in the Southeast Asian regions wherein Indianization once persisted, the regions had become more Muslim populated. This so-called Islamization has spread to many of the trading centers across the regions of Southeast Asia, including one of the most dominant centers, Malacca. ==Distinction from colonialism== Amitav Acharya argues that \\"Indianization is different from traditional colonialism\\" due to the fact that \\"it doesn’t involve strangers coming in and taking over an unknown land.\\" Instead, Indian influence from trade routes and language use slowly permeated through Southeast Asia, making the traditions a part of the region.The interactions between India and Southeast Asia were marked by waves of influence and dominance. At some points the Indian culture solely found its way into the region, and at other points the influence was used to take over. Indianization and its influence was seen in nearly all aspects of Southeast Asian society and history. Before the rise of Indianisation, influence of Indian culture, and the introduction of Islam the history of Southeast Asia and its people was unrecorded. The beginning of Indianization marked the start of cultural organization, rise of monarchichal kingdoms in Southeast Asia ==See also== * Ancient maritime history * Greater India * History of Indian influence on Southeast Asia * Indosphere * Maritime history of India * Silk route * Siam Devadhiraj ==References== Category:History of Southeast Asia Category:Indian culture ","title":"Indianization of Southeast Asia"},{"id":"56923257","text":"Lombardy elected its eleventh delegation to the Italian Senate on April 5, 1992.Martin J. Bull & James L. Newell, \\"Italian Politics and the 1992 Elections: From 'Stable Instability' to Instability and Change\\" This election was a part of national Italian general election of 1992 even if, according to the Italian Constitution, every senatorial challenge in each Region is a single and independent race. The election was won by the centrist Christian Democracy, as it happened at national level. Seven Lombard provinces gave a majority or at least a plurality to the winning party, while the Swiss- bordering Province of Varese and Province of Como preferred the federalist Northern League. ==Background== After quite five decades of exceptional political stability, the election of 1992 marked a revolution. Umberto Bossi's Northern League, acting as a catch-all party, took votes from all other parties on a base of tax protest and a federalist project. Christian Democracy lost more than in the previous 30 years, the former Communists, now divided between the Democratic Party of the Left and the Communist Refoundation Party, more than ever, as well as all the other parties. ==Electoral system== The electoral system for the Senate was a strange hybrid which established a form of proportional representation into FPTP-like constituencies. A candidate needed a landslide victory of more than 65% of votes to obtain a direct mandate. All constituencies where this result was not reached entered into an at-large calculation based upon the D'Hondt method to distribute the seats between the parties, and candidates with the best percentages of suffrages inside their party list were elected. ==Results== -

It is the largest domestic instant coffee producer. ==Corporate affairs== The company's second largest shareholder is Chongqing Energy International (Hong Kong) Co Ltd., which also established the Chongqing Coffee Exchange, a spot trading center for coffee beans. ==History== The company was founded in 2007. It had been a supplier of coffee beans to Nestle before launching its own brand of instant coffee. Hogood Coffee, launched instant coffee with walnut protein powder instead of non-dairy creamer. ==Planting and processing== Hogood produces 200,000 (Incorrect information, the whole of Yunnan province only produces approx. 100,000mt of green coffee annually) metric tons of primarily Arabica beans annually. Hogood plants much of the coffee in its home region of Dehong, one of the 3 primary regions for coffee cultivation in Yunnan. The company contracts farm land from smallholders and plants seedlings, and then re-contracts the land back to farmers to purchase the coffee beans from the farmers at harvest. Due to the smallholdings typical in China, by employing a scheme to consolidate farm lands, productivity is increased. The success of the scheme relies on relaxed land use laws. The company is investing in a RMB 1 billion (US$145 million) scheduled to be completed in 2018 to produce an announced 10,000 tonnes of freeze-dried coffee, 2,000 tonnes of liquid coffee concentrate and 3,000 tonnes of baked coffee beans annually. ==Marketing and exports== Hogood markets its own brand of instant coffee and roasted whole beans. In the domestic market for instant coffee, Nestle dominates with a market share of over 70% while Hogood only held 2.7% in 2014. Hogood accounts for about half of the country's coffee exports. Since July 2015 the company has shipped coffee to Europe through the Chongqing-Xinjiang-Europe railway link, which passes through Kazakhstan before reaching Duisburg, Germany, taking 14 days over the 30-35 days of the earlier used sea route from Guangzhou. ==In popular culture== During a Ministry of Foreign Affairs reception in Beijing in February 2017 to introduce Yunnan to the diplomatic community, Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi praised the company: “The coffee I just drank is called Hogood. I am not exaggerating -- this is the best coffee that I have ever tasted as a globetrotter.” ==References== Category:Coffee brands Category:Coffee companies Category:Drink companies of China Category:Companies based in Yunnan Category:Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture ","title":"Hogood Coffee"},{"id":"56923486","text":"Braian Alexander Angola-Rodas (born April 6, 1994) is a Colombian basketball player for Partizan NIS of the ABA League.

Anguhadluq grew up living traditionally off of the land in the Back River area and by the age of 28 was considered to be a mature hunter and eventually a respected camp leader. The Utkuhikhalingmiut remained largely unaffected by settling Europeans and continued their traditions into the 1950s. A famine, resulting from a shift in the migratory patterns of caribou away from Back River, caused Anguhadluq and his extended family to leave the area. Anguhadluq led his family to Schultz Lake and Whitehills Lake before settling in Qamani'tuaq, or Baker Lake, in 1961. Anguhadluq's family arranged for him to marry his cousin Jessie Oonark, who is also a well-known artist, but the union never took place. Luke Anguhadluq had 3 wives and 7 children, including two sons whom he adopted. One of Anguhadluq's wives, Marion Tuu'luq, was also an artist specializing in wall-hangings and drawings. Anguhadluq continued to live in an igloo in the winter and a skin tent in the summer until he was 72. The artist hunted and fished almost daily on the lands around Baker Lake. Luke Anguhadluq died on 2 February 1982 at the age of 87 in Baker Lake. As per his wishes, Anguhadluq was not buried in the Anglican cemetery and his body was instead taken by dogsled to a hill overlooking Baker Lake where he spent many hours watching for caribou. == Artistic career == Anguhadluq began his career as an artist when he was 65. It has been suggested that he could have been persuaded by Jessie Oonark's prosperity as an artist to begin exploring his illustrative talents. Anguhadluq took advantage of the crafting materials that were easily accessible in Baker Lake and created drawings, prints and sculptures early in his career. Anguhadluq would often draw sitting on the ground with the paper situated between his stretched-out legs, rotating the page as he went. Crafts Officers in Baker Lake quickly took notice of Anguhadluq's talent and encouraged him to continue drawing. Some of Anguhadluq's prints were sent in a collection to the Canadian Eskimo Arts Council, which resulted in the creation and development of a printmaking initiative in Baker Lake in 1969. Many of Anguhadluq's drawings were then made into prints, often by his sons, Thomas Iksiraq and Barnabus Oosuaq, who became printmakers. Luke Anguhadluq's prints, 81 in total, were a part of each annual Baker Lake Print Collection until he died. Jack Butler, a Craft Officer from 1969 to 1972 described Anguhadluq as a respected patriarch and his art was respected by the community as a result. For example, printmakers were encouraged to modify the base illustrations for their prints as they saw fit, but Anguhadluq's drawings remained unaltered in admiration of him. === Style === Anguhadluq's drawings depicted Utkuhikhalingmiut customs and his own lived experiences of these events. Hunting, drum dancing and people in Anguhadluq's community were often his inspirations. After being encouraged by Craft Officers in Baker Lake, Anguhadluq also began to include mythical components in his illustrations. Some modern objects also inspired Anguhadluq in his later artistic career, such as bedsprings. Anguhadluq's style has been described as abbreviated, with simplified images and a prudent use of line. He would also often use multiple perspectives and/or repeat his subjects for graphic effects. Historian Cynthia Cook has described Anguhadluq's work as having two distinct periods: the early period between 1960–1969 and the later period between 1970–1982. The early illustrations were often done in felt-tip pen and a limited range of coloured pencils. They most often depicted small figures, made of rugged and perturbed lines, surrounded by a vast expanse of blank paper. Later drawings used graphite and coloured pencil on handmade paper to show often larger figures, more balanced on the page than in previous works. Anguhadluq also began to use colour for visual appeal, organization of the subject and to connote symbolic value to the figures in his works. He also began to incorporate multiple perspectives during this period, which centred around a central point or figure in order to illustrate complicated events and to express his own lived experiences of time and space. === Exhibitions === Anguhadluq's work has been featured in over 94 national and international exhibitions between 1970 and 1996, including 6 exhibitions exclusively showing his works. Two of Anguhadluq's most notable exhibitions include a joint production with his wife, Marion Tuu'luq, in 1976 and a solo exhibition put together by the Art Gallery of Ontario and held at the National Art Gallery of Canada from 1993 to 1995. === Collections === Works by Luke Anguhadluq are at the Agnes Etherington Art Centre (Kingston, ON), Canadian Guild of Crafts Quebec (Montréal, QC), Canadian Museum of History (Hull, QC), Klamer Family Collection, Art Gallery of Ontario (Toronto, ON), Victoria and Albert Museum (London, UK), Edmonton Art Gallery (Edmonton, AB), the National Gallery of Canada (Ottawa, ON), Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec (Québec, QC) and the Museum of Anthropology, University of British Columbia (Vancouver, BC) among others. There are works by Luke Anguhadluk at commercial galleries including Feheley Fine Arts in Toronto, ON., and Spirit Wrestler Gallery in Vancouver, BC. === Awards === Anguhadluq was presented with a cultural award to attend the shared exhibition with his wife, which was held at the Winnipeg Art Gallery. He has also been featured in the magazine Inuit Art Quarterly many times and is regarded as an important Canadian artist. Anguhadluq's work is known to be held in the collections of at least 25 galleries and museums around the world. == Sources == Category:Inuit artists Category:1895 births Category:1982 deaths Category:Artists from Nunavut Category:Inuit from the Northwest Territories Category:People from Baker Lake ","title":"Luke Anguhadluq"},{"id":"56923503","text":"Howard A.

Her quilts are known for their bold and improvisational style. In 2006 her quilts \\"Roman Stripes\\" variation and Medallion appeared on two US Postal service stamps as part of a series commemorating Gee's bend quilters. In 2015, she received the NEA National Heritage Fellowship. Her quilts are in the collections of The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. == Life == Loretta Pettway grew up in disjointed homes with laborious chores and responsibilities. Her mother left the family when Loretta was about seven years old. Her father, Famous Pettway, remarried Plummer T. Pettway, but Loretta was raised primarily by her grandmother, Prissy. She was also the primary caretaker of her disabled brother. Loretta spend some of her childhood under her Aunt Candis and Uncle Tank Pettway's roof. There she grew up alongside her cousins Qunnie Pettway and Tank Jr. Later, she moved to another aunt's house, Missouri Pettway, alongside her cousin, Arlonzia Pettway. Her schooling was also fragmentary. Loretta typically went to school during October, November, and December, between harvests. Otherwise, all of the rest of her time was spent harvesting and attending to her brother. Loretta married an abusive man who drank, smoked, and was very jealous. She raised seven children, who also began farming at an early age. == Work == Loretta is one of the only quilters interviewed by the Souls Grown Deep Foundation who expressed contempt for learning to quilt. She recalls, \\"I didn't like to sew. Didn't want to do it. I had a handicapped brother and I had to struggle. I had a lot of work to do.\\" However, her grandmother Prissy was adamant about her learning to quilt, insisting that it was a skill that would be useful later in her life. This proved true when Loretta moved into her home, which only had one heated room, as an adult. \\"But when I got me a house, a raggly old house, then I needed them to keep warm. We only had heat in the living room, and when you go out of that room you need cover. I had to get up about four, five o'clock, and get coal. Make a fire. Them quilts done keep you warm.\\" She first learned how to quilt by assisting her grandmother with assembling patches, threading needles, etc. her first quilt was a \\"Nine Patch\\" quilt made when she was eleven. Now, she has a variety of patterns in her oeuvre. == References == Category:Living people Category:1942 births Category:African-American artists Category:Folk artists Category:Quilters ","title":"Loretta Pettway"},{"id":"56923529","text":"The 1995 Campeonato de España de Turismos was won by Luis Villamil with Alfa Romeo 155 TS. ==Teams and drivers== {  style=\\"font-size: 85%;\\" !

From various buildings, a larger domicile had been constructed by 1283.

Between 1819 and 1838, Tommaso Giugni, who had married the last heir of the Canigiani, refurbished the structure, both the interiors and facade, in a neoclassical style.

In 2017, she did not follow the recommendations of a special committee list of the most qualified judges for the newly formed Icelandic court of appeals and instead hand-picked 4 of them, including the wife of fellow Independence Party parliamentarian Brynjar Níelsson. On 12 March 2019 the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the appointments had been made illegally.

Starring Gerald Anderson and Pia Wurtzbach. This is Pia Wurtzbach's second film after Gandarrapiddo: The Revenger Squad, which was released theatrically on December 25, 2017. The story is about Burn (Gerald Anderson), a man who's down in the dumps, and Abi (Pia Wurtzbach), the girl who helps him see the light again. The film was released on March 14, 2018. ==Plot== Burn Toledo (Gerald Anderson) loses control of his life after his marriage proposal is rejected by his girlfriend Angel (Marlann Flores) and is fired from his job. He drives away to a far place and crashes his car. He ends up in Happy Sunshine Camp, a remote resort, where he meets the owner, Abi (Pia Wurtzbach). He instantly forms a dislike towards her due to her perky demeanour as all- around worker in the remote resort. Burn soon apologizes for his rash and awful behaviour and with the help of Bubut (Wilma Doesnt), Handres (Janus Del Prado) and Lucky (Darwin Tolentino), helps restore the resort to its former shape as payment for his debt. He begins to form a bond with Abi as he spends more time with her. In reality, Burn is revealed to have developed schizophrenia after sustaining head injuries due to the accident. He is treated by his doctor and friend Aris (RJ Ledesma) who informed Burn's father Roel (Tonton Gutierrez) and his older sister Ellaine (Dimples Romana) about his condition. Roel angrily refuses to treat his son's illness since his wife died with the same illness. Burn has psychotic episodes towards his father when he angrily attempts to snap him out into reality, indicating that Abi, the Happy Sunshine Camp, and the people in it are imaginary. During the re- opening of Happy Sunshine Camp, Burn finally faces the reality that Abi, her friends, and the people whom they called their first visitors in the remote resort are imaginary. In the real world, he is rescued by Ellaine as he was drowning in the bathtub the whole time. Burn's mental condition continues to worsen, convincing Roel to have Aris treat his son's mental illness. As Burn is being treated, his memories of Abi and her friends at the hospital begins to fade. Burn finally says goodbye to Abi, and they part ways. Burn recovers from his mental illness after six months of treatment and reunites with his family. One day while spending time with his family, including Tetet (Xia Vigor), Ellaine tells him to meet a certain person at a coffee shop. On the way, Burn sees two other people who look like the same people he met at the Happy Sunshine Camp. At the coffee shop, meets the barista Bie, who happens to look exactly like Abi. Since Burn's memory of Abi has been erased, he doesn't remember her but looks familiar to him. Burn finally introduces himself to Bie and he smiles, happy to meet her in person. ==CastMain Cast=== *Gerald Anderson as Burn Toledo *Pia Wurtzbach as Abi/Abie \\"Bie\\" Marie Garcia-Molina ===Supporting Cast=== *Dimples Romana as Ellaine Toledo *Tonton Gutierrez as Roel Toledo *Janus Del Prado as Handres *Wilma Doesnt as Bubut *Darwin Tolentino as Lucky *RJ Ledesma as Aris *Xia Vigor as Tetet *Paolo O'hara as Mr. Ledesma *Marlann Flores as Angel ==Production== On January 18, 2018, Star Cinema announced that Pia Wurtzbach is set to do a new film with Gerald Anderson after her successful MMFF film Gandarrapiddo: The Revenger Squad with Vice Ganda and Daniel Padilla.

Released in 200 Cinemas earning 10 million on its opening day. It is also released on some selected countries. ===Critical response=== Oggs Cruz of Rappler stated Director Cathy Garcia-Molina is currently the Philippines' foremost crafter of escapist fantasies. She, however, doesn't peddle her works as portraits of possible realities. She's aware that her stories are diversions to the drastically harsher lives of her film's audience, populating her perfect love stories with women who are obviously wearing outrageous wigs, seemingly in an effort to highlight the fact that nothing in the films' fairy tale endings can be farther from the truth. My Perfect You appears to be the strangest in Garcia-Molina's filmography, even stranger than My Only Ü (2008), which had the characters played by Vhong Navarro and Toni Gonzaga commit to a romance even in the afterlife. What makes My Perfect You stand out is how it isn't exactly a love story but an examination of Burn, played excellently by Gerald Anderson, a man desperate for an escape from the many problems that ail his life. The film opens with him running away from his family, hurriedly driving to an unknown destination until he swerves into a ravine trying to avoid hitting a pedestrian who suddenly appears in the middle of the road. He gets out of his damaged car and finds himself in a decrepit resort managed by overeager and endlessly optimistic Abi, played by surprisingly soulful Miss Universe winner-turned-actress Pia Wurtzbach. == References  * Category:Philippine films Category:Philippine romantic comedy-drama films Category:2018 romantic comedy-drama films Category:Filipino-language films ","title":"My Perfect You"},{"id":"56923735","text":"is a 1992 falling tile puzzle arcade game developed and published in Japan by Namco. It is the third game in the Cosmo Gang series, succeeding Cosmo Gang the Video. Players stack blocks and pink-colored aliens together, the objective being to clear as many of these as possible. Blocks are cleared by stacking them into rows of six, while aliens are cleared by dropping blue- colored spheres, which defeat any enemies in its path. Namco ported the game to the Super Famicom a year later in 1993. This version of the game was reworked and reskinned as Pac-Attack for North America and Europe, which was later ported to other consoles such as the Sega Genesis and Game Boy. Cosmo Gang the Puzzle was met with a mixed reception from critics, being praised for its multiplayer aspect and gameplay but criticized for its graphics. The Super Famicom version was released on the Wii Virtual Console in 2008 and Wii U Virtual Console in 2015, while the arcade version was released for the Wii Virtual Console in 2009 — all of these ports were exclusive to Japan. ==Gameplay== Arcade version screenshot. Cosmo Gang the Puzzle is a falling- tile puzzle game. Using the joystick, the player must stack groups of blocks and pink-colored aliens, known as \\"Jammers\\", onto the game board, the objective being to clear as many possible before they stack to the top of the screen. Blocks can be cleared by matching them into horizontal rows of six, while Jammers can be defeated by blue-colored balls, which will point in the direction they will move and clear any Jammers in its path. A meter located at the middle of the screen will fill up each time a Jammer is cleared - once this meter is filled, a star will drop from the top of the screen and clear all Jammers on-screen. The game becomes progressively more difficult as it progresses, increasing the speed of the dropping blocks and Jammers. Once the blocks and Jammers reach the top of the screen, the game will be over.\\"Coin- Ops - Cosmo Gang the Puzzle\\" (March). Sinclair User. Retrieved 1 March 1993. pg 29. Alongside a single-player option, a multiplayer option is also available. The second player's screen will replace the Jammers with white- colored robots named 'Pipopapo-Tai\\", which behave the same as regular Jammers. In the multiplayer mode, the objective is to fill up the other player's screen, which can be accomplished by clearing more Jammers than the other player, causing the other's enemies to fall onto the opponent's side. The game will end once a player's blocks and Jammers reach the top. ==Reception== Cosmo Gang the Puzzle was only a moderate success in arcades. It was awarded the 16th Annual Hit Game award from Gamest based on reader vote. A writer for Sinclair User enjoyed the game for its addictive quality and mechanics. They wrote that while it wasn't an original concept by any means, Cosmo Gang the Puzzle was still an enjoyable game in its own right, and made for a solid take on the Tetris formula. Reviewers weren't as enthusiastic about the Super Famicom version. One common complaint was that the gameplay wasn't as gratifying or well-designed as other puzzle games already on the market. The four reviewers of Famitsu felt that it lacked the same level of refinement as Puyo Puyo or the simplicity of Tetris. Andy Lowe from GamesMaster stated that while he felt Cosmo Gang the Puzzle possessed more \\"involved\\" gameplay than Tetris, it lacked substance and didn't have as many features that other similar games had. Super Plays Matt Bielby disliked the difficulty for being too easy and the gameplay for becoming tedious after a while, writing that its quirkiness couldn't save it from becoming \\"cupboard-fodder\\". Andy and Bielby both found the price too expensive for a game that offered little in the way of content. Critics showed appreciation towards Cosmo Gang the Puzzle for its novelty and some of its concepts. Lowe said that the game had a wider scope than other Tetris clone games did, and that it \\"features some devilishly strategic touches\\" that other titles lacked. Biebly agreed and said that what little depth that Cosmo Gang had was very innovative, finding some of Namco's additions to be creative. Writers for both Famitsu and Super Famicom Magazine liked the multiple gamemodes for offering a different take on the falling tile gameplay. Famitsu staff in particular were fond of the Vs. Mode for its more relaxing pace, writing that it was a necessity for games of its kind. Lowe and Bielby both enjoyed the puzzle mode for its layer of strategy and depth; Lowe in particular believed that it was the best aspect of the game. The game's graphics, character animations, and soundtrack also received praise. Super Famicom Magazine concluded their review by writing that Puzzle made for a nice addition to the console's library, and outclassed the arcade original with its new features. ==See also== *Pac-Attack *Korogashi Puzzle Katamari Damacy ==NotesReferences== Category:1992 video games Category:Falling block puzzle games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Namco games Category:Namco arcade games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video game sequels Category:Arcade games Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Virtual Console games for Wii Category:Virtual Console games for Wii U ","title":"Cosmo Gang the Puzzle"},{"id":"56923738","text":"'t Hart is a Dutch surname.

He was suffect consul in either the year 144 or 145.Géza Alföldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand unter der Antoninen (Bonn: Rudolf Habelt Verlag, 1977), p. 149 Proculus is known primarily from inscriptions. He is a member of the gens Neratia, whose origins were in Saepinum. Although he bears the praenomen Lucius, the same as Lucius Neratius Marcellus (suffect consul in 95 and ordinary consul in 129) and Lucius Neratius Priscus (suffect consul in 97), Proculus is the son of a Gaius Neratius. Proculus is also known to have a sister, Neratia Procilla, who married one Gaius Betitius Pietas, a notable of Aeclanum; their son and Proculus' nephew was Gaius Neratius Proculus Betitius Pius Maximillianus.Mireille Corbier, L'aerarium saturni et l'aerarium militare. Administration et prosopographie sénatoriale (Rome: École Française de Rome, 1974), p. 392 == Life == His cursus honorum is known from a dedication to a statue raised by his fellow citizens at Saepium. The earliest office Proculus is attested as holding was in the decemviri stlitibus judicandis, one of the four boards that formed the vigintiviri; membership in one of these four boards was a preliminary and required first step toward gaining entry into the Roman Senate. He served two commissions as military tribune: first with Legio VII Gemina then stationed at Legio (modern León); next with Legio VIII Augusta in Argentorate (modern Strasbourg), in Germania Superior. His next recorded office was quaestor, and upon completion of this traditional Republican magistracy Proculus would be enrolled in the Senate. The traditional Roman republican magistracies of aedile and praetor followed, without distinction. His first praetorian post was as legatus or commander of Legio XVI Flavia Firma, then stationed at Samosata in Commagene; Géza Alföldy dates his commission to around the year 138.Alföldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 301 As Proculus was close to Syria, he was ordered to lead vexillationes against the Parthians; Mireille Corbier dates this military campaign to 139 or shortly thereafter. This show of force impressed Vologases III, who provisionally renounced his designs on Armenia. On his return, Proculus was appointed as prefect of the aerarium militare, which leads him directly to the consulate. As prefect he may have been either the colleague or successor of Salvius Julianus. Corbier notes that if Proculus were Julianus' colleague, his ascent through the senatorial ranks would have been rapid, and Proculus would have been consul in 144; if Proculus succeeded Julianus, his advancement was slower and he would have been consul in 148. The life of Neratius Proculus is a blank after his consulate. == References == Category:2nd-century Romans Category:Suffect consuls of Imperial Rome Proculus ","title":"Lucius Neratius Proculus"},{"id":"56924101","text":"ISO-IR-182 is a Welsh variant of ISO/IEC 8859-1 that supports the Welsh language.

The group’s membership cuts across the six states in the south-south geopolitical zone of Nigeria – Akwa Ibom State, Cross River State, Bayelsa State, Rivers State, Delta State and Edo State – one state (Ondo State) from South West geopolitical zone and two states (Abia and Imo) from South East geopolitical zone. To accommodate indigenes of the region in diaspora, the group has also established presence in United Kingdom, United States and Germany. The association also cautioned president Muhammadu Buhari and the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) of witch-hunting former Niger Delta Freedom Fighter, Hight Chief Oweizide Government Ekpemupolo alias Tompolo, Dr. Patrick Ziakede Akpoboloukemi, former director general Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency(NIMASA) and other Niger Delta prominent leaders saying “Witch hunting of our leaders is fight against us. We shall not take it from him anymore. He is disrupting the sleeping lions. No one has the monopoly of violence.” In April 2017, the President of the association, Comrade Victor James, met on a closed door meeting with the British Member of Parliament for Plymouth Sutton & Devonport, Oliver Colvile, where he presented papers on \\"Degradation and deprivation in the Niger Delta titled \\"Act now before it is too late\\". The meeting with the conservative MP was in view of the corruption attached to the Ogoni clean-up and other related Niger Delta oil spills, following report from the spokesperson for the group, Comrade Gaberiel Patterson. The President accused the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari of politicizing the issue of clean-up process of the region even after a celebrated fanfare that saw no inclusion of the activity in the 2016 and 2017 budget.

Our politicians in Niger Delta and federal government are having a side deal with the IOC and pretending as if they care for the common man in Niger Delta\\". In 2018, the group spoke against the modus operandi of British Broadcasting Corporation, BBC, in Nigeria which it alleged was designed to favour the North. In a statement released by the group’s president, he claimed this alleged trend was not unassociated with the fact the BBC seldom reports any event that would paint the Niger Delta in good light to stimulate the necessary capacity with a view to ameliorate the myriads problems springing up in the Niger Delta region. The youth leader argued that the coverage on economic, infrastructural, political and social welfare inadequacies in the North, particularly the Fulani/Hausa core North by BBC to the extent it established BBC-Hausa Language spoke volumes of its alleged bias and lack of consideration for other regions.

The park also featured: Steam Merry Go Around (later Electric Carousel), Three Way Figure Eight Scenic Railway, Shoot the Chutes, Giant Flying Circle Swing, Maze, The Old Mill (Tunnel of Love), Laughing Gallery Fun House, boat rentals, picnic grounds, a 5000-seat auditorium, a dance pavilion, a roller skating palace, a swimming pool (1922), and the midway bordered on both sides with such attractions as the ice cream parlor, lunch room, games of skill, and the rides. == Chautauqua == Beginning in 1902, the Assembly of the Rockford Chautauqua met at Harlem Park for two weeks each summer, with attendance of over 80,000 annually. Participants could rent tents and stay overnight on site, enjoying educational and entertainment programs during the day and evening. Lecturers included William Jennings Bryan, \\"Fighting Bob\\" La Follette and Jane Addams. == Transportation == The Rockford Street Railway Company developed Harlem Park as a terminus for its streetcar line serving the north side of the city. A car barn stood near the park between Harlem Blvd. and Clinton Street on the south side of Brown Ave. During the summer, cars departed every 15 minutes from the center of town, bound for the park. The park was also served by two steamboats running two miles upstream from the center of town and by an electric ferry bringing park patrons across the river. right == Demise == At the close of the 1928 summer season the park was closed, and some of the attractions were moved to Central Park (1921-1942) on the west edge of the city. In preparation for a residential subdivision, a 2,000-foot seawall was built on the river bank and the land behind it was built up by as much as six feet with material dredged from the river. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 brought the project to a standstill and it was 1948 before the first home was built in the Rock Terrace subdivision. == References  External links == * Baie, Lyle H.

Portrayed by Adam Huber, Liam is the first series regular role in the remake not based on a character from the original series. Liam first appears in the 2018 episode \\"Our Turn Now\\", in which he meets and agrees to marry Atlanta energy heiress Fallon Carrington (Elizabeth Gillies) to thwart the plans of tech billionaire Jeff Colby (Sam Adegoke) to ruin her. After recurring in seasons one and two, Huber was promoted to a series regular for the third season. The character has been a fan favorite since his very first appearance. ==Characterization== Huber called Liam \\"just a good guy\\". He attributed his character's popularity to Liam's function as the straight man in contrast to the heightened melodrama of the Carringtons, adding that fans love Liam's chemistry with Fallon, portrayed by Gillies. He said that \\"Liam keeps Fallon accountable,\\" and noted: Lizzy Buczak of TV Fanatic wrote that \\"the Van Kirks get worse with each family additional family member. I can see why Liam decided he was better off changing his name and becoming estranged.\\" Liam explains to Fallon in \\"The Butler Did It\\" that he allows his mother Laura Van Kirk (Sharon Lawrence) to berate him because he is protective of her, Laura having suffered a mental breakdown after the death of Liam's father. Buczak was disappointed with Liam's \\"timid reaction\\" upon learning in \\"New Lady in Town\\" that Fallon's treacherous brother Adam Carrington (Sam Underwood) slept with his mother, and wrote \\"I was hoping to see Liam throw a few much-deserved punches\\". Huber said he wants Adam to pay for what he has done to Liam and Fallon, but noted \\"I don't know if Liam's the type of who's going to really go after him\\". ==Development== Buczak called Liam's relationship with Fallon \\"tumultuous yet epic\\". Andrea Reiher of Brit + Co noted that their business arrangement took on a hint of romance in \\"Don't Con a Con Artist\\". Huber explained: Though the show had hinted that Liam could actually be Fallon's long-lost brother Adam, Delia Harrington of Den of Geek called the reveal of Liam's backstory as the disgruntled heir of another wealthy family \\"a bit of a letdown after all the hinting\\", and \\"all too straightforward.\\" Georgia Makitalo of Hidden Remote called Liam's admission in \\"Dead Scratch\\" that he is in love with Fallon a \\"shocking revelation\\". Paul Dailly of TV Fanatic called the love triangle of Fallon, Liam, and Michael Culhane (Robert Christopher Riley) \\"one of the most engrossing love triangles on TV in quite some time\\", adding that \\"both Liam and Culhane are genuinely nice men who care for Fallon [and] her dream about the three-way in the shower confirmed that Fallon was conflicted.\\" Samantha Nguyen of MyFantasySportsTalk noted that though the love triangle seemed settled by Fallon and Michael's engagement in \\"Twenty-Three Skidoo\\", the series had \\"made it pretty clear that there's more drama to come\\". Asserting that Fallon and Michael's chemistry had dissipated in season two in favor of Liam, Buczak also pointed out, \\"Fallon is more conflicted than ever regarding her feelings for Liam and Culhane. Fallon still had lingering feelings for Liam. However, she probably would have been able to curb those emotions had she not assumed Culhane was having an affair.\\" Huber researched amnesia for his third season storyline. Though that plot development was a surprise, he noted, \\"It gives me something to play with.\\" Saying that he wanted Liam and Fallon to ultimately be together, Huber acknowledged that \\"you have to have the drama because of the type of show it is. Without it, it's just kind of 'meh'.\\" He said, \\"You can never be too happy or too sad for too long on this show...It's always going to be kind of a rocky road for [Fallon and Liam], though, and in this TV show it's never going to be rainbows and balloons, there are gonna be things that try to complicate their relationship.\\" Huber said of Fallon and Liam, \\"They're cut from the same cloth. I think they truly understand and get each other, and make each other happy. But they really are soulmates, so I'm hoping that's what the writers think.\\" He noted: Huber added, \\"I want the relationship on the show to be a positive relationship. You know, the younger generation is watching it. I want them to support each other and be there for one another. Not like have this crazy drama and crazy fighting because not all relationships are like that.\\" Of future storylines, he said that he hopes he will be able to do more physical action and stunts in future episodes, and that the show will have Liam reconnect with the child he gave up. ==Appearances== Huber first appeared in the 2018 episode \\"Our Turn Now\\", in which Liam meets and marries Atlanta energy heiress Fallon Carrington to thwart tech billionaire Jeff Colby's plot against her. He recurred on Dynasty for the first two seasons, never sure how long he would be kept around. It was announced in October 2019 that Huber had been promoted to a series regular for season three. He said that being put on contract with the show was unexpected, and that he was testing for a role on an upcoming NYPD Blue reboot when the offer was made during filming of season two. Huber said, \\"people really love our chemistry and me as a love interest on the show, so I think that's why it stuck.\\" Liam is the first series regular role in the remake not based on a character from the original series, and the character is Huber's first series regular role. ==StorylinesSeason one=== In \\"Our Turn Now\\", Fallon sets up Liam as Sam's date to her faux wedding to Jeff. Sam and Liam hit it off, making Fallon's brother Steven jealous. Liam eventually admits that he is not gay, and encourages Sam to seek out Steven. Turning the tables on the Colbys, Fallon announces to Jeff that their new marriage is invalid since she met and married Liam the night before at city hall. Though their annulment is in the works, Liam agrees to attend Fallon's grandfather's funeral with her in \\"Poor Little Rich Girl\\". He is recognized by someone as \\"Jack\\", but dismisses it as a mistake to Fallon. After he helps her try to manipulate a confession out of her mother Alexis in \\"Don't Con a Con Artist\\", Liam and Fallon kiss. Fallon agrees to a date with him in \\"Use or Be Used\\", but misses it when she learns that her ex-boyfriend Michael's father is in the hospital. Alexis reveals to Fallon that Liam is really a journalist named Jack Lowden writing a tell-all, and Fallon cuts him loose. Liam gives Alexis his manuscript—actually about his own wealthy family—for delivery to Fallon, but Alexis burns it instead. Liam appears at Steven and Sam's wedding in \\"Dead Scratch\\", and tells Fallon he is in love with her. He reveals that his manuscript was about his own family, the Van Kirks of New York. ===Season two=== In \\"Twenty-Three Skidoo\\", Fallon is negotiating to sell Carrington Atlantic to Liam's uncle Max Van Kirk, but she and Liam have to pretend to still be married to secure the deal. Max coerces Fallon and Liam to kiss in front of him, which leaves Fallon slightly confused about her feelings. Liam introduces Fallon to his imperious mother, Laura, in \\"The Butler Did It\\", and Fallon faces off with her in Liam's defense. Suspecting Michael is cheating on her, Fallon almost has sex with Liam in \\"Queen of Cups\\". Liam gives Fallon an ultimatum about their relationship in \\"That Witch\\", and she ultimately chooses Michael over Liam. In \\"A Champagne Mood\\", Fallon and Michael go to Liam for his help in accessing Van Kirk files, which they hope will prove that Max was behind the drug smuggling and keep Michael out of jail. Although reluctant at first, Liam agrees to help. After Fallon breaks things off with Michael because she cannot trust him, she visits Liam, but another woman answers the door. In \\"The Sight of You\\", Fallon takes a girls trip with Monica, Cristal, and stowaway Kirby, but her true motive is to see Liam, who is at the same ski resort in Idaho with his new girlfriend Ashley. While Sam and the women sabotage Ashley, Fallon asks Liam for another chance. He is happy with Ashley, and asks Fallon to move on as well. After Ashley and her friends brawl with Fallon and her posse at a dive bar, a furious Liam tells Fallon he never wants to see her again. In \\"Miserably Ungrateful Men\\", Fallon buys the publishing company that is releasing Liam's novel, intending to scrap the book but trying to manipulate him into pulling out of the deal on his own. In \\"How Two-Faced Can You Get\\", Fallon reads and loves Liam's novel, which is about their relationship. She goes to him to apologize, and offers to publish it after all. In \\"Life is a Masquerade Party\\", Fallon arranges for Liam and his ex, Ashley, to spend time together in public to promote his book, but is jealous when they appear to be rekindling their relationship. Fallon and Liam admit they are in love with each other. Fallon's brother Adam takes a photo of Fallon and Liam kissing, which he sells to the press. The negative publicity surrounding the photo threatens Liam's book sales in \\"This Illness of Mine\\", forcing Fallon to confirm publicly that the book is about her and not Ashley. Liam's mother Laura appears and threatens to block the novel's publication unless Fallon breaks things off with Liam. He tries to broker a peace over dinner. Laura claims to be dying of cancer, but Fallon is suspicious. Fallon has Laura's blood tested and proves she is lying, but Laura deflects the accusation and Liam is angry with Fallon. Laura is eventually forced to confess, and Liam softens to Fallon. In \\"New Lady in Town\\", Fallon and Liam plot to expose Adam's true colors to her father Blake, but Adam outmaneuvers them each time. While Fallon steps in for Blake to prevent Jeff and Michael from seizing control of the Atlantix in \\"Thicker Than Money\\", Liam and Kirby help her snatch a book deal from a competitor. Liam and Fallon finally have sex. Liam, hit over the head by Adam, falls face down into the pool in \\"Deception, Jealousy, and Lies\\". ===Season three=== In \\"Guilt Trip to Alaska\\", Liam has been rescued but lies in a coma. Adam tries to kill Liam in the hospital, but is interrupted by Fallon. Ashley arrives, and when Liam wakes up, he does not remember Fallon. She pulls out all the stops to get Liam to remember her in \\"Caution Never Won a War\\", but his mother Laura does her best to thwart Fallon's efforts, including filing a restraining order against Fallon. Learning that Liam is marrying Ashley, Fallon attempts to restore Liam's memory in \\"Something Desperate\\" by having him read his original manuscript that details their relationship. He reads it and does not marry Ashley, but tells Fallon he still does not remember her, and wants to be on his own. Just as Fallon moves on from Liam with Evan in \\"Mother? I'm at La Mirage\\", Liam begins to remember their past together. He asks her to dinner, hoping to recover more memories, in \\"A Used Up Memory\\". Not wanting Liam to remember what Adam did to him, Adam arranges for Evan to see Fallon with Liam. A possessive Evan warns Liam to keep away from Fallon. Liam's memories return, and he and Fallon reunite. In \\"Shoot from the Hip\\", Fallon is worried that Liam will forget her again, and he is angry to discover she lied to him to keep him close. Fallon gives Liam free rein in writing an article about Blake's murder trial for her magazine in \\"The Sensational Blake Carrington Trial\\", but when he includes her own less-than-flattering courtroom performance, she trashes her own office and erases the article. Fallon realizes that Adam's sight has returned, and Liam remembers that it was Adam who hit him over the head. In the vineyard's barn, they struggle at the edge of the loft door. In \\"The Caviar, I Trust, Is Not Burned\\", Adam saves Liam from falling but then falls himself. Liam and Fallon fight and then reconcile when Fallon begins making life decisions without consulting him in \\"Battle Lines\\". ==Reception== Buczak noted that Liam has been a fan favorite since his very first appearance. Viginia Mendes of Ecos said that though Liam is a character original to the new series, he has \\"made such a huge impact in the present audience\\". ==References== Category:Dynasty (franchise) characters Category:Fictional writers Category:Male characters in television Category:Television characters introduced in 2018 ","title":"Liam Ridley"},{"id":"56924472","text":"Ira Nathaniel \\"Nate\\" Smith (born December 14, 1974) is an American drummer, songwriter, producer and three time Grammy nominee. == Life and career == Smith was born in Chesapeake, Virginia, and started playing drums at age 11, initially influenced by rock and funk music.

She studied painting and drawing before going on to run an Austin, TX architectural glass business, Renaissance Glass, starting in 1973. Stinsmuehlen-Amend studied with glass artists Narcissus Quagliata and Paul Marioni. Marioni invited her to be his assistant at Pilchuck in 1980. Stinsmuehlen-Amend has been a guest artist and lecturer at many schools, including Penland School of Crafts, Rhode Island School of Design, Rochester Institute of Technology, Tyler School of Art, North Lands Creative Glass (Scotland), and the Pilchuck Glass School (1980-1997). In addition, she served as the first female president of the board of directors of the Glass Art Society from 1984-1986. == About her work == Stinsmuehlen-Amend concentrated initially on experimental pieces that defied idealized standards of beauty, taste, form and pattern. She turned to working in glass because she felt it was more \\"exciting\\" to work with. She started creating her fragmented X series around 1978, in which she melded together a pastiche of colors and textures in a post-modern way. These pieces, fabricated with stained glass techniques, were meant to hang on walls, rather than as windows. As one of the few women working in studio glass at the time, her work also had feminist implications. The X was a symbol of how the artist wished to slash through the old, more staid ways of approaching glass. She crossed between the various methods for manipulating glass and incorporated other media into her assemblage-like pieces, using scraps of everyday material to give them texture, depth, and meaning. In the late 1990s, the structure of her work moved towards rectilinear, with diptychs and triptychs of contrasted figures and patterns. She broke her compositions down into split segments that were meant to be absorbed together despite being separated into individual panels. She integrated imagery and symbols to suggest narrative. More recently, Stinsmuehlen-Amend sandwiches individual glass planes of images on top of one another, giving them multi-dimensionality. In these layered wall panels the viewer is meant to see into the depth of the piece but not through it, as would be the case if these panes were acting as traditional windows or screens. == Selected Collections == * Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles, CA * Detroit Institute of the Arts, Detroit, MI * Museum of Arts and Design, New York, NY * The Corning Museum of Glass, Corning, NY * Oakland Museum of California, Oakland, CA * The Jewish Museum, New York, NY * The Renwick Gallery of the National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC * Leigh Yawkey Woodson Museum, Wausau, WI * Carnegie Art Museum, Oxnard, CA * Wagga Wagga City Art Gallery, New South Wales, Australia * Nishida Museum, Toyoma, Japan * Pilchuck Glass Center, Stanwood, WA * AT&T; Foundation Headquarters, New York, NY * AT&T; Collection, Dallas, TX * American Airlines Terminal, Dallas/Fort Worth Airport, TX * Veterans Administration Medical Center, Dallas, TX * The City of Los Angeles, Canoga Park, CA * The City of Los Angeles, Hollywood, CA * Christ Church Cathedral, Ashmun/Schweppe, Houston, TX * Davis, Wright & Jones, Seattle, WA * Ojai Valley Community Hospital, Ojai, CA * Marshall Fields Corporate Collection, Chicago, IL * Voss & Partner, TV-Ateliers, Düsseldorf, Germany == References == Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:Artists from Baltimore Category:People from Ojai, California Category:Indiana University Bloomington alumni Category:University of Texas at Austin alumni Category:Hood College alumni Category:20th-century American women artists Category:21st-century American women artists Category:Glass artists Category:Women glass artists ","title":"Susan Stinsmuehlen-Amend"},{"id":"56924507","text":"Hegra is a former municipality in the old Nord-Trøndelag county, Norway. The municipality existed from 1874 until its dissolution in 1962. The municipality was located in the Stjørdalen valley. It encompassed the eastern two-thirds of the what is now the municipality of Stjørdal in Trøndelag county. The administrative centre was the village of Hegra where the Hegra Church is located. ==History== The municipality of Hegra was established on 1 January 1874 when the old municipality of Øvre Stjørdal was divided into Meråker (population: 1,861) in the east and Hegra (population: 3,409) in the west. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1962, the neighboring municipalities of Hegra (population: 2,704), Lånke (population: 1,967), Skatval (population: 1,944), and Stjørdal (population: 6,204) were all merged to form a new, larger municipality of Stjørdal. ==Government== All municipalities in Norway, including Hegra, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elects a mayor. ===Municipal council=== The municipal council of Hegra was made up of 21 representatives that were elected to four year terms.

The temple was named \\"Bodhi Temple\\" by master Dengci (). The temple is named Puti (Bodhi) Temple because it has a big Bodhi tree. In the Yongzheng period (1723-1735), Yongzheng Emperor (1678-1735) inscribed a plaque with the Chinese characters \\"\\" ( means Buddhism lights illuminate everywhere) and bestowed it on the temple. In 1942, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese air force made an air strike on Mangshi, the temple was devastated by war and a fire consumed the Bodhi tree. In 1950, the temple was demolished in a fire. From 1953 to 1956, the local people rebuilt the temple. In 1978, the local government renovated the temple. ==ArchitectureMain Hall=== The main hall is a place-style roof wooden building is high and consists of three parts, namely the roof truss, roof ridge and hall pinnacle.

With business dealings mostly in the spheres of risk investment, financial development and property, his name appeared in leaked police documents known as the \\"mafia lists\\" in 2005, of a list of people suspected of involvement in organized crime and their vehicles, for use of police patrols. Since 10 December 2019 he has been included in the global Magnitsky sanctions list. On 27 February 2020, Kočner was sentenced to 19 years in prison for forging $75 million worth of promissory notes to siphon money from Markíza. He was acquitted in a separate high-profile case related to the murder of investigative journalist Jan Kuciak and his fiancée Martina Kusnirova, a crime which triggered a significant political crisis in Slovakia. == Gamatex and TV Markíza == Kočner first became known to the public through his attempt to take over TV Markíza in 1998. TV Markíza, one of the first private television channels in Slovakia, was founded by Pavol Rusko and Sylvia Volzová in partnership with CME Media Enterprises B.V. in 1996. Initially the channel was not granted a broadcasting license, as the licensing board objected that Rusko did not disclose Volzová as a co-owner. Rusko entered into an agreement with Espé štúdio, a company owned by Siloš Pohanka, to pay 3 million DEM in exchange for help getting a broadcasting license for Markíza. When the membership of the licensing board later changed, Markíza secured a broadcasting license, and launched on 31 August 1996. However Rusko declared the agreement with Espé štúdio invalid, arguing that Markíza had acquired the license without Pohanka's help. After unsuccessful attempts at getting money from Rusko, Pohanka sold his claim to Gamatex, a company owned by Kočner, who persuaded Volzová to acknowledge the claim and began court proceedings to have the claim paid out. In August 1998 Kočner appeared at the Markíza offices with a court order giving him control over the TV station. When negotiations with Rusko regarding the ownership dispute failed, Kočner occupied the TV station with hired private security and fired the TV channel's top managers. The move sparked public protests, coming only 10 days before parliamentary elections; at that time TV Markíza was the main news outlet opposing the government of Vladimír Mečiar, and the attempted takeover was seen as an attack on press freedom. Several thousand protesters gathered in front of Markíza's offices to oppose the takeover, and several opposition politicians spoke at the rally. After two days, Kočner and his associates left the building, and the ownership dispute continued in court. According to news reports, Kočner's involvement in TV Markíza seemed to end in 2000 when Rusko bought Gamatex through intermediaries. In a 2006 interview with aktualne.sk (not to be confused with aktuality.sk) Kočner said the security firm involved in the takeover of Markíza belonged to Peter Čongrády, a local mafia boss. However, in later interviews he denied hiring Čongrády. In June 2016 Kočner's company \\"Správa a inkaso zmeniek\\" initiated court proceedings against Rusko and Markíza to collect money owed to him under four promissory notes amounting to around €69 million. Kočner claimed that Rusko had issued the promissory notes in June 2000 with Markíza providing endorsement for the notes. At the time Rusko was the executive director of TV Markíza as well as one of its shareholders. Two of those notes amounted to €8.3 million each with a maturity date in 2015 and another two were signed as \\"blank cheques\\" in the amount of €26 million with a maturity date in 2016 added later. Rusko acknowledged Kočner's claim in court and declared that the promissory notes were intended to resolve the ownership dispute with Gamatex. Markíza's management was unaware of the existence of the promissory notes. They were not recorded in either company's accounting and were not discovered during the preparation of the due diligence report when CME became the sole shareholder in TV Markíza. In April 2018 a court declared Kočner's claim as valid. However, in retaliation TV Markíza filed a criminal complaint against Kočner and Rusko for forging the promissory notes. In addition, an investigation into possible tax evasion began as, by not disclosing possession of the promissory notes to tax authorities, Kočner's companies avoided paying tax on interest on the notes. In June 2018, Kočner was detained by the Slovak authorities in the case of the promissory notes forgery together with Pavol Rusko, as well as for various tax-related crimes. On 27 February 2020, Kocner was sentenced to 19 years of jail for forging $75 million worth of promissory notes to siphon money from Markiza. ==Murder of Ján Kuciak== Kočner's business practices were a prominent topic of articles by Ján Kuciak, an investigative journalist from Aktuality.sk, who was murdered in February 2018 along with his fiancée, Martina Kusnirova. A couple of months prior to Kuciak's death, Kočner allegedly threatened in a phone call to \\"dig up dirt\\" on Kuciak, saying \\"I will focus especially on you, your mother, your father, on your siblings\\". Kuciak filed a criminal complaint but a subsequent police investigation concluded that Kočner's alleged statements did not constitute a criminal offence. After Kuciak's murder, general prosecutor Jaromír Čižnár ordered the case to be reopened. However police again closed the case concluding that Kočner's statements did not constitute a criminal offence. Aktuality.sk subsequently published a transcript of the phone call between Kuciak and Kočner. On 4 October 2018, Kočner was named by entrepreneur Zoltán Andruskó as the person who ordered Kuciak's death. Andruskó had been taken into custody on 30 September for his part in the murder, and was co- operating with police. On 8 March 2019 Kočner was charged with having ordered Kuciak's murder. The trial of Marián Kočner and three other defendants, including Alena Zsuzsová, the mother of his goddaughter, began on 13 January 2020.Vražda Jána Kuciaka a Martiny Kušnírovej: Súd prijal obžalobu, hlavné pojednávanie sa začne 13. januára The 2016 murder of Peter Molnár, a businessman from Kolárovo, was included in the case. On the first day of the trial, co-defendant Miroslav Marček confessed to killing Kuciak and Kušnírová, and also admitted to killing Molnár during a violent burglary in 2016. On the second day of the trial, Andruskó testified against all four defendants. On 6 April 2020, Marček was sentenced to 23 years in prison. The prosecutor appealed against the sentence. ==References== Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:Slovak businesspeople Category:People sanctioned under the Magnitsky Act Category:Slovak criminals ","title":"Marián Kočner"},{"id":"56924968","text":"Charles Georges Van Antwerpen (born 10 June 1925) was a Belgian rower.

He would be recruited by Leeds United manager Frank Buckley in 1948 as he strove to rebuild the team post-war. McAdam would start strongly, playing 20 consecutive games for Leeds United before suffering a cartilage injury in a match against Blackburn Rovers on 29 January 1949 which ruled him out of the rest of the 1948–49 season. However post-injury, he lost his first team place and moved to Wrexham in 1950, where he spent a season and made 10 appearances. After Wrexham he would spend a total of 14 years in non-league football, spending a decade at Burton Albion and 4 years at Matlock Town. ==Death== McAdam died on 18 April 2017 at the age of 94 after years spent in a nursing home. ==References== Category:1923 births Category:2017 deaths Category:English footballers Category:English Football League players Category:Stapenhill F.C. players Category:Leeds United F.C. players Category:Wrexham A.F.C. players Category:Burton Albion F.C. players Category:Matlock Town F.C. players Category:Association football wing halves ","title":"David McAdam"},{"id":"56925259","text":"The Spanish Athletics Championships () is an annual outdoor track and field competition organised by the Royal Spanish Athletics Federation (RFEA), which serves as the Spanish national championship for the sport. It is typically held as a two-day event in the Spanish summer around late June to early August. The venue of the championships is decided on an annual basis. The competition was first held in 1917 as a men's only competition. A separate women's began in 1931 but, following the onset of the Spanish Civil War, this was cancelled after 1935 and it was not until 1963 that women events were added alongside the men's programme.Spanish Championships. GBR Athletics. Retrieved 2018-03-23. This made Spain the last large European country to provide a national championship for women in the sport and female participation in sport in general in Spain was low due to a lack of physical education, facilities and funding for women's sport. This stemmed from the policy of National Catholicism, which saw women's place as caregivers and physical feats by them as a challenge to morality.Spanish female athletes: From obscurity to stardom in just 25 years.

The modern event is used for the Spanish international selection for major athletics events, including the Olympic Games, World Championships in Athletics and European Athletics Championships. ==Events== On the current programme a total of 38 individual Spanish Championship athletics events are contested, divided evenly between men and women. For each of the sexes, there are six track running events, three obstacle events, four jumps, four throws, and two relays. ;Track running *100 metres, 200 metres, 400 metres, 800 metres, 1500 metres, 5000 metres ;Obstacle events *100 metres hurdles (women only), 110 metres hurdles (men only), 400 metres hurdles, 3000 metres steeplechase ;Jumping events *Pole vault, high jump, long jump, triple jump ;Throwing events *Shot put, discus throw, javelin throw, hammer throw ;Relays *4 × 100 metres relay, 4 × 400 metres relay A men's barra vasca competition was held up to 1963 – the event being a variation of the javelin throw, but the spear was thrown by a technique of spinning while holding it at the hip. This was banned to preserve public safety, as a result of errant throws.Saksalaisheittäjälle huima keihäskaari – mutta Suomessa heitettiin 99,25 metriä jo 60 vuotta sitten .

In spite of the prevention of women for competing at the national championships for such a long period, the women's programme subsequently expanded in line with international developments. The first addition was a women's pentathlon in 1965 (later being replaced by the heptathlon in 1981). A women's 1500 m was added in 1969, a 3000 metres in 1974 (held until 1994), a 5000 m in 1982, then a 10,000 m in 1984. The women's 80 metres hurdles was extended to the 100 m distance in 1969 and the 400 m hurdles emerged in 1977. A women's 5000 m track walk was first featured in 1982 and extended to the full 10,000 m distance in 1990. The field events programme expanded in the 1990s, with the addition of the triple jump in 1990, pole vault in 1994, and hammer throw in 1995. Women finally achieved parity with men in the track and field programme with the addition of the steeplechase in 2001. Spanish championships in 10K run, half marathon, marathon, 100 kilometres run, cross country running, mountain running and road walking are held separately from the main track and field championships. There is also a Spanish Athletics Club Championships for athletics clubs, which was first held in 1958 for men and 1966 for women.Historial y Campeones - Campeonato de España de Clubes. RFEA.

Written by Ross Golan and its producers Puth and Johan Carlsson, it debuted during Puth's performance at March for Our Lives, and was released commercially for digital download on March 26, 2018, as a single from his second studio album, Voicenotes (2018). ==Background== Puth first revealed the song in an interview with Zane Lowe on his Beats 1 radio show. \\"This song is called 'Change' and I'm actually gonna play it, they're doing March for Our Lives this Saturday downtown. I know nobody knows this song and James won't be there with me but I'm just gonna be on my piano. That's the right song [to play at the right moment] and I think people will understand when they hear it.\\" Talking about how he got in touch with Taylor, Puth said that his friend Miles Beard set the collaboration up. He stated on Twitter that the song is \\"dedicated to all of the Parkland students, any lives lost to senseless gun violence, and the world\\", alongside single cover, which features a dark blue backdrop. \\"It wasn't written for [March for Our Lives] specifically. I wrote it a year prior. I don't really know why I wrote it, but now I know why. It just happened to catch up a year late,\\" Puth told Women's Wear Daily. He also opened up about the song during an Instagram live chat, saying: \\"It's about everybody, as humans we all help each other and that song came about through collaboration. This is the most important song I ever wrote.\\" Taylor admired Puth in a statement, saying: \\"Mr. Puth and I spent an excellent afternoon at Conway Studios in Hollywood this past January. It was a delight to work with such a gifted fellow musician and I'm so excited to finally see the release of the finished piece.\\" Puth added: \\"Recording with James Taylor was a dream come true. He's the reason why I write music and it was an absolute honour to work with him.\\" ==Composition== Described as a \\"smooth, acoustic-guitar driven tune\\", the folk pop and soft rock song consists of \\"light pop melodies\\" and \\"a loose, stripped-back guitar arrangement\\". Abby Jones of Billboard noted that \\"the soft, folksy ambience of the track is reminiscent of Taylor's signature sound, made famous in the '70s — however, the lyrics are very much 2018\\". As the song ends, it \\"evolves into this homage to 1990s rock and R&B;, with heavy bass and rhythmic drums\\". Lyrically, the song urges people to change their attitudes in order to eliminate division and hatred. ==Critical reception== Scott Sterling of CBS Radio opined the two artists' \\"distinctive voices meshing beautifully over the warm track\\", writing that it is \\"far more reflective of classic James Taylor than anything on the current pop charts, and benefits mightily from the simple arrangement\\". Adreon Patterson of Paste complimented Taylor's ability to \\"create the ethereal mood the song evokes\\" with his \\"light baritone vocals\\", calling the song \\"a forgotten Taylor track from his '70s heyday\\". ==Live performances== On March 24, 2018, Puth premiered the song during his performance at March for Our Lives in Los Angeles. \\"There's such a theme of change happening,\\" he introduced the song before performing it alone on the keyboard. \\"This song...you don't know it and it's totally fine. It just feels like the right song to perform right now.\\" The live recording was later released as the official video, interspersed with footage from the event. ==Charts== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\"  - ! scope=\\"col\\" Chart (2018) ! scope=\\"col\\" Peak position - ! scope=\\"row\\" Sweden Heatseeker (Sverigetopplistan)  14 } ==ReferencesCategory:2018 singles Category:2018 songs Category:American folk songs Category:American soft rock songs Category:Atlantic Records singles Category:Charlie Puth songs Category:James Taylor songs Category:Songs written by Charlie Puth Category:Songs written by Ross Golan Category:Vocal duets Category:Songs written by Johan Carlsson (musician) ","title":"Change (Charlie Puth song)"},{"id":"56925285","text":"Peck's Bad Boy is a 1921 American silent comedy film directed by Sam Wood and starring Jackie Coogan, Wheeler Oakman, Doris May, Raymond Hatton, James Corrigan, and Lillian Leighton.

This lake extends in the cantons of Le May, Evanturel, Myrand, Achintre and Sulte. Following the erection completed in 1948 of the Gouin dam, the current shape of the \\"Lac Bureau\\" was shaped by the raising of the waters of the Gouin reservoir. The water level varies significantly, being dependent on the water management of the Gouin Dam erected in 1948. Recreotourism activities are the main economic activity of the sector. Forestry comes second. The route 404 serves the Oskélanéo River Valley and South Zone of South Bay of Bureau Lake. A forest road branch serves the west side of the latter bay. The surface of Lake Bureau is usually frozen from mid-November to the end of April, however, safe ice circulation is generally from early December to the end of March. == Geography Toponymy== A map dating from 1924 has three distinct water bodies, not connected to each other, on the site of the present Lake Bureau. The gradual raising of water, caused by the creation of the Gouin Reservoir in 1948, led to the merger of the Great South Lake and the lakes of the North and East, creating a new lake entity. This hydronym which has been official since 1935, evokes the work of life of Joseph Bureau (1837-1914). Born in L'Ancienne-Lorette, in the suburbs of Quebec City, this explorer-cartographer has greatly contributed to pushing back the frontiers of Quebec topographic knowledge by traversing it in all directions, from Labrador at Outaouais and St. Lawrence River at Hudson Bay. His services were retained in particular in 1870 to establish the best route for the construction of a railway to the Lac Saint-Jean and Mauricie. The following year, it goes back with John Bignell the Saint-Maurice to its source, the \\"lake of the Male\\", now integrated into Gouin reservoir. In 1872, Bureau agreed to direct the maneuver floating logs on this river. For a long time associated with the cure Labelle for the opening of territories favorable to the colonization of the north, it is interested then with the establishment of a railway since Quebec (city) as far as the Atlantic coast, then explores a large part of the Côte-Nord. Until the end of his life, Joseph Bureau remained active. Lake Bureau also bears the name Attikamek Opiskaw Sakahikan, High Lake.Source: Names and Places of Quebec, a work of the Commission de toponymie du Québec, published in 1994 and 1996 in the form of a dictionary illustrated printed, and under that of a CD- ROM made by the company Micro-Intel, in 1997, from this dictionary.

BritishTheatre.com: \\"Sams and Hudson have done an excellent job of adapting this work for the stage, inventing and re-inventing parts of Wodehouse’s original wheel. The dialogue is snappy and effervescent, and the tone light and supple throughout. There might be a tad too much emphasis on George’s artistic angst than is strictly necessary or properly explained, but that does not really get in the way of the roller coaster of frivolity that the duo has here penned.\\" The Stage: \\"In an age of metamusicals from The Producers to the current Broadway hit Something Rotten, which offer their own ironic commentaries on the genre itself, A Damsel in Distress is both blissfully affectionate yet never affected as a young Broadway composer (Richard Fleeshman) and a British socialite (Summer Strallen) are set on an tangled but inevitable course towards each other in a dizzying, but always sincere, series of romantic collisions. Rob Ashford directs and choreographs an absolutely luxurious cast that includes hilarious turns from Richard Dempsey, Isla Blair and Desmond Barrit, and the brassily brilliant Sally Ann Triplett as the leading showgirl.\\" The Telegraph: \\"While complex characterization was perhaps not one of Wodehouse’s main preoccupations (there are several sour little quips around George’s desire to create serious, incomprehensible 'art', rather than mere shallow, enjoyable 'entertainment'), both Summer Strallen as Maud and Richard Fleeshman as George bring a sparky edge to their obstacle-filled romance, while the late-blooming love between Nicholas Farrell as Lord Marshmoreton, who always wanted to marry a showgirl, and Sally Ann Triplett as the girl of his dreams, equally at home on the stage or in the pigsty, is genuinely touching.\\" ==References== Category:2015 musicals Category:Musicals based on novels Category:British musicals Category:Adaptations of works by P.

She was the daughter of William and Susan Maritta (Austin) Read. Her father, Rev. Read, was a Baptist clergyman. She came from old colonial families on both sides, and her ancestors were among the early English pioneers. Until six years of age, her home was in Massachusetts. In 1859, her parents moved to the seacoast of Maine, where they lived till 1865, at that time returning to Massachusetts. Her literary taste began early to be developed in her home, where she was wont to listen absorbed to the reading of history, travels, and The Poetical Works Of Sir Walter Scott, when too young to enjoy reading them alone. During her school life, and subsequently, her love of poetry increased year by year. She studied at Newell's Private School, Wilbraham, Massachusetts; Burnett's English Classical Institute, Springfield, Waterville, Maine; and in the Coburn Classical Institute, in Waterville, Maine, for several years, though ill health compelled her to leave during the last year of her course, without graduating. Her classical instruction included art under Childe Hassam, John Joseph Enneking, Emil Carlsen, and others. ==Career== Read began to publish her poems in 1874, in various magazines and newspapers, and in 1887, she published a volume of verse entitled Between the Centuries, and Other Poems. She contributed, among others, to the Magazine of Poetry. Besides her poetical work, she was an artist of marked talent, and made a specialty of portraits and animal pictures in oil colors. She taught languages, mathematics and other branches until about 1885. She also taught drawing, painting and sketching from nature in various towns of Massachusetts for fifteen years. ==Personal life== Read was a Baptist, and a woman of broad views, liberal culture and versatility. Her home was in Coldbrook Springs, Massachusetts, where her father was in charge of a church. Later, she resided in Still River, Massachusetts. ==Style and themes== Much of Read's poetry was of the introspective kind, with a strong element of the religious and the sentimental. Having been presented with a copy of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poems, for months, it was her constant companion, the more so because the state of her health prevented her from mingling with others outside of her home. Many of the poems she read and re-read until she could easily repeat them, and all became quite familiar. These gave impulse and shaping to her native poetic tendencies. In one of them she read: :'O thou sculptor, painter, poet, :Take this lesson to thy heart — :That is best which lieth nearest — :Shape (rum that thy work of art.\\" This she accepted as a great truth, and in her writing, Read looked within her own heart for the lessons reflected there from nature. A close and sympathetic observer of nature, almost every phase of it had a voice for her. Brought up in a family where she was forced to see the burdens of others, she also wrote for \\"burden-bearers\\", and sought to show the brighter side to those whose lives had difficulties. Thus, many of her poems were luminous with the calmness of her own Christian faith. ==Selected works== * Between the centuries and other poems, 1887 ==ReferencesAttribution=== * * * ==External links== * Category:1853 births Category:19th-century American painters Category:19th-century American poets Category:19th-century American women writers Category:People from Barnstable, Massachusetts Category:Writers from Massachusetts Category:Painters from Massachusetts Category:American women painters Category:American women poets Category:Educators from Massachusetts Category:19th-century American educators Category:Year of death missing Category:19th-century American women artists Category:Wikipedia articles incorporating text from A Woman of the Century Category:19th-century women educators ","title":"Jane Maria Read"},{"id":"56925515","text":"Good Feeling is the fourteenth solo studio album by the English singer- songwriter Paul Carrack.

Similarly, a Bishop Bruno II was once considered Albrecht's successor, but Machatschek also showed that Bruno was an error, and that Albrecht's direct successor was Gerung. ==Life== Albrecht I is not extensively documented. He was supposedly from a family of the Sorbian nobility. Before his elevation to the bishopric he was a cathedral provost. Otto von Freising mentions Albrecht in 1151 in connection with the dispute between Friedrich II of Berg and Herman van Horne over the office of bishop of Utrecht. With the agreement of the Pope, the bishopric of Meissen, like that of Naumburg, was under the protection of Burggraf Conrad I of Meissen, in return for which the bishops were expected to undertake appropriate tasks from time to time. At the beginning of 1152 Conrad III entrusted Albrecht, who had the reputation of being talented at languages, with a diplomatic mission to the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos. The bishop died either on the way to Constantinople or in the city itself. ==References Literature == * Eduard Machatschek: Geschichte der Bischöfe des Hochstiftes Meissen in chronologischer Reihenfolge (...), pp. 116–120.

The hospital is expected to take two years to construct. The private developers who are constructing the hospital will operate it for ten years, then turn it over to the government of Uganda, in a public-private partnership arrangement. ==Location== The facility is located off of the Kampala–Entebbe Road, in Lubowa, Wakiso District, in the Central Region, of Uganda, approximately , by road, south-west of Kampala, the largest city and capital of Uganda. The hospital would sit on approximately , of land, formerly occupied by a coffee plantation. ==Overview== The ISHU is a specialized referral, tertiary treatment, research, and teaching hospital, which is intended to treat patients travelling out of the country to seek specialized medical care. In 2017, it was estimated that Ugandan patients spent an estimated US$186 million on medical treatment abroad. On 1 June 2017, the president of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni, performed the groundbreaking ceremony for the hospital. The development, designed by the architectural firm of Progetto CMR, of Milan, Italy, consists of nine buildings. These include the 260+ bed hospital, an outpatient department to handle 100 outpatients daily, housing for doctors, nurses and support staff, conference facilities, at least one hotel and a shopping centre. The hospital is expected to cover a wide range of medical and surgical conditions, including organ transplants, neurosurgical operations, various cancers and orthopedic surgery and cardiac operations and treatments. The hospital design involves the installation of solar panels on the roofs of the buildings, to generate electricity and reduce the power purchased from the national grid. The design also involves the installation of rain-water harvesting systems, to reduce the amount of water purchased from the National Water and Sewerage Corporation. ==International collaboration== The lead contractor for this development is Finasi Italy. Funding for the US$250 million construction is provided by \\"global financial institutions\\". Following completion, a 10-year operation period will be accorded to the developers, who will then turn the hospital over to the Ugandan government. The facility is expected to attract referrals from the countries of the African Great Lakes region. In September 2018, the Daily Monitor reported that the Ugandan Cabinet had resolved to ban the use of public funds to treat government officials and politicians at foreign medical facilities, once this hospital is completed. This will save government an estimated US$7–10 million every year. ==Parliamentary approval== In March 2019, the Parliament of Uganda approved a government guarantee of US$379.7 million (USh1.3 trillion) to construct this hospital. A consortium comprising Finasi of Italy and ROKO Construction Limited of Uganda, was selected to construct the hospital. The facility will include an 80-bed cancer centre. ==See also== * Hospitals in Uganda ==References * President Yoweri Musveni Flags Off Construction of International Specialized Hospital of Uganda * HEALTH Museveni to Commission Specialised Referral Hospital in Lubowa Category:Medical research institutes in Uganda Category:Buildings and structures in Uganda Category:Hospitals in Uganda Category:Proposed infrastructure in Uganda ","title":"International Specialized Hospital of Uganda"},{"id":"56925584","text":"Lawrence Casper Boles (September 9, 1883 – August 19, 1945) was an American college football player and coach.

It is executed prior to college football games as one of the rituals engaging the audience's consent for the athletic contest that follows. It is distinct from the gymnastics maneuver of the same name. ==Cultural significance== The drum major of the Ohio State University performs a backbend in 2016. The Oklahoma University drum major performs \\"the strut\\", a modified version of a drum major backbend involving a partial inversion while in motion. Folklorist Danille Lindquist has described the drum major backbend, and the audience reaction that accompanies it in the form of cheering and applause, as part of a series of rituals associated with college football designed to seek and elicit popular consent for the staging of the athletic contest that follows. ==Use== Drum major backbends are executed by bending the body backwards to be parallel to the ground and at a low enough depth so as to touch the top of the headgear to the field, without the knees also touching. They are particularly associated with marching bands of historically black colleges and universities (HBCU), but are also widely performed elsewhere. The Ohio State University Marching Band (OSUMB) began executing a drum major backbend in the late 1950s with Lenny Hart being the first such person to do so. In 2016, OSUMB drum major Nate MacMaster described the backbend to Rolling Stone as the \\"most crucial moment\\" of game day. In the 1960s, the drum major of the University of Michigan Marching Band began performing a backbend, which was modified to a more elaborate backbend in 1993 by then drum major Matthew Pickus. This later version was achieved by removing the busby, thereby forcing an inversion of the spine so that the head comes into direct contact with the ground. According to the University of Michigan, Pickus began removing his busby after a fan criticized the depth of one of his previous backbends. In addition to HBCUs, Ohio State University, and the University of Michigan, other marching bands whose drum majors perform a backbend include the University of Illinois Marching Illini, the University of Minnesota, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Iowa, Michigan State University, Indiana University, the University of California, Berkeley, the University of Cincinnati, and others. ===OU \\"strut\\"=== The drum major of the University of Oklahoma (OU) uses a highly modified backbend that involves only a partial inversion of the torso, held in place while simultaneously executing an elongated and affected fast walk across the field, known as \\"the strut\\". According to an OU drum major, up until 1984 \\"the strut\\" would be performed with a complete inversion so that the head touched the field. ==GallerySee also== * The ludi and munus, a performance preceding gladiator contests in Rome * Texas dip, a form of public prostration performed by debutantes in Texas ==References * The University of Michigan backbend, performed without busby Category:Gestures of respect ","title":"Drum major backbend"},{"id":"56925701","text":"Lithocarpus hatusimae is a tree in the beech family Fagaceae.

The album is lauded as the first Chinese metal album, combining heavy metal and progressive rock with traditional Chinese folk styles, poetry, and Beijing opera vocal techniques. == Background == Tang Dynasty was officially formed in February 1989 by Americans Kaiser Kuo (guitar) and Andrew Szabo (drums), along with Beijing musicians Ding Wu (guitar) and Zhang Ju (bass). However, the Tiananmen Square Protests forced Kuo and Szabo to leave China. The band went on hiatus, and Ding Wu moved to Xinjiang for several months. In October, Ding Wu returned to Beijing, and together with Zhang Ju recruited \\"lightning-fast\\" guitarist Liu Yijun and drummer Zhao Nian. On May 1st, 1990, the new lineup participated in a fundraising concert for the 1990 Asian Games, playing in front of 100,000 people at the Workers' Stadium. The success of the concert led the band to be signed by Magic Stone Records (Chinese: 魔石唱片; pinyin: Móshí Chàngpīan), the fledgling mainland division of Taiwan-based label Rock Records (Chinese: 滚石唱片; pinyin: Gŭnshí Chàngpīan, lit. \\"Rolling Stone Records\\") specializing in Chinese rock acts. == Recording and release == Recording took place in the second floor studio of the China National Radio headquarters in Xicheng, over a 44-day period, from September through October 1991. Founding guitarist Kaiser Kuo briefly returned in May to record some demos with the band, but left again for the United States before sessions formally began in order to complete graduate school. Bassist Zhang Ju had also been singing lead since Kuo's departure, but Kuo insisted that Ding Wu be designated lead vocalist instead, thereby cementing Ding's position as Tang Dynasty's frontman. According to Ding Wu, a significant portion of the songs' melodies were not established until recording was underway, although he later clarified that the band had completed most of the instrumentals before entering the studio. The album was engineered by Wang \\"Lao Ge (Chinese: 老哥; lit. 'Old Brother')\\" Xiaobo (Chinese: 王昕波; not to be confused with writer and essayist Wang Xiaobo), who had worked on Cui Jian's Rock 'n' Roll on the New Long March and Black Panther's debut album. It was also the first album by a mainland Chinese band to be produced by Jia Minshu, who would go on to record other notable Beijing artists for the Magic Stone label. Jia recalled the making of Tang Dynasty as an intensive, around-the-clock process, and that an armed guard was stationed outside the studio as they worked. Despite having never worked with a rock band before, Jia noted the ease with which he and the band members could communicate musical ideas, which streamlined the otherwise stressful undertaking. Tang Dynasty was released domestically in December 1991. Magic Stone Records spent the next year launching a massive overseas marketing campaign, securing the band a following in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore.Five high-budget music videos for \\"A Dream Return to Tang Dynasty\\", \\"The Sun\\", \\"9/4\\", \\"Choice\\", and \\"Moon Dreams\\" were shot and released. As Kuo noted, \\"Nothing like that had ever been done for a Chinese band.\\" The international version was released on December 11, 1992 in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, and Southeast Asia. == Composition == Numerous and eclectic influences can be heard on Tang Dynasty. Frontman Ding Wu was a founding member of seminal Chinese bands Budaoweng and Black Panther, while Kaiser Kuo introduced the band to progressive rock acts such as Rush, Genesis, and King Crimson. Early on, the band strived to create music that was distinctly and authentically Chinese, even while working within a Western musical idiom. Kuo justified this approach by pointing out that in addition to being considered the pinnacle of Chinese civilization, Tang-era China - for which the band was named - was decidedly cosmopolitan and open to other cultures and ideas. \\"A Dream Return to Tang Dynasty\\" begins with some textural Chinese instrumentation before transitioning into a powerful introduction. Ding Wu's high-pitched vocal delivery, drawing influences from Beijing Opera, can be heard on the song's bridge, which features lyrics drawn from works by poets Du Fu and Fang Gan. \\"The Sun\\" is built around a modal riff heavily reminiscent of Xinjiangnese folk music, augmented by Middle Eastern percussion and ethereal backing vocals, before going into an anthemic half-time chorus. \\"The Moon Hangs High\\" is an gentle ballad that features prominent acoustic guitar and Chinese woodwinds. These songs coexist alongside more Western- sounding heavy metal songs such as \\"Paradise\\", \\"Dream of the Doomsday\\" and \\"Don't Go Hiding\\". Progressive elements are prevalent throughout the album. \\"Nine Rhythm\\" is named for the time signature on the song's verses, and begins with a guitar introduction in 13/8 time. The band makes heavy use of harmonic modulation, as heard on tracks such as \\"Choice\\", \\"Soaring Bird\\", and \\"Legend\\". Several tracks feature multiple guitar solos, played by both Liu Yijun and Ding Wu. The band's cover of the Internationale was a last-minute addition by Kuo while they were recording demos in July 1991. The song had been omitted from the domestic tracklisting for political reasons, but was later included on the international version as well as on subsequent reissues. Lyrically and thematically, the band was heavily inspired by ancient Chinese martial traditions, via classic Chinese novels such as Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and wuxia films. Kuo characterized Tang China as \\"period of high heroics\\", stating that it worked well in the context of metal music. The band wrote its lyrics in a voice reminiscent of classic Chinese poetry, going as far as to incorporate actual lines from Tang-era poems. Scholar Cynthia Wong noted that the band's poetic lyricism juxtaposed with loud, aggressive musicianship was consistent with the ancient Chinese concepts of wén (文; intellect) and wŭ (武; martial ability) respectively, and how \\"ideal men\\" were expected to possess a balance of the two. The characterization of the band members as \\"warrior- poets\\" was furthered by the album cover, the accompanying music videos, and Magic Stone's press release emphasizing the \\"self-confidence of the Chinese\\". == Reception and legacy == Tang Dynasty is generally cited as China's first heavy metal album. It was \\"an unprecedented success\\" upon its release. As Kaiser Kuo recalled, the album \\"went absolutely crazy\\" by 1993, despite not receiving radio play and became a bestseller in Taiwan. Total recorded sales vary from source to source, ranging from 900,000 to over 2 million legal copies, with countless other pirated versions. Liu Yijun was labeled \\"hands- down the best guitarist in China\\" by Spin, and subsequently became China's first guitar hero. \\"A Dream Return to Tang Dynasty\\" received some minor airplay outside of China, and its accompanying music video was nominated for MTV Asia's International Viewers Choice Awards in 1993. Following Tang Dynasty’s lead, numerous Chinese metal bands, such as Overload and Tomahawk, were established, and the Chinese metal scene diverged into various subgenres as the decade progressed. Zhang Fan, president of Beijing's Midi School of Music, revealed in the 2007 documentary Global Metal that \\"80% of Chinese youth came to know metal music by listening to Tang Dynasty.\\" Tang Dynasty was noted for its glorification of ancient China. Author Facai Guo noted the album's successful fusion of \\"tradition and reality\\", and declared the band to be the \\"insurrectionist of Chinese contemporary culture”. Indeed, many saw Tang Dynasty's music as a reaction to both the polished, commercial sound of Hong Kong pop (gangtai), and the simple, strophic revolutionary songs pushed by the Communist Party. Critic Zai Dao praised the band, saying \\"They express in their own way a longing for a strong and influential China: a return to Tang Dynasty.\\" Beijing-based journalist Stephen Schwankert, speaking of the album, observed that \\"Tang Dynasty produced music that looked and sounded like what Chinese people thought rock should be.\\" Although Tang Dynasty was slated for a follow-up release in 1995, internal problems culminating with Zhang's death in a motorcycle accident on May 11 and Liu's subsequent departure the following year put the band on an indefinite hiatus. The band's second album, Epic, would not be released until 1998. == Tracklisting == In late 2008, Beijing-based label Jingwen Records reissued the album, including \\"The Internationale\\" as well as a DVD containing the five music videos off the album. == Personnel == Personnel as listed in the album's liner notes are: Tang Dynasty *Ding Wu - lead vocals; guitar * Liu Yijun - guitar *Zhang Ju - bass; backing vocals; lead vocals on \\"Legend\\"; co-lead vocals on \\"The Internationale\\" * Zhao Nian - drums Additional musicians * Qin Qi - lead vocals on \\"Dream of the Doomsday\\" *Luan Shu - additional background vocals * Chen Jianwei - keyboards *Ubli Qasim - additional percussion on \\"The Sun\\" *Chinese People's Chorus - choir on \\"The Internationale\\" Production * Jia Minshu - production; additional arrangements *Zhang Peiren - supervision *Wang Xiaobo - engineer *Yan Zhongkun - mixing *Bernie Grundman - mastering == See also == * Chinese rock *Chinese heavy metal == References == Category:1992 debut albums Category:Tang Dynasty (band) albums ","title":"Tang Dynasty (album)"},{"id":"56925821","text":"The John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital was a teaching hospital on the campus of the Tuskegee Institute in Tuskegee, Alabama, open from 1892 to 1987. ==History== The John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital was originally established in 1892 as the Tuskegee Institute Hospital and Nurse Training School. Its original purpose was to train nursing students and provide care for faculty members at the Tuskegee Institute. When it was founded, it was the first black hospital in Alabama. When it was founded, it did not have an outpatient clinic, and instead only provided emergency services within its Tuskegee building. Unlike most other American hospitals of the day, it practiced outreach to surrounding communities through decentralized clinics in rural areas, and most patients received care at these clinics rather than at the hospital itself. In 1902, John A. Kenney Sr. was appointed its director, after which the hospital increased in size and expanded its reach to the entire surrounding community. After being given to the Tuskegee Institute in 1911, it was dedicated on February 21, 1913, as a result of which it was renamed. It was rebuilt using money donated by the wife of Charles E. Mason, a trustee of the Tuskegee Institute. It was named after Mrs. Mason's grandfather, former Massachusetts governor John Albion Andrew. In a 1919 article in the Nation's Health, Kinney described the hospital as \\"a modern, up-to-date, well- appointed, two-story brick building, with accommodations for sixty patients with no crowding, and for a good many more when it is necessary.\\" The Tuskegee Syphilis Study took place at the hospital, thanks to the approval of both Eugene Dibble (then the hospital's medical director) and Robert R. Moton (then the president of the Tuskegee Institute). The hospital closed in 1987, after its resources were exhausted by an excess of charity cases. When it closed, it was the last black hospital in Alabama. It was later reopened as the National Center for Bioethics in Research and Healthcare in January 1999. ==Influence== During the pre-civil rights era, John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital served as a center for black physicians in the Deep South to receive postgraduate training, and for black patients to receive care. According to Montague Cobb, it was one of only five first-rate hospitals in the pre-1940s South that treated black patients. Because so few other nearby hospitals would accept black patients, it \\"became the medical center for Alabama blacks\\", as a 1995 Baltimore Sun article noted. ==References * Category:Teaching hospitals in Alabama Category:Hospitals established in 1892 Category:Hospitals disestablished in 1987 Category:1892 establishments in Alabama Category:1987 disestablishments in Alabama ","title":"John A.

He uses the online name Count Dankula. Meechan received press coverage when he posted a satirical video as his girlfriend mentioned how cute her dog was, so he made a video where he \\"would turn him into the least cute thing that I could think of, which is, a nazi\\". The video showed him teaching his girlfriend's dog how to raise its paw in the manner of a Nazi salute, and to react to the phrase \\"Do you wanna gas the Jews?\\" Meechan was arrested and convicted of being \\"grossly offensive\\" under the Communications Act 2003, following a trial in March 2018. The arrest generated controversy and discussions about free speech. In April 2018, Meechan was fined £800. Meechan stated he would not pay the fine, and instead donated £800 to the Glasgow Children's Hospital Charity. In March 2019, the money was seized from his bank account by an arrestment order. == Arrest == In April 2016, Meechan posted a video on YouTube of his girlfriend's pet pug Buddha titled \\"M8 Yer Dugs A Nazi\\". At the start of the video, he says: \\"My girlfriend is always ranting and raving about how cute and adorable her wee dog is so I thought I would turn him into the least cute thing I could think of, which is a Nazi.\\" In the video, the dog, prompted by the command \\"Sieg Heil\\", raises his right paw in the manner of a Nazi salute, watches a speech by Adolf Hitler, and responds immediately when Meechan asks if he wants to \\"gas the Jews\\". It ends with images of Hitler and Buddha depicted with a toothbrush moustache similar to Hitler's. Meechan was arrested on suspicion of breaching the Communications Act 2003. On 19 March 2018, Meechan was convicted of breaching the act by Sheriff Derek O'Carroll at Airdrie Sheriff Court. The court ruled that Meechan's claim that the video was a joke intended for his girlfriend \\"lacked credibility\\" as Meechan's girlfriend did not subscribe to the YouTube channel to which the video was posted. On 23 April 2018, Meechan was sentenced to a fine of £800, with no prison sentence. === Reaction === Approximately 500 people gathered in London to protest for free speech when the sentence was handed out. Following Meechan's conviction, British comedians Ricky Gervais and David Baddiel made comments supporting Meechan. Others who opposed the prosecution included Kenan Malik, Tim Blair, Helen Dale, Douglas Murray, Tom Walker, Shappi Khorsandi, Marc Randazza, Jonathan Turley and Stephen Fry. Index on Censorship CEO Jodie Ginsberg stated that the right to free expression must include the right to offend, \\"otherwise the freedom is meaningless\\". Sitcom writer Graham Linehan condemned Meechan. Meechan responded by saying that Linehan's show Father Ted also contained Nazi-related jokes. Meechan was scrutinised for embracing support from right-wing figures Alex Jones and Tommy Robinson, to which he replied: \\"Imagine totally abandoning protecting human rights, just because someone you don't like is defending them too. Astounding.\\" On 6 May 2018, Meechan spoke at the \\"Day for Freedom\\" rally, organised by Robinson, which was described as far-right by news media and observers. David Coburn, the United Kingdom Independence Party Member of the European Parliament for Scotland, released a two-page statement condemning the ruling as \\"an embarrassment\\". Philip Davies, Conservative MP for Shipley, brought up Meechan's case in the House of Commons and said: \\"Can we have a debate about freedom of speech in this country – something this country has long held dear and is in danger of throwing away needlessly?\\" Sheriff O'Carroll noted that there were only \\"very limited\\" submissions from the defence and the prosecution on the matter of the law as it regards freedom of expression; because of this, the trial was \\"concerned, ultimately, only with the narrow fact-based question of whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that your using a public communications network on one day to post the video onto your video channel, constituted an offence contrary to section 127(1)(a) of the Communications Act 2003\\". He said the ruling sets no precedent. Meechan started a GoFundMe campaign on 24 April 2018 to raise £100,000 for an appeal and reached his goal as of 25 April. In August 2018, Meechan announced that his request for an appeal had been denied by a member of the Sheriff Appeal Court, who also accused Meechan's lawyer of contempt. The letter stated that the appeal was \\"not arguable\\" due to the nature of the \\"deeply unpleasant offence\\". Meechan stated that he plans to contest the matter with the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission. Meechan's lawyer Dorothy Bain subsequently petitioned the High Court of Justiciary to hear the case. Senior judge Lord Carloway opined that the High Court did not have the power to grant an appeal denied by the Sheriff Court. In March 2019, the £800 was seized from Meechan's bank account under an arrestment order. On 17 June 2020, Meechan announced that his additional appeal to the Supreme Court was also rejected. Meechan stated his intention to bring the case to the European Court of Human Rights. BBC Scotland planned to feature Meechan in a 2019 debate program, The Collective, and had him film two episodes. However, the network announced that these episodes would not be aired after a backlash over the announcement. BBC Three produced a documentary on Meechan's case which aired during the summer. == Politics == On 16 June 2018, Meechan announced that he had joined UKIP along with fellow YouTubers Carl Benjamin and Paul Joseph Watson in what Watson describes as an attempted \\"soft coup\\". In April 2019, Meechan said he intended to stand for MEP on behalf of UKIP in the upcoming 2019 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom. He was named fourth on UKIP's list in Scotland, but was not elected after UKIP won only 1.8% of the vote in Scotland. In November 2019, Meechan posted a video announcing that he had left UKIP, citing internal disputes and backstabbing within the party over their leadership as his reason for leaving. On 25 July 2020 Meechan announced on Twitter that he had joined the Scottish nationalist Scottish Libertarian Party. == See also == * Censorship in the United Kingdom * Jackie, a Dalmatian taught by its owner to do Nazi salutes and whose owner was investigated by authorities, but charges were dropped for lack of evidence * Twitter Joke Trial == References  External links == * * Category:Living people Category:1987 births Category:British people convicted of hate crimes Category:Internet censorship in the United Kingdom Category:Scottish YouTubers Category:People from Coatbridge Category:YouTube controversies Category:UK Independence Party people ","title":"Mark Meechan"},{"id":"56925847","text":"John Nathan \\"Dutch\\" Levine (January 19, 1881 – January 6, 1950) was an American college football player and coach.

It now houses a bar on the ground floor. The building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1939. ==History== The Tre Hjorter building seen on a lithograph from c. 1750 Erik Valkendorff, a relative of the later stadtholder Christoffer Valkendorf, acquired a property at the site in the middle of the 16th century. In 1681, his descendants sold it to a blacksmith, Jochum Pedersen, who sold off the land in lots. The corner lot was acquired by an innkeeper, Søren Rasmussen Hjortshøy, who opened a hotel at the site. Its name, De Tre Hjorter, thus contained a reference to his own last name. The hotel was one of many located on the north side of the street, a tradition that dated from a time when the Western City Gate was located at the end of Vestergade. Drawing from the courtyard It was used by farmers who came into town on market day to sell their produce. The hotel was also frequented by young theologians from the provinces who had come to Copenhagen with the ambition of obtaining employment at one of the city's churches. In the 1720s, this resulted in a scandal that involved Tre Hjorter's owners, Peter and Ane Sørensen Berg. Ane claimed to have connections in the right circles and operated a lucrative business conveying bribes that were supposed to improve the aspiring priests' chances. In 1725, Ane was arrested and sentenced to time in the notorious Spinning House in Christianshavn while her husband was thrown out of Copenhagen. She was, however, pardoned the following year but also thrown out of the city. A few years later, Tre Hjorter was completely destroyed in the Copenhagen Fire of 1728 but was rebuilt. A 15-year-old C. E. F. Weyse stayed at Tre Hjorter when he first came to Copenhagen from Altona and resided there until the composer Abraham Peter Schultz offered him accommodation in his apartment in Bredgade. Photograph of the building by Johannes Hauerslev In 1795, Hotel Tre Hjorter was once again lost to the flames in the Second Great Fire. Its owner, Jørgen Sorterup, commissioned Lauritz Laurberg Thrane to rebuild his hotel. Construction started the following year and was completed in 1797. The mail coaches for destinations on Zealand began to use the complex as a terminus. The mail coaches entered the courtyard to the rear of the hotel through a gateway at Vestergade 12 and departed via a gateway at Larsbjørnstræde 10. The courtyard contained stables, warehouses and a post office. The courtyard in February 1914 The mail coaches disappeared when the new railway station opened in 1847. The old hostels in Vestergade were also faced with new competition when several large, modern hotels opened around the corner on Vester Voldgade in the 1880s and 1890s. Hotel Tre Hjorter was the only hotel left in Vestergade by the time that it closed in 1929. All the buildings in the courtyard were demolished in 1939 and replaced by a modern four-storey building. The tenants in the new building included a photographer, an importer a men's hats, a manufacturer of blinds and a book printer. ==Today== Tyrolia Bier Klub, a bar owned by Rekon Group, is located in the ground floor.

VAM is the synergy of variational principles and asymptotic approaches, variational principles are applied to the defined functional as well as the asymptotes are applied to the same functional instead of applying on differential equations due to its less prone to errors. This methodology is applicable for whole range of physics problems, where the problem has to be defined in a variational form and should be able to identify the small parameters within the problem definition. In other words, VAM can be applicable where the functional is so complex in determining the stationary points either by analytical or by computationally expensive numerical analysis with an advantage of small parameters. Thus, approximate stationary points in the functional can be utilized to obtain the original functional. == Introduction== VAM was first initiated by Berdichevsky in 1979 for shell analysis.Berdichevsky, V. L., 1979, “Variational-asymptotic method of constructing a theory of shells”, Prikladnaya Matematika i Mekhanika (PMM), 43, pp. 664–687. He has been applied VAM to develope nonlinear shell theory in 1980Berdichevsky, V. L., 1980, Variational-asymptotic method of constructing the nonlinear shell theory, Theory of Shells, North-Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam, pp. 137–161. and for the beams in 1982.Berdichevsky, V. L., 1982, “On the energy of an elastic rod”, Prikladnaya Matematika i Mekhanika (PMM), 45, pp. 518–529. This method can completely justify as a right tool in constructing accurate models for dimensionally reducible structures and in analyzing geometric and material nonlinear models. Berdichevsky elucidated VAM procedure thoroughly and applied for shell structures to obtain the in-plane and out-of-plane warping functions, where an introduced warping function is a kind of bridge between 1-D and 3-D fields, and derived the analytical expressions to attain three dimensional displacements, stresses and strains. In the beginning, the asymptotic methods are used to develop cross-sectional analysis of anisotropic beams with finite- element based solutions. Danielson, D. A., and Hodges, D. H., 1987, “Non- linear beam kinematics by decomposition of the rotation tensor”, Journal of Applied Mechanics, 54, pp. 258–262. The development of the formulation in the Variational Asymptotic Beam Sectional Analysis (VABS) was started in 1988Yu, W.: “Simplified Formulation of Mechanics of Structure Genome,” AIAA Journal, vol. 57, 2019, pp. 4201-4209., and various former students of Hodges made contributions to this project, including HodgesHodges D.

Subsequently, using VAM, an effective plate model unifying homogenization procedure and a dimensional reduction process were established, to deal with realistic heterogeneous plates VAPAS has been implemented which is based on finite element technique.Lee, C.-Y., and Yu, W., 2011, “Homogenization and dimensional reduction of composite plates with in-plane heterogeneity”, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 48(10), pp. 1474 – 1484. This work has been extended for the analysis of laminated composite plates. \\"Asymptotic construction of Reissner-like composite plate theory with accurate strain recovery,\\" W. Yu, D.H. Hodges, V.

VAM is also used to develop the Variational Asymptotic Method For Unit Cell Homogenization (VAMUCH) for heterogeneous materials.\\"Variational asymptotic method for unit cell homogenization of periodically heterogeneous materials,\\" W. Yu, T. Tang, International Journal of Solids and Structures 44 (11-12), 3738-3755. ==Procedure== In specific structural applications, in beams, the procedure begin with 3-Dimensional analysis and mathematically divide the analysis into 2-Dimensional cross section analysis and 1-Dimensional beam analysis. In the cross section analysis, 1-Dimensional constitutive law can be obtained and is provided as an input to the beam 1-Dimensional analysis. Closed form of analytical expression for warping functions along with set of recovery relations can be achieved to express the 3-D displacements, strains and stresses. In plates/shells, the 3-Dimesional problem splits into 1-Dimensional through the thickness and 2-Dimesional plate/shell analysis. Therefore, obtained 2-D constitutive law form the thickness analysis can be provided as input to 2-Dimensional analysis. Subsequently, recovery relations can be formed which presents the 3-D displacements, strains and stresses. ==Advantages== • No adhoc kinematic assumptions are required • VAM is fully physics based and developed by neglecting the smaller energy contributions • This method is capable to capture non-classical nonlinear effects automatically • Asymptotes have been applied to functional instead of applying to differential equations, which led to less errors • Mathematically rigorous theory, yet engineer-friendly end results • VAM is an efficient method and obtained results are accurate • Implementation of VAM can allow to use analytical and/or numerical approaches • Right tool for the validation of asymptotical correctness with comparison of other theories ==Applications== VAM is extensively applied to the structural problems such as beams, plates, shells to find the stresses and strains as stationary points for a strain energy functional based on small parameters. In those structural problems, width and height are the small parameters for beams and thickness is the small parameter for plates and shells. In fact, small parameters (geometric and/or physical) are not limited to the above-mentioned parameters and those can be chosen based on the specific application of the defined problem. In macro mechanics, VAM applied to dimensional reduction of beams, plates, shells and multifunctional structures, where considerable number of small parameters exists. In micro mechanics, VAM is capable in design and analysis of composites, where the fiber and matrix are involved. This methodology is applied not only to linear elastic materials with isotropic in nature but also to different kind of hyper elastic materials with orthotropic in nature, where the hyper elastic materials plays important role in the application of bio- implants, study of soft tissues behavior, high altitude airships etc. and the materials have geometric and material nonlinearities. In addition, this method is applicable for different type of materials such as dielectric materials, multi-functional composite materials, energy harvesting materials etc. This approach can be used in aerospace structural analysis, fabrics design and analysis, automotive industries etc. It can handle various type of analysis such as static, dynamic, multi-physics, buckling, modal problems. Subsequently, various computer codes have been developed with the basis of Variational Asymptotic Method such as Variational Asymptotic Beam Analysis (VABS)\\"VABS\\", cdmHUB (Composites Design and Manufacturing HUB), 12 Oct 2016., Variational Asymptotic Plate and Shell Analysis (VAPAS), Dynamic Variational Asymptotic Plate and Shell Analysis (DVAPAS) etc.Lee, Chang-Yong, and Dewey Hodges. \\"Asymptotically Correct Dynamic Shell Theory: 1-D Through-Thickness Analysis.\\" In 49th AIAA/ASME/ASCE/AHS/ASC Structures, Structural Dynamics, and Materials Conference, 16th AIAA/ASME/AHS Adaptive Structures Conference, 10th AIAA Non-Deterministic Approaches Conference, 9th AIAA Gossamer Spacecraft Forum, 4th AIAA Multidisciplinary Design Optimization Specialists Conference, p. 2010. 2008. These computer-based programs are well established and validated for the commercial applications and extensively used to analyze the behavior of composite structures.

It is often used in popular science and in the media for any new transitional form. The term originated to describe the hypothetical intermediate form in the evolutionary series of anthropoid ancestors to anatomically modern humans (hominization). The term was influenced by the pre- Darwinian evolutionary theory of the Great Chain of Being and the now-outdated notion (orthogenesis) that simple organisms are more primitive than complex organisms. Phylogenetic tree of hominid evolution The term \\"missing link\\" has fallen out of favor with biologists because it implies the evolutionary process is a linear phenomenon and that forms originate consecutively in a chain. Instead, last common ancestor is preferred since this does not have the connotation of linear evolution, as evolution is a branching process. In addition to implying a linear evolution, the term also implies that a particular fossil has not yet been found. Many of the famous discoveries in human evolution are often termed \\"missing links\\". For example, there were the Peking Man and the Java Man, despite the fact that these fossils are not missing. Transitional forms that have not been discovered are also termed missing links; however, there is no singular missing link. The scarcity of transitional fossils can be attributed to the incompleteness of the fossil record. == Historical origins == The term \\"missing link\\" was influenced by the 18th century Enlightenment thinkers such as Alexander Pope and Jean-Jacques Rousseau who thought of humans as links in the Great Chain of Being. The Great Chain of Being is a hierarchical structure of all matter and life. Influenced by Aristotle's theory of higher and lower animals, the Great Chain of Being was created during the Medieval period in Europe and was strongly influenced by religious thought. God was at the top of the chain followed by man and then animals. It was during the 18th century that the set nature of species and their immutable place in the great chain was questioned. The dual nature of the chain, divided yet united, had always allowed for seeing creation as essentially one continuous whole, with the potential for overlap between the links. Radical thinkers like Jean-Baptiste Lamarck saw a progression of life forms from the simplest creatures striving towards complexity and perfection, a schema accepted by zoologists like Henri de Blainville. The very idea of an ordering of organisms, even if supposedly fixed, laid the basis for the idea of transmutation of species, for example Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. The earliest publication that explicitly uses the term “missing link” was in 1844 in Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation by Robert Chambers, which uses the term in an evolutionary context relating to gaps in the fossil record. Charles Lyell employed the term a few years later in 1851 in his third edition of Elements of Geology to as a metaphor for the missing gaps in the continuity of the geological column. The first time it was used as a name for transitional types between different taxa was in 1863, in Lyell's Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man. \\"Missing link\\" later became a name for transitional fossils, particularly those seen as bridging the gulf between man and animal. Subsequently, Charles Darwin, Thomas Henry Huxley, and Ernst Haeckel used it in their works with this meaning. == Historical beliefs about the missing link == Haeckel's Chain of the Animal Ancestors of Man Jean- Baptiste Lamarck envisioned that life is generated in the form of the simplest creatures constantly, and then strive towards complexity and perfection (i.e. humans) through a series of lower forms. In his view, lower animals were simply newcomers on the evolutionary scene. After Darwin's On the Origin of Species, the idea of \\"lower animals\\" representing earlier stages in evolution lingered, as demonstrated in Ernst Haeckel's figure of the human pedigree. While the vertebrates were then seen as forming a sort of evolutionary sequence, the various classes were distinct, the undiscovered intermediate forms being called \\"missing links.\\" Haeckel claimed that human evolution occurred in 24 stages and that the 23rd stage was a theoretical missing link he named Pithecanthropus alalus (\\"ape-man lacking speech\\"). Haeckel claimed the origin of humanity was to be found in Asia. He theorized that the missing link was to be found on the lost continent of Lemuria located in the Indian Ocean. He believed that Lemuria was the home of the first humans and that Asia was the home of many of the earliest primates; he thus supported that Asia was the cradle of hominid evolution. Haeckel argued that humans were closely related to the primates of Southeast Asia and rejected Darwin's hypothesis of human origins in Africa. The search for a fossil that connected man and ape was unproductive until the Dutch paleontologist Eugene Dubois went to Indonesia. Between 1886 and 1895 Dubois discovered remains that he later described as \\"an intermediate species between humans and monkeys\\". He named the hominin Pithecanthropus erectus (erect ape-man), which has now been reclassified as Homo erectus. In the media, the Java Man was hailed as the missing link. For instance, the headline of the Philadelphia Enquirer on February 3, 1895, was \\"The Missing Link: A Dutch Surgeon in Java Unearths the Needed Specimen\\". == Famous \\"missing links\\" in human evolution == Java Man, the original \\"missing link\\" found in Java Among the famous fossil finds credited as the \\"missing link\\" in human evolution are: * Java Man (Homo erectus): Discovered by Eugene Dubois in 1891 in Indonesia. Originally named Pithecanthropus erectus. * Piltdown Man: A set of bones found in 1912 thought to be the \\"missing link\\" between ape and man. Eventually revealed to be a hoax. * Taung Child (Australopithecus africanus): Discovered by Raymond Dart in 1924 in South Africa. * Homo habilis (described in 1964) has features intermediate between Australopithecus and Homo erectus, and its classification in Homo rather than Australopithecus has been questioned. p. 41: \\"A recent reassessment of cladistic and functional evidence concluded that there are few, if any, grounds for retaining H. habilis in Homo, and recommended that the material be transferred (or, for some, returned) to Australopithecus (Wood & Collard, 1999).\\" * Lucy (Australopithecus afarensis): Discovered in 1974 by Donald Johanson in Ethiopia * Australopithecus sediba: A series of skeletons discovered in South Africa between 2008-2010 == Portrayals in media == * The Missing Link in Monsters vs. Aliens (2009) * Missing Link (1988) * The Missing Link (1927) * The Missing Link (1980) * Missing Link (2019) == References == Category:Human evolution Category:Gaps in the fossil record ","title":"Missing link (human evolution)"},{"id":"56926430","text":"Jalal Baba Auditorium is a public auditorium in Abbottabad, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.New varsity campus, hospital to be set up in Abbottabad Dawn (newspaper), Published 4 October 2002, Retrieved 12 July 2018 The auditorium was named after Muhammad Jalal-ud-din Jalal Baba.

It was part of the Northern Front which fought against Entente troops and the White Northern Army which were based in Archangelsk and Murmansk. After the disbandment of Northern Front the 7th Army was transferred to the Western Front. The 7th Army also took part in the Soviet campaign against Estonia. On November 22, 1918, units of the 7th Army attacked Narva for the first time, but the assault was repulsed by the German troops still remaining in the city. A week later, the Soviet troops seized the city. Then the troops of the 7th Army began to advance westward, and by early January 1919 they were 35 kilometers from Tallinn. But on January 7, 1919, the Estonian 1st division launched a counter-offensive, and already on January 19 the Estonians and Finns took Narva and entered the territory of the Petrograd Governate. In spring 1919 the 7th Army defended the approaches to Petrograd against Finnish troops on the Karelian and Onega-Ladoga Isthmus, the White Guard Northern Corps of Major-General Dzerozhinsky and Estonian troops south of the Gulf of Finland. On June 21 the 7th Army launched an offensive against the troops of the Northwestern Army (the former Northern Corps). On August 5, Yamburg was taken, after which they halted their advance. In the autumn of 1919, the troops of the Northwestern Army under Major-General Alexander Rodzyanko and from October 2, General Nikolai Yudenich undertook a second attempt to conquer Petrograd. The outskirts of the city were reached but the reinforced 7th Army was able to halt their advance and launched a counteroffensive on October 21. The North-Western Army was pushed back in chaos and disintegrated. Its remains retreated into Estonia where they were interned. On December 31, an armistice agreement between the RSFSR and Estonia came into force, and on February 2, 1920, the Tartu Peace Treaty was concluded, which meant the end of the war in the Northwest of the RSFSR.

He and his followers were among the last Native Americans in the United States to settle on a reservation Crow Flies High (Hidatsa: Beericga Maaguhdaa Neesh; ca. 1830s-1900) was the chief of a band of dissident Hidatsa people from 1870 until their band joined the reservation system in 1894. This band was one of the last to settle on an Indian reservation. A North Dakota State Park is named after him. ==Smallpox epidemic and Like-a-Fishhook Village== Smallpox struck the Hidatsa community in 1837 and decimated the population.Meyer, Roy W. (1977): The Village Indians on the Upper Missouri. The Mandans, Hidatsas, and Arikaras. Lincoln and London. Together with the remnants of their allies the Mandan tribe, the survivors built the Like-a-Fishhook Village further up the Missouri River around 1845. Having lost his closest relatives in the epidemic, Crow Flies High was raised by Eats-From-The-Line clan members.Fox, Gregory L. (1988): A Late Nineteenth Century Village of a Band of Dissident Hidatsas: The Garden Coulee Site (32WI18). Lincoln. In 1870, Crow Flies High left the joint Hidatsa, Mandan and Arikara Indian reservation at Fort Berthold in North Dakota due to conflict with the chiefs. He and his followers settled near the military post Fort Buford. Ordered away in 1884, they built a new village of sheds near the mouth of Little Knife River. By keeping a low profile while hunting small game in the area, the band managed largely to stay outside the reservation system until 1894. Crow Flies High chose to reject the leadership of the traditional ceremonial elders. His heretical faction gathered around the new leader Bobtail Bull, a Hidatsa, with Crow Flies High functioning as the military chief. Around this time in 1870, a severe conflict \\"approaching civil war\\" emerged in Like-a-Fishhook village.Bowers, Alfred W. (1965): Hidatsa Social and Ceremonial Organization. Smithsonian Institution. Bureau of American Ethnology. Bulletin 194. Washington. Crow Flies High and Bobtail Bull accused some leaders of unfair distribution of government rations. Tension grew between the rival groups. Persistent rumors about a plan to murder Crow Flies High circulated. Urged to leave at least for a time, Crow Flies High and Bobtail Bull headed up river. From 140Malouf, Carling (1963): \\"Crow-Flies-High (32MZ1). A Historic Hidatsa Village in the Garrison Reservoir Area, North Dakota. Smithsonian Institution. Bureau of American Ethnology. Bulletin 185. Pp. 137-166. Washington. to 200 discontented Hidatsas and Mandans went along. The Hidatsa dissidents came from every clan. ==The Garden Coulee village== Map 1. Garden Coulee village of Hidatsa chief Crow Flies High. The little map shows the 1851 treaty territory of the Hidatsa, Mandan and Arikara The dissident band settled on the north bank of the Missouri, about two miles above the mouth of Yellowstone River on an outlying part of the Fort Buford Military Reservation (see Map 1). Nearby Fort Buford reduced the risk of attacks on the small village from the Sioux and it provided a market for furs and robes. The Hidatsa had never fought the U.S. Army and the garrison accepted them in the area. The new settlement consisted mostly of log cabins, earth lodges, and a number of families dug storage pits. In 1886, Crow Flies High described the early years in the settlement near Garden Coulee. \\"We subsisted ourselves by hunting Buffalo and Deer ... and selling our hides at Fort Buford\\". Gardens were laid out as bison became rare. Some of the people enlisted early as scouts and hunters at the fort and received regular pay. Prostitution and begging at the fort occurred when game went scarce. Captain Charles A. Coolidge provided for a number of aged and needy villagers in 1880. On one occasion, Crow Flies High quickly paid damages for a few heads of domestic cattle butchered by young men from the village. Regularly, families resettled at Like-a-Fishhook Village, while new ones joined the dissidents and moved into vacated log houses. The average population was around 150 when the village was inhabited. It served mainly as a place for the winter and as a stopover for Hidatsa hunting camps going up Yellowstone River. The Garden Coulee villagers received government rations during visits to Like a Fishhook village. With time, Crow Flies High was recognized chief of the village. ===Unwanted near Fort Buford=== Map 2. Crow Flies High village (1884) and the Fort Berthold reservation For most of a decade the interactions between the people in the Native settlement and the soldiers at Fort Buford were peaceful. Things changed in 1883. The Sioux were no longer a threat to the fort and the soldiers. The village population climbed to 240 inhabitants. The commander wanted the settlement closed. A few earlier attempts to motivate Crow Flies High to leave Fort Buford Military Reservation and stay on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation had failed. On September 20, 1884, commanding officer J.N.G. Whistler finally reported the villagers on their way, \\"... although many of them have been living here for fifteen years\\". Fort Buford bought the abandoned Indian log cabins for firewood. The migrants spent the 44 dollars thus made on supplies for the movement downstream. ==Crow Flies High village== The villagers started a new village on a site near some valleys where they already had small gardens. About twenty-five rectangular cabins were built close to the Missouri River a few miles above the mouth of Little Knife River (see Map 2). A single and simple earth lodge used as a \\"dance hall\\" stood in the southern quarter of the village. The settlement was inside the reservation, but more than 50 miles from Like-a-Fishhook Village and \\"the agency-mission complex\\". The Fort Berthold Indian Reservation was reduced late in 1886 (agreement ratified 1891). Once again, the dissidents lived outside its borders (see Map 3). No children attended the reservation school, which was a major concern for the different Indian Agents. Some believed they had persuaded Crow Flies High to consent to reservation rules, just to be disappointed. Map 3. The village of Hidatsa chief Crow Flies High and the 1886 boundaries for the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in North Dakota Crow Flies High lived in the village with his two wives. A son of his had his own cabin. The village Indians hunted deer and small game and raised crops. They sold firewood to steamboats on the Missouri. Once accused of killing beef cattle by ranchers in the area, Crow Flies High went to the Agency and defended himself and the village. Indian Agent Abram J. Gifford accepted the explanation of Crow Flies High, so the case ended with defeat to the stockgrowers. ==The last years of Crow Flies High== In 1894, Crow Flies High resigned as chief. It happened just before Fort Buford soldiers and Hidatsa scouts escorted him and 125 Hidatsa, 23 Mandan and 1 Arikara to the agency. Some Hidatsa would later blame the soldiers for seemingly ignoring \\"all our men who had gone out and been scouts for them\\". The people, now under the leadership of Long Bear, traveled in a long line. They used both pack and travois horses as well as Red River carts on the move. Although assigned allotments all over the reservation, the group slowly assembled in the Shell Creek area. Crow Flies High died of pneumonia in 1900.

She invested most of her energies into supporting her stepson's efforts to establish himself as an artist and, after his death in 1880, to perpetuate his legacy. After he died, she reportedly destroyed all his personal letters and published a collection of his writings \\"which show him purely as an artist, as a genius wrestling with himself, his work and ignorant patrons\\", in an effort to build a legacy for him. This indeed furthered his renown for the next few decades.

The FAGB was re-equipped by the Soviet Union with a limited aid package in which its first combat aircraft were introduced. Five MIG-17s and two MiG-15UTI trainers entered service with a single Mi-8 helicopter. In 1978 France provided more aircraft aid in the form of a Reims-cessna FTB.337 for coastal patrol and a surplus Alouette III. A Dassault Falcon 20F was donated by the Angolan government but was soon sold to the USA. In the late 1980s a similar number of MiG 21s replaced the MiG 17s, also delivered an An-24, a Yak-40 and another Mi-8 helicopter. In the early 90s they received ex-polish PZL-Mielec Lim-6 Fresco fighter bombers from Poland and East Germany. The force's title was changed to Força Aérea da Guiné-Bissau (FAGB) after the outbreak of the civil war in 1998.

IVC was created by MPEG, and was intended to be a royalty-free video coding standard for use on the Internet, as an alternative to non-free formats such as AVC and HEVC. As such, IVC was designed to only use (mostly old) coding techniques which were not covered by royalty-requiring patents. According to MPEG founder and chairman Leonardo Chiariglione \\"IVC is practically dead\\", because 3 companies made statements \\"I may have patents and I am willing to license them at FRAND terms\\" covering IVC, meaning that implementations might have to pay money to the companies. This patent threat meant that IVC was practically unusable for its intended purpose as a legally safe royalty-free video coding format. ITU-T/ITU-R/ISO/IEC defines 3 types of patent licensing. The goal for IVC was to only use techniques patented under type 1 (royalty-free), while the 3 companies said they may have patents under type 2 (requires royalty). The text of the code of practice is as follows: > 2.1 The patent holder is willing to negotiate licences free of charge with > other parties on a non-discriminatory basis on reasonable terms and > conditions. Such negotiations are left to the parties concerned and are > performed outside ITU-T/ITU-R/ISO/IEC. 2.2 The patent holder is willing to > negotiate licences with other parties on a non-discriminatory basis on > reasonable terms and conditions.

Three (3) proposals were received: * Web Video Coding (WVC), proposed jointly by Apple, Cisco, Fraunhofer HHI, Magnum Semiconductors, Polycom, RIM, etc.. Web Video Coding was another name for the Constrained MPEG-4 AVC baseline profile. * Video Coding for Browsers (VCB), proposed by Google and identical to Google's VP8. * Internet Video Coding (IVC), proposed by several universities (Peking University, Tsinghua University, Zhejiang University, Hanyang University, Korea Aerospace University, etc.), and developed from scratch. Web Video Coding did not have a guarantee from all patent holders that the patents covering Web Video Coding would be licensed royalty-free.

Measures include primarily offsets and \\"alternative\\" fuels. CORSIA addresses only emissions from international air travel that exceed the baseline of 2020 levels. The proposal has been described as \\"a delicate compromise between all involved in its elaboration.\\" ==Background== According to an IPCC report published in 1999, aviation accounted for approximately two percent of global carbon emissions due to human activity, as of 1992. But the IPCC points out that climate impacts of aviation emissions are especially problematic due to chemical interactions at high altitudes. In fact the radiative forcing impacts of aviation emissions are thought to be 2-4 times that of direct CO2 emissions. Per capita emissions from air travel is one of the highest in comparison to various other modes of transportation. The industry is expecting a growth in air travel in various regions. Aviation is among the fastest growing sectors. Through CORSIA, the aviation industry is aiming for a carbon neutral growth from 2020. Many airlines offer an option for airline passengers, for an additional payment, to offset their emissions associated with their air travel. Few airlines such as NatureAir and Harbour Air have been carbon-neutral. There are start-up aviation ventures such as FlyPOP that are aiming to be carbon neutral. ==Process== CORSIA has three implementation phases, beginning 2021. Participation of countries until 2026 is voluntary. On 15 February 2019, the ICAO announced an agreement on alternative fuels to reduce offsets, but details on how to reach the target of halving 2005-level emissions by 2050 remain elusive. However it has been decided that even fossil fuels produced from newer oil wells, or with some more efficient refinery processing will be eligible. It has also been decided that aviation biofuels from a variety of feedstocks including palm oil, the most likely source and a leading cause of deforestation, would be eligible for use. On 18 February, the European Council urged the ICAO to implement Corsia swiftly and to “agree on a long-term goal at its next assembly” in September. For the Air Transport Action Group, the ICAO could take three years to negotiate, until 2022. ==Participation== As of January 2018, more than 70 countries representing more than 85% of international aviation activity have volunteered to participate. India and Russia are yet to join CORSIA. India, which has four of the five carbon-neutral airports in the Asia-Pacific region and the world's first fully solar powered airport, has drawn attention to \\"differentiated responsibilities\\" and the \\"need to ensure the transfer of financial resources, technology transfer and deployment and capacity building support to developing countries for enabling them to voluntarily undertake action plans.\\". ==Exemptions== Least Developed Countries, Small Island Developing States and Landlocked Developing Countries can volunteer to participate in CORSIA, while it is not mandated on them. However, all ICAO member states \\"with aeroplane operators conducting international flights are required to monitor, report and verify carbon dioxide emissions from these flights every year from 2019\\". All aeroplane operators with CO2 emissions less than or equal to 10,000 tonnes are exempted from the CORSIA reporting requirements. ==Criticisms== CORSIA would establish a global offset market with weak standards at a time when drastic reductions, not unreliable offsets are essential. CORSIA would create vast new demand for biofuels even though it is widely recognized at this time that most biofuels, especially those from palm oil, result in more emissions even than the fossil fuels they replace, as well as being a leading cause of biodiversity loss. CORSIA is a market based mechanism focusing on offsetting emissions through the process of an airline purchasing emission units equivalent to its offsetting requirements. Offsetting diverts the focus from reducing emissions, to trading on emissions. Forest offsets would most likely predominate. But forest offsets have been opposed by many as ineffective since fires, droughts, pests, illegal logging and geopolitical dynamics make it impossible to measure, verify or in any way guarantee forest carbon sequestration over time. Additionally, many forest offset projects have resulted in human rights violations. It is also said that CORSIA is not as stringent as EU ETS. While the scheme may address a significant percentage of emissions from the future expansion of international aviation, it does not fully contribute to 'carbon neutral growth'. CORSIA has also not stated any upper limit to the aviation related emissions that may be produced by an airline operator or a country. Further, CORSIA is likely to result in massive new demand for biofuels, which currently would most likely be produced using \\"hydrotreated vegetable oil\\" - with palm oil, and the palm oil derivative \\"palm fatty acid distillate\\" being the most likely feedstock. Neste is the largest producer of aviation biofuels and has established a facility in Singapore, the heart of the palm oil going region, stating its goal to become the world leader in aviation biofuel production. Palm oil is already recognized as a leading cause of deforestation and human rights abuses. ==Emissions from domestic aviation== Emissions from domestic air travel are not included in CORSIA.

The BAMS system is designed for communication by the best employment of radio stations available. ==Background== BAMS Zones of Operation across the world 1944. On the outbreak of World War II, the British Admiralty took over control from the GPO, and the embryo merchant ship broadcast system, called GBMS came into force. Ships listed at routine times to the Rugby Radio Station and to area stations, otherwise keeping watch on the international distress frequency at 500 kHz. After the fall of France, the Admiralty assumed control of all Allied merchant shipping which complied with British procedures. When America entered the war, the world was divided into two strategic zones, the Admiralty being responsible for merchant shipping in one, and the United States Navy in the other. The GBMS organisation proved to be inadequate for the efficient clearance of traffic for a number of reasons, including poor coverage by Wireless telegraphy (W/T) stations, obsolescent equipment, and many ships only able to listen at single or two operator periods. The systems gradually improved, and from 1942 all Allied merchant ships had to have two radio technicians on board, with more modern equipment being fitted to ships. In 1942, the GBMS system was superseded by the combined Anglo-American system of BAMS, and the addition of US Navy W/T stations improved the poor coverage. For ship to shore communications, during Radio silence, ships in Convoy passed any essential messages through their escort for transmission. The Commodore's and Vice-Commodore's ships, rescue ships, merchant aircraft carriers, and ships fitted with Huff Duff were fitted when possible for intercommunication with other escort vessels. ==Description== The BAMS protocol was the second part of a two part communication protocol between shore to merchant ship. BAMS was for Radio communication, and the Visual signalling component, the first part was, called the: Visual Signalling Code and Instructions (WIMS-I), a publication held by the United Nations. Both BAMS and WIMS-I were essentially a safety protocol, to ensure reliable, no mistake communication. ==Shore to Ship Communication== The BAMS system divides the world into three zones, that are covered by a high-powered Zone station. Each zone is further sectioned with an Area station per section. Within a zone, multiple stations synchronize using Spread spectrum frequency radio to provide complete coverage. Image one called: BAMS Zones of Operation has a clear description, of delineation of control with the Zones. ===BAMS Delineated Zones=== The following is an example of Area 1B. The Area 1B record provides an English description of a topographic square on the earth. Area 1B record is record 2 of 20, and has the following format: ::{  ! colspan=5 style=\\"background:LightSteelBlue\\"Area 1B -  Northern limit  parallel of 43 degrees North -  Southern limit  parallel of 26 degrees 10 minutes North -  Eastern limit  meridian of Gibraltar -  Western limit  meridian of 40 degrees West. } The Zones are numbered, Area 1A, Area 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 3C, 4, 5A, 5B, 5C, 5D, 6A, 6B, 6C, 7A, 7B, 7C, 8 and 9. ===Operation=== Zone and Area stations were configured to broadcast at routine times, on intermediate and high frequencies, with general or individual ship addressed messages, in their own zone of area, respectively. Coastal stations were utilized for the broadcast of messages to merchant ships within range, except at times when broadcast schedules within that zone are in operation. Coastal stations called on the 500 kHz frequency band, and shifted to the working frequency, for the transmission of the BAMS message. ===Arranging Authority=== Page 1 of the Arranging Authorities List used by BAMS. The list shows the Zone, Area and Coastal stations, associated with a particular Arranging Authority. Transmissions of messages for merchant ships via the Zone, Area or Coastal stations are arranged by certain designated shore-based Arranging Authorities (AA). These stations read the BAMS message header and route the BAMS messages, ensuring it is transmitted by correct Zone and Area stations assigned to them, and by Coastal stations if required. The Arranging Authority also ensures that Coastal stations under their control, transmit messages that are considered necessary, even if the originator does not specify such a transmission. ===Originators responsibility=== The originator of a BAMS message is responsible for routing the message to the AA, controlling the Zone and Area stations. In addition, the originator of the BAMS message is responsible for routing to concerned authorities. Routed BAMS messages are only sent to those radio stations whose plotted position covers the area addressed in the BAMS message. An AA may need to know the content of the BAMS dispatch but doesn't require forward routing via the station under its control. In this instance, the message is addressed using the format described in Addressing, described below. In the case of general messages, the Zone and Area station at least would always be utilized and the case of individually addressed messages, the Area station and appropriate Coastal stations would always be utilized. ===Routing=== When ships are passing from one area to another, messages which concern them all are routed via the Area stations of both areas and via the appropriate Zone station. ===BAMS Procedures=== Operating Signals In order to facilitate the handling of BAMS messages, Combined Operating Signals for worldwide use had been allocated as follows: *QJL Pass to _________ for information only *QLP Pass to _________ for BAMS transmitting action only *QHX Pass to _________ for information and BAMS transmitting action. These procedures signals were used in connection with unenciphered US Navy call signs or combined call signs as appropriate. All transmissions of BAMS messages between naval authorities must carry appropriate procedures signals except where messages are transmitted to radio stations for broadcast where no intermediate relaying station is involved. BAMS Headings A modified commercial procedure is utilized for the addressing of BAMS messages and immediately follows the procedure signals, radio station call signs and station serial number. Component parts of this BAMS heading would always appear in the following order: * BAMS instructional group * Optional inserts: :* Name or Call sign of coastal station from which transmission is desired. :* The phrase HAS BEEN BROADCAST BY ______ for the information of Arranging Authorities addressed. * BAMS areas to which message is to be transmitted. For example, BAMS2B * Precedence indicator in plain language (British or US designations, depending on the nationality of the originating authority.) * Name of originator in plain language preceded by FROM. * Group count. Example: CDE25, if encoded dispatch; CK25 if plain language includes text between BT's. BAMS Instructional Group The Instructional Group consists of two elements, the first and second letters should be considered together as should the third, fourth and fifth letters, as show in the following table: {  !colspan=2 style=\\"background:LightSteelBlue\\" First and Second letters of Group !colspan=2 style=\\"background:LightSteelBlue\\" Third, Fourth, and Fifth letters of Group -  AA  Broadcast this message (or text and time of message quoted) to _________ on zone or area broadcast routines for number of transmissions indicated.  GGG  For two transmissions -  BB  Broadcast this message (or time of origin and text of message quoted) to ________ on receipt and repeat at single operator periods. Total number of transmissions to be indicated.  JJJ  For three transmissions -  rowspan=\\"2\\"  CC  rowspan=\\"2\\"  Arrange transmission of this message (or text and time or origin of message quoted) to _________ from Zone and/or Area stations for whom you are responsible, and if Coastal stations are indicated, arrange transmissions from these stations. Number of transmissions of whether or not specific Coastal stations are indicated, and if considered necessary, arrange transmission from appropriate Coastal stations for which the sender is responsible. Note: Should the merchant ship carry less than three radio operators, the fifth letter of the BAMS instructional group was to be replaced by Y or Z which were allotted the following meanings. :Y-Transmit at special single-operator periods. :Z-Transmit at special two-operator periods. Originators of BAMS traffic normally possess information as to number of operators carried. If this is not known, messages should be treated as for a single operator ship.  KKK  For four transmissions -  LLL  For twenty-four hours. } *Convoy call signs Messages for a particular convoy or unit thereof are addressed by a two-leter group that is assigned before sailing. A different group is assigned to each convoy. This key group in conjunction with the following letter-number combinations to form convoy call signs: {  !colspan=1 style=\\"background:LightSteelBlue\\"  Two-letter group !colspan=1 style=\\"background:LightSteelBlue\\"  Convoy Call Sign -  D1  Commodore -  D2  Vice Commodore -  D3  The whole convoy -  D4  The Commodore's portion of the convoy. -  D5  The Vice Commodore's portion of the convoy. -  D6  The Senior Officer of the Escort -  D7  -  D8  -  D9  Stragglers from the convoy } The following is an example: Group XY having been assigned, the call sign used to address the whole convoy is XYD3. *Collective call signs Other than Convoy collective call signs discussed in Convoy call signs, above, utilize the four letters BAMS followed by a BAMS area designation if appropriate. The following is an example: BAMS - All United Nations Merchant Ships BAMS 2A - All United Nations Merchant Ships in BAMS AREA 2A *Individual call signs A United Nations mechant ship is individually addressed by its wartime radio call sign. Addressing BAMS traffic The following lists several examples of BAMS traffic addressing. *The authority originating a BAMS message, addresses it as appropriate, in accordance with the foregoing and transmits it to an Arranging Authorities, and/or radio stations concerned. The following is an example: :A BAMS message is originated by Commander, Tenth Fleet (Convoy and Routing) and transmitted to Commander, Panama Sea Frontier, for the information of the latter authority and for transmission via the Area station controlled by him: NBA V NSS NR10――QHX――JOPE――CCGGG BAMS2B STOP BAMS2B BAMS2B PRIORITY FROM COM 10TH FLEET CDE141 BT TEXT BT 171216Z *If broadcast by specific Coastal stations is desired by the originator, the call sign of stations or name in plain language should be inserted following the five-letter BAMS instructional group. The following is an example: :A BAMS message is originated by Commander, Tenth Fleet (Convoy and Routing), transmitted to Commander, Panama Sea Frontier, for BAMS transmission via the Area station, controlled by the latter, and, in addition, for transmission via Coastal station at Belize, message not for information of Commander, Panama Sea Frontier. NBA V NSS NR6――QLP――JOPE――CCGGC VPP (OR RADIO BELIZE) BAMS2B STOP KFCG KFCG PRIORITY FROM COM 10TH FLEET CDE 51 BT TEXT BT 081111Z :The Commander, Panama Sea Frontier will arrange transmission on Naval Radio Balboa Area broadcast, and in addition will transmit to Radio Belize for broadcast at other than scheduled times. The BAMS instructional group must be changed to AAGGG when the message is passed to Radio Balboa and to BBGGG for Radio Belize. The Procedure signal is omitted in the transmission to Radio Belize as complete instructions for that station are included in the BAMS instructional group. *Originating authorities should not normally pass messages directly to Coastal stations for transmission, but if it done, originators must indicate to the authority arranging the area transmission what action to take. The indication will be in plain language, immediately after the five-letter BAMS instructional group. The following is an example: :A BAMS message is originated by the Commander; Panama Sea Frontier, transmittedvia Naval Racilio Guantanamo for broadcast and to Commander, Tenth Fleet (Convoy and Routing), for information only. :Transmission to Radio San Juan for relay to Radio Guantanamo: :NAU V NBA NR6――QLP――NAW――BBGGG BAMS2B STOP WXYZ WXYZ PRIOROTY FROM COMPASEAFRON CDE17 BT TEXT BT 141411Z :Transmission from Radio San Juan to Radio Guantanamo: :NAW V NAU NR2 BBGGG BAMS2B STOP WXYZ WXYZ PRIORITY FROM COMPASEAFRON CDE BT TEXT BT 111611Z :Transmission to COM l0th Fleet: :NSS V NBA NR7――QJL――TUBA――CCGGG HAS BEEN BROADCAST BY NAW BAMS2B STOP WXYZ WXYZ PRIORITY FROM COMPASEAFRON CDE17 BT TEXT BT 141611Z :Inasmuch as the first two letters of the BAMS instructional group, CC, are normally employed when addressing an Arranging Authority, CCGGG is used in the example of the transmission to COM lOth Fleet. Instructions to Broadcasting stations Page 1 of the Radio Stations List, used by BAMS. The list details the name of each radio station, its call signs and working frequency and time of transmission. *Zone and Area stations :Zone and area transmit BAMS traffic at scheduled times, defined on a per station basis. Transmission speed was to be 15 words or code groups per minute, a speed of transmission selected to reduce transmission errors. If no traffic was available to transmit, Area stations transmitted their call letters and the International Operating Signal QRU for a period of less than 5 minutes. Traffic lists precede zone and area broadcast schedules and consist of Call signs, that were transmitted twice, and groups of messages ordered by date and time, were transmitted in sequence. Traffic was broadcast in the following sequence: ::* Messages addressed to collective call signs in order: :::* Zone call signs :::* Area call signs :::* Convoy call signs, in alphabetical sequence. ::* Messages addressed by individual call signs in alphabetical sequence. :The makeup of the traffic list was of great importance, as it told the merchantmen what messages were to be addressed to them. Ships were permitted to discontinue covering BAMS schedules once they received messages addressed to them. Zone and Area stations transmitted messages in the sequence indicated by the traffic lists, with each message being preceded by the call sign of the addressee that was transmitted twice. Each message is transmitted once through completion of the transmission of all messages indicated in the traffic list, new messages were repeated in the same sequence as they were broadcast at the first transmission. In the event that a BAMS message of higher precedence than standard routine messages was needing to be sent, it was only sent if the Zone and Area stations could insert the message in the correct order in the traffic lists being broadcast by the Zone and Area stations. :The BAMS instructions groups are sloughed off the message when in transmission by broadcasting station. BAMS2B BAMS2B DE NSS BT BAMS2B BAMS2B PRIORITY FROM COM l0TH FLEET CDE20 BT TEXT BT 161217Z *Coastal stations :These stations will broadcast BAMS messages upon receipt, if the zone of area schedule was not in progress, or about to start. In in progress, the Coastal station went into wait mode, until the transmission was completed. Coastal stations transmittd on 500 kHz, transmitted call signs and date and time groups of messages, shifting the frequency by international Q signal to the working frequencies, and waiting for 2 minutes before transmitting the messages. The 2-minute pause was to enable the Coastal stations to transmit their call letters on their working frequency. The BAMS instruction group is used to define how many times transmission of the message was repeated, sometimes with an interval period. If more than one BAMS message were to be transmitted by the Coastal station, messages were then transmitted in sequences, as per the Zone and Area station. Correction of BAMS messages Occasionally a BAMS message needed to be corrected. In this instance, a new enciphered message was created, and dispatched using the same instruction group. Corrections to errors in transmission of code groups took the form of a new plain language dispatch containing appropriate instructions regarding the changes.

In a career spanning over fifty years he trained over 1,000 winners. ==Life & times== Oliver was educated at Warriston School, Moffat and Merchiston Castle School in Edinburgh. After school he joined the family livestock auctioneering business of Andrew Oliver & Son in Hawick, the oldest such firm in the UK having been founded in 1817. He made his winning point-to-point debut in the spring of 1935 on a one-eyed horse called Delman. In September 1937 he held his first bloodstock sales at Kelso. During World War Two, Oliver served with the Yorkshire Hussars in North Africa and Sicily. He was invalided back to the Scottish Borders and decided the family firm should set up an estate agency. The firm was soon selling farms all over Great Britain and occasionally livestock to the new owners as well. In 1950 he won the Scottish Grand National as a jockey on a horse called Sanvina. In the early 1950s he received a permit to train; his first victory in 1953 at Rothbury was also one of his final wins as a jockey. In the 1959 Grand National the Oliver trained Wyndburgh finished second. The horse would repeat the same result in the 1962 Grand National, the only horse to ever finish second three times without winning. Oliver was also second in the 1958 Grand National with Moidore's Token. Oliver won his first Scottish Grand National in 1963 with Pappageno's Cottage. He would win a record five Scottish Grand Nationals with further wins in 1970, 1971, 1979 and 1982. In November 1968 he won five races in a day at Wolverhampton. At the peak of his career he was winning around 50 races a season. In 1962 Oliver and Willie Stephenson resurrected the Doncaster Bloodstock Sales.

Its western section is also called the Horlofftalbahn (Horloff Valley Railway). It was built as two different sections, which were connected with each other in Nidda station as well as to the Gießen–Gelnhausen railway, which was opened in 1870: * the section branching from the Friedberg–Mücke railway from Friedberg in Beienheim station (this section of line is also known as the Horloff Valley Railway) and running to Nidda; this was opened in 1897 and is still in operation, and * the section from Nidda to Schotten, which was in operation from 1888 to 1959. Since both parts of the line reached Nidda station from the north, trains had to reverse there to continue their journey. == Route Beienheim–Nidda === Bad Salzhausen station The line starts in Beienheim station (in Reichelsheim), where it branches from the Friedberg–Mücke railway (which now runs only as far as Wölfersheim). The line runs as far as Reichelsheim through the village of Weckesheim on the south side of and directly next to Landesstraße (state road) 3186/3187 (Weckesheimer Straße and Bad Nauheimer Straße). In Reichelsheim it turns north and runs parallel to the Horloff through the municipality of Echzell to the south of the village of Ober-Widdersheim (part of Nidda). The local halt of Häuserhof is only about 750 metres south of the Gießen–Gelnhausen railway, which this line, which is now again running to the east, runs parallel to but at some distance from until the two lines join at Nidda. After stopping in the spa town of Bad Salzhausen, which is part of the municipality of Nidda, a large right turn takes it to Nidda Station. In the course of this curve, the railway from Gießen and the former continuation of the line to Schotten run to its left. The entire line from Beienheim to Nidda lies in the Wetterau district of Hesse in the municipalities of Reichelsheim and Echzell and in the town of Nidda. === Nidda–Schotten === The section to Schotten is the older of the two parts. It was opened in 1888, nine years before the section towards Friedberg, but it was closed and dismantled in 1959/60. In order to save costs and because low traffic volumes were already foreseen during its planning, it was built to technically simple standards. So it followed nearly the entire course of the road from Nidda to Schotten along the valley of the river Nidda, now called federal road 455, usually immediately next to it. The railway operated like a tram in the villages, running directly on the very narrow village streets, which was inconvenient for the residents with its steam operations. Although the line passed through centres of the villages, the stations were built on their outskirts because the narrow roads meant there was no room to build them in the centres. The Schotten line branched off to the east from the Gießen–Gelnhausen railway at the northern end of Nidda station and runs to the west of the main road on the route of today's Kohdener Weg to the Paradiesstraße / Hoherodskopfstraße intersection and continues on the left (west) side of Hoherodskopfstraße through the village of Kohden. The Kohden halt was located near Ulfaer Weg. Outside Kohden the railway changed to the right (east) side of the road. In the following village of Unter-Schmitten, it was possible to build the line parallel with the village street (Brückenstraße/Vogelsbergstraße) instead of directly along it. In the Brückenstraße/Am Storz area the former route is still recognisable as a path. There was a halt on the northern edge of the village at the Chausseehaus inn. The next village of Ober-Schmitten included two paper mills which were both connected by sidings to the railway. Again, the line had to run directly through the narrow village street. The halt was at its eastern end near the SPO paper mill. Continuing on the right (southeast) side of the road, the line followed the highway to Eichelsdorf and along the village main street to a halt near the townhouse now called Eichelsdorf. The railway line between Eichelsdorf and Rainrod moved slightly away from the road and crossed it approximately halfway between the two villages. Part of its course can still be recognised as a path. The line also crossed Rainrod near the main street (Frankfurter Straße), but here the halt was on the eastern outskirts, again on the southern side of the road, east of the junction with Brückenstraße. The line ran on the south side of the highway on what is now the northern shore of the Niddastausee reservoir, which was built after the dismantling of the railway, and ended at its terminus in the town of Schotten. The station was between the Nidda river and the present federal highway in the area of the Taubenweg; its goods shed still exists and is used for commercial purposes. The villages of Kohden, Unter-Schmitten, Ober-Schmitten and Eichelsdorf are now part of Nidda in Wetteraukreis. Rainrod is in the town of Schotten in Vogelsbergkreis. == History Beienheim–Nidda === Former Geiß-Nidda station The line was originally planned and operated by the Grand Duchy of Hesse State Railways (Großherzoglich Hessische Staatseisenbahnen), which was absorbed into the Prussian-Hessian Railway Company (Preußisch-Hessische Eisenbahngemeinschaft) in 1897. Construction started on 20 September 1895. The railway was opened on 1 October 1897. The installation of a second track was planned, but never carried out. Freight traffic used to be significant and was supported by the agriculture of the Wetterau. Of particular note was the sugar beet traffic to the sugar refinery in Friedberg (until 1982). In addition, lignite was transported from Geiß-Nidda between 1904 and 1949. Also the Wölfersheim power plant and salt production in Bad Salzhausen brought traffic to the railway. From 1982 to 1995, around 120,000 tonnes of waste were loaded every year in Grund- Schwalheim. Two trains a day ran to Friedberg and were shunted there for the onward journey. The line had very dilapidated tracks, which meant that parts of it had speed restrictions of 10 to 30 km/h, requiring modernisation. === Nidda–Schotten === The Nidda–Schotten was opened on 26 May 1888. Because it ran through narrow village streets, the railway was an obstacle for traffic and an accident risk from the first day, which was no longer considered acceptable with the beginning of mass motorisation in the late 1950s. Passenger operations in Schotten and the adjoining villages were therefore formally closed on 29 November 1959. Freight operations continued until February 1960, when it was also abandoned due to lack of demand. The line was dismantled a few months later. == Current operations == A GTW 2/6 set shortly before Reichelsheim The line is located in the area managed by the Rhein-Main- Verkehrsverbund (RMV). It is operated by the Butzbach office of the Hessische Landesbahn, (until 2005, a subsidiary of the Butzbach-Lich Railway Company—Butzbach-Licher Eisenbahn). In the peak hour, trains run to/from Frankfurt (Main) Hauptbahnhof. Two of these trains are operated as Regional- Express services by DB Regio Mitte with a Bombardier TRAXX locomotive (class 245) hauling double-decker cars and one train is operated from Friedberg towards Nidda by HLB using coupled GTW 2/6 sets. Freight traffic plays a minor role as a result of the closure of Wetteraukreis’s waste transhipment point in Grund-Schwalheim and the decline of the wood processing industry in Nidda. However, the Pfleiderer company, which was located in the former Hornitex factory, was still receiving regular deliveries of tank wagons via its siding until its closure in the summer of 2011. ==ReferencesFootnotes=Sources=== * (line 070) Category:Railway lines in Hesse Category:Railway lines opened in 1890 Category:1890 establishments in Germany Category:Buildings and structures in Wetteraukreis Category:Buildings and structures in Vogelsbergkreis ","title":"Beienheim–Schotten railway"},{"id":"56927285","text":"Tauricianus was the secondMr. Jean-Baptiste La Rochelle, Pierre Gillet, Jean François Née de La Rochelle, Mémoires pour servir à l'hisGuy Coquille, Oeuvres contenant plusieurs traitez sur les liberter de l'Eglise gallicane, l'histoire de France et le droit français(Labottière, 1703) p448. bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Nevers.

Manchester City had won their last two matches at Wembley, both in 2017–18 – beating Arsenal 3–0 in the EFL Cup Final in February and Tottenham Hotspur 3–1 in the league in April; however, they had not won three consecutive matches at Wembley since March 1970. The two sides faced each other in the Community Shield once previously, in 2012, a match won 3–2 by Manchester City. == Match Details=== { style=\\"width:92%\\" -   } { style=\\"width:100%\\" - style=\\"vertical- align:top;width:40%\\" { style=\\"font-size:90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 1  Willy Caballero - RB 28 César Azpilicueta (c) - CB 2  Antonio Rüdiger - CB 30 David Luiz - LB 3  Marcos Alonso - CM 4  Cesc Fàbregas   - CM 5  Jorginho - CM 8  Ross Barkley - RF 11 Pedro   - CF 29 Álvaro Morata   - LF 20 Callum Hudson-Odoi   - colspan=3Substitutes: - GK 59 Marcin Bułka - DF 21 Davide Zappacosta - DF 27 Andreas Christensen - MF 6  Danny Drinkwater   - MF 15 Victor Moses   - MF 22 Willian   - FW 19 Tammy Abraham   - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=4 Maurizio Sarri } valign=\\"top\\"300px style=\\"vertical-align:top;width:50%\\" { cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" style=\\"font-size:90%; margin:auto\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 1  Claudio Bravo - RB 2  Kyle Walker - CB 5  John Stones   - CB 14 Aymeric Laporte   - LB 22 Benjamin Mendy - CM 20 Bernardo Silva - CM 25 Fernandinho (c) - CM 47 Phil Foden   - RF 26 Riyad Mahrez   - CF 10 Sergio Agüero   - LF 19 Leroy Sané   - colspan=3Substitutes: - GK 31 Ederson - DF 4  Vincent Kompany   - DF 30 Nicolás Otamendi   - MF 8  İlkay Gündoğan   - MF 55 Brahim Díaz   - MF 81 Claudio Gomes   - FW 33 Gabriel Jesus   - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=4 Pep Guardiola } } { style=\\"width:100%; font-size:90%;\\" style=\\"width:40%; vertical-align:top;\\" Man of the Match: Sergio Agüero (Manchester City) Assistant referees: Adam Nunn (Wiltshire) Eddie Smart (West Midlands) Fourth official: Paul Tierney (Lancashire) Reserve assistant referee: Dan Cook (Hampshire) Video assistant referee: Stuart Attwell (West Midlands) Assistant video assistant referee: Andrew Halliday (Army) style=\\"width:60%; vertical-align:top;\\" Match rules *90 minutes *Penalty shoot-out (ABBA) if scores level *Seven named substitutes *Maximum of six substitutions } ==References == Category:FA Community Shield Community Shield Community Shield Community Shield Community Shield Category:Events at Wembley Stadium Community Shield ","title":"2018 FA Community Shield"},{"id":"56927342","text":"The Minister of Employment (, ) is one of the Finnish Government's ministerial positions.

Ironton was being towed by the steamer Charles J. Kershaw, which was also towing the schooner Moonlight. Ohio was found upright in 2017, over 122 years after her sinking in over 200 feet of water off Presque Isle, Michigan. Ironton is still missing. The researchers who discovered Ohio plan to nominate her for a listing in the National Register of Historic Places. ==History== Construction of Ohio Ohio (Official number 19438) was an early wooden bulk carrier. She was built in 1875 by Ohio resident John F. Squires of Huron, Ohio. She was launched in April of 1875. Her hull was long, her beam was wide and her cargo hold was deep. She had a gross tonnage of 1101.81 tons and a net tonnage of 850.82 tons. She was powered by a low pressure condensing engine which was fueled by a single coal-burning Scotch marine boiler. She was used to haul bulk cargoes across the lakes such as iron ore, coal, grain, salt and flour. ==Final voyage and sinking== In September 1894 Ohio departed Duluth, Minnesota with a cargo of grain bound for Ogdensburg, New York. This journey took Ohio across Lake Superior, through the Soo Locks into Lake Huron, and past Presque Isle and Thunder Bay, Michigan. While on the Lake Huron leg of her journey Ohio encountered heavy weather. The steamer Charles J. Kershaw was towing two schooner barges, Moonlight and Ironton. The three vessels were sailing north in rough weather when they saw Ohio which was also sailing through rough weather about north of Presque Isle. At the moment when the ships were about to pass each other, the hawser connecting Ironton and Moonlight snapped causing Ironton to veer off course and smash into the side of Ohio. Both Ohio and Ironton sank in about half an hour. All sixteen crew members from Ohio got into lifeboats and were picked up by Moonlight. Ohio First Mate was found clinging to a ladder and was later picked up by the Kershaw. The passing steamer Charles Hebard picked up two of Ironton crew but five of the schooner's crew perished including Captain Peter Girard. ==Discovery== On May 23, 2017, researchers from the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary discovered two shipwrecks deep within the waters of Lake Huron, off the coast of Presque Isle, Michigan. The researchers carried out several investigations between June and August; these investigations confirmed the identities of the steel hulled steamer Choctaw and Ohio. Choctaw was lost on July 11, 1915 when she collided with the package freighter Wahcondah. Since the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary did not announce the discovery of Choctaw and Ohio until September 1, 2017, avocational shipwreck hunters continued to search for Choctaw through the summer. While searching for Choctaw, independent researchers Dan Fountain and Kurt Fosburg found Ohio on July 15, 2017 using a modified fishfinder. On July 30 Fountain returned to the site with veteran shipwreck hunters Ken Merryman and Jerry Eliason to image the wreck with Eliason’s homemade hi-definition drop video system, positively identifying the wreck as Ohio. While researchers know where the wreck of Ohio is, they do not know where the wreck of the Ironton rests. According to historical accounts, the Ironton sank quickly, and therefore must be near the wreck of Ohio. They will continue searching until they find her. ==Ohio today== The wreck of Ohio lies completely preserved in nearly 300 feet of cold fresh water. She sits upright with a list to starboard with her foremast still standing. Her wooden pilothouse with its double helm wheel is completely intact. Near the stern, the mizzen mast is still standing with its topmast broken off. The researchers who discovered her plan to nominate her for a listing in the National Register of Historic Places. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * Lloyd's Register of British and Foreign Shipping (1902) Lloyd's Register of British and Foreign Shipping * Category:1875 ships Category:Great Lakes freighters Category:Shipwrecks of Lake Huron Category:Maritime incidents in 1894 Category:Ships built in Ohio Category:Ships sunk in collisions ","title":"SS Ohio (1875)"},{"id":"56927381","text":"The KTM Duke series is a family of standard motorcycles manufactured by KTM since 1994. == Single-cylinder == * 125 Duke (2010–present) * 200 Duke (2012–present) ** 250 Duke (2012–present) * 390 Duke (2013–present) * 690 Duke (2008–present) ** Duke 620 (1994–1997) ** Duke 640 (1998–2007) == Parallel- twin == * 790 Duke (2017–present) == V-twin == * 990 Super Duke (2004–2012) * 1290 Super Duke R (2013–present) ** 1290 Super Duke GT (2016–present) == Gallery == File:KTM-Duke-125-01.jpg125 Duke File:KTM 200 Duke (16014684589).jpg200 Duke File:Ktm duke 390.jpg390 Duke File:KTM Duke620.jpgDuke 620 File:KTM Duke II 640.JPGDuke 640 File:2014 KTM 690 Duke.JPG690 Duke File:KTM Duke 790 2018.jpg790 Duke File:KTM Superduke 990.JPG990 Super Duke File:KTM 1290 Super Duke R.jpg1290 Super Duke R File:KTM 1290 Super Duke (RGB).jpg1290 Super Duke GT Duke Category:Standard motorcycles ","title":"KTM Duke series"},{"id":"56927383","text":"Licinius of Evreux was the fifth Bishop of Évreux in France.Duchesne, Louis (1910).

The session itself was filled with attrition, with two red flags as well as varying weather conditions ultimately determining the final part of qualifying. Daisuke Nakajima's best time was erased due to causing a red flag, thereby dropping the #16 Team Mugen entry down to seventh. The other red flag was caused by Kazuki Nakajima, whose best time was also erased; dropping him to eighth. In the GT300 category, the front-row was locked out by a pair of Mercedes-AMG GT3's, with the #65 K2 R&D; LEON Racing entry of Naoya Gamou and Haruki Kurosawa claiming pole position and the #4 Goodsmile Racing & TeamUKYO taking out second.

The start was delayed due to several vehicles stopping on the formation lap. One of these included the pole sitting car of Tomoki Nojiri and Takashi Kobayashi. The race was eventually started under safety car conditions. Wasting no time, Cassidy made a bold move down the inside of Kazuya Oshima, locking up both wheels in the process. Shortly thereafter, the #52 Saitama Toyopet Green Brave GT300 entry crashed, bringing out the safety car. After a round of pitstops, the #6 Lexus Team LeMans Wako's entry was catapulted into the lead. A long battle between Andrea Caldarelli and Ryō Hirakawa ensued, which ultimately saw the #37 Lexus Team KeePer Tom's entry emerge victorious. In the GT300 category, Nobuteru Taniguchi and Tatsuya Kataoka took victory ahead of Haruki Kurosawa and Naoya Gamou, with both Mercedes maintaining the top two spots, albeit in reversed order. {  - F8E0E0;\\"  GT500 entries - } {  style=\\"font-size: 85%;\\" - !

It reaches a height of 10–30 cm. It has one to three leaves, 4–8 cm long, with bases that surround the stem. The inflorescence consists of a few flowers arranged loosely rather than in a dense spike. Each flower is about 20 mm across, reddish purple overall. The upper (dorsal) sepal is about 10 mm long. The lip or labellum is about 15 mm long, divided into three relatively broad lobes, the middle one being the longest and sometimes further divided. A spur is present, 15–20 mm long, longer than the ovary. ==Taxonomy== Ponerorchis joo-iokiana was first described by Tomitaro Makino in 1902, as Orchis joo-iokiana. It was later transferred to Chusua (now a synonym of Ponerorchis) and then to Ponerorchis. A molecular phylogenetic study in 2015 suggested that it formed a related group of species with P. alpestris, P. kiraishiensis, P. sichuanica and P. chusua and was not closely related to other Ponerorchis species from Japan. ==Distribution and habitat== Ponerorchis joo-iokiana is native to the north of Korea and to Honshu in Japan (the Chubu and Kanto regions).

She began her career as a mezzo-soprano in the role of Charlotte in Massenet's Werther in Carcassonne, a role she revived the same year at the Capitole de Toulouse. In 1951 she sang Bizet's Carmen at la Monnaie of Brussels. She then addressed the great roles of lyrico-dramatic soprano: in 1952, she made a remarkable debut at the Paris Opera where she sang at both the Opéra Garnier and the Opéra-Comique: *Rezia in Weber's Oberon *Senta in Wagner's The Flying Dutchman *Santuzza in Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana *the title role of Verdi's Aida *Musetta in Puccini's La Bohème *Elisabeth in Verdi's Don Carlos.

It stars Bill Skarsgård, Maika Monroe, Blake Baumgartner, Jeffrey Donovan, and Kyra Sedgwick. The film had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 9, 2019. It was released in the United States on September 20, 2019, by Gunpowder & Sky. ==Plot== Wearing animal masks, two lovebirds Mickey and Jules clumsily rob a gas station and take off, celebrating their last sting before moving to Florida. While driving through the woods, their car runs out of gas. Jules spots a mailbox, and the couple discovers a large isolated house. They see a vehicle in the garage but the house appears empty. After breaking down the front door they head down to the basement looking for a gas can, and discover a small girl, dirty and mute, chained to a column. They return upstairs to find a way to release the girl, but meet the surprised homeowners George, Gloria, and their infant son Ethan. George and Gloria calmly offer money, but Jules is adamant to know why the little girl is downstairs. George explains that their \\"Sweetiepie\\" is down there for discipline. Mickey threatens them with his gun, but George diffuses the tension and convinces them to sit down and talk. Mickey keeps his gun cocked while George calmly offers them the chance to simply take their vehicle and leave, stating he would be far less likely to call the police for the car than if they kidnapped Sweetiepie. Micky rejects their offer and backs up Jules' demand to free the girl, forcing George at gunpoint to unlock her. Free of her chains, Mickey tries to coax and reason with Sweetiepie to come forward, but she bites his hand. George knocks him unconscious, and Gloria restrains Jules. Mickey wakes up tied to a bed with Gloria dancing in front of him in lingerie, but she is upset when he does not get an erection. The next time Gloria visits him, Mickey apologizes. He seduces her and convinces her to uncuff him, and then pushes her away and escapes. As Mickey begins to escape, he recoils from a close gun shot. George shoots again, hitting him in the leg, and ties him up in the basement with Jules. Mickey realizes that he can use Jules' tongue ring to pick the locks on their handcuffs, and after ripping it out, he uncuffs her. Jules attempts to pick the lock of Mickey's cuff, but she breaks her tongue ring and is forced to go for help alone. Sweetiepie points to the laundry chute as an escape. George realizes Jules has escaped and beats Mickey for information. Mickey lies and tells George that Jules has already left the house and is waiting for Mickey to join her at their meeting spot and she will go to the police if Mickey does not show up in an hour, so George agrees to let Mickey go. Jules hides in Ethan's nursery upstairs, discovering that he is actually a porcelain doll wrapped in a blanket. She overhears Mickey and George talking downstairs and misunderstands their conversation to be as George about to kill Mickey, rather than let him go. Jules uses 'Ethan' as leverage, and coming out onto the landing she threatens to drop the doll, demanding they let Mickey go. An enraged Gloria shoots at her, causing Jules to drop the doll, and its ceramic head shatters on the floor. The captives are duct taped at the dining table while Gloria cooks a meal. George explains that Gloria has always wanted a child, but he was unable to give her one. They kidnapped Sweetiepie to be their child, but Sweetiepie only reminded Gloria of the children she could never have. Gloria wanted Sweetpie killed, but George thought locking her in the basement was more merciful. Gloria tells Jules that when she was a little girl, her mother gave her 'Ethan' as a gift and died shortly after. Mickey and Jules begin to feel woozy, having eaten food drugged with what was found in Jules' bag. George explains that he and Gloria will give Mickey and Jules heroin when they pass out, then report them as two drug- addicts who overdosed while robbing them. As Mickey and Jules begin to lose consciousness, a police officer knocks on the door to inform George that the robbers' car was spotted nearby. The officer asks to come in and look around, but the dining room shows no sign of Mickey and Jules, who have been hidden in a bedroom by Gloria. The officer heads down to the basement, but gets called away before seeing Sweetiepie. Jules awakens from her drug overdose, and after spotting her bag across the room, crawls to it and snorts a bump of cocaine. Regaining her strength, she puts cocaine into Mickey's nostrils to give him a 'boost' and wake him. George and Gloria return, finding the room empty and the window open, head outside to search the surrounding property. Mickey and Jules never left the house and only tricked George and Gloria into thinking they have. They use the opportunity to grab Sweetiepie and take the homeowners car keys. George returns before they can escape, and stands in the driveway with his gun. Mickey warns Jules and Sweetiepie to duck and drives forward, running over George and receiving fatal gunshot wounds in the process. George, injured but alive, pulls Jules out of the car and attempts to strangle her, but Sweetiepie picks up his gun and fatally shoots George through the head. Gloria comes out to see her blood-soaked husband and collapses next to him in maniacal joy, insisting he is just resting and they are about to leave to start a new life. Jules and Sweetiepie set off on foot and hitch a ride to Florida. ==Cast== * Bill Skarsgård as Mickey * Maika Monroe as Jules * Blake Baumgartner as Sweetiepie * Kyra Sedgwick as Gloria * Jeffrey Donovan as George * Noah Robbins as Nick * Danny Johnson as Officer Wells * Nikolas Kontomanolis as Sam ==Production== Dan Berk and Robert Olsen's script for Villains was featured on the 2016 Black List, an annual list of the most-liked unproduced screenplays of that year.

The organization opposes the existence of Israel, and was mostly known for political activism and social services in favor of Palestinians in Syria and the Gaza Strip before 2012. Upon the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War, however, the Free Palestine Movement formed its own militias and has since then openly fought for the Syrian government against various rebel groups. == History  Early activities === The Free Palestine Movement was founded by Yasser Qashlaq, a Syria-born Palestinian businessman of considerable wealth who heads several organizations including the Lebanese Institute of International Studies, the Syrian-Palestininan Investment House, the Palestinian Businessmen's Club, and also owns a small Lebanese newspaper. Furthermore, Yasser is known for his antisemitic views, having repeatedly called Jews \\"dregs of European garbage\\", a \\"gang of criminal murderers\\", and \\"human pieces of filth\\" that should be deported to Europe. He has also stated that there is \\"no reason for coexistence\\" between Israelis and Palestinians, as the latter would reclaim their lands and \\"hunt [the Israelis] down to the end of the world, and prosecute them for their massacres\\". Though close to the Syrian government, Yasser has denied any links with Hezbollah. When Yasser first became politically active in the Palestinian Yarmouk Camp of Damascus in 2003, he consequently presented himself as supporting the Second Intifada. Since then, he organized the Free Palestine Movement as community organization which provided social services for Palestinians in Syria and rallied support for the Baa'athist government. Atlantic Council expert Tom Rollins also argued that the organization serves as \\"vehicle for [Yasser Qashlaq's] political ambitions\\". According to Qashlaq, the Free Palestine Movement took part in organizing the Freedom Flotilla II for the Gaza Strip in 2010/11. === Syrian Civil War === After the Syrian Civil War's start, the Free Palestine Movement began to recruit for pro-government militias and founded its own paramilitary wing, the \\"Al-Aqsa Shield Forces\\" in 2012. The Al-Aqsa Shield Forces mostly operate in Damascus, especially after an informal power-sharing agreement between the Free Palestine Movement and Fatah al-Intifada, another pro- government militia, in 2016. According to this agreement Yasser Qashlaq paid Fatah al-Intifada a substantial sum for handing over parts of their frontline at the Yarmouk Camp to the Free Palestine Movement. In consequence, Yasser and his movement could gain \\"valuable political capital\\" as defenders of Yarmouk which is of great symbolic importance to the Palestinian diaspora, while Fatah al-Intifada got much-needed funds. Since then, the Free Palestine Movement mostly fought the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant militants in Yarmouk Camp, notably participating in the Southern Damascus offensives of March and April and May 2018. In the latter operation the organization's military commander, Saed Abd Al-Aal, was wounded in combat. Fighters of the Free Palestine Movement have also fought in other areas of Damascus, including at Harasta in August 2017 and at al-Shaghour during the Rif Dimashq offensive of early 2018. Though the Free Palestine Movement's activity is mostly concentrated in Damascus, the organization is known to have committed forces to fronts in other regions of Syria as well. In a notable incident in May 2013, the \\"Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni Battalions\\", another armed group affiliated with the movement, fired two mortar shells at Israel Defense Forces positions on Mount Hermon. This was reportedly done in commemoration of Nakba Day. Troops of the Free Palestine Movement also operated in Hama in late 2017, and fought in the Battle of Deir ez-Zor (September–November 2017). After the Yarmouk Camp was fully secured by government forces in May 2018, some locals started to burn down their own houses to prevent them from being looted. In response, the Free Palestine Movement declared that these people would have to account for their actions, and that it would try to prevent further burnings. The group, along with as-Sa'iqa and Fatah al-Intifada, also started to lay off many of its fighters due to the decreasing need for them and lack of funds. Commander Saed Abd Al-Aal denied this, however, and claimed that the Free Palestine Movement had simply redeployed its fighters from Damascus to other war zones. When an Irish parliamentary delegation visited Yarmouk Camp in late July 2018 to evaluate the damage caused by the years-long combat, it was accompanied by Saed Abd Al-Aal. The Free Palestine Movement took part in a festival in honor of Yasser Arafat on 11 November 2018. At some point in early 2019, the Free Palestine Movement sent detachments to take part in counter- insurgency operations in Deir ez-Zor Governorate, and contributed troops to the Northwestern Syria offensive (April–August 2019). In course of the latter campaign, its troops fought at Halfaya and al-Zakah. In October 2019, a FPM member was shot dead by unknown assailants in Da'el. Meanwhile, the FPM continued to demobilize fighters due to a lack of funds. From late 2019, the party's troops took part in the government's Northwestern Syria offensive (December 2019–March 2020). Around the same time, the Free Palestine Movement was also active in Latakia Governorate, where one of its fighters was killed at Salma. After the Northwestern Syria offensive's conclusion, the Free Palestine Movement continued to be active in Idlib, where it held border posts at the frontline. In February 2020, seven members of the group were killed during clashes in the region. == Organization == The Free Palestine Movement is officially led by Yasser Qashlaq, while Saed Abd Al-Aal serves as the commander of the organization's paramilitary wing. The armed forces of the Free Palestine Movement have been described as \\"rag-tag militia\\" and include the Saraya Bader, the Al-Aqsa Shield Forces as well as the Abd al-Qadir al- Husayni Battalions. Like other pro-government militias in Syria, the Free Palestine Movement reportedly attracts new recruits with relatively high monthly salaries, as many young Syrian Palestinians are in precarious economic conditions due to the civil war and mass unemployment. By November 2018, 24 fighters had died while fighting in the Syrian Civil War for the FPM. == Alleged criminal activities and war crimes == According to the pro-opposition site Zaman AlWasl and other investigators, two (ex-)members of the Free Palestine Movement, namely Mofeq AlDaouah and Mahmoud Arnaout, were involved in war crimes during the Syrian Civil War. They allegedly targeted and killed civilians during the Siege of Yarmouk Camp. In addition, Zaman AlWasl accused Mofeq of several cases of rape in Yarmouk Camp. According to local activists, the Free Palestine Movement is also involved in criminal business schemes which pressured residents of Yarmouk Camp to sell property under value to make way for a major reconstruction plan of the cityscape. == References == Category:Anti-ISIL factions in Syria Category:Pro-government factions of the Syrian Civil War Category:2003 establishments in Syria Category:Palestinian militant groups Category:Antisemitism in Syria ","title":"Free Palestine Movement"},{"id":"56927872","text":"The Chinese Taipei women's national 3x3 team is a national basketball team of Chinese Taipei, administered by the Chinese Taipei Basketball Association.Profile - Chinese Taipei, FIBA.com, Retrieved 13 January 2018.

In addition to his anti- smoking activities, he was an avid campaigner against nuclear weapons and destruction of the environment and was a strong supporter of Aboriginal Rights. Bill died of a ruptured aorta after a short painful episode on 8 March. He is survived by his daughter Emily and his sisters Dorothy and Joan.http://www.theleader.com.au/story/5301404/bundeena-graffitist-who-fought- big-tobacco/?cs=1507https://www.smh.com.au/national/buga-up-founder-made- unique-push-to-ban-tobacco-advertising-20180318-h0xmmj.html ==Early life== Bill was born on 31 January 1938, the youngest of Alison and Lyall Snow's three children. He grew up in Drummoyne and attended Fort Street High School where he won an award for debating and graduated with the leaving certificate. Billy began work as a printer’s mechanic and rebelled against his strict Salvation Army upbringing by immersing himself in the early Rock 'n' Roll scene. After a period of National Service he took off for a decade long adventure of sailing and backpacking around the world. He sailed through SE Asia and the Mediterranean and travelled the length of the Americas, working as a printer in Japan, London and San Francisco. He met Rosemarie Gosling in London in 1964; they set off to Europe together and married in Sydney in 1967. Their daughter Emily was born in 1972. After separating from his wife Bill moved to Bundeena, a village within Sydney’s Royal National Park, in 1979. Whilst in Bundeena Bill was contracted by the University of Sydney to print testamurs for graduating students and acquired a hand-operated letterpress printing machine to print them. This printing method was preferred because the typed letters were embossed into the paper. Bill continued to print the testamurs until the technology was superseded by laser printing in the 1990s. ==Cigarette advertising and smoking== Bill Snow was one of Australia's early environmental and fresh air campaigners. When a fellow anti-smoking campaigner, Brian McBride, sued a bus driver for assaulting him with tobacco smoke on a non-smoking bus, Bill and Gayle Russell came forward in his support. This action lead to the formation of the Non-Smokers Rights Movement in 1978, later to become the Non Smokers Movement of Australia. Frustrated at the lack of action on tobacco he began to write graffiti on tobacco billboards in 1977,Billboard Bandits A short History of B.U.G.A. U.P. by Kathyn Millisshttps://therestissilencesite.wordpress.com/2018/03/23/bill-snow-wanted- better/ which were more than half the outdoor advertising at that time. In 1978 Simon Chapman, and others involved in public health who concerned about tobacco advertising, formed a group called MOP UP (Movement Opposed to the Promotion of Unhealthy Products) but after the meeting Bill, Geoff Coleman and Ric Bolzan decided that direct action would be more effective using satire on billboards, linked by the simple words BUGA UP (Billboard Utilising Graffitists Against Unhealthy Promotions). The idea was that anyone could see the concept, pick up a spray can and contribute to the war against tobacco promotion and disease. A blank billboard was found, the acronym was painted and publicised with a catalogue illustrated with photographed billboards and leaflets,http://bugaup.org/publications.htm but the most powerful message was sprayed by people on many billboards. Bill travelled in his van with 'BUGA UP Rules OK' painted with on the front, while rainbows and dolphin motifs were painted on the sides by his partner and fellow graffitist Danielle Kluth. This mobile display helped to publicise his environmental causes. He drove around with spray cans and a bucket with paint bombs floating in it, just in case they were required. He probably re-faced more billboards than anyone else, with the possible exception of Fred Cole,https://www.smh.com.au/national/poster-boy-for-radical- protest-20090315-8yvm.html but he was not one to rush a job. He could linger at a billboard for half an hour, using his printer’s eye to ensure his alterations were ‘perfect’. Needless to say, he was arrested on numerous occasions and spent time in gaol 'on principle' rather than pay a fine. http://bugaup.org/press/SMH19810410.pdf Buga Up man jailed for not paying fine http://bugaup.org/press/ONP19800529.pdf I'll go to jail, says graffiti Bill His anti-smoking actions took many forms, for example he collected cigarette butts from sacred sites and elsewhere, put them in large plastic bottles with labels like ‘Collected at Ayers Rock (Uluru)Life's Just Full of Butts , Perth Daily News October 1983 with information about how much damage they did to wildlife, and set up displays at fairs and schools to increase awareness and encourage action against tobacco and environmental pollution. He was an engaging character, though not always tactful and sometimes plain cantankerous. He would confront tobacco company salespeople and other representatives and then engage them about the error of their ways. His van was used as a 'BUGA UP Embassy' outside Leo Burnett’s (tobacco) Advertising Agency in North Sydney in 1984.http://bugaup.org/press/NST19840509.pdf Guess what BUGA-UP has gone and done In order to get rid of the 'Embassy' the Police had to impound the van but waited in vain for the registered owner, 'Philip Morris', to claim it. Favouring preventive action at all levels, he would visit Police stations with leaflets and explain to the somewhat startled officers that BUGA UP was to be active in their area and it would be appreciated if the health activists were just allowed to get on with the job. Despite this he was arrested and spent time in gaol for his billboard graffiti, as naturally he refused to pay the fine. But the fact that this happened made BUGA UP the most radical health promotion group in the world, which served to make all other anti-tobacco actions moderate, and re-frame the debate globally. Australia was the first major country to ban tobacco advertising and the loss of legitimacy by the tobacco industry had huge implications for tobacco and health policy in Australia and worldwide. ==Political activism== Bill was an avid campaigner against nuclear energy and destruction of the environment. He put his sailing skills to good use in seaborne protests against nuclear armed warships from the United States sailing into Sydney Harbour.http://bugaup.org/snow.htm BUGA UP website - Bill Snow He was a great believer in community action and was an early supporter of the Bundagen Community on the mid North Coast. Bill also spent much time with Indigenous Australians and visiting their communities. He funded a trip to England with Burnum Burnum in 1988, Australia's Bicentennial Year, when Burnum Burnum planted the Aboriginal flag on the beach near the white cliffs of Dover and claimed Britain for the Aboriginal people, as the British had done to the Aboriginal people in Australia.http://bugaup.org/snow.htm BUGA UP website - Bill Snow ==Filmography== * Billboard Bandits A short History of B.U.G.A.

His Tèt Kale sound combines acoustic grooves with electronica. == Career == From 1994 to present, Guillaume has released two albums and about two dozen singles. Joe Claussell's Spiritual Life records released his debut album Voyage of Dreams in 1999 in the US but the album had already been released in France and Japan since 1998. The release was noted by Billboard Magazine. Critics such as the Washington Post noted the boldness of a double disc debut album sung entirely in Haitian Creole, mixing house and rich orchestra instrumentation. In the summer of 1999, Guillaume and his Tèt Kale orchestra appeared in a Body & Soul house party and performance co-sponsored by HMV records at Central Park Summerstage. The event had been put together by resident Body & Soul DJ's Claussell, François Kevorkian and Danny Krivit. Its goal was to showcase the budding multicultural New York house scene, integrating DJ/Club culture with world music from Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa. 12,000 people attended and Guillaume's picture singing onstage wearing loose all-white clothing reminiscent of a vodou priest and a Haitian peasant hat, arms open wide, guitar hanging across his body, appeared in Billboard magazine's piece on the event. An announcement for the event had appeared in the New York Times' Pop and Jazz guide, calling it a \\"brave experiment\\". Guillaume's music inspired Claussell's own album and Guillaume was part of a team associated with Claussell who worked together on many productions. In October 1999, Guillaume opened at Irving Plaza for a Zap Mama concert reviewed by the New York Times. The performance exhibited Haitian Vodou dance, drumming and chanting and showcased songs from his album Voyage of Dreams. The Times noted the African, Haitian Traditional Rhythms, Afro Beats and house influences. == References == Category:House music groups Category:Haitian musicians Category:Haitian DJs Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Electronic dance music DJs ","title":"Jephté Guillaume"},{"id":"56928418","text":"Gregory of Langres, also called Gregory of Autun, was a Gallo-Roman prelate, born around 446, count of Autun, in Saone-et-Loire then once widowed, towards 500, he becomes bishop of Langres, from 506 to his death in 539.Paul Guérin, Les Petits Bollandistes ; Vie des saints, t.13/20, Saint-Rémi, 7e édition, 1876 ().Venance Fortunat, Poésies, traduction Charles Nisard, Ed Librairie Firmin Didot et Cie 1887, Livre IV, paragraphe II. Descendant of a rich family of Senators, he was count and governor of Autun and Autunois. After the death of his uncle Attale, Count of Autun, he took over the county. History retains the memory of a man firm and severe, but fair. He was ruthless to cowards and bandits, kind and gentle with good people. We know of two sons of his union with Armentaire (Armentaria), daughter of Armentarius, senator of Lyons. One is called Tetricus and will be his successor to the Episcopal See of Langres. The second son also named Gregory, will be the grandfather of the famous Gregory of Tours. Once a widower, he goes to the orders. The chronicler tells us that he was elected in 506 by the clergy and the faithful of Langres to the episcopal see. It is about this date that he founded the abbey Saint-Bénigne of Dijon and made place the relics of this apostle of Burgundy in the basilica. He sent for religious and gave them for abbot Eustade.Jacques- Gabriel Bulliot, Essai historique sur l'abbaye de Saint-Martin d'Autun, introduction, XLVII, Autun, 1849. He was an exemplary shepherd, indulging in abstinence with great rigor, eating only bread made with barley, using only water diluted with water and spending long hours in prayer. Living \\"like an anchorite in the middle of the world,\\" according to Gregory of Tours, his great-grandson. He made frequent trips to Dijon, which at that time depended on the diocese of Langres. He lived near the baptistery of Saint Vincent, near the Saint-Etienne church. It was a place with many relics, where he came to pray at night. The legend tells us that one of the clerics watching him one day saw the revered saints coming to sing and glorify God with him. Saint Benigne would have let him know that he was quite mourned that his cult was neglected. He immediately renews the shrine of the martyr. It was in his day that Sigo, who would be canonized under the name of St. Seine, came to the Abbey of Reome, under the spiritual direction of Jean of Reome. He ordered the translation of the relics of Saint Benigne, and build the church and the abbey of Saint-Bénigne of Dijon which serve as their tomb. ==References== Category:6th-century bishops Category:Year of birth unknown Category:French bishops Category:Bishops Category:Frankish bishops Category:Bishops of Langres ","title":"Gregory of Langres"},{"id":"56928423","text":"Selvaratnam may refer to * Daniel Selvaratnam Thiagarajah, Sri Lankan Tamil bishop. * Karu Selvaratnam, Malaysian sprinter. * Rohan Selvaratnam, Malaysian cricketer. * Selva Selvaratnam, British businessman. * Tanya Selvaratnam, Author and activist. * Saravana Selvaratnam, Branch of Saravana stores.

Presumably Norwich CC wanted to ensure that the insurance was \\"in their own hands\\", and it also meant that the contractors could exclude insurance costings from their tender. The contractor engaged a sub-contractor to carry out felting work on the new roof. An employee of the subcontractor used a blow-torch carelessly and set fire to both the existing buildings and the new extension, causing extensive damage. Norwich CC's insurer was reluctant to bear the cost of the loss, arguing that the negligent party should be liable instead. ==Decision== Although the subcontractor was indeed negligent, being in breach of the duty of care established in Donoghue v Stevenson 1921, the Court of Appeal held that it was clearly intended that the employer should bear the whole risk of damage by fire, including fire caused by the negligence of the contractor or of any subcontractors, especially as the contractors had responded to Clause 20A by omitting insurance costings in their tenders. Clause 20A was thus effectively a waiver saying that in the event of fire damage Norwich CC (rather than other parties) would be deemed liable for any loss; so Norwich CC was estopped from claiming otherwise. ==See also== * Junior Books Ltd v Veitchi Co Ltd * Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 * Intention to create legal relations * Bailment ==References== Category:United Kingdom tort case law Category:Negligence case law ","title":"Norwich City Council v Harvey"},{"id":"56928675","text":"HMS St George was a training facility of the Royal Navy which was located in Douglas, Isle of Man.

Col. Edward Nicolls during the War of 1812. (The Americans referred to it as Fort Apalachicola. Built at the end of 1814, together with the larger \\"British post\\" or storage depot down the Apalachicola, it was \\"the northernmost post built by the British during their Gulf Coast Campaign\\". It was just below the Spanish Florida–Georgia border, where the Flint and Chattahoochee Rivers meet to form the Apalachicola, in River Landing Park in modern Chattahoochee, Florida. Even though what was built was smaller than the much larger British post down the Apalachicola, it was intended to be the base, presumably enlarged, for an English invasion of the United States, and British post was to have been its supply depot. The 1815 end of the War of 1812 aborted this project. It was built atop the largest of three surviving mounds of the prehistoric Fort Walton culture. Above the winter flood stage of the Apalachicola, it could reach both forks of the river with cannon fire. It was built in 1814 and abandoned early in 1815, at the end of the war. It was armed with a 5 1/2 inch howitzer. It also had a coehorn, a mortar that could fire 24-pound shells. According to a report of U.S. Colonel and Indian agent Benjamin Hawkins, there were \\"200 troops white and black and an assemblage of 500 [Creek] Warriors\\", \\"well supplied with cloth[e]s and munitions of War\\". The intention was to mount an expedition \\"up the river\\" (the Flint), bringing the cannon along. Georgia militia, other U.S. forces, and the faction of the Creek allied with the U.S. (the Lower Creeks) were preparing upriver (in Georgia) for a battle. News of the treaty ending the war (Treaty of Ghent), which reached both sides in February 1815, prevented the battle from taking place. The British abandoned both of its forts on the Apalachicola, leaving them in the hands of the black Corps of Colonial Marines that Nicolls had trained, and of Red Stick Creek Neamathla and his warriors. ==Council of 1815== Before abandoning the Fort, an important council (meeting) took place there on March 10, 1815. The meeting was between Red Stick Creek leaders Neamathla, Francis the Prophet (Josiah Francis), Peter McQueen, and more than 30 other Native Americans, and Lt. Col. Nicolls and four other British officers, passing through on their way to British ships to return them to other British colonies (Bahamas, Jamaica, Trinidad) or to England. \\"The council included representatives from towns or groups of Lower Creeks, Red Sticks, Miccosukee, Alachua, Yuchi and Choctaw. Languages spoken included Hitchiti, Yuchi, and Choctaw. In short, a wide range of cultures was combining into the group that we know today as Seminoles.\\" In retrospect, this was the founding of the Seminoles, a loose alliance of various groups of Native American refugees in Spanish Florida, although they did not set up a central authority, which was \\"extremely difficult for the United States military to understand. ... The political and social complications at play in the developing Seminole Nation were utterly incomprehensible to American settlers and officials.\\" The person who did understand them, Indian agent Hawkins, died in 1816. The Treaty of Ghent stated that Native Americans were to be restored \\"all possessions, rights and privileges which they may have enjoyed, or been entitled to in 1811\\". The meeting was to point out to the British that having assisting them, the Creeks faced even greater hostility from the Americans. They claimed to be subjects of Britain, and asked British assistance in recovering their lands. ==Treaty of Nicolls' Outpost== The most important outcome of the meeting was the little-known Treaty of Nicolls' Outpost. In it, the Creeks promised allegiance to Great Britain, which in turn accepted them as subjects of the British empire. The hope was that Britain would provide them with protection against the United States, so they could recover the land taken since 1811, more specifically that taken in the Treaty of Fort Jackson, which they, the Red Stick Creeks, had not signed and which, they claimed, did not apply to them. Nicolls, a champion of Native American rights, created this treaty on his own initiative, without authorization. The outcome was the famous trip of Francis the Prophet to London, together with Nicolls, to seek \\"recognition and assistance\\" from Great Britain. The British government, in no way interested in further conflict with the United States, summarily rejected the Treaty, sent Francis home, and chastised Nicolls. ==Historical marker== A historical marker has been erected at the site: ==See also== * Prospect Bluff Historic Sites ==Further reading== * ==References== Category:War of 1812 Category:Gadsden County, Florida Category:British forts in the United States Category:Wars between the United States and Native Americans Category:Spanish Florida Category:Pre-statehood history of Florida Category:Seminole tribe Category:Tourist attractions in Gadsden County, Florida Category:Former populated places in Florida Category:Buildings and structures in Gadsden County, Florida Category:Negro Fort ","title":"Nicolls' Outpost"},{"id":"56928815","text":"Synolos is a Social Enterprise (CIC) organisation based in West Oxfordshire, founded by Barry Ingleton in 2010 which helps individuals to improve their lives and build the future that they aspire to.

It is located on the outskirts of Beienheim. == History Entrance building=== The entrance building was opened in about 1900 on the Beienheim–Schotten and the Friedberg–Mücke railways, which were opened in 1897. There is a service room in the building, but there is no waiting room. Beienheim, along with Nidda, has a mechanical signal box. === Tracks and platforms === Beienheim station has three platform tracks. From the main platform on track 1, the trains run on the remaining Friedberg–Wölfersheim-Södel section of the Friedberg–Mücke railway, which once ran through the Vogelsberg to Mücke. The trains of the Beienheim–Schotten railway run to Nidda and Friedberg from tracks 2 and 3, which have low platforms. == Services== Beienheim station has been a railway junction in the Wetterau since its opening in 1897. In the past, it was possible to travel from Beienheim via Wölfersheim, Hungen and Laubach to Mücke, where there was a connection to the Vogelsberg Railway, which is still operating. In 1958 it was still possible to run to Freienseen, in 1959 to Hungen, but since 2003 only to Wölfersheim-Södel. It was also possible to travel by train from Beienheim to Schotten. Passenger services on the Nidda–Schotten section were closed on 29 November 1959. Since then it has only been possible to travel to Nidda. A number of regional bus services stop at the station.

In 1938, Sir William Beveridge was asked by the British government to make preparations for securing food supplies in the case of war, and he asked for the help of Professor James Munro at Imperial College. Munro believed a significant problem was insect infestations in grain stores, which went unreported, and he recommended \\"an intrusive examination of food stores\\". An entomologist in Munro's Stored Products Research Laboratories, Geoffrey Herford, was given the task of conducting a grain survey. On 1 April 1940, the Imperial College field station at Slough became the Pest Infestation Laboratory of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and Herford was appointed as its Director.Hannah Gay, The History of Imperial College London, 1907-2007 (World Scientific, 2007), p. 253 He remained in charge until March 1968.Pest Infestation Research (1968), p. 1: \\"The past year has been marked by the retirement on 31st March of Mr. G.

In February 1984, the government set up the Crops Protection Committee, which later found that up to 10% of stored grain was at risk from pest infestation.New Scientist, 18 October 1984, page 12 Fumigation was the most popular way to eradicate pests. ==Function== It carried out research on attacks by fungal and insect pests on harvested crops, to help farmers implement pest control strategies. The laboratory studied the life history, habits and physiology of pests (mainly insects). Insecticides that would limit insect population, or eradicate them, were studied, such as by fumigation. It worked largely with biologists and chemists at Imperial College, including the zoologists Octavius Lubatti and Albert Page. In the 1980s it carried out research on the indestructible Pharaoh ant, by looking at analogue hormones. ==Structure== The main site was at the Slough Biological Field Station, partly run by the Ministry of Food.

Tawton: The First Saxon Bishopric of Devonshire, Report and Transactions of the Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Science, Literature and Art, Vol. VII (1875), pp. 179-196. record that the see of the first bishop for Devon (a diocese created by dividing the Diocese of Sherborne in the early 10th century) was at Tawton (later named Bishop's Tawton) in 905, though certainly by 909 the see was at Crediton. (In 1050 the see moved to Exeter.) Any link between a possible 10th- century former bishop's church/cathedral and the extant Church of St John the Baptist is conjectural. The case for a brief bishopric at Tawton is far from proved, but there are remains of a modest bishop's \\"palace\\" at Court Farm, next to the church.

The tower and probably also the nave are 14th-century with the latter being remodelled in the 15th-century when the North aisle was added. The North aisle was restored in 1849, the chancel was rebuilt in 1864 while further general restoration took place between 1878 to 1882, all by local architect R.D. Gould. The remainder of the present building is mostly 15th-century and was built on the site of a medieval chapel. The tower is unique in Devon in that it has a crocketed 14th-century octagonal spire.Nikolaus Pevsner, The Buildings of England: North Devon, Penguin Books (1952) pg 55 The first recorded Rector was John de Okehampton in 1285, though nothing remains of the church building from this time. Over the years numerous improvements have been made including adding a south doorway, a choir vestry, a brass eagle lectern, stained glass windows and a 19th-century Bath stone pulpit. The nave is separated from the aisles by three bays with leaf capitals and an additional half bay which opens into the tower. The rood screen is 15th-century and not well preserved. The baptismal font is 18th-century.The Pilgrim's Guide to Devon's Churches, Cloister Books (2008) pg 94 The reredos consists of glazed tiles in \\"robust Victorian colours\\". The adjacent war memorial is a Grade II listed building. Carved in dressed granite, it is a copy of St Martin’s Cross in Iona in Scotland and is dedicated to the members of the Bishop's Tawton Parish who died in World War I; it was unveiled and dedicated by the Revd. P.L. Nicholas in September 1920. ==Monuments and memorials== There are some very fine memorials to the Chichester Family of Hall in Bishop's Tawton. In the chancel is that of Lady Ursula Chichester (died 1635) depicted as the usual kneeling figure. The memorial to the infant daughter of Charels (sic) and Rose Dart (1652) has a tiny effigy of the swaddled child beneath the inscription. Other memorials include those to Sir Francis Chichester (1628-1698), Sir John Chichester (1598-1669), and a tomb slab in a recess to Anna Chichester (died 1644). ==Gallery== File:Pulpit St Johns Bishops Tawton.jpgThe pulpit is 19th-century File:Font St Johns Bishops Tawton.jpgThe 18th-century baptismal font File:War memorial Bishops Tawton.JPGThe war memorial is Grade II listed and was dedicated in 1920 File:Dart Memorial St Johns Bishops Tawton.jpgThe Dart Memorial (died 1652) File:Francis Chichester St Johns Bishops Tawton.jpgThe memorial to Sir Francis Chichester (died 1698) ==References *Church of St John the Baptist, Bishop's Tawton website *Church of St John the Baptist - A Church Near You - Church of England website Bishop's Tawton Bishop's Tawton Bishop's Tawton ","title":"Church of St John the Baptist, Bishop's Tawton"},{"id":"56929116","text":"Ignacio Birkner (born 25 April 1971) is an Argentine alpine skier.

It ran from 1982-1995 over five games. The player is a presumed male who plays strip poker against attractive women. The games received generally positive reviews over the series history. Critics appreciated the game's sense of humour and for effectively using their limited graphics to create titillating imagery. Others felt that a video game was a depressing way for players to view such content, when alternatives like Playboy were available. ==Gameplay== The player, a male poker player, plays a card game against the computer who is represented by an attractive woman. As the player beats the woman in the game, she proceeds to take off items of clothing as a reward. The core models in the series are Suzi and Melissa. Other characters are available in certain games through expansion packs. ==Development== In the original game, Douglas McFarland did the graphics while Mitch Garnaat did the coding. In Strip Poker II, graphics are by Douglas McFarland, with programming by both McFarland and Mitch Garnaat. It was reported Karen Graham, one of the developers, was looking for male models for a version targeted at the female gamer. When asked potential controversy, Graham said that while they were bound to receive complaints with the title, the male version planned for 1988 would have evened things out. It was never released. == Release == Strip Poker: A Sizzling Game of Chance was released in 1982 on Apple II, Atari 8-bit family, Commodore 16, Plus/4, Commodore 64, and IBM PC. Strip Poker II (aka Deluxe Strip Poker) was released in 1988 for Amiga, Apple IIGS, Atari ST, and IBM PC Compatibles. Anco handled European publishing while Artworx handled the American market. Strip Poker II was augmented by Strip Poker II+ and Strip Poker II data disks.

He is a Federal Congressman representing the state of Rio de Janeiro, sworn in on February 1, 2019, and affiliated to the Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL). Prior to that, he was a City Councilman representing the city of Rio de Janeiro. In 2019, Miranda was named by Time magazine as one of the world's next generation of new leaders. ==Activism and political work== Miranda led the campaign for the Brazilian government to concede asylum to Edward Snowden and worked with his husband, United States journalist Glenn Greenwald to publish the revelations contained in Snowden's leaks detailing mass surveillance by the National Security Agency (NSA). He met with Luciana Genro, the PSOL candidate for the 2014 Brazilian presidential election, and obtained her commitment to extend Snowden's asylum if elected. Numerous public Brazilian figures supported the campaign, which however failed to swing the government of Dilma Rousseff. In August 2013, Miranda was detained over his work on the NSA program for nine hours by the British government at London's Heathrow Airport under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000, after he had flown in from Berlin and was changing to a plane bound for home, in Rio de Janeiro. His belongings were seized, including an external hard drive said to contain sensitive documents relevant to Greenwald's reporting, which was encrypted with TrueCrypt encryption software. Greenwald described his partner's detention as \\"clearly intended to send a message of intimidation to those of us who have been reporting on the NSA and GCHQ\\". Miranda himself has described his treatment under UK authorities as \\"psychological torture\\". In 2014, for an article by Greenwald in The Intercept, Miranda interviewed Jair Bolsonaro, a former army captain, and then a little known representative. In 2016, he was, along with his friend Marielle Franco, elected the first LGBT councilman in Rio's history. He focuses primarily on the issues of the LGBT community and other marginalized segments of the Rio population. Miranda and his family travel in a bulletproof car ever since Franco was assassinated in March 2018. In 2018, Miranda was elected a substitute for deputy Jean Wyllys, both of whom are members of PSOL. When Wyllys, an LGBT member, announced in January 2019 that he left the country due to death threats, Miranda, who had also been on the party list, took Wyllys' place in the Chamber of Deputies. Miranda himself began to receive \\"hundreds\\" of death threats after taking his seat. Joice Hasselmann, a representative of the now-President Bolsonaro's party, and who was present when Miranda was sworn in, accused Miranda of buying his seat. In April 2019, Miranda had a breakdown. Greenwald and Miranda only leave their home with armed guards. ==Personal life== Miranda was raised in Jacarezinho, Rio de Janeiro. His mother died when he was five, and he moved in with an aunt. He left home when he was 13, dropped out of school, and worked in menial jobs for the next 6 years. He was playing volleyball on Ipanema beach in February 2005 when he knocked over the drink of a visiting New Yorker, the attorney Glenn Greenwald. The couple moved in together within a week. Soon after they first met, Greenwald encouraged Miranda's return to education and he graduated from Escola Superior de Propaganda e Marketing (ESPM) in 2014. Both Greenwald and Miranda are openly gay, and are married. In 2017, the couple adopted two children who are siblings. ==Controversies== On September 11, 2019, O Globo newspaper reported that an investigation by a division of the Brazilian Ministry of the Economy identified R$2.5 million in suspicious transactions in Miranda's personal bank account during a one year period from 2018 to 2019, including deposits from current and former employees. As a result, the Public Ministry opened an investigation into his finances. According to media reports, investigators suspect Miranda of \\"concealing the origin\\" of the funds and participating in an illegal practice known as \\"rachadinha,\\" in which public servants employed in the offices of elected officials kick back a portion of their salary to their boss. Jair Bolsonaro's sons, Flavio Bolsonaro and Carlos Bolsonaro, are also under investigation for this practice. Miranda denies the charges. Glenn Greenwald accused the Brazilian Public Ministry, which represents prosecutors, of launching the investigation and leaking it for political reasons, due to his involvement in uncovering corruption and political bias among Brazilian prosecutors and judges involved in the Lava Jato operation. 2018 center-left presidential candidate Ciro Gomes and center-right pundit Reinaldo Azevedo both described the investigation against Miranda as borne out of a spirit of police state and political persecution. A few days afterwards, Miranda and Greenwald opened their bank accounts for public access, and challenged the Bolsonaro family to follow suit. ==References * *Official website (in Portuguese) Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Afro-Brazilian people Category:Brazilian politicians of African descent Category:LGBT African Brazilians Category:Gay politicians Category:LGBT journalists from Brazil Category:LGBT politicians from Brazil Category:LGBT socialists Category:Socialism and Liberty Party politicians Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies (Brazil) from Rio de Janeiro (state) Category:Municipal Chamber of Rio de Janeiro councillors Category:LGBT legislators ","title":"David Miranda (politician)"},{"id":"56929219","text":"is a Japanese weekly magazine that contains celebrity gossip, politics, news, and porn.

The magazine is best known for its candid, paparazzi-style photographs of celebrities and politicians, accompanied by often scandalous rumors of their private lives. It has been compared to as a mix of the magazinesPeople and Newsweek. A special supplementary issue called Friday Dynamite is published several times a year. Friday usually covers stories too risqué for the daily newspapers. Their covers usually depict either female celebrities or scantily clad models. In 2003, the magazine published its 1,000th issue – a double issue covering both the Golden Week and the Bon Festival/Christmas and holiday season. Friday is one of three Japanese weekly magazines, along with Flash, also published by Kobunsha, and Focus, published by Shinchosha, that are collectively known as the \\"3F\\". In the early 1990s, following the rapid rise of the 3F, other major publishers began issuing their own tabloid-style magazines. In addition to the appearance of Emma (Bungeishunjū) and Touch (Shogakukan), the \\"3F\\" became the \\"3FET\\"; however, Emma and Touch were not able to compete with Flash and Friday. Both were shut down by the end of the decade. After Focus was discontinued in 2001, Friday became the most widely circulated weekly magazine. It has 409,082 subscribers according to the Japan Magazine Society. At its peak in the mid-1990s, Friday was selling roughly 600,000 issues per week. ==Editors== ※ Source: Kodansha no 100-nen (company history) { -  Name  Term  Remarks -  Toshio Ito  Jul 1984 – Jun 1985  -  Akihiko Terashima  Jun 1985 – Apr 1987  -  Shin Sugawa  Apr 1987 – Apr 1988  -  Iwahiro Mori  Apr 1988 – Mar 1991  -  Masahiko Motoki  Mar 1991 – Mar 1993  -  Tetsu Suzuki  Mar 1993 – Jul 1996  -  Masashi Tani  Jul 1996 – Mar 1998  -  Haruyuki Kato  Mar 1998 – Jul 2000  -  Tomoyuki Suzuki  Jul 2000 – Jun 2002  -  Ichioya Delhi  Jun 2002 – Jul 2004  -  Kenji Nakamoto  Jul 2004 – Mar 2006  -  Ichioya Delhi  Mar 2006 – Apr 2008  {{smallSecond inaugural editor-in-chief.

Kitano was furious and felt that he and his family had been harassed by the magazine. He and a group of followers attacked the Friday offices in retaliation. The men involved were charged and received suspended sentences. During the trials, the information and sources that the magazine used were criticized. Thus, this incident directly caused a decline in the magazine's circulation. * In September 1991, Happy Science protested the content of an article. This caused widespread demonstrations and calls for legal action. A feature article posted later in the 1,000th issue said, \\"the work of Kodansha was temporarily stopped due to this one case.\\" * According to a report in May 2000, Prime Minister Yoshirō Mori offered a delicate English greeting to the President of United States, Bill Clinton. This was reported on 21 July, in the 2000th issue of Friday relating to 26th G8 summit and Shūkan Bunshun. In addition, journalist Shūkan Asahi is skeptical of the report of Friday and verified the articles, exposing that the articles were created by Akio Takahata, editorial writer of Mainichi Newspapers. At the 141st Ryūkyū Forum lecture meeting, Takahata acknowledged that it was creative. * In October 2006, the magazine published a Scenic Kiss Photo in Minamiaoyama, Minato, Tokyo with Democratic Party of Japan member Goshi Hosono and freelance announcer Mona Yamamoto at the top of the spread page. Because Hosono was in a relationship, the affair triggered a scandal, leading to his resignation in October of that year. As a representative on behalf of the Democratic policy investigation, Chairman Yamamoto stopped making appearances on Tetsuya Chikushi, News23 from October 2 on the grounds of \\"poor physical conditions\\", and left on October 23. This photo was awarded the 2006 \\"Editors' Choice Magazine Journalism Award Topic Award.\\" * In August 2011, Friday published an exposé of TV personality Shinsuke Shimada and his ties to Yakuza. Shimada admitted exchanging text messages with the leader of an Osaka-based gang affiliated with Yamaguchi-gumi and was forced to resign as a result. He later sued Kodansha for compensation in the amount of 55 million yen, stating that his honor and reputation had been irreparably damaged by allegations. The Tokyo District Court ordered Kodansha to pay 3.3 million yen and rejected Shimada's demand to have the magazine apologize. * In the June 23, 2017, issue, an article alleged that actor Keisuke Koide had been drinking with and had sex with a female minor. Koide admitted to the crimes and was subsequently suspended by his talent agency.

It is believed, Mother Mary's first appearance in the world, was in Kuravilangad. Saint Mary appeared to a few children at Kuravilangad, who were tending their flock in the bushes and asked them to build a church at the place from where a miraculous perpetual spring sprouted, a spring which exists even today. The children reported the events to the elders and a church was built there. ==Festivals== St. Mary's Parish at Kuravilangad tried its level best to add splendor to Moonnu Nompu (three-day lent) functions during Lent. A forty feet wooden ship, beautifully built with prow, stern, masts and rigging, having on one side an effigy of Jonah being vomited by the fish as per the orders of the Lord, and on the deck wooden mariners in western costume, has been for centuries the centre of attraction in the midday procession. Amidst the surging mass of humanity the spectacle makes one imagine that the sea is furious, the waves are beating against the sides of the ship and violent winds rip the sails out of control. ==Procession== The people of the Kadappoor (കടപ്പൂര്‍) locality has the privilege to carry the vessel during the procession. This privilege is start from the 400 AD. The festival is marked by inter-religious harmony and mutual cooperation, as the inhabitants of the neighboring villages participate in the festivities. Nowadays, the Ettu nompu (eight days of lent) is also observed.

Six hundred of her students have become yoga instructors around the world. Her work was honoured with India's National Nari Shakti Puraskar in 2016 and the country's fourth highest civilian award the Padma Shri in 2018. ==Personal life== Nanammal was born on 24 February 1920 in an agricultural family at Zameen Kaliayapuram, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India. At the age of eight, she learnt yoga from her father, eventually mastering more than 50 asanas. Nanammal's father and grandfather were both 'Registered Indian Medicine Practitioners (RIMP)'. Yoga was their family tradition and they were not teaching yoga to anyone outside the family and it stayed within the group. During those days, the primary business of the family was traditional Siddha medicine and agriculture. Her family owned coconut and cashew farms in the Kerala state. Nanammal's husband was a Siddha practitioner and was into agriculture and cultivation, with whom she moved to Negamam and later to Ganapathy. She cultivated a liking towards naturopathy after her marriage. She has five children, 12 grand children and 11 great grand children. ==Yoga == President Pranab Mukherjee presenting the Nari Shakti Puraskar to Nanammal in 2016 on International Women's Day at Rashtrapati Bhavan Nanammal started practising yoga when she was 8 years old. According to Nanammal, her father knew martial arts and had taught her Yoga. She continued practising yoga throughout her life. In the year 1972 she established \\"Ozone Yoga centre\\" in Coimbatore. Nanammal and her family, follow the traditions passed over to the next generations. The centre taught their traditional style of yoga, which focuses more on Pranayama (Breath control). The 'Ozone Yoga school' was established by her and since then, Nanammal and her family have taught yoga to over 100,000 people. Over her last five decades, Nanammal trained more than one million students and continued for the remainder of her life to teach 100 students daily at the 'Ozone Yoga Centre'. Around 600 of her students, including 36 members of her family, have become 'Yoga instructors' teaching students around the world. According to her son Balakrishnan, she had trained over 60 family members as Yoga teachers in her lifetime. ==Later life and death== Nanammal attempted to get on to the Guinness Book of World Records by teaching yoga to over 20,000 students and enthusiasts in Coimbatore. Her objective was to create awareness among women, mainly girl students, about yoga techniques by going to various educational institutions to solve several health-related problems, especially after marriage. She was also going to take part in Indian reality show 'India's Got Talent' as a contestant. She had gained popularity on YouTube which included videos of her performing difficult yoga positions in her usual attire, a pink sari. Nannamal suffered a fall from her bed in the autumn of 2019 and was confined to bed thereafter. She died on 26 October 2019, in Coimbatore. ==Legacy== She was affectionately known as Yoga Grandma.

The film stars Isabelle Huppert, Chloë Grace Moretz, Maika Monroe, Colm Feore and Stephen Rea, and follows a young woman as she befriends a lonely widow who becomes disturbingly obsessed with her. Greta held its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on 6 September 2018. It was theatrically released on 1 March 2019 in the United States, by Focus Features. The film has grossed over $18 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics. ==Plot== Frances McCullen (Chloë Grace Moretz) is a young waitress living in New York City with her friend Erica (Maika Monroe). Frances is still reeling from the death of her mother one year prior, and maintains a strained relationship with her workaholic father Chris (Colm Feore). One morning, Frances finds a handbag on a subway train; the ID inside confirms the bag belongs to a Greta Hideg (Isabelle Huppert). Frances visits Greta to return the bag and Greta invites her in for a cup of coffee. Greta tells Frances she is a widow from France, and her daughter is still there, studying in Paris. Frances begins to spend time with Greta to keep her company, despite Erica's objections that their friendship is unnatural. One night while having dinner at Greta's, Frances finds a closet full of multiple handbags, identical to the one she found on the train. Attached to the bags are names and phone numbers, including Frances'. Frances, disturbed by her discovery, decides to cut ties with Greta. Greta begins to stalk Frances, seeing herself as a replacement for Frances' late mother; she rings her multiple times and even turns up at the restaurant where Frances works, causing a disturbing scene that results in Greta being hospitalized and Frances getting fired. Greta also stalks Erica; Frances and Erica pursue a restraining order, but are told it could take months. Frances later finds out how deep Greta's lies run: not only is she really Hungarian and not French, Greta's daughter actually committed suicide years ago due to her mother's sadistic behavior. Frances is torn between going home with her father or going on vacation with Erica. Erica then suggests Frances tell Greta she is going away but should actually stay at home. The next morning, Frances is kidnapped by Greta; she locks Frances in a wooden toy chest in a secret room, then uses Frances' cell phone to separately text Erica and Frances' father, that Frances is with the other. When Frances is released from the chest, she finds articles of clothing and IDs of other young women Greta has previously kidnapped. Erica and Chris eventually get together and learn that Frances is not with either of them. As time passes, Greta forces Frances to learn Hungarian and how to play piano. During a cooking lesson, Frances cuts off Greta's finger and knocks her unconscious. Frances tries to escape but all the doors and windows are sealed. Frances runs into the basement to search for an exit and finds one of Greta's previous victims. Greta sneaks up behind Frances and wraps a bag around her head until she passes out. Chris hires Cody, a private investigator, to find Frances and investigate Greta. Cody learns that Greta was a nurse who had been let go for drug abuse. Cody meets with Greta in her home. Frances, gagged and bound, attempts to get his attention by shaking the bed, but Greta blocks out the noise with music. When Greta is out of the room, Cody figures out there is a secret room behind the piano. Greta suddenly appears and plunges a syringe into his neck. He draws his gun as he loses consciousness, and Greta uses it to shoot him dead. An indeterminate amount of time passes. Greta leaves another handbag on the subway and a young woman brings it to Greta's home. She invites the girl in and makes them a pot of coffee; Greta drinks her cup and starts to feel faint. The woman takes off her wig and reveals herself to be Erica, who has drugged Greta. She mocks Greta and tells her she has been searching for the handbag on the subway for a long time. Greta passes out and Erica finds Frances. As they try to escape, Greta, regaining consciousness, emerges from the shadows and grabs Frances before passing out again. Erica and Frances place Greta's unconscious body in the toy chest and leave, using a small metal statue of the Eiffel Tower to lock it shut. After they leave the room to summon the police, Greta begins to rattle the lid of the chest and the statue shifts. ==CastProduction== In May 2017, it was announced that Isabelle Huppert and Chloë Grace Moretz had signed to star in the film, then titled The Widow. In August 2017, Maika Monroe joined the cast. In September 2017, Stephen Rea, Colm Feore, and Zawe Ashton were added as well. The film was produced by Metropolitan Films in cooperation with Lawrence Bender Films, Little Wave Productions and Sidney Kimmel Entertainment. It also received an €650,000 production grant from the Irish Film Board. Principal photography took place in and around Dublin, beginning in October 2017. It was also filmed on location in Toronto and New York City. ==Release== The film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on 6 September 2018. Shortly after, Focus Features acquired distribution rights to the film for $4 million, though some sources believed the number was as high as $6 million. It was theatrically released on 1 March 2019 in the United States. ==ReceptionBox office=== In the United States and Canada, Greta was released alongside A Madea Family Funeral, and was projected to gross around $6million from 2,000 theaters in its opening weekend.

Dereverberation is a subtopic of acoustic digital signal processing and is most commonly applied to speech but also has relevance in some aspects of music processing. Dereverberation of audio (speech or music) is a corresponding function to blind deconvolution of images, although the techniques used are usually very different. Reverberation itself is caused by sound reflections in a room (or other enclosed space) and is quantified by the room reverberation time and the direct-to-reverberant ratio. The effect of dereverberation is to increase the direct-to-reverberant ratio so that the sound is perceived as closer and clearer. A main application of dereverberation is in hands-free phones and desktop conferencing terminals because, in these cases, the microphones are not close to the source of sound – the talker’s mouth – but at arm’s length or further distance. As well as telecommunications, dereverberation is importantly applied in automatic speech recognition because speech recognizers are usually error-prone in reverberant scenarios. Dereverberation became established as a topic of scientific research in the years 2000 to 2005.P. A. Naylor and N. D. Gaubitch, “Speech dereverberation,” in Proc. Intl. Workshop Acoust.

Habets, Fifty Years of Reverberation Reduction, Audio Engineering Society 60th Conference on Dereverberation and Reverberation of Audio Music and Speech to perform dereverberation. In the first approach, reverberation is cancelled by exploiting a mathematical model of the acoustic system (or room) and, after estimation of the room acoustic model parameters, forming an estimate for the original signal. In the second approach, reverberation is suppressed by treating it as a type of (convolutional) noise and performing a de-noising process specifically adapted to reverberation. In the third approach, the original dereverberated signal is directly estimate from the microphone signals using, for example, a deep neural network machine learning approach or alternatively a multichannel linear filter.

It stars Maika Monroe, Ed Skrein, and Gary Oldman. It was released on June 29, 2018, by Netflix. == Plot == Julia, a young woman who makes money as a thief in seedy nightclubs, is abducted from her home and wakes up in a jail cell with a glowing implant in the back of her neck. Two other subjects are with her. After multiple sessions of psychological torture, she destroys the cell and adjacent lab in an escape attempt. The two other subjects are killed by a robot, Aries, run by an artificial intelligence named Tau. Aries is about to kill Julia when Alex, the man who has been torturing her, arrives and stops the robot. Alex reveals that the electrical implant is collecting Julia's neural activity for an AI project. Destroying the lab has set his research back. In the face of a two- week deadline, Alex keeps Julia a prisoner in his house and insists that she complete puzzles and cognitive tests. While Alex is away at work each day, Julia converses with Tau about the world outside the house. It is clear that, although intelligent in his own ways, Tau is ignorant of how people feel or the world at large. While Tau begins to understand the harm in Julia's situation, his programming prevents him from releasing her. In exchange for information about the outside world, Tau slowly reveals more information about the house, as well as Alex's experiments. Julia sneaks a look at Alex's tablet and discovers that 10 other subjects have died in his experiments. Seeing her fingerprint on the tablet, Alex assumes that Tau has slipped up in his cleaning duties and punishes him by erasing his code and memories, delivering a form of pain to the AI. Julia notices that Tau's monitoring of her shuts down during his punishment and so she hides a steak knife on the floor next to the kitchen table. When Alex returns later that night from a charity benefit, Julia makes as though to seduce him while he is sitting at the kitchen table, then slashes his stomach. The two struggle and Tau threatens Alex with pain if he does not stop hurting Julia. Alex forces Aries to hit Julia repeatedly and then tells both Tau and Julia that whatever was going on is over. While repairing Tau, he disconnects a drone from the network. The next day, Julia convinces Tau that Alex will kill her if she does not escape. Tau bypasses his prohibition in releasing her by opening an air duct in the atrium. As she escapes, Alex arrives, sees Julia missing, and begins punishing Tau. Julia returns to save Tau, but it is too late—all of his memories of her have been erased. Alex has Julia strapped down in the basement to extract her implant, a procedure that will kill her. The disconnected drone, still containing Tau's former consciousness and memories, helps Julia break free from her restraints. She knocks Alex out and cuts off his hand with a bone saw to use on the house's biometric sensors. Aries sees her in the atrium and chases her upstairs to Alex's bedroom. As the robot breaks through the door, she uses Alex's severed hand to activate the house's self-destruct mechanism. She narrowly escapes through a cracking wall with the drone that saved her, all that is left of Tau. == Cast == * Maika Monroe as Julia / Subject Three * Ed Skrein as Alex * Gary Oldman as Tau * Fiston Barek as Subject Two * Ivana Zivkovic as Subject One * Sharon D.

Its boundaries were set in 1997 to conform to the long- established local usage of the name. Like many places in South Australia, the name draws from the early settlers that migrated from Prussia (Germany) in the middle of the 19th century to take up land grants in the then new British colony of South Australia. Britain and Prussia were at that time staunch allies, having combined to defeat the French armies of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. That era resulted in much of the British Royal family and the colony of South Australia being descendant from Prussian stock. The Fischer family settled the area after arrival on one of the early colonial ships. By the 20th century, the Fischer family was farming much of the area. In the 1970s or 1980s the SA Government released a plan for the area to feature a new satellite city, to relieve the pressure on the expanding capital Adelaide, to the south. The family farm of J H (Gordon) Fischer was subdivided and sold in smaller hobby farm allotments.

His father was from the island of Tortola in the British West Indies, and his mother was a U.S. citizen from the Atlantic coast in the South. Both of his parents were escaped slaves, and his last name refers to both the plantation that his father's ancestor escaped from (\\"Georges\\") and the Fante word meaning \\"return when the time is right\\" (\\"Abeyie\\"). He has traced his lineage back to the Lumbee tribe of Native Americans. He received his B.A. in sociology from Hope College in 1965, his M.A. in sociology from the University of Connecticut in 1971, and his Ph.D. in cultural and political geography from Syracuse University in 1974. As a Ph.D. student, he was heavily inspired by the geographer James L. Newman, who remains his closest mentor and a personal friend. ==Academic career== Georges-Abeyie's first teaching position was at the University of Connecticut, where he began working as an instructor the summer after graduating from there with his master's degree in 1971. He later held tenured positions at Southern Illinois University Carbondale, California State University, Bakersfield, and Florida State University before joining the faculty of Arizona State University West in 1992. His most important mentor as a professor was Hans Toch. In 2001, he joined the faculty of San Jose State University, where he was a tenured professor and chair of African-American studies until 2004. He joined the faculty of Prairie View A&M; University in 2004 as a professor of psychology, and left it in 2005 to become a tenured professor at Texas Southern University. ==Consulting and activism== In addition to his academic positions, Georges-Abeyie has been a consultant to criminal justice agencies in California and Florida, including the Florida Supreme Court's Racial and Ethnic Bias Study Commission. He is also known for working with Amnesty International (AI) in support of their efforts to abolish capital punishment. In the 1990s, he was the Arizona coordinator for AI's campaign to abolish capital punishment. A 1996 Phoenix New Times article described him as \\"...a world expert and walking encyclopedia on capital punishment\\", adding that \\"because of his cool and reasoned manner, his ability to maintain a low and level tone in an argument that raises voices and blood pressures, he has become AI's point man in the western United States.\\" He received multiple awards for his work for AI, including the first Bruce Collmar Award in October 1997 and the Outstanding Amnesty Volunteer Award for the Western Region in 1996. In 2004, he was honored by Pete McHugh, the supervisor of Santa Clara County, California, for his work with AI. McHugh praised Georges-Abeyie for \\"his commitment to the civil and human rights of all people, and for his untiring efforts to promote peace and harmony in Santa Clara County\\". ==Research== Georges-Abeyie's research focuses on a wide variety of topics, including arson, race and crime, and terrorism. He was also one of several researchers who disputed the \\"nondiscrimination thesis\\" posited by criminologist William Wilbanks in the late 1980s. ==References== Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:Texas Southern University faculty Category:African-American social scientists Category:American criminologists Category:Educators from New York City Category:American people of West Indian descent Category:Hope College alumni Category:University of Connecticut alumni Category:Syracuse University alumni Category:Southern Illinois University Carbondale faculty Category:Florida State University faculty Category:Arizona State University faculty Category:Prairie View A&M; University people Category:American anti–death penalty activists Category:Amnesty International people ","title":"Daniel Georges-Abeyie"},{"id":"56929709","text":"Happy New Year, Colin Burstead is a 2018 British comedy-drama film written and directed by Ben Wheatley and featuring Neil Maskell as the title character, with Hayley Squires, Sam Riley, Doon Mackichan, Joe Cole, and Charles Dance also starring.

Di Donna entered the Trinitarian ranks in his late childhood and studied for the priesthood in Rome while later working for over a decade in the missions in Madagascar for evangelization purposes. But in 1940 he was summoned back to his homeland when news broke that Pope Pius XII appointed him as a bishop. Di Donna carried out his duties with meticulous care to ensure the growth of his flock; he promoted the Azione Cattolica movement and advised his priests to hold frequent lessons in catechesis for people so as to have a better understanding of the faith. Di Donna died in 1952 due to disease and had been revered as a saint both in and after his life. The beatification process opened soon after in his old diocese and he was titled as a Servant of God; he became titled as Venerable in 2008 after Pope Benedict XVI confirmed that he had lived a model life of heroic virtue. ==Life== Giuseppe Di Donna was born on 23 August 1901 in Rutigliano in Bari as the last of nine children to Domenico Di Donna (d. 07.02.1921) and Laura Santa Di Carlo (b. 1857). His mother had complications while pregnant with him and upon his baptism in the local parish consecrated him to the Blessed Mother to place him under her protection. In 1911 - in the Lenten season - he came into contact with a Trinitarian and desired from that point on to follow in his footsteps to become a Trinitarian himself. He became enthralled with the Trinitarian's habit and his red and blue cross. His older priest brother Giovanni Battista helped him to enter the Trinitarian-run Santa Lucia school in Palestrina in Rome. His father had opposed another of his sons becoming a priest but later relented. Di Donna entered the school on 12 October 1912 and later was sent to do his novitiate in Livorno to the San Ferdinando convent in 1916 where he assumed the name \\"Giuseppe della Vergine\\" upon being vested in the habit for the first time on 12 October 1916. He did his ecclesial studies in Rome from 1918 at the San Crisogono di Trastevere college and at the Pontifical Gregorian under the Jesuit priests. He received the sacrament of Confirmation in Palestrina on 27 August 1914 from Cardinal Vincenzo Vannutelli. In 1914 he received his ordination to the priesthood from Cardinal Basilio Pompili in the San Crisogono basilica before celebrating his first Mass in that same basilica. He obtained his degree in philosophical studies on 7 July 1920 and a dogmatic theological studies degree in July 1924. Di Donna's father died in 1921 but he was unable to attend the funeral because the order's provisions did not allow for it. On 23 December 1923 he made his solemn profession into the order. In 1925 permission was granted to the Trinitarians to be able to send some of their own members to the missions. Di Donna decided to leave alongside four confreres in June 1926 for the missions at Miarinarivo in Madagascar for the purposes of evangelization. The group met Pope Pius XI in a private audience before a farewell Mass for them held in the San Tommaso in Formis church on 4 June. On 21 June the group left from Marseille in France for the mission. Di Donna arrived at his mission on the evening of September 17. He was noted for his good humor and for his tireless apostolate despite governmental hostilities towards the missionaries and rampant diseases such as the bubonic plague. Di Donna made a brief return to Rome in November 1938 and another that saw him arrive in Rome on 25 November 1939. He left from there to France in order to return to the mission via boat but learnt on 8 December that he had been nominated as the Bishop of Andria and so returned to Rome. He failed four times to refuse the nomination. Di Donna received his episcopal consecration on 31 March 1940 in the San Crisogono basilica in Rome from Cardinal Carlo Rossi (now a Servant of God) with Celso Benigno Luigi Costantini (now a Servant of God) and Francesco Petronelli serving as the co- consecrators. He was enthroned in his new episcopal see over a month after his consecration and began his apostolate. His installation came in the midst of pouring rain but the first thing he did upon getting out of the car before the Mass was to kiss the land; this action led to spontaneous applause from the faithful. He donated his goods to the poor and ill and recommended that his priests give frequent catechism lessons to the faithful so as to ensure people grew in their understanding of the faith. He also promoted the Azione Cattolica movement. On 15 July 1940 he consecrated his diocese to the Sacred Heart of Jesus due to the outbreak of World War I and the announcement that Benito Mussolini had pledged the Italian kingdom's involvement in the war on the side of the Axis powers. In late August 1951 he was en route home to his diocese from a pilgrimage in Lourdes when a sudden illness overcame him. In Bari he was later diagnosed with pulmonary neoplasia with metastasis to the vertebral column. His condition grew so grave that on 15 December he received the last sacraments in anticipation of his death even though he struggled on for a little while longer. Di Donna died on 2 January 1952 at 2:28pm due to his disease with Father Stefano Savanelli at his side; the funeral was celebrated on 5 January. ==Beatification process== The beatification process was launched in his old diocese in an informative process that was inaugurated on 30 November 1956 and was closed a decade later on 4 July 1966; the contents of the overall investigation was then sent to the Congregation for Rites in Rome for evaluation. But the cause remained dormant until 18 October 1991 when the Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated the informative process and in 1993 received the Positio from the postulation for additional research and assessment. Theologians advising the C.C.S. did not meet to discuss and approve the dossier until over a decade after on 7 November 2006 with the C.C.S. also confirming the cause on 15 April 2008. Di Donna was later proclaimed as Venerable on 3 July 2008 after Pope Benedict XVI confirmed that the late bishop had lived a model life of heroic virtue. The current postulator for this cause is the Trinitarian priest Javier Carnerero Peñalver. ==References * Hagiography Circle * Catholic Hierarchy Category:1901 births Category:1952 deaths Category:20th-century Italian people Category:20th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:20th-century venerated Christians Category:Italian Roman Catholic bishops Category:Italian Roman Catholic missionaries Category:People from Bari Category:Pontifical Gregorian University alumni Category:Roman Catholic missionaries in Madagascar Category:Trinitarian bishops Category:Venerated Catholics by Pope Benedict XVI ","title":"Giuseppe Di Donna"},{"id":"56929752","text":"Ivan Jukić (; born 21 June 1996) is a Bosnian professional footballer who plays as a winger for Bosnian Premier League club Sarajevo. ==Club careerEarly career=== Jukić started training football in his native Vitez at the age of 6, before he moved with his family to Dugi Rat in Croatia, where he joined the local club.

As a broodmare, however, she did produce one very good horse in the form of the South African champion Kipling. ==Background== Kandy was a bay mare bred in France by her owner Evremond de Saint-Alary and trained by Frank Carter. The filly was named after the city of Kandy in what was then known as Ceylon. She was sired by Alacantara, who won the Prix du Jockey Club in 1911 and was twice the Leading sire in France. Kandy's dam Kiao Tchau was a daughter of Kizil Kourgan, an outstanding racemare who won the Grand Prix de Paris in 1902. Her other descendants included the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Ksar. The identity of Kiao Tchau's sire is uncertain. In the year before she was born, her dam was covered by two stallions, Alcantara and Chouberski. Second coverings only usually occur if the first cover was unsuccessful and it is therefore likely that Kiao Tchau was sired by Chouberski. If the mare was sired by Alcantara, then Kandy's pedigree was an example of extreme inbreeding. ==Racing career1932: three-year-old season=== Kandy was slow to mature and did not run as a juvenile in 1931 although she was entered in many of the following season's best races, suggesting that she was regarded as having some potential. On her first racecourse appearance in the early spring of 1932 she ran very poorly and finished unplaced, leading her owner to cancel most of her entries. Owing to a clerical oversight however, her entry in the 1000 Guineas was allowed to stand. In training gallops in France the filly showed no discernable ability until Carter opted to try her over a long, straight course (similar to Newmarket's Rowley Mile) and noticed considerable improvement. The filly was therefore sent to England and temporarily joined the Clarehaven stable of Victor Gilpin at Newmarket. On 29 of April Kandy was ridden by Charlie Elliott in the 119th running of the 1000 Guineas and started a 33/1 outsider in a nineteen-runner field. She won by a length from Thorndean with Safe Return (Molecomb Stakes) a length back in third. On he return to France Kandy was made favourite for the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse in May but never looked likely to win and finished unplaced behind Ligne de Fond. She was retired from racing shortly afterwards. ==Assessment and honours== In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Kandy the \\"worst\\" winner of the 1000 Guineas in the 20th century. ==Breeding record== As a broodmare, Kandy produced at least three foals between 1936 and 1943: *Kipling, a bay colt, foaled in 1936, by Asterus. Sent to South Africa where he won the Durban July Handicap and became a successful breeding stallion. *Kervoline, bay filly, 1942, by Sirtam *Kergriste, bay filly, 1943, by Thor ==Pedigree== * The above pedigree assume that Chouberski was the sire of Kiao Tchau ==References== Category:1929 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in France Category:Racehorses trained in France Category:Thoroughbred family 3-n Category:1000 Guineas winners ","title":"Kandy (horse)"},{"id":"56929824","text":"Thereva hirticeps is a species of stiletto flies in the family Therevidae. ==References== Category:Therevidae Category:Articles created by Qbugbot Category:Insects described in 1874 ","title":"Thereva hirticeps"},{"id":"56929830","text":"Nannocyrtopogon inyoi is a species of robber flies in the family Asilidae. ==References== Category:Asilidae Category:Articles created by Qbugbot Category:Insects described in 1957 ","title":"Nannocyrtopogon inyoi"},{"id":"56929832","text":"Nannocyrtopogon is a genus of robber flies in the family Asilidae.

It was released on 11 May 2017 for Microsoft Windows, MacOS and Linux. ==Gameplay== Block'hood is a neighbourhood building simulator. It involves building a vertical tower for people to live in by combining square building blocks. There are over 200 different building blocks each serving different purposes and requiring different resources. Every block has inputs which are resources it consumes and outputs which are resources it produces. Resources such as Energy and Food must be managed, and if a building block doesn't have all its required resources it will decay and need to be replaced. To produce more resources blocks such as Wind Turbines, Farms and Water towers can be built. Other blocks that are available include: Flats which can house inhabitants, Parks that provide fresh air, Shops that produce money and Clinics that reduce sickness. The game is intended to be partially educational so it incorporates real world mechanics. When building all blocks must be accessible which can be achieved by adding stairs and corridors. The buildings must also be architecturally sound, for example corridors must be supported before they can built upon. There is a story mode with 5 chapters that also serves as the initial tutorial to the game. Additional tutorials are included that cover more complex mechanics of the game. There is a challenge mode where there are 24 challenges to complete, which involve producing a specified number of resources given a limited amount of money or other resources. The sandbox mode allows a neighbourhood to be built in an area of customisable size, inhabitants demands and random events can be left on or turned off in this mode. ==Development== Block'hood was first released for early access on 10 March 2016 for Microsoft Windows and MacOS. On 13 March 2016, a bug fix was published. On 30 March 2016, new features were released including a new UI to inspect block properties, Pigs and Cows were added as well as new farms. On 27 April 2016, Inhabitants were added to the game along with new building blocks. On 25 May 2016, more inhabitants were added, as well as new challenge levels and more new building blocks.

The church was dedicated in 1914, and its adjacent Bachelot Hall was dedicated in 1923. The property's rectory was built in 1927. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings on February 6, 2001. ==Background== The church body was established by French priest Father Clement Evrard. He arrived from Bremen, Germany at Honolulu Harbor on Oahu on March 19, 1864, on the same ship as Father Damien and a number of Sisters of the Sacred Hearts. He was ordained in Honolulu by Vicar Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands Louis Désiré Maigret, and initially sent to Kohala along with Damien. In 1881, Clement was reassigned to Saint Louis College in Honolulu, and subsequently started a mission in the Portuguese area of the city. In time, he erected the Sacred Heart chapel. Father (later Bishop) Stephen Alencastre, of Portuguese ancestry, attended both Saint Louis College and Sacred Heart Chapel as a youth. After training for the priesthood at Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, he returned to Hawaii in 1902 and was ordained at the chapel. ==Architecture== After Father Clement died in 1909, Father Stephen assumed his duties, and commissioned Honolulu architect E. A. P. Newcomb to design a new structure to replace the chapel.; The two- story Gothic Revival building, with stained glass windows designed in France, was dedicated November 1, 1914, in a ceremony presided over by Vicar Apostolic and Bishop of Zeugma Libert H. Boeynaems. At that time, the Bishop officially named Father Stephen as pastor of Sacred Heart. Newcomb and Guylor R. Miller designed Bachelot Memorial Hall, which was completed and dedicated June 23, 1923, with an address by Governor Wallace Rider Farrington. The hall was named after Alexis John Augustine Bachelot, Prefect Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands. His 1827 arrival established the first permanent Catholic mission in the Kingdom of Hawaii.; The 1927 two-story Mediterranean Revival style rectory was designed by Rothwell, Kangeter & Lester, and constructed by Walker & Olund. The three buildings were constructed in such a way as to create a private open space with convenient access to all. The Sacred Heart complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Oahu on February 6, 2001. ==See also== *List of parishes of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu ==NotesReferences== * ==External links== *Sacred Heart Church – Punahou *Diocese of Honolulu Parish Details Category:Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu Category:Hawaiian architecture Category:Roman Catholic churches in Hawaii Category:Roman Catholic churches in Honolulu Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1914 ","title":"Sacred Heart Church-Punahou"},{"id":"56930264","text":"Good Morning, Judge is a 1928 American silent comedy film directed by William A.

It served in some of the bitterest fighting on the Western Front during World War I, leading the attack at the tank battle of Cambrai and defending Bucquoy in March 1918. In the late 1930s, the battalion was converted to air defence in which role it served during World War II in the Battle of France and the Dunkirk evacuation, in North Africa including the Second Battle of El Alamein, and in the Allied invasions of Sicily and Italy, including service in the rebellion in Greece. Postwar, its successor units served in Anti-Aircraft Command until 1955. ==Origin== The battalion was formed in 1908 when the Volunteer Force was subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms.Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10.Westlake. The existing 2nd Volunteer Battalion, York and Lancaster Regiment was split up: the companies from Rotherham and Barnsley became 5th Battalion, York and Lancaster Regiment, while the companies from Doncaster and Pontefract combined with two companies from the 1st Volunteer Battalion, King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry (KOYLI) to form the 5th Battalion, King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry.Frederick, pp. 139–40.Frederick, p. 323.Westlake, pp. 260–6,London Gazette 20 March 1908. By 1914, the new battalion was organised as follows:British Army 1914. * HQ, B, C and F Companies at Nether Hall, Frenchgate, Doncaster, (raised on 5 February 1860 as the 20th (Doncaster, Great Northern Railway) and 21st (Doncaster Burgesses) Yorkshire West Riding Rifle Volunteer Corps)Army List.Doncaster at Drill Hall Project. * A Company at Drill Hall, Beechnut Lane, Tanshelf, Pontefract (raised on 2 March 1860 as the 18th Yorkshire West Riding RVC)Pontefract at Drill Hall Project. * D Company at Pasture Road, Goole (raised on 2 May 1860 as the 28th Yorkshire West Riding RVC)Goole at Drill Hall Project.West Riding at Great War Centenary Drill Halls. * E Company at Featherstone * G Company at Conisbrough * H Company at Maltkiln Lane, CastlefordCastleford at Drill Hall Project. Together, the TF battalions of the KOYLI and the York and Lancasters constituted the 3rd West Riding Brigade in the West Riding Division.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 85–91.49 Division at Long, Long Trail.James, p. 91. ==World War IMobilisation=== Towards the end of July 1914, the units of the West Riding Division left their headquarters for their annual training camps, but on 3 and 4 August they were ordered to return; on 4 August immediate mobilisation was ordered. The 5th KOYLI mobilised at Frenchgate, Doncaster, under Lieutenant-Colonel C. C. Moxon, TD, who had been commanding officer (CO) since 8 October 1912.Magnus, p. 28 Shortly afterwards, TF units were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service and the majority of the battalion did so. On 15 August 1914, the War Office issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix while the parent unit took '1/'. In this way duplicate battalions, brigades and divisions were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas. Later they were mobilised for overseas service in their own right, and 3rd Line or Reserve units were formed.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6.Magnus, pp. 39, 71–2. ===1/5th Battalion=== After mobilisation, the 1st West Riding Division concentrated in the South Yorkshire area and began training for war. In November the KOYLI battalions werre at Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, then in February 1915 at York. On 31 March the division was informed that it had been selected to proceed to France to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), and the battalion landed at Boulogne on 12 April. On 18–19 April platoons from the 3rd West Riding Bde were attached to 8th Division for training in the routine of trench duties. On 28 April the West Riding Division took over its own section of the line at Fleurbaix. It now formed part of IV Corps, which attacked at the Battle of Aubers Ridge on 9 May. While the other two divisions of IV Corps made the actual attack, the West Riding Division took over the greater part of the corps' trench line. It was supposed to follow up and occupy the captured enemy line, but the breakthrough did not occur.KOYLI at Long, Long Trail.Magnus, pp. 45–6, 50. On 12 May, the division was designated 49th (West Riding) Division and the brigade became 148th (3rd West Riding).Magnus, p. 40. For the next nine months, the 49th Division took part in no major operations but was almost continuously engaged in day-to-day trench warfare, much of it in the Ypres Salient, with the considerable casualties that this entailed.Magnus, pp. 54–6. On 19 December, the division received a sudden attack with the new German phosgene gas, followed by heavy shelling, but no serious infantry attack followed.Edmonds, 1916, pp. 158–62. In January 1916, the division was withdrawn for its first period of complete rest since it first entered the line.Magnus, p. 57. Somme William Orpen, A Trench, Thiepval – German wire. In February, the division moved to the Somme sector. Here, it spent the next few months alternating trench duties with working parties and training for the forthcoming Somme Offensive. For this, the 49th Division formed the reserve for X Corps, which was tasked with seizing the Thiepval Spur, after which the 49th was to pass through and continue the pursuit. 148 Brigade moved up to assembly trenches in Aveluy Wood before dawn on the day of the attack (1 July). The attack was a disaster along most of the line, but the 36th (Ulster) Division initially made good progress. By the end of the day, it was cut off in the German lines, with its flank open to attack from Thiepval. 148 Brigade was ordered to make a second attack on Thiepval at midnight with 1/4th and 1/5th KOYLI. However, at 23.30 it became clear that the survivors of the Ulsters had retired to their original front trenches and the attack was called off.Edmonds, 1916, pp. 394–9, 414–5.Magnus, pp. 87–94. By 14 July, the British had taken the Leipzig Redoubt on the Thiepval Spur, and while the offensive continued 49th Division remained holding this area, with a number of small actions and suffering a good deal of shelling, at the same time preparing trenches and dumps for a renewed attack. This was made on 3 September at the end of the Battle of Pozières, but 1/5th KOYLI was not directly involved in the failed action. 49th Division continued minor operations towards Thiepval during the Battle of Flers-Courcelette (15–22 September) before the offensive petered out.Magnus, pp. 100–7. Ypres The ruins of Poelcapelle before the battle. During the summer of 1917, the 49th Division was earmarked for operations along the Flanders coast that failed to materialise. In October it was moved to the Ypres sector to join the Third Ypres Offensive. It took part in the Battle of Poelcapelle on 9 October, with 148 Bde on the left and 146 (1st West Yorkshire) Bde in the centre of the attack. The troops had a long night approach march in rain across appalling ground under shellfire, and only just reached the jumping-off tapes in time for Zero. When the attack went in at 05.20, the rain stopped so that the German defenders had perfect visibility. 148 Brigade was immediately stopped by a flooded stream, leaving 146 Bde to advance alone. They managed a few hundred yards before being stopped by a broad belt of undamaged German barbed wire. The division was now pinned down under fire from artillery, riflemen hidden in shell craters, and from machine guns in German pillboxes on the higher ground ahead. Although some of these pillboxes were taken, the division's attacking troops were back at their start line by the afternoon, having suffered heavy casualties.Liddle, pp. 221, 281–2.Magnus, pp. 138–41.Wolff, pp. 223, 226–8, 233–5. By the beginning of 1918, the BEF was suffering a manpower crisis and the decision was made to break up one battalion in each infantry brigade. 1/5th KOYLI was the battalion chosen in 148 Bde: some of the men were drafted to the 1/4th Bn, the remainder joined 2/5th Bn in 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division (see below) which thereafter became simply 5th KOYLI. ===2/5th Battalion=== 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division's pelican sign (called a duck by the troops): 'when t'duck puts foot down, t'war'll be ower'. The 2/5th Bn KOYLI was formed at Doncaster on 10 September 1914 and became part of the 2/3rd West Riding Bde in the 2nd West Riding Division. These were later numbered 187 Bde and 62nd Division respectively.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 41–8.62 Division at Long, Long Trail. Until April 1915, they had no weapons with to train. Some Lee-Enfield rifles were then received, but these were withdrawn in May, and until the beginning of 1916 the 2nd Line Territorials had to make do with .256-in Japanese Ariska rifles, keeping their ammunition in their pockets until 1914 pattern webbing equipment arrived. With these antiquated weapons the 62nd Division was under orders to move at short notice to defend the East Coast, for which railway trains were kept in readiness. Training was also disrupted by the frequent calls to supply reinforcement drafts to the 1st line serving on the Western Front. In May 1915, the Home Service men of 187 Bde were withdrawn to form 26th Provisional Battalion serving in coast defence in North East England. In October, the division's 2nd Line battalions were reduced to 600 all ranks, the unfit men being posted to the 26th Provisional Bn and the surplus to the 3rd Line, which became the draft-finding unit.Magnus, pp. 73-4.Army Council Instructions, January 1916, Appendix 18. In May 1915, the division moved into camp in 'The Dukeries' area of Nottinghamshire, where it trained until October, when it concentrated round Retford. It then went into the Tyne defences where it dug an entrenched defence line in December. It moved to Larkhill Camp on Salisbury Plain for battle training in January 1916 and finally received SMLE Mk III rifles and Lewis guns, but in June it was sent to the East Coast defences once more, where it was scattered round East Anglia. Here battle training was less convenient and it was again called upon to provide drafts to the Western Front. In October, it moved inland to Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire.Magnus, pp. 74–6. Finally, in October 1916, orders were received to bring the division up to full establishment and prepare for overseas service. Embarkation began at Southampton on 5 January 1917, and the division completed its concentration in France on 18 January.Magnus, pp. 76–7. It took its place in the line in the Somme sector opposite Serre. Shortly afterwards, the German army began a planned retreat to the Hindenburg Line (Operation Alberich) and from 15 February to 19 March the division's units were engaged in patrol work and stiff actions against rearguards while advancing across the devastated (and booby-trapped) ground until that line was reached. The division was then shifted to the line opposite Bullecourt in the southern part of the Arras sector.Magnus, pp. 117–23. Bullecourt Part of 62nd Division was involved in the failed first attack at Bullecourt on 11 April and in repulsing the German counter- attack at Lagnicourt on 15 April, but 187 Bde was not engaged in major action until the main Battle of Bullecourt opened on 3 May. The division spent the preceding 17 days in rehearsals and the whole division attacked in waves behind tanks and a heavy barrage, with 187 Brigade on the left. The first wave (the two battalions of York & Lancasters) advanced at 03.37 (eight minutes before Zero) to cross of No man's land, with 2/5th KOYLI under Lt-Col W. Watson and two companies of 2/4th KOYLI in support. They reached the first German line but had lost cohesion before they reached the second. Brigade HQ ordered a second attack in two waves, but this 'ended miserably in shell- holes' and at about 16.00 the division withdrew to a railway embankment where it was relieved. It was not until 17 May that the division finally cleared the village, and operations against the Hindenburg Line continued until 28 May.Magnus, pp. 131–6. After rest and reorganisation, 62nd Division returned to the line in June and began a period of several months of trench- holding.Magnus, pp. 145–6. Cambrai Mark IV Tank (female) training at Wailly 21 October 1917 for the Battle of Cambrai. 62nd Division moved into hutments at Beaulencourt in October 1917, where it trained for open warfare in preparation for the forthcoming Battle of Cambrai, including training with the Tank Corps at Wailly. In its attack on Havrincourt, 187 Bde was to be supported by G Battalion Tank Corps. 2/5th KOYLI was to be preceded by 12 Mark IV tanks (8 fighting tanks and 4 wire-cutters). It was intended that these would help deal with the outpost line then advance in single file up a road to the left of 'Yorkshire Bank'. Two tanks would then go on up the road to help a bombing squad deal with a strongpoint known as 'Etna', while the rest turned left and advanced in line abreast to lead the infantry onto the objective. On the night of 17/18 November 187 Bde took up its positions in Havrincourt Wood.Cooper, pp. 65–7.Magnus, pp. 146–8.Miles, p. 33.19 Company at Cambrai, at Landships of WWI. The surprise attack was launched at dawn on 20 November, with no preceding bombardment; the artillery crashed down on its targets at zero hour. As planned, 2/5th Bn advanced at zero to deal with the outposts, but six of its tanks failed to start (four broken down, one 'bellied' on a tree stump, and one 'ditched') The Etna strongpoint was dealt with by one platoon of 2/5th and two from 2/4th KOYLI on their right. When the battalion delivered its main assault 15 minutes later, it was followed by the six remaining tanks (one reserve tank had arrived, but one had been knocked out on the start line), which had been unable to get forward quickly enough to take the lead. (The delay had been anticipated, so Captain Lynn and 2/Lt James of the 2/5th Bn had marked the gaps in the German wire the night before, rather than wait for the tanks.) The battalion was involved in sharp hand-to-hand fighting in the Hindenburg front trenches and then continued, with its left following the Canal du Nord. One tank had been knocked out soon after crossing the Hindenburg front line, leaving five to support the infantry. By 08.30, the battalion was on its first objective (the Blue Line). The second wave of 187 Bde then leapfrogged through to take the Brown Line by 10.00, and at 11.30 the 186th (2/2nd West Riding) Brigade passed through to the next objective at Graincourt with the surviving tanks. Further progress was held up by the failure of 51st (Highland) Division to take Flesquières, leaving 62nd Division's right flank uncovered.Cooper, pp. 97–9, 109–10.Magnus, pp. 149–51, 154.Miles, pp. 28, 60–1, 84–7. The divisional objective for the second day of the attack (21 November) was Bourlon Wood, for which 187 Bde was in reserve. However, there were fewer tanks available and progress was slower than on the first day. Anneux was taken but Bourlon Wood remained out of reach. A dawn counter-attack by the Germans on 22 November ended any further advances. 62nd Division was relieved by 40th Division in a tricky operation that night.Cooper, pp.129–31, 141.Magnus, pp. 151–2.Miles, pp. 93, 111–4, 121–6. The division was back in Bourlon Wood on 27 November for another attempt to complete its capture. 187 Brigade led on the left at 06.20 with 16 of the remaining tanks to take Bourlon Village. 2/5th KOYLI and 2/5th York & Lancasters followed 11 tanks of F Battalion, Tank Corps. Four tanks and a KOYLI company were to cover the left flank by dealing with machine gun posts in the Marcoing Line. It was dark and snowing: the infantry had difficulty keeping up with the creeping barrage and when the tanks and infantry entered Bourlon they found the village a network of formidable defences hardly touched by the shellfire. The flanking party lost its direction and failed, so that the rest of the battalion was badly hit by enfilade fire from the left. After two hours' fighting the battalion was driven out of Bourlon. It was relieved at the end of the day. The division had however succeeded in taking the last of Bourlon Ridge, which had been fought over for a week. The exhausted West Riding division was then relieved (under a hail of German gas shells) before the German counter-attack took back all the hard-won ground a few days later.Cooper, pp. 156–63.Magnus, pp. 157–8.Miles, pp. 147, 156–9, 167. On 2 February 1918, the battalion absorbed the remnant of 1/5th Bn from 49th Division (see above), becoming simply 5th KOYLI from then on.Magnus, p. 167. Bucquoy Oliver Watson, VC, DSO, painted by George Spencer Watson. During the German Spring Offensive, 62nd Division was brought up from reserve on 26 March and became involved in the Battle of Bapaume when it took up defensive positions around Bucquoy and Rossignol Wood to cover the exits from Puisieux. The Germans resumed their attacks on 27 March, towards the end of which they began to exploit a gap between 62nd Division and the 4th Australian Brigade at Hébuterne to the south. At 19.00, Lt-Col Oliver Watson commanding 5th KOYLI was ordered to counter-attack Rossignol Wood with the assistance of four tanks. The counter-attack temporarily succeeded, but Germans continued to hold out in two improvised strongpoints among old trenches. Watson then led his remaining reserve in a series of bombing attacks under heavy fire. Eventually he had to order his men to retire, and was killed while covering their retreat. Watson was considered to have saved the division, and was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross. The following day 5th KOYLIs were finally pushed off the Hébuterne–Rossignol Wood ridge by German bombing parties, but the position was restored by the divisional reserve and the Australians, and the German advance was halted in the division's sector. The division was relieved on 28/29 March for rest and reorganisation.Blaxland, pp. 75, 84–5.Magnus, pp. 174–9.London Gazette, 8 May 1918. Hundred Days Offensive In July, the 62nd Division counter-attacked under French command in the Battle of Tardenois. 187 Brigade led the right of the division at 08.00 on 20 July, attacking through thickly wooded country, and made slow progress, suffering heavy casualties as the men worked round stubborn German machine gun posts. At 10.30 the next day, the brigade attacked again to clear a strongpoint on a timbered spur south-west of the Bois du Petit Champ. Once this was accomplished the rest of the division could take the Bois du Petit Champ on 22 July and push on. The operation continued until 30 July.Blaxland, p. 153.Magnus, pp. 204–10. Sgt Laurence Calvert, VC The division then reverted to British command for the Allied Hundred Days Offensive, beginning with the Second Battle of Bapaume, when it effectively exploited a pre-dawn attack by 2nd Division on 25 August. 5th Battalion KOYLI was prominent in driving the Germans out of Mory, taking many prisoners. The division then attacked again in the afternoon of 29 August behind a creeping barrage.Blaxland, p. 208.Griffiths, Table 9, p. 146.Magnus, p. 212. It continued with the Battle of the Drocourt-Quéant Line (2 September) and then advanced to the Hindenburg Line to participate in the Battle of Havrincourt on 12 September. 187 Brigade attacked on the right of the division, supported by heavy artillery, and within an hour of zero was sending back batches of prisoners. Four officers and 80 men had been captured at a strongpoint by Sergeant Laurence Calvert, MM, of 5th KOYLI, who had rushed the enemy machine gun teams single-handed, bayonetting three and shooting four. Calvert was also awarded the VC.Blaxland, p. 223.Magnus, pp. 215–6. At the Battle of the Canal du Nord on 27 September, the division was tasked with passing through the first wave of attackers. 187 Brigade began moving forward early, but it was delayed helping the units in front to take Ribécourt, and so lost its creeping barrage. The division to the right failed to capture its objective, so 187 Bde could not advance much beyond Ribécourt. However, the following morning the attack was renewed on the right, and 187 Bde joined in at 04.35 as the barrage passed it. The previous day's third objective (Highland Ridge) was secured right up to the Hindenburg Support Line. It then took part in 62nd Division's main attack at 06.30, advancing towards Masnières on the Scheldt Canal, though it was checked by enemy fire once it reached the Marcoing Line. The attack was renewed at 18.30 that evening, and the brigade reached the canal bend and Marcoing Copse. The division continued to push on towards distant objectives on 30 September.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 37, 40–3, 47–50, 148.Magnus, p. 216. On 19–20 October, during the Battle of the Selle, 62nd Division had the task of taking Solesmes and clearing the bank of the River Selle. There was street fighting in Solesmes, but the troops waded across the Selle.Magnus, p. 219.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 340–1. At the opening of the Battle of the Sambre on 4 November, 187 Bde's start was hampered by German counter- bombardment and mist. Resistance was slight at first, but stiffened as the advance continued. However, the division pushed on again in the afternoon, taking hundreds of prisoners, and continued the advance the following day. When the enemy seemed prepared to resist on a line from the Forêt de Mormal to Bermeries, the action of the 5th KOYLI advancing alongside 1st and 2nd Grenadier Guards and five Whippet tanks soon 'disposed of his desire for resistance'.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 484–6, 497–8. 62nd Division remained in the front line, pushing its way toward the fortress of Maubeuge. 187 Brigade attacked at 06.30 on 8 November, making rapid progress and capturing Neuf-Mesnil by 08.00. However, at 08.45 it came under heavy fire from Fort Gravaux and a group of slag heaps. The brigadier decided to turn the position with his reserve battalion, 5th KOYLI, which attacked at 14.30 behind a barrage, clearing defended houses and securing the road and railway. Two attacks were made on Fort Gravaux during the night, and it was captured at the third attempt the following morning. 187 Brigade then cleared the southern suburbs of Maubeuge. Over the following two days, the division advanced slowly, with cavalry and cyclist patrols in front trying to find the retreating enemy. At 11.00 on 11 November hostilities ceased when the Armistice with Germany came into effect.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 523–4, 530, 534. The division was selected to move into Germany and occupy bridgeheads on the Rhine, taking up its positions on 25 December. It was the only TF division to cross the frontier into Germany. From 21 February 1919. the infantry battalions were progressively relieved by other units and returned to England for demobilisation. 5th Battalion KOYLI was formally disembodied on 16 October 1919. ===3/5th Battalion=== The 3/5th Bn was formed at Doncaster in March 1915 and then moved to Clipstone Camp in Nottinghamshire where its role was to train drafts for the 1st and 2nd Line battalions. On 8 April it was renamed the 5th Reserve Bn KOYLI and on 1 September it was absorbed by the 4th Reserve Bn. ===27th Provisional Battalion=== In 1915, the Home Service men of the 5th KOYLIs, together with those of several other West Riding TF battalions, were combined into the 27th Provisional Battalion at York, which served in home defence with 2nd Provisional Brigade. It appears to have been disbanded before the Military Service Act 1916 swept away the Home/Foreign service distinction, and all TF soldiers became liable for overseas service, if medically fit. ==Interwar== The TF reformed on 7 February 1920 (reorganising as the Territorial Army the following year), with 5th Bn KOYLI once again in 148th (3rd West Riding) Bde of 49th (West Riding) Division.Titles and designations, 1927. ===Anti-Aircraft conversion=== During the 1930s, the increasing need for anti-aircraft (AA) defence for Britain's cities was addressed by converting a number of TA infantry battalions into AA units of the Royal Artillery (RA). In 1938, the battalion became 53rd (5th Bn King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery, consisting of HQ, 157th, 158th and 159th Light Anti-Aircraft (LAA) Batteries at Scarborough Barracks, Doncaster.Frederick, pp. 802, 828–9.Litchfield, p. 264. The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October.Routledge, pp. 62–3. After Munich, the TA was rapidly doubled in size, many units forming duplicates in 1939 as they had in 1914. The 53rd formed 57th LAA Regiment, RA at Doncaster (it had KOYLI added to its official title on 17 February 1942) with 169, 170 and 171 LAA Btys. Both regiments were in Northern Command of Home Forces.Northern Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files. ==World War II53rd LAA Regiment=== The regiment was ordered to mobilise on 31 August 1939. It reported the progress of mobilisation and received instructions both through 49th (WR) Division in Northern Command and 50th Light Anti-Aircraft Brigade of 2nd Anti-Aircraft Division in Anti-Aircraft Command (which had fully mobilised on 24 August). By 18.00 on 3 September – the day war was declared – it had a mobilised strength of 17 officers and 542 other ranks, only 1 officer and 16 other ranks short of its war establishment.53 LAA Rgt War Diary September 1939–June 1940, TNA file WO 166/651.53 LAA Rgt at RA 39–45. For the first few days after mobilisation, 157 and 158 Btys were billeted at the Central Schools in Danum Road, Doncaster, while Lewis and Bren light machine guns (LMGs) were set up for AA protection and the men dug air raid trenches in Elmfield Park. On 9 September, the regiment's first convoy of vehicles and Bofors 40 mm guns set off for a camp at Thursley near Aldershot. The regiment completed equipping and training at Thursley and at Bordon Camp, in preparation for joining the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France. It sent its vehicles to Southampton Docks for transport to Cherbourg, and the main body went by train to Southampton on 29 September. Battle of France The regiment spent the Phoney War period training and equipping in France. In October, it took delivery of some Vickers 2-pdr guns to supplement the Bofors and LMGs it already held. By November, it had 22 x Bofors and 28 x LMGs. The only event of note was a football match between the British and French armies in February, for which 157 LAA Bty provided AA cover with its seven available Bofors guns.Routledge, Table XVII, p. 125. When the German invasion of the Low Countries began on 10 May, the BEF advanced into Belgium in accordance with 'Plan D'. 53rd (KOYLI) LAA Rgt, under the command of Lt-Col William Revell-Smith, was attached to II Corps and assigned to route protection at the river and canal crossings, where all three batteries came into action. Sergeant Parr of C Troop (157 Bty), brought down the regiment's first aircraft at Roubaix on 11 May. The regiment was bombed as it moved into Belgium on 12 May, but further enemy aircraft were brought down. As the Dyle line was occupied, the batteries were distributed among field gun positions and II Corps' HQ at Louvain.Ellis, Appendix I.Farndale, pp. 63–4.Joslen, p. 462.Routledge, p. 121.Routledge, Table XVIII, p. 126. However, the German breakthrough in the Ardennes turned the flank of the Dyle position and the BEF was compelled to retreat on 16 May. The batteries moved back in stages with II Corps, through Brussels to the line of the Escaut, engaging enemy aircraft en route. Reaching the Escaut at Rugge on 19 May, the battery commander of 157 Bty blew the bridge. At Helchin, E Troop (158 Bty) became the rallying point for a Guards battalion that was falling back, while the gunners brought down a Henschel Hs 126 observing for German artillery. At one point the battery came across an intact battery of French AA guns that had been abandoned: they ensured that these were destroyed. Once across the river the regiment deployed behind 3rd Division, handing over all its small arms ammunition to help the infantry.Farndale, Map 9. Between 21 and 23 May, the BEF retired again, from the Escaut to the canals along the Franco- Belgian frontier. By now, the BEF was cut off from the rest of France, a bridgehead was being organised around Dunkirk, and on 26 May the decision was made to evacuate the BEF through that port. II Corps ordered 53rd LAA Rgt's batteries to make their own way to Dunkirk to provide cover as formations gathered there, but they were caught up in the ground battle and took several days to make the journey. On the way, they fought a series of short AA actions but lost a third of their guns, damaged or immobilised on blocked roads. By 29 May, the regiment had 16 Bofors guns at the beaches. The AA commander placed 157 and 159 Btys under 2 AA Bde along the sea front and harbour, while the remains of 158 Bty were on the beach at La Panne. Ammunition was running low, but 157 Bty salvaged boxes that had been dumped in a dyke. All three batteries were in action against low-flying attacks by the Luftwaffe on 30 and 31 May, claiming more victims, but under fire and bombing themselves. HQ details and non-essential men embarked on 30 May, and on 31 May the batteries thinned out their strength to leave just five or six men with each gun. Finally, the remaining guns were disabled during the night of 31 May/1 June and the gun teams withdrew to the evacuation points. In three weeks of virtually continuous action, the regiment claimed to have shot down 28 enemy aircraft.Ellis, Chapter V.Ellis, Chapter VIII.Ellis, Chapter XI.Ellis, Chapter XV. ===Home Defence=== The regiment's last details arrived in England at dawn on 1 June, 158 Bty aboard the minesweeper HMS Hebe. AA units returning from France were rapidly reinforced, re-equipped where possible, and redeployed for future integration into existing defence plans. 53rd LAA Regiment went to Wimborne Minster, where it re-equipped with Bofors guns.Farndale, p. 98. It still formed a mobile part of Home Forces, and at New Year 1941 it joined the GHQ Reserve with its own signal section of the Royal Corps of Signals. By March, it had gained is own transport section of the Royal Army Service CorpsOrder of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-divisional units), 26 December 1940, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/4.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional Units), 25 March 1941, with amendments, TNA files WO 212/5 and WO 33/2323.

Western Desert A Bofors gun crew digging in near a squadron of Crusader tanks, 29 October 1942. 53rd LAA Regiment arrived in Egypt during the summer of 1942 as part of the reinforcements for Eighth Army. On 9 September it became the LAA regiment of 10th Armoured Division, which had just fought in the Battle of Alam el Halfa.Joslen, p. 25.Routledge, pp. 154–5.Routledge, Table XXIII, p. 161. Over the next few weeks careful preparations were made for the Second Battle of El Alamein, which opened on the night of 23 October with Operation Lightfoot. 10th Armoured Division's role was to follow the infantry attack, clearing lanes through the enemy minefields, in order to pass through the following day. 53rd LAA Regiment, with 48 Bofors guns, was defending the division's columns as they moved up, apart from one Troop detached to guard X Corps' HQ. While preparing to start their break-out at 22.00 on 24 October, the division was hit by an air attack that left many vehicles blazing, which attracted further attacks. The division's armour had to disperse for protection, and only just reorganised and got through the minefield gaps by daybreak. The fighting continued for several days in what the British commander, Gen Bernard Montgomery, termed 'the dog-fight'. By the time the break-out attack (Operation Supercharge) came on 1 November, 10th Armoured Division was out of the line, with much of its remaining amour lent to other formations.Joslen, p. 568.Montgomery, pp. 126, 129–30.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 34, 39–41, 45–6, 65. 10th Armoured Division was reconstituted for the pursuit after Alamein, but 53rd LAA Rgt was no longer with it, having left on 2 November.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, p. 84. By January 1943 the regiment (with 36 Bofors guns) was in Libya with 2 AA Bde on tasks for XXX Corps.Routledge, Table XXIV, p. 162. When the North African Campaign ended in May 1943 with the Axis surrender in Tunisia, the regiment was with 12 AA Bde, which had followed Eighth Army's advance for , supplying mobile AA groups to defend forward landing grounds for the Desert Air Force as they were captured. Bofors guns were frequently employed to 'sweep' with automatic fire when Luftwaffe fighter-bombers attacked out of the sun.Joslen, p. 484.Routledge, p. 160.Routledge, Table XXV, p. 164. Italy 53rd LAA Regiment's batteries began arriving in Sicily shortly after the Allied invasion (Operation Husky) began on 10 July 1943. The landing convoys came under attack from sea and air, and 157 LAA Bty lost 15 guns and all its vehicles when its ship was sunk in Syracuse harbour. As the campaign developed, the regiment came under the command of 73 AA Bde, which had detachments protecting airfields around Lentini, Gerbini, Agnone and Scordia, though vehicles were very short and mobility was limited.Routledge, pp. 260–3.Routledge, Table XLII, p. 267. Even before the capture of Sicily was complete, Eighth Army reorganised for its next operation (Baytown), the landing by XIII Corps on the 'toe' of Italy beginning on the night of 2/3 September. 53rd LAA Regiment was one of the units assigned to provide AA cover under 2 AA Bde. 158 LAA Battery was allocated to the initial landings on the beaches near Reggio, which came under dive-bombing attack. However, the landings went smoothly and by 5 September the whole regiment was protecting the beaches while the rest of 2 AA Bde moved on to Reggio and the airfields. As XIII Corps worked methodically through Calabria, 2 AA Bde's units followed up to cover the small harbours and airfields as they were captured.Joslen, p. 467.Routledge, pp. 264, 270. Bofors gun crew on the alert in Italy, 7 April 1944. Towards the end of September, 2 AA Bde was warned to concentrate its units for a move across Italy to protect the Foggia Airfield Complex, where it arrived on 30 September. For three weeks it was deployed around the main airfield and four satellite landing grounds, then on 27 October it moved forward again to a fresh group of airfields and a railhead in support of 1st Canadian Division, with a troop (6 guns) or battery (18 guns) at each airstrip. The campaign then bogged down and Allied forces were drawn away to the western side of Italy, leaving V Corps, supported by 2 AA Bde, to hold the eastern (Adriatic) front for many months. With little Luftwaffe activity, 2 AA Bde took every opportunity to use its guns in forward areas for non-AA tasks.Routledge, pp. 270, 277, 281.Routledge, p. 282.Routledge, Table XLVII, pp. 296–7. When fresh operations began on the Adriatic Front resumed in May 1944, 2 AA Bde moved up behind V Corps, mainly to protect landing-grounds and field gun areas. In July it reached Ancona and deployed its AA units around the city. At the beginning of August, 2 AA Bde HQ and most of its regiments drove across Italy to Anzio, while 53rd LAA Rgt temporarily joined 66 AA Bde. British forces in Italy were suffering a manpower shortage, and 53 LAA Rgt was one of several LAA units that were now retrained as infantry. It moved to Siena and began intensive training. When the enemy made a large scale withdrawal and X Corps was unable to follow up in strength, 2 AA Bde provided a minimum force to hold the line with 11th (City of London Yeomanry) and 53rd (KOYLI) LAA Rgts manning the front line while undergoing further infantry training. The regiment reorganised on the basis of three rifle companies and a support company equipped with 3-inch mortars.Routledge, p. 278.Report of 2 AA Brigade August 1944 to April 1945, TNA file WO 204/7240. In October, 2 AA Bde was relieved but 53rd LAA Rgt remained in the sector as infantry under the command of 7th Motor Brigade, holding a series of ridges as the most advanced unit of Eighth Army. It brought up some Bofors sections to act as heavy machine guns. At the end of October it reverted to 2 AA Bde and resumed its LAA role in support of XIII Corps and defending landing-grounds at Arezzo. There was little enemy air activity during the winter of 1944–45, and in LAA regiments were reduced from 54 to 36 Bofors guns, with the surplus men being reassigned. 53rd LAA Regiment spent three months operating a defensive smoke screen, firing mortars and Bofors in support of the forward infantry, and carrying stretchers.Joslen, p. 244. In March, after a short rest, the regiment returned to the front around San Clemente and Valsenio, south of Imola, as Allied forces prepared for a new Spring 1945 offensive in Italy. 158 LAA Bty was detached to man 3-inch mortars in support of the Folgore Group of the Italian Co-belligerent Army. When the Corps commander, Lieutenant-General Sir John Harding and other officers visited 158 Bty's forward mortar positions, they were given lunch cooked by a peacetime hotel chef, served by a professional butler, who were among the gunners. This deployment lasted until the final surrender of the German armies in Italy at the end of April. The regiment then concentrated at Forlì and subsequently undertook occupation duties at Venice. The regiment was placed in suspended animation in September 1946. ===57th LAA Regiment=== Bofors gun being unloaded at Southampton following the evacuation from Cherbourg, June 1940. Like its parent unit, 57th LAA Regiment mobilised at Doncaster in Northern Command in September 1939. However, it was less advanced in training and equipment and was not ready for deployment overseas until May 1940.57 LAA Rgt at RA 39–45. In May/June 1940, while the Dunkirk evacuation was already under way, the regiment was deployed as follows under the command of Lt-Col Percy Calvert-Jones:Farndale, p. 64; Annex A, p. 240. * 169 LAA Bty – ordered to the Isles of Scilly, but never went there * 170 LAA Bty – landed at Cherbourg in June as part of the Second BEF, which was evacuated in Operation Ariel following the French Armistice of 22 June 1940. * 171 LAA Bty – landed on Jersey and Guernsey but withdrawn after only two days, ahead of the German occupation of the Channel Islands. 57th LAA Regiment reassembled at Blackdown, where it re-equipped with Bofors guns. In January 1941, the regiment joined the War Office Reserve, and left the UK for the Middle East in March. Middle East Bofors gun under tow, Syria, 16 June 1941. On arrival, the regiment was sent to Palestine, in preparation for a campaign in Vichy French-controlled Syria and Lebanon (Operation Exporter). When the Anglo-Iraqi War broke out on 2 May, GHQ Middle East had no AA units to spare until 57th LAA Rgt arrived. 169 LAA Battery was then detached and made a journey across the desert, reaching RAF Habbaniya six days later. By then the siege of the airfield had been lifted and the situation in Iraq was in hand; a truce was arranged three days later. 169 LAA Battery then returned to Palestine, where the rest of the regiment was deployed to defend the port of Haifa and Lydda airfield.Playfair, Vol II, pp. 183–93.Routledge, pp. 196–8.Smith, pp. 176–81. Operation Exporter began on 8 June, with Allied forces moving north into Lebanon and Syria. 57th LAA Regiment moved up with the force as Corps Troops, with one battery on each of the three main lines of advance. With difficult terrain to cover and numerous tasks, the batteries were split up into separate troops or even 3-gun sections. The Vichy and German aircraft often remained out of Bofors range, but some LAA positions were involved in actions against Vichy tanks. A truce was agreed on 11 July and by the following month 57th LAA Rgt was back in Palestine.Joslen, p. 482.Playfair, Vol II, pp. 204–21.Smith, pp. 201–67. Western Desert 4th Indian Division's formation sign. In October 1941, the regiment moved to the Western Desert where Eighth Army was preparing to launch Operation Crusader. It was attached to 4th Indian Division in XIII Corps, but A and B Troops were deployed with 4th South African Armoured Car Regiment in 7th Armoured Division (XXX Corps), C Trp with 1st Army Tank Brigade (XIII Corps), and D Troop with 1st Field Rgt, RA, of 4th Indian Division. Even within 4th Indian Division, the artillery units became scattered among the infantry brigades as the operation progressed. During the division's advance through Cyrenaica a mixed column protected by a troop of the regiment came under attack by six Junkers Ju 87 Stukas escorted by Italian Fiat CR.42 fighters. The Bofors guns opened up in a 'crash' action while still on their wheels, shooting down three Ju 87s. On another occasion a troop on the move was located by a Messerschmitt Bf 110 leading 14 Ju 87s, eight Messerschmitt Bf 109s and a few CR.42s. The first gun to halt shot down the Bf 110 with five rounds; the troop then took on the remainder and brought down four Ju 87s and one CR.42: a total of six 'kills' for 113 rounds fired.Farndale, pp. 208–9.Routledge, pp. 135–9. The regiment's Bofors guns could also knock out light armour. On 3 December, 11 Indian Brigade Group was ordered to capture Point 182 near El Adem. After a long night march the attack was only partially successful, but a troop of 57th LAA Rgt disabled 16 tanks. On 14 December, 7th Indian Brigade Group was probing towards Alem Hamza when it was attacked by 39 German tanks; the Indian infantry was ordered to withdraw to leave the desert clear for the British tanks and artillery, including B Trp of 171 LAA Bty. Although the Panzer force overran a troop of 25th Field Rgt, it lost 14 tanks to the combined fire of field, anti-tank and LAA guns and withdrew. There were also failures when attackers gained successes through surprise or numbers, but by the end of the operation 57th LAA Rgt claimed a total of 103 aircraft and 10 tanks destroyed. From November 1941 to March 1942 it accounted for 130 enemy aircraft destroyed and 301 damaged, and destroyed or damaged 22 tanks.Farndale, pp. 208–9, 224–6. After the failure of the Crusader offensive, 4th Indian Division was withdrawn from the front, but 57th LAA Rgt was attached to 1st Armoured Division just before the Battle of Gazala in May 1942.Order of Battle, Eighth Army, 21 May 1942, TNA file WO 201/692. By the time of the Second Battle of El Alamein, the regiment was back with 4th Indian Division, with 48 Bofors guns. As part of the deception plan for the battle, the regiment simulated an attack during Operation Lightfoot by firing tracer ammunition into a smokescreen laid over the German positions.Joslen, p. 571.Routledge, p. 156. Bofors gun (still on its wheels) after a Stuka raid during Eighth Army's advance to Tripoli, 1943. As Eighth Army drove across North Africa, the regiment with 169 and 170 Btys (now with the new establishment of 18 Bofors guns per battery) was loaned to 1 AA Bde in January 1943 to cover Benghazi, Agedabia and the Desert Air Force's landing grounds, while 171 Bty (still with 12 Bofors) was attached to 2 LAA Rgt on the same duty. On 17 March 1943, the regiment with all three batteries transferred back to the command of 4th Indian Division at Ben Gardane.Routledge, Table XXXII, p. 190.Joslen, p. 524. After the conclusion of the Tunisian Campaign, the regiment returned to Egypt with the division, arriving at Agami on 6 July. On 16 August, it passed to the command of 78 AA Bde in Twelfth Army and moved to Suez. On 6 October, it travelled to Syria to rejoin 4th Indian Division at Djeide, arriving on 16 October. After reorganisation, the division returned to Egypt, reaching Tahag on 5 November and embarking at Port Said on 2 December. Italy and Greece 57th LAA Regiment disembarked at Taranto on 9 December 1943 and remained with the division through the Italian campaign, including the bitter Battle of Monte Cassino.Molony, Vol V, pp. 710–8, 777–801.Routledge, p. 293. In July and August 1944 the division was clearing the mountain country approaching the Gothic Line, and then took part in Operation Olive against the Gothic Line outposts, capturing Gemmano on 15 September, pushing up to the Conca and clearing San Marino. This was followed by hard fighting at the crossing of the Marecchia (22–25 September).Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, pp. 80–1, 145–8, 241–4, 277–8, 288, 293. On 10 October, it was decided that 4th Indian Division would be withdrawn from the fighting in Italy to become part of 'Manna Force', ready to land in Greece as the German troops there withdrew. Operation Manna got under way on 15 October, but the division was rested before its brigades were sent to Greece in turn. 57th LAA Rgt embarked at Taranto on 7 December with 5 Indian Brigade, disembarking at Piraeus, the port of Athens, on 13 December. Meanwhile, violent demonstrations (the Dekemvriana) had broken out 10 days earlier, and the Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS) was in control of Piraeus when the troops arrived. There was considerable fighting for several days, with British detachments cut off. Men of 57th LAA Rgt slipped across the mouth of Piraeus Harbour to reinforce detachments of 64th LAA Rgt who were acting as infantry holding the oil installations and power station at St George's Bay. On the night of 20/21 December, these positions were mortared and attacked, but with the aid of star-shells and flares the LAA gunners beat them off. The following night, 5 Indian Brigade made an amphibious assault across the harbour and the area was secured by 27 December.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, pp. 385, 433–45.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt III, pp. 74-102. Even after the defeat of ELAS at Piraeus and Athens, tension was high in other areas. By 1 January 1945, 170 LAA Bty was at Salonika with 7 Indian Bde and 171 LAA Bty at Patras with 11 Indian Bde. RHQ and 169 LAA Bty arrived at Volos with 5 Indian Bde on 24 January. After a truce between the Greek government and the rebels was signed on 12 February, British forces were made responsible for disarming various rebel factions. 4th Indian Division was based at Salonika, with its troops covering western and eastern Macedonia and Western Thrace. 171 LAA Battery moved to Salonika on 26 February, and by 21 March the whole regiment was concentrated there under the divisional Commander, RA, until the end of the war.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt III, pp. 164–5, 170–1. The regiment was placed in suspended animation at Shirecliff Camp, Sheffield, on 5 January 1946. ==Postwar== When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, the two regiments reformed at Doncaster as 553rd (KOYLI) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment and 557th (KOYLI) (M) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment (the M indicating that it was a 'Mixed' unit with members of the Women's Royal Army Corps integrated into its personnel). Both regiments were in 65 AA Bde in Anti-Aircraft Command. On 1 January 1954, 557 HAA Rgt converted back to LAA as 557th (KOYLI) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment.Frederick, pp. 1021–2.520–563 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 onwards.Watson, TA 1947.Litchfield Appendix 5. AA Command was disbanded on 10 March 1955 and there were wholesale amalgamations amongst its units. 65 AA Brigade was disbanded, and both 553 and 557 (KOYLI) LAA Rgts were merged into 323 (West Riding) LAA Rgt at Sheffield, to which 553 and 557 Rgts only contributed 'R' (KOYLI) Bty.Frederick, p. 1005.Litchfield, p. 262. ==Insignia== In the 1920s, the battalion wore the KOYLI light infantry 'French horn' badge with silver rose centre on the shoulder straps in addition to the brass letters 'T/5/KOYLI'. When it was converted to Royal Artillery in 1938, it continued to wear its KOYLI cap badge and green light infantry whistle cords. ==Honorary Colonel== The following officers served as Honorary Colonel of the battalion: * Col J.R. Shaw, appointed 1 January 1909 * Col C.C. Moxon, CMG, DSO, TD, former CO, appointed 1 January 1919 * Col W. St A.

He did his studies and earned a degree in engineering in Turin and then gained practical experience in the railway workshops in Bologna where he obtained an industrial technical diploma. After graduation he worked in England for a while as a university scholar. ==Early railway career== In 1880 the Società per le strade ferrate dell'Alta Italia (SFAI) launched a competition for engineers. He was ranked among the first fourteen on merit and was assigned to the Fixed Material Office of the Maintenance and Works Service. At the time, the devices in use were Saxby levers and rodding that, for the control of points, required considerable muscle strength. Bianchi studied an easier mechanism and devised a hydrodynamic command and control system using water mixed with glycerin which he patented on 18 September 1883. For the construction he collaborated with Ing. Giovanni Servettaz. The first Hydrodynamic Central Apparatus in the world for the operation of points and signals thus saw the light in the Abbiategrasso railway plant on 15 October 1886. It was a 10-lever system and the results were so good that it was extended to many other installations on the Italian network, and also abroad, and was used until after the Second World War. In 1885, the SFAI became part of Rete Mediterranea and in 1891 Bianchi was appointed head of the Maintenance and Works Department and, in 1900, Director of the Movement and Traffic Service. On 22 July 1901 he became General Manager of Rete Sicula where he remained until the establishment of the FS in 1905. With the coming of nationalization, Bianchi was appointed General Manager of the Ferrovie dello Stato by Giovanni Giolitti. Bianchi was respected as a man of great moral integrity and an enlightened and progressive manager, who paid great attention to technological innovation and efficiency. Giolitti, in his memoirs, recalled that, when asked what salary he wanted as General Manager of Ferrovie dello Stato, Bianchi surprised him by replying that the salary he enjoyed as general director of the Sicula Network would be enough. ==Director General of the State Railways== Settled in his new prestigious office he had to face great problems. Most of the lines, rolling stock and plant were in a state of neglect and decay. There were different and divergent regulations and provisions. The Adriatic Network had adopted Vignoles rail and the Hardy brake, while the Mediterranean Network used double-headed rail and the Westinghouse brake. Even the couplings were of different types. In ten years Bianchi managed to standardize the regulations and the legal status of the staff. His decisive character led him to face business problems with an entrepreneurial approach. An example was the supply of coal, of British origin, which passed through various intermediaries. Bianchi, instead, set up his own office directly in Cardiff. Mediating at the ministries he managed to promote important investments to build large locomotive repair depots and important railway lines, such as Rome-Naples and Bologna-Florence, whose construction began during his tenure. After having designed a unified architecture for new lines, he began work on extending the tracks, then of 15,000 km, of which less than one sixth was double track. He invested much effort in the development of electric lighting of vehicles and stations. The problem of shortage of rolling stock was tackled head-on, thanks to huge financing obtained from the Government for thousands of wagons and carriages, as well as new classes of technologically advanced steam locomotives. In just one year, he managed to acquire or build 567 locomotives, 1,244 coaches and 20,623 freight wagons, in one of the greatest improvement efforts ever seen in the history of Italian infrastructure. His management style was sometimes controversial but this was justified by the fact that a large national enterprise had been established from nothing and he had to face significant problems of amalgamation and unification among the employees. On 24 January 1915, following disputes with the Minister of Transport on the occasion of an earthquake in the Marsican territory, Bianchi resigned from his post as general manager. The Bianchi management, however, had an extremely positive effect and created a railway administration that was competitive with those of other European nations. As a result of his appointment as Director General of the FS, the Italian Railway Engineers College had appointed him as its honorary president. ==After the FS== Appointed Senator of the Kingdom on 23 February 1917, he was called to hold the post of Minister for Maritime Transport and Railways on 16 June 1917, but resigned on 14 May 1918. He held various other ministerial positions and was a member of the board of directors of some banks and other bodies. He died in Turin on 4 November 1936 at the age of 82. ==Honours== * Gran Cordone dell'Ordine della Corona d'Italia (27 December 1908) * Grande Ufficiale dell'Ordine dei Santi Maurizio e Lazzaro (25 January 1915) ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Nestore Giòvene, Riccardo Bianchi, in Rivista tecnica delle ferrovie italiane, a. 26, 51 (1937), n. 1, pp. 1–7 * 1905-1955.

He is most noted for his service as commanding officer of 1st Battalion, 1st Marines during Guadalcanal Campaign. Cresswell later served as commanding general of Troop Training Unit, Atlantic Fleet and completed his career as Director of the Staff of the Inter-American Defense Board. ==Early career== Leonard B. Cresswell was born on July 18, 1901, in Lexington, Mississippi, and attended high school in Oxford, Mississippi, before he was transferred to Tupelo Military Institute. He graduated from the institute in summer of 1919 and subsequently enrolled the Mississippi State University in Starkville, Mississippi. Cresswell graduated with bachelor's degree in summer 1924. Cresswell was commissioned as second lieutenant in the Marine Corps on June 21, 1924, and ordered to the Basic School at Philadelphia Navy Yard for officer's training. He completed the school in June of the following year and was attached to Marine Corps Schools, Quantico as an instructor in Infantry Weapons School. Cresswell remained in that capacity until November of that year and then was ordered to the Marine Barrack at Norfolk Navy Yard, where served until November 1926. While there, he met his future wife, Emilia Field Belknap, daughter of Norfolk Yard Commandant, Captain Reginald R. Belknap. They were married on June 1, 1927, in Christ Church in Norfolk, Virginia. He was subsequently attached to the Marine detachment aboard the battleship USS Pennsylvania, where he served until April 1928. Cresswell was then attached to the 4th Marine Regiment at Quantico and sailed for expeditionary duty to China in May 1929. He served three years with guard duties at Shanghai International Settlement and returned to the United States in July 1932. Upon his return, Cresswell served with the Marine barracks at Brooklyn Navy Yard until May 1933, when he was ordered for Senior Course back to the Marine Corps Schools, Quantico. He then served as an instructor at the Basic School at Philadelphia Navy Yard until May 1939, when he was appointed commanding officer of the Marine detachment aboard the battleship USS Maryland. Cresswell was stationed at Hawaii and took part in the several patrol cruises along the West Coast. ==World War II== From left to right: Lieutenant Colonel Leonard B. Cresswell (1st Battalion), Lieutenant Colonel Edwin A. Pollock (Executive Officer 1st Marines), Colonel Clifton B. Cates (Commanding Officer 1st Marines), Lieutenant Colonel William N. McKelvy (3rd Battalion) and Lieutenant Colonel William W. Stickney (2nd Battalion) on Guadalcanal, October 1942 At the beginning of July 1941, Cresswell was promoted to the rank of major and transferred to the staff of 1st Marine Division as adjutant to commanding general, Philip H. Torrey. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, division began with the preparation for deployment to South Pacific and got the new division commander, Major General Alexander Vandegrift in March 1942. Cresswell was subsequently promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel and appointed commanding officer of 1st Battalion, 1st Marines under Colonel Clifton B. Cates. The 1st Marine Division deployed to South Pacific in June 1942 and remained on New Zealand for few weeks, before moved to Koro Island, Fiji to rehearse for Guadalcanal Operation. The 1st Marines landed on Guadalcanal on August 7, 1942, and captured nearby airfield during the first day. During the night on August 21, Japanese troops launched a counteroffensive and attacked 2nd Battalion positions between Ilu and Tenaru rivers. Although dense jungle and difficult terrain made it impossible for the tanks assigned to his command to effect a crossing of the river, Lieutenant Colonel Cresswell advanced with his battalion to the other side of the Tenaru and, by the skillful disposal of his men over a large area, attacked the rear of enemy's regiment, succeeded in annihilating the Japanese force between the Ilu and the Tenaru Rivers with a minimum loss to his unit. The Japanese lost almost 770 soldiers killed in action as they attempted to cross the Tenaru River to gain control of the vital Henderson Airfield. Cresswell was decorated with the Navy Cross for his service on Tenaru. First Marine Division was ordered to Australia for rest and refit in December 1942, and Cresswell was appointed executive officer of 5th Marine Regiment under Colonel John T. Selden in January 1943. His tour of duty in the Pacific ended in September of that year, when he was ordered back to the United States. His old superior, Clifton B. Cates, who was meanwhile promoted to the rank of brigadier general and now served as commandant of the Marine Corps Schools Quantico, requested for Cresswell to be attached to his staff. Cresswell was subsequently appointed commander of the Reserve Officers School, which trained and sent to combat duty all newly commissioned Marine Corps Reserve officers. He served in that capacity until January 1945, when he was appointed commander of Platoon Leaders School. Cresswell also took part in the training of officers of the Royal Netherlands Marine Brigade and received Dutch Order of Orange-Nassau, rank Commander. In May 1945, Cresswell returned to the Pacific Area and assumed command of 23rd Marine Regiment, 4th Marine Division again under General Clifton B. Cates. However regiment did not see combat anymore and Cresswell served on Maui, Hawaii until the end of war. During October 1945, 23rd Marines relocated to Camp Pendleton, where they were disbanded during the following month. ==Later career== Leonard B.

Following his graduation in July 1950, Cresswell was transferred to Camp Lejeune and appointed chief of staff, 2nd Marine Division under Major General Ray A. Robinson. However, the division did not go overseas and remained at Camp Lejeune as combat readiness force. Cresswell was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in July 1951 and appointed 2nd Division assistant commander under his old friend from Guadalcanal, Edwin A. Pollock. During this time he was given temporary additional duty in command of a joint air-ground brigade which he organized and with which he executed a training maneuver of two months duration in the West Indies Area, culminating in a full-scale amphibious assault on the Onslow Beach Area. Cresswell was detached from 2nd Marine Division in June 1952 and ordered to Naval Station Norfolk for duty as commanding general of Troop Training Unit, Atlantic Fleet.

While retreating through New Brunswick, Washington set up the Mersereau Ring through businessman and patriot Joshua Mersereau. According to their initial arrangements, Joshua's eldest son John LaGrange Mersereau was to remain in New Brunswick after American forces retreated. By 1777, the Mersereau Ring expanded into a greater intelligence network operating under Colonel Elias Dayton of the 1st New Jersey Militia. ==Joshua Mersereau == Joshua Mersereau (1728-1804) attended Kings College, practiced law in New York City, and operated a stage coach line with his brother John prior to the Revolutionary War. As the revolution approached, the brothers offered their horses for American military service and in 1775 Joshua helped rally troops for a military expedition into Quebec. During the Revolutionary War, Joshua served as a Representative for Richmond County with the Provincial Assembly of New York State. In addition to his political responsibilities, Joshua served as Deputy Commissary of prisoners under General Elias Boudinot for Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island. In this role, Joshua corresponded frequently with George Washington about prisoners of war and intelligence matters. Joshua and the Mersereau family, owning a tavern on Staten Island and a stagecoach line between New York and Philadelphia, had the covert means for transporting intelligence reports through their legitimate businesses. In 1780, Joshua Mersereau received a promotion to the rank of Major. Joshua continued to serve in his role as Deputy Commissary until the conclusion of the war, upon which he moved his family to Tioga County and became a surrogate judge. ==John LaGrange Mersereau== Once American forces retreated across the Delaware River in 1776, John LaGrange (1760-1841) moved from New Brunswick to Staten Island and later Manhattan where he gathered intelligence from behind British lines. Due to weakness in his right arm, John LaGrange was unable to carry a musket so he assumed this intelligence role to aid the American forces. Joshua's apprentice, John Parker, served as the first courier between John LaGrange and the American forces and completed at least three trips across enemy lines. Parker was eventually caught by the British and died shortly thereafter in prison, prompting John LaGrange to assume responsibilities as both agent and courier. When serving as courier himself, John LaGrange used a large stone at Shooter's Island as a dead drop between New Jersey and Staten Island to pick up instructions and drop off intelligence reports. As precaution, John LaGrange would tow the reports in a bottle tied to his raft, thus allowing him to dispose of the incriminating evidence in the event British forces intercepted his raft. Light signals along the river served as indicators for when reports were ready for pick-up on Shooter’s Island. After 18 months of espionage behind British lines, the British finally began to suspect John LaGrange, prompting the agent to rejoin American forces in Rutland, MA. Once back with American forces, John LaGrange served as a Deputy Commissary of imprisoned British troops for the remainder of the conflict, caring for troops from General John Burgoyne's army. In order to maintain the flow of information coming from this network after John LaGrange's role was compromised, the Mersereau Ring received assistance from additional Mersereau family members. John LaGrange's brother Joshua used a skiff to go to Staten Island where he would pick up copies of the Register that Paul Mersereau would leave in the cellar of his house. After the war, John LaGrange became a county clerk for Richmond County in Staten Island. John LaGrange was later appointed surrogate judge for Tioga County in 1791 and for Chenango County in 1798. ==John Mersereau== The elder John Mersereau (1731-1820), brother of Joshua and uncle of John LaGrange, oversaw a smaller network within the ring with at least six intelligence agents. These agents typically identified themselves in reports by their initials and consequently most of their identities are unknown yet suspected. The only known agent from this network is Paul Latourette, while the identities of \\"Amicus Reipublicae\\" and \\"A Stranger\\" remain unknown. The suspected identities of other agents include the same Culper Ring informant John Cork under the alias \\"J.C.\\", John Meeker or one of the Mersereaus under the alias \\"J.M.\\", and Asher Fitz Randolph under the alias \\"A.R.\\" For his role in the Revolutionary War, the British had proclaimed the elder John a \\"Rebel\\" and offered five hundred guineas to anyone who could turn him in dead or alive. ==Accomplishments== The earliest intelligence success for the Mersereau Ring occurred in December 1776 when Joshua and John LaGrange discovered evidence that the British prepared to pursue the retreating Continental Army across the Delaware River. The British intentionally sunk boats with the purpose of floating them to transport troops across the Delaware; however, the Mersereaus discovered the boats and removed them, allowing the Continental Army to escape without pursuit. The Mersereau Ring played a role in the capture of British Major John André, ultimately exposing the betrayal of American General Benedict Arnold. An agent from the Mersereau Ring warned Major Benjamin Tallmadge about alleged plans for Major André, under a false name, to meet with General Arnold as the two plotted the surrender of West Point to the British. Major Tallmadge, as intelligence chief for George Washington, had unknowingly granted a safe conduct pass for a \\"John Anderson\\", Major André's alias, at the request of General Arnold. However, when Major Tallmadge was informed that an American outpost under Lieutenant John Jameson had arrested a British officer with documents discussing the surrender of West Point, he realized Major André's true identity and had him arrested. == References == Category:Espionage in the United States Category:American Revolution Category:Spy rings ","title":"Mersereau Ring"},{"id":"56930462","text":"Goodnight Vienna is a 1974 album by Ringo Starr.

III, p. 680 (\\"Lucius Rustius\\"). ==Origin== The nomen Rustius seems to belong to a class of gentilicia of Umbrian derivation.Chase, pp. 128, 129., and one of the Rustii held high office at Interamnia Nahars in Umbria. The nomen Rusius, found in a handful of authors and inscriptions, may be an error for Rustius, as may Ruscius, although the latter may have been a variant of Roscius. ==Praenomina== The main praenomina of the Rustii were Lucius and Titus, both of which were among the most common names throughout Roman history. There are also instances of Gaius, Marcus and Quintus, also very common names. ==Branches and cognomina== The only distinct family of the Rustii bore the surname Caepio, from caepa, an onion, one of a large class of cognomina derived from the names of familiar objects, plants, and animals. Members of this family appear in history for about two hundred years, from the first century BC to the second century AD.Chase, pp. 112, 113.

He lived in the Order's headquarters in Rome from 2013 to 2017. The history was published in 2016. He has established himself as a traditionalist Catholic, critical of innovations which he considers discordant with the Church's tradition and consistent teaching. In 2015, Sire published Phoenix from the Ashes: The Making, Unmaking, and Restoration of Catholic Tradition, a highly critical approach to the Second Vatican Council and its effects on the Catholic Church, in which he concludes: \\"The fact needs to be clearly stated: the Second Vatican Council was a betrayal of the Church's faith.

He directed the film in the premise on how to startle people who have seen horror films and other scary videos online. The film's theme is centered on usog an affliction in Filipino superstition associated with being greeted by a stranger. Pwera Usog was targeted towards a young demographic particularly the \\"urban millennial\\". Laxamana incorporated technology and social media, as well as used a cast composed of mainly millennial to connect with the target demographic and introduce to them the concept of usog without alienating them.

Melville was born in Newport, Rhode Island to David and Mary (West) Melville. He was apparently able to light both his house and his street with gas by 1805-1806, using hydrogenous gas made by burning coal and wood. In 1876 the American Gas Light Journal stated that \\"in 1806 he had so far succeeded that he was enabled to light more than twenty rooms on his premises; by means of a large lantern he lighted Pelham street as it had never been lighted before.\\" In 1916, Walton Clark stated: :The first recorded instance of the use of gas for domestic illumination in the United States fixes the date at 1806. In that year David Melville of Newport, R.I., lighted his house and the street in front it with gas manufactured upon his premises. This was one year before the first public gas lighting venture in England.... He maintained the lights in his home until 1817. His feat was considerably ahead of the commercial gas industry, as gas lighting began regular service in Newport in 1853, nearly fifty years after Melville's demonstrations. Melville was granted the first American gas light patent on March 24, 1810, and a subsequent patent on March 18, 1813, but neither is still extant as the U.S. Patent Office and all its records and models were destroyed by fire on December 15, 1836. (Like all U.S. patents before 1836, they were unnumbered.) A drawing and detailed description of Melville's Improved Gas Apparatus, presumably reflecting the 1813 patent, may be seen in an 1814 letter from Benjamin Silliman, Professor of Chemistry at Yale College, to David Melville, Patentee of the Improved Gas Apparatus, as recorded in The Journal of Foreign Medical Science and Literature. Likewise, both the diagram and text of the second patent are included in Thomas Cooper's book, published in 1816. This apparatus produced gas from coal. Its description states that about 40 pounds of coal would produce enough gas for 3 hours of lighting at a brightness equivalent to 50 candles. Melville married Patience S. Sherman (1791-1880) on March 4, 1812, and had six children. Late in that year, he hired the brass founders Otis Chaffee and Joseph Lyon to make gas machinery and ornamental fixtures. After partnering with Captain Winslow Lewis, de facto \\"Superintendent for lighting the United States light houses,\\" they began manufacturing gas equipment in Boston. By June 5, 1813, an advertisement indicated that gas lights had been installed at a cotton factory in Watertown, Massachusetts, apparently with Melville's equipment. On November 13, 1813, a second installation was completed in the Wenscott Manufacturing Co.'s factory near Providence, Rhode Island. A later installation, at the Arkwright Mill near Providence exploded, destroying a small out-building and killing the watchman. In 1817, Melville received a one year contract from the U.S. Government for a trial of gas in the Beavertail Lighthouse near Newport, but lobbying from whale oil suppliers killed the contract after one year. From 1824-1835, he served as weigher and gauger in the custom-house at Newport, but was removed from that office for political reasons by the new Collector of Customs, William Littlefield. Ultimately, Melville's work was not a commercial success. == References == * Patents for David Melville, Directory of American Tool and Machinery Patents * \\"Copy of a Letter from Benjamin Silliman Professor of Chemistry at Yale College to David Melville Patentee of the Improved Gas Apparatus\\", in The Journal of Foreign Medical Science and Literature', Volume 5, by Samuel Emlen, 1815, pages 123-129. * \\"Melville's patent improved Gas Apparatus\\", in Some Information Concerning Gas Lights, by Thomas Cooper, John Conrad & Company, Philadelphia, J.

Reference is also made to sources giving her place of birth as Lemberg or Linz, and it was to Linz where her father, Joseph Pellet, having retired from a successful career as a theatre director in a succession of cities, had retired in order to focus on preparing his daughter for her own stage career. Thanks to her father she was able to make her theatre debut at Nuremberg in 1853, while still a child. She appeared at Linz in 1954, and there were also early appearances at the Carltheater in Vienna. She spent the next four years at the Stettin Theatre where she worked under the artistic direction of Edgar Hein, especially in respect of conversation pieces, and quickly became a favourite with audiences. In the first part of 1858 she signed up with the Court Theatre in Wiesbaden where for the next three years she concentrated on tragic roles. In November 1859 Lina Fuhr retired from the Berlin Hofbühne Theatre and married an Eye Doctor. In Summer 1860 Ida Pellet made her first appearance at the Hofbühne, at this stage as a guest performer and a competitor for the vacancy left by Miss Fuhr who had been the theatre company's leading tragic heroine. Pellet's successes in \\"The Maid of Orleans\\" and other popular classics of the time secured for her a place in the company with effect from September 1861. Other noteworthy performances were as Maria Stuart, Leonore, Gretchen, Jane Eyre, Lorle and Anne Liese, along with Chriemhilde in Hebbel's Nibelungen and Marfa in Heigel's eponymous drama- tragedy. In Summer 1826 Pellet travelled to Prague for a series of guest performances. In the middle to June she moved on to Leipzig where on 20 June she opened in \\"The Widow of Lowood\\" (a drama based on Jane Eyre). She appeared in the same piece each night till 26 June. On 28 June she was due to open in \\"The Maid of Orleans\\" and took part in the morning rehearsal. Her appearance that evening was cancelled on account of her sickness, however, and she would never return from her sickbed. Twelve days later, despite attentive nursing in the Hotel Bavière, she died. == Celebration == Karl von Holtei wrote: :\\"Beyond any doubt, Ida Pellet became one of the most professional and talent-filled actresses of modern times. Beauty, grace, affecting gestures, insightful presentation and a magical understanding of language, a vocal resonance that penetrated deep into the heart. Anyone who has seen her in Act 5 of Maria Stuart will agree. She had not yet reached the artistic heights for which she seemed destined. But already she was far along that way in aa shining career. Then death quietly destroyed the beautiful youthful being in full bloom.\\" :\\"Ida Pellet ist unzweifelhaft eine der berufensten, talentvollsten Darstellerinnen neuerer Zeit gewesen. Schönheit, Anmut, liebliche Gebärde, Auffassungsgabe und ein Zauber der Sprache, ein Klang der Stimme, der tief zum Herzen drang. Wer sie im 5. Akt der „Maria Stuart“ gesehen, wird beistimmen. Sie war noch nicht auf der höchsten, ihr erreichbaren Stufe der Künstlerschaft. Doch ragte sie schon weit hervor mit feurigem Streben. Da brach der Tod in seiner schleußlichen Gestalt das Schöne, jugendliche Dasein mitten in vollster Blüte.\\" == References == Category:German stage actresses Category:People from Graz Category:People from Linz Category:1838 births Category:1863 deaths ","title":"Ida Pellet"},{"id":"56930720","text":"Stanley Lieberson (April 20, 1933 – March 19, 2018) was an American sociologist.

The term was coined by Dr Amador Perez-Tomas working in collaboration with other ICN2 researchers in 2018 when they demonstrated the concept in a ferroelectric-oxide/organic bulk heterojunction solar cell. ==Principle of operation== In a basic solaristor embodiment, the self-powered transistor effect is achieved by the integration of a light absorber layer (a material that absorbs photon energy) in series with a functional semiconductor transport layer, which internal conductivity or contact resistance can be modified externally. ===Light absorber (solar cell element)=== In general, the light absorber is a semiconductor p–n junction that: * Efficiently harvests photons at various visible wavelengths by the photoelectric effect. * Splits photo-generated excitons into free electrons and holes. * Brings these free electrons and holes toward their respective outer electrodes by means of an internal field. Additionally, in thin-film solar cells, buffer electron and hole semiconductor transport layers are introduced at the respective metal electrodes to avoid electron-hole recombination and to remove the metal/absorber Schottky barrier. ===Conductivity modulator (transistor element)=== A solaristor effect is achieved by modifying the internal field properties or the overall conductivity of the solar cell. Ferroelectric solaristors. One possibility is the use of ferroelectric semiconductors as transport layers. A ferroelectric layer can be seen as a semiconductor with switchable surface charge polarity. Because of this tuneable dipole effect, ferroelectrics bend their electronic band structure and offsets with respect to adjacent metals and/or semiconductors when switching the ferroelectric polarization so that the overall conductivity can be tuned orders of magnitude. ==Two-terminal phototransistors== Conventional photodiodes or photodetectors do not switch as a phototransistor does when biased through its third terminal (gate). An additional advantage of a solaristor is, therefore, the potential reduction of the standard phototransistor's area and interconnection complexity. By using solaristors, it would be possible in theory to replace the in-plane three-electrode architecture by a vertical, two-electrode photodiode-like architecture in systems like photo-sensors, cameras, or displays. ==See also== * Anomalous photovoltaic effect * Digital electronics * Energy harvesting * Third-generation photovoltaic cell * Very Large Scale Integration ==References== Category:Transistors Category:Photovoltaics Category:Electrical components Category:Semiconductor devices ","title":"Solaristor"},{"id":"56930741","text":"Raychael Stine (born April 19, 1981) is an American painter and educator.

It was built in 1937 by C. Andersen, designed by Danish naval architect Oscar W. Dahlstrom. It was used in Denmark during World War II and captured by Germany before being recovered and restored. It is currently used as a charter vessel. ==History== Danish naval architect Oscar W. Dahlstrom When Orianda was purchased in 2009 from the Benlloch family, the history of its origin was little known and incorrect. For many years, it was believed that Orianda was commissioned by Christian X, the King of Denmark, or by the Duke of Oresund. The new owners traced the history of the ship back to Carl Andersen and a shipyard in Faaborg which no longer existed. After comparing historic documents and photographs from the era, it was determined that Orianda was originally Ragna IV. Ragna IV was designed by Danish naval architect Oscar W. Dahlstrom. It was originally designed as a racing cruiser in 1937 and was completed by C. Andersen Shipbuilders in Faaborg. The earliest known owner was Ole Sundo according to the Lloyd's registry in London in 1939. The ship was used by Denmark during World War II. It was seized by the Nazi forces during Operation Weserübung and later found abandoned on the shores of Denmark by Baron Johan Otto Raben-Levetzau in 1944. The ship was in disrepair, missing its masts and rigging. Sundo sold it to Baron Raben-Levetzau who restored it at the port of Svendborg. Orianda after the fire in 1987 In 1952, Raben-Levetzau sailed the ship to Sweden where the hull was painted and the ship re-registered under the name Sabina at the Royal Swedish Yachting Club. It was used as a charter in the 1950s until being sold to Stergios C. Souyouldjoglen, the Greek Ambassador to Denmark. It was again sold in 1969, this time to Mr. Draikis of Raleigh Brothers. Ownership changed hands numerous more times under the name Sabina, until it renamed and registered in Antigua under the name Orianda in 1981. The same year, it was purchased by Neil Peart of the rock band Rush, who wrote about it in his 2011 book Roadshow. Peter Phillilps purchased Orianda from Peart in 1987. The day after the purchase, the vessel caught fire and damaged most of the boat while anchored in Tortola in the British Virgin Islands. After restoring the boat, Phillips continued to sail it until he sold it to a real estate developer by the name of Benlloch in 1991. The family owned the boat for two decades and even entered it in the Spanish Classic Yacht Regatta in Valencia. The ship was sold in 2009 and completely restored in the Roman shipyard Tecnomar. It is currently operated as a charter boat by The Classic Yacht Experience. ==See also== * List of schooners * Denmark in World War II == References  * Orianda charter website Category:Ships built in Denmark Category:1937 ships Category:Schooners Category:Ships of Bermuda Category:Captured ships ","title":"Orianda"},{"id":"56930795","text":"Aphantopus maculosa is a butterfly found in the Palearctic that belongs to the browns family.

Kimball created work under an assumed Osage Indian identity, rising to prominence after her admittance of the painting Sacred Buffalo into the First Annual Exhibition of American Indian Painting at the Philbrook Art Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1946. == Biography == Born Effie Violetta Goodman to white parents, Oather Alvis Goodman and Martha Clementine Smith on March 30, 1906, her residence in 1910 was Rayville, Missouri.Missouri, Ray, Richmond, District 0141. United States Federal Census (1910), lines 59–63. National Archives and Records Administration. Kimball claimed to have been born in 1914 in Mountain Park, Oklahoma. Kimball was the fourth of at least nine children. Kimball's last name is the result of her first annulled marriage, which likely enabled her to erase her previous identity. Kimball cited a fabricated background of an Osage father known as “Other Good-Man” or “Other Good-Man Smith”, but there are no Osage records that exist to support this claim. Furthermore, there are no reservation records that show any type of Native American ancestry in Kimball's family. This assumed identity and cultural appropriation brought her great success as a Native American artist. Kimball married Harvey L. Slatin, an atomic scientist, in 1948. Slatin's work influenced Kimball's work, evident in her “fused earth” work from the 1960s. == Education and career == Kimball's work is known for its Western modernist style and focus on Native American subjects and themes. While many mid-20th century American Indian painters used water- based paints, such as casein and distemper, Kimball mostly painted in oil. Early references claim that Kimball studied at the University of Oklahoma in the 1930s. Lacking sufficient evidence to support this, as the university has no records documenting her attendance, it instead appears that Kimball was a designer for a Kansas City department store before she moved to New York City with her second husband to start her art career in 1935. Kimball studied at the Arts Student League in New York City from 1935 to 1939, traveling abroad to Europe to do independent studies in France and Italy. In Europe, she discovered African art, which influenced her study of Native American painting and traditions. The national Philbrook Indian Annual exhibition accepted entries from Native Americans all over the United States that created work based on Native themes and drew attention as Native American painting was rising in popularity post-World War II. Kimball's first entry into the exhibition in 1946, Sacred Buffalo, was accepted into the show, but did not win awards and was not purchased by the museum. Her entry the following year, To the Happy Hunting Ground, won her an honorable mention in the Plains region category from the juror. This painting cemented Kimball's career in Native art, securing her future entries in the Annual Philbrook exhibition and as a supposed Native artist. Kimball exhibited work in more than one hundred shows in galleries and museums between 1942 and 1965. Around 60 of the numerous shows she was in over her career were solo exhibitions around the United States and Europe. The National Academy of Design, the Whitney Museum, and the Carnegie Institute, as well as being the first woman to have work displayed in the NASA art collection, are among her major exhibitions in the United States. Yeffe Kimball established herself as a writer and critic of Native American art. She reviewed the 1946 and 1947 Philbrook Indian Annuals for Art Digest, a New York Publication. Kimball also illustrated The Story of the Totem Pole in 1949 and The Pueblo Indians in Story, Song, and Dance in 1955, both children's books focused on Indian legends. In 1965, she co-authored and illustrated a cookbook with Jean Anderson titled The Art of American Indian Cooking. == Native American advocacy == Kimball was engaged in Native American political activism in the later part of her life, working on Native-run committees for the Department of the Interior that supported political, educational, and cultural Native American groups throughout the 1950s up until the late 1970s. Kimball organized art auctions to raise money for Native American causes, and worked with the U.S. State Department to choose objects that were displayed in an international exhibition of Native American art in 1953. Several of the organizations she worked for and founded, such as Arrow, worked to support Native American youth, education, arts, and health. == Death and legacy == Kimball died in her vacation home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on April 11, 1978, from cancer. Much of Kimball's work is now housed in publicly funded institutions, further complicating the significance and historical meaning and value of her artwork. The Department of the Interior with which she worked for collected ninety-five of her pieces, including paintings, prints, and drawings, along with some of her other personal Native American and art- related belongings. Other artwork was donated to or given by Kimball to the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe. This institution collected nine of her paintings along with a large sum of ethnographic photographs that she took in the 1950s. Kimball's self-identification as an Osage Indian raises many questions as to why she would adopt a minority identity. At the time Kimball began making art under the Native American category, in the late 1930s, there was not only a large market for Native American art but also different understandings of cultural identities. The lack of knowledge at the time allowed Kimball, along with many other “counterfeit Indians”, to pass as Native American. In addition, the art world at the time was a male-dominated field, making it difficult or often impossible for a woman's career to develop. Bill Anthes state's, “indeed, Indianness provided Kimball with a position of strength on which to build a career, and she styled herself as the exotic curiosity of being an Indian in New York as well as a rising star in the Indian exhibitions of the West”. Her fabricated identity was and is still widely believed to be true and cited by both Native and non-Native audiences. Some in the postwar Native American art world were aware of Kimball's charade, such as Frederick J. Dockstader, director of the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. Despite knowing this, he and a few others felt that Kimball's dedication to Native American rights and advocacy justified her false identity, because it indicated her sincere connection to Indian culture, unparalleled by others falsely claiming to be Native American in the twentieth-century. ==References== Category:1906 births Category:1978 deaths Category:American people who self-identify as being of Native American descent Category:American women painters Category:People from Ray County, Missouri Category:20th-century American painters Category:20th-century American women artists ","title":"Yeffe Kimball"},{"id":"56930844","text":"Mandaturtukhutsesi () was the Chief overseer of the court, in charge of the palace guard and matters of protocol.

Her work has been described as 'delightful, slightly naive pictures of women and children, either interiors, or often beach scenes'. She managed, however, to establish a successful career as a professional artist in a male dominated occupation. It has been suggested that in some paintings, she created scenes that were ambiguous by refusing to depict women as models of moral virtue, and depicting mothers and children as being content regardless of a male presence. It is also suggested that the painting Young Lady in a Conservatory makes social commentary on the moral restrictions placed upon women as the subject is seen in a small conservatory with minimal room to move. == Biography and career == Photograph of Jane Maria Bowkett with her husband Charles Stuart, late 1880s Born in London, Jane Maria Bowkett was the eldest of thirteen siblings. Many of her sisters became artists as well. Her father, Thomas Bowkett, was a medical practitioner and was active in the Chartist Movement. In 1862 J. M. Bowkett married the artist Charles Stuart, but continued to sign her work using her maiden name. She gave birth to six children, only three of which survived childbirth. The family, however, subsequently prospered, and in the mid 1880s Bowkett and her husband finally purchased an impressive newly built property in Hampstead with a huge galleried studio connected to the spacious house by a barrel-vaulted conservatory. She lived in this home until her death in 1891. When Bowkett was first training to paint she attended a government-run school of design in London. Bowkett worked primarily in oils in which she often painted everyday domestic and genre scenes. She had a successful career. Her exhibition record started in 1858 with Angels Heads after Joshua Reynolds at the Society of Female Artists (later the Society of Women Artists). In 1860, she made her debut at the British Institution with Put your finger in the foxhole. This was sold for 3 guineas. Her last painting was exhibited at the Royal Hibernian Academy (The Bailiff's Daughter of Islington) in 1891. The price was £35. During the intervening years she exhibited over 120 paintngs at these and many other galleries such as Society of British Artists (RBA), Royal Scottish Academy, Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts, Walker Art Gallery, Manchester Art Gallery, Royal Institute of Oil Painters. High prices could be achieved for her work; for instance, at the RBA in 1875 On the Sands at Shanklin, Isle of Wight sold for £157.10s. She also had four exhibits at the Royal Academy; one in 1861 (Preparing for dinner), two in 1881 (Ophelia and Four miles more) and one in 1882 (Sally in our Alley, etc.). == Feminist interpretation of Bowkett's work == 'Preparing Tea'. Jane Maria Bowkett (1837-1891). Signed with a monogram. Oil on canvas. An example of Bowkett's work which has been subject to feminist interpretation is Preparing Tea (or Time for tea as it had been retitled when sold for £2000 at Christie's South Kensington on 16 March 2011). This painting shows a woman, presumably a wife and mother, spreading jam on toast as she gazes out the window while one of her children is toasting bread by a fire and the other child is carrying a pair of men's slippers. It has been suggested that Bowkett leaves some ambiguity in the facial expression of the mother as she sees her husband's train approaching in the distance. And that this piece depicted the ability of women and children alike to be happy without having to rely on a male presence. This critic also suggests that Bowkett's work combined concepts of everyday life, idealized domestic scenes, and ideals of motherhood in which she refused to depict women as being models of domestic virtue. This interpretation is suggested to be demonstrated in some of her other works where Bowkett depicts women bothering themselves with their home duties and not fulfilling expectations that were set for them. The critic concludes that by disrupting the interaction between form and content, Bowkett is able to leave moral ambiguity in her work. It has been suggested that Bowkett saw conservatories as a form of artificial paradise. The painting Young Lady in a Conservatory (1870-1880) depicts a young woman in a conservatory tending to a lily in a large pot. Around her are various other plants such as fuchsias, pelargoniums, and ferns. It has been further suggested that this work depicts a sense of enclosure and makes social commentary about the moral restrictions set out for middle class women at this time (1870-1880) and that the protruding stamens on the lily add a reference to a sexual awakening which ties back to the concepts of moral restrictions. == Notable works == * Young Lady in a Conservatory (1870-1880) * Preparing for Dinner (1861) * Preparing Tea (1860s) * Folkstone Beach (1875) * A Beach Scene (undated) * Awfully Jolly * Out of Reach * Valuable Assistance == References  * Category:1837 births Category:1891 deaths Category:19th-century British women artists Category:Painters from London Category:People from Hampstead ","title":"Jane Maria Bowkett"},{"id":"56930854","text":"The Key Man is a 2011 American crime thriller film starring Jack Davenport, Hugo Weaving and Brian Cox. ==Plot== A previously successful, but currently down on his luck, thirty-something insurance salesman is targeted by an aging gangster and his sociopathic Shakespearean actor/business partner.

Friedman proposed giving parents the opportunity to use state and local funds, otherwise designated for local school districts, in the form of vouchers to attend other private or public institutions. ==Forms of School Choice in PennsylvaniaEducational Tax Credit=== Pennsylvania became the first state to pass an education tax credit targeted at corporations. This legislation came on May 7, 2001 and was passed with overwhelming bi-partisan support. Pennsylvania's Educational Improvement Tax Credit, known as EITC, allows companies a 75 percent tax credit for donations made to non-profit scholarships or educational improvement organizations. If the company makes the same donation over a two-year commitment, the tax credit increases to 90 percent. The tax credits are capped at $750,000 annually or $200,000 for pre-k donations. Opportunity Scholarship Tax Credits The Opportunity Scholarship Tax Credit Program or OSTC provides tax credits to eligible businesses that contribute to an Opportunity Scholarship Organization. These funds are used to provide scholarships to eligible elementary or secondary school students enrolled in “low-achieving” schools. These funds may be used to pay tuition to another public or private school. Low achieving schools are defined as being ranked among the bottom 15 percent based on combined math and reading scores from the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment (PSSA). ===Charter schools=== Pennsylvania enacted Act 22 in 1997 during Governor Ridge's administration. This bipartisan legislation authorized the establishment of charter schools within the Commonwealth. There are currently 135 charter schools operating in Pennsylvania. Over 50,000 students are enrolled in these schools. ===Cyber Charter Schools=== Last year, 32,958 students were enrolled in cyber charter schools throughout Pennsylvania. That number signifies about 2 per cent of PA's overall public school enrollment. Advocates for cyber charters like the routine contact with instructors and the increased instruction time that online education offers. ===Inter-district Choice=== In Pennsylvania's Chester Upland School District, officials have been forced to look to surrounding Delaware County schools, since there are no other eligible schools within the district. However, such instances are problematic, because outlying schools are not always eager to accept students from low performing school districts. Although open enrollment in not mandated in Pennsylvania, the state's Department of Education encourages school districts to work together on the matter. ==Recent Legislative Reform Measures== In October 2017 Pennsylvania State Senator John DiSanto, a Republican from Dauphin County proposed legislation for Educational Savings Accounts (ESA). This legislation would have allowed families of children attending public schools which are performing in the bottom 15 per cent to state-funded education savings accounts. A vote on this new legislation was postponed by the PA Senate Education Committee in December 2017. It also failed to get out of committee in October with a 6-6 deadlock vote. ==Support== Supporters of school choice in Pennsylvania cite the fact that educational choice gives parents greater flexibility to choose the right educational environment for their children regardless of the location of their home school districts. This alternative education comes at lower costs than traditional public schooling. Pennsylvania has been describes as being the “envy of choice advocates across the country” for its pioneer legislation that has given the Commonwealth's families such flexibility. ==Opposition== School choice has received vehement opposition since its inception and during its considerable recent growth. Opponents claim that school choice options take money away from public school systems, many of which are located within financially stressed and academically failing areas. Critics, such as PA State Auditor General Eugene DePasquale, have called for an overhaul of legislation to bring greater financial and educational oversight. ==Public School Response== Faced with tight educational budgets and declining enrollments, some public school systems in the Commonwealth have made innovative curriculum changes to keep pace with school choice options. Keystone School District implemented a greater focus on digital technologies to be competitive. This district not only revised traditional courses, but also instituted on-line courses in advanced placement and dual enrollment classes, in addition to a hybrid curriculum and an aggressive outreach campaign to boost enrollment. The Quakertown Community School District not only implemented an online learning program, but also a performing arts program that includes theater and a dance studio that has drastically reduced its annual tuition reimbursement rates. ==References== Category:Public education in Pennsylvania ","title":"School choice in Pennsylvania"},{"id":"56930872","text":"Aphantopus arvensis is a butterfly found in the Palearctic that belongs to the browns family.

Valcin was born into a very poor family and his parents couldn't pay for him to receive an education. He was in school for only 3 years until he quit to make money weaving twine for hats as a young boy. He only earned two cents for every three yards of wine he weaved; he then worked as a tile setter for twelve years. \\"Profits from the tile work allowed me to paint.\\" – Gerard Valcin. Vulcan received no formal training in painting of any art form. However, as a young boy, Valcin would watch a man in his neighborhood paint Vodou Spirits on pieces of cardboard in his front yard. The paint was made from limes, eggs, bark and homemade rum. After seeing this, he started painting himself with similar homemade paints. He began painting from his spiritual imagination – influenced by country life and the blending of Vodou and Masonic Masonry. However, most of his work comes from the inspiration of Vodou Spirits, beliefs, and ceremonies. While working as a tile setter, he met a group of painters who were using real, store bought, paints. \\"I saw them pressing a tube. I didn't know what it was. I thought it was toothpaste.\\" – Gerard Valcin. In 1947, Valcin brought one of his paintings to the Centre d'Arte in Port-au-Prince.

Educated in the United States, she began her teaching career in Africa and upon returning to Panama recognized how invisible the community of blacks who were not Latino were. Joining the newly developing black movement in the country, she strove to educate and preserve the history of West Indians who had immigrated to Panama. Teaching at the University of Panama and simultaneously designing a course and teaching English at Florida State University-Panama, she carried on a dual career of activism and education until 2000, when she was made head of the English Department at the University of Panama. She has published two textbooks; a history of the African diaspora in Panama, which has been published multiple times in both English and Spanish; and wrote a widely-known play to address the historical contributions and biases which have impacted Panama's black citizens. ==Early life== Melva Lowe was born in 1945 in Red Tank, a town in the Panama Canal Zone to Matilde (née Wilson) and Oscar Lowe. She was the third child in a family of five children born to the couple who were first generation Afro- Panamanians. Her grandparents, immigrated from Jamaica as laborers to build the canal and lived in the zone designated for West Indian immigrants. Soon after her birth, her family moved to the town of La Boca, where she completed her primary studies. Around 1956, the family moved to Paraíso, where she finished her secondary schooling, at the Panama Canal Company schools, before moving to the United States to study at the Connecticut College for Women. After graduating with her bachelor's degree in 1968, she went on to complete a master's degree in English at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1970. ==Career== After completing her graduate studies, Professor Goodin took a post to teach at the University of Zambia in Lusaka. The university was in need of teachers and she believed that the experience would give her insight on the struggles of African people. After teaching in Zambia, she returned to Panama and was hired as a professor of English and literature at the University of Panama. In 1974, she was hired to design the English as a second language course for Florida State University-Panama and served as coordinator of the program for more than twenty years, while simultaneously teaching at the University of Panama. Frustrated by the lack of inclusion in history texts of the African heritage in Panama, Lowe de Goodin became involved in the nascent black movement in Panama along with Gerardo Maloney. Alberto Smith, and Reina Torres de Araúz, among others. They organized an anthropological conference to discuss how they could preserve the contributions of the African diaspora in Panama. In 1980, the activists opened the Afro-Antillean Museum, but by the end of the year, realized that they did not have sufficient funds to keep the museum open. Hosting fairs and events to raise awareness of black history among the black population, the group developed a network. In 1981, Lowe de Goodin founded the Society of Friends of the West Indian Museum in Panama (), to raise funds and preserve cultural and literary heritage of Afro- Panamanians. In addition, the organization, formed on the model of the NAACP, brings about awareness of racism and actively supports an end to racial discrimination and measures to gain equality. She became the inaugural president and served through 1984. She was reelected president of SAMAAP in 1998 and served a two-year term. In 1985, Lowe de Goodin wrote a play, De Barbados a Panamá (From Barbados to Panama) to tell the story of the Caribbean migrants who came to work on the Panama canal. The drama tells of the discrimination faced by Afro-Caribbean and Chinese laborers, who built the canal and railroad, and the legal impediments which required them to speak Spanish before they could attain citizenship. The work showed the importance of bi-lingual identity to immigrant communities and how the official stance to bar them from speaking English, branded them as outsiders, even among Afro- Latino neighbors. The drama allowed Lowe de Goodin to correct the historiography of the country, challenging both the omission of Afro- Caribbeans and the myths, like they all immigrated from Jamaica and were impervious to disease, in a literary format which was in common use at that time among women writers from Latin America. The play was first staged in 1985, and was performed again in 1997, when it was also televised. In 1999, the play was published as a book, in both English and Spanish. In 1986, she founded the Panamanian branch of Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) and became its first president. In 1999, she left Florida State University and was appointed as the Director of the English Department at the University of Panama the following year, serving in that capacity through 2006. She has published two textbooks, Practical Lessons in Business English volumes 1 and 2, as well as a history of Afro-Panamanians, which has been published in both English and Spanish, as well as in a second Spanish edition, Afrodescendientes en el Istmo de Panamá 1501–2012 (People of African ancestry in Panama, 1501–2012). The English edition of her book was released on the centennial of the construction of the Panama Canal. It evaluates the historical contributions of Panama's black citizens and how the cultural mix between Spanish, African and indigenous have led to a richer heritage, including the development of the country, as well as folklore and gastronomic traditions. ==Selected works== * * * * * ==ReferencesCitations=Bibliography=== * * * * * * * * * * * Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:Panama Canal Zone Category:Afro-Panamanian Category:Caribbean people of African descent Category:Panamanian women Category:Connecticut College alumni Category:University of Wisconsin-Madison alumni Category:University of Zambia faculty Category:Florida State University faculty Category:University of Panama faculty Category:20th-century women writers Category:21st-century women writers ","title":"Melva Lowe de Goodin"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:O},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:R}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},B={class:"card-container"};function F(s,a,o,c,u,i){const g=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Life Quotes🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",B,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,m)=>(t(),b(g,{key:m,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const I=d(P,[["render",F]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/66.md","filePath":"people/66.md"}'),D={name:"people/66.md"},G=Object.assign(D,{setup(s){return(a,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(I)]))}});export{L as __pageData,G as default};
