Koch Inventor and mechanic Johannes Peter Langgaard purchased the farm Hakkemose at Taastrup in 1847 and founded the brickyard at the site on 10 November that same year. Langgaard had studied the latest technological trends in Germany and constructed a machine for the production of bricks. In 1868 , he also began the construction of a Hoffmann kiln with 15 chambers. Each chamber had room for 22,500 bricks. The Hoffmann kiln Hakkemose Brickworks had by the 1870s developed into the largest brickyard in the country. It produced 7 million bricks in 1872. In 1883, it also started a production of terracotta objects and faience cocklestoves. The brickyard was represented and won awards on the 1872 Nordic Exhibition in Copenhagen and again on the Nordic Exhibition of 1888. Langgaard passed away in 1890 and his heirs sold the brickyard to a British consortium in 1895. The clay deposits had been depleted in 1908 and the Hoffmann kiln was demolished in 1909. The factory was from then on used for production of ceramic objects and tiles. Morten Korch was managing director of the factory from October 1909 to September 1911.

Prior to the opening of West Point, the school district was turning away potential students; at its other high schools, it had pressed teachers' lounges into service as extra classrooms and put into place portable classroom structures to provide needed space. The name West Point and Dragons mascot were determined in consultation with parents, community members, and students. The $108 million construction cost primarily came from $48 million from the Arizona School Facilities Board and $53 million from a 2016 voter-approved bond. Design of the school complex was conducted by ADM Group, with Chasse Building Team serving as the general contractor. Prominent in the school's design is a wing theme inspired by the school's proximity to Luke Air Force Base. The 11-building campus was designed around a \\"secure but open\\" plan, with strategically placed windows, one-way windows in the principal's office, and the ability to lock any door in the facility remotely. The grades are 9th though 12th The district announced that Brandi Haskins, a 28-year district veteran who had been the principal of La Joya Community High School, would transfer to the new West Point in January 2019. The first phase of the school opened to an estimated 1,200 freshmen and sophomores on July 31, 2019, with construction on a second phase of sports fields, a performing arts center, and classroom space currently underway to allow the school to open to juniors and seniors for the 2020–21 and 2021–22 school years, respectively. ==Curriculum== The primary academic feature of West Point High School is an academy (West Point Leadership Academy) in partnership with Luke Air Force Base, which is modeled after the school- within-a-school program at the district's University High School.

Russell or S. H. Russell, was a lawyer, politician, U.S. marshal, member of the Texas Congress, a soldier in the Confederate Army, and, at the time of his death, justice of the Oklahoma Supreme Court (OSC). Born in Marshall, Harrison County, Texas, he moved to what would become the state of Oklahoma after 1870 and before 1910. Although he lived a relatively full and adventurous life, his career on the OSC was cut short by illness. Re-elected to this high position in the fall of 1914, he died before the end of the calendar year and the beginning of his second term. == Early life == S. H. Russell was born in Brazoria County, Texas on Valentine's Day (February 14), 1846 to William Jarvis (1802-1881) and Eleanor (Heady) Russell (1817-1890). Little about his early life has been published except that he attended the Texas Military Institute and farmed until the U.S. Civil War intruded. He enlisted as a private in the 25th Regiment of the Texas Cavalry, fighting for the Confederate Army. His military career was evidently unremarkable, because he emerged as still a private at the end of hostilities. Returning to civilian life, Russell got a job as a clerk in a Brazoria, Texas dry goods store. He used his spare time to study law in the offices of Lathrop and McCormick. In 1869, he was admitted to the Texas bar, and soon afterwards moved to Galveston, Texas. == Texas politics == Russell was selected as City Attorney for both Houston and Galveston in 1870. Texas Governor Edmund Davis appointed Russell as District Attorney, covering both Harrison and Rusk Counties in East Texas. He held that post until 1872, when he was elected sheriff of Harrison County, remaining in that position until 1876. In 1875, he was also a delegate to the Texas State Constitutional Convention, where he served on the committees on the Legislative Department and Revenue and Taxation. Russell decided to run for election to the U.S. House of Representatives from Texas' 2nd Congressional District. Despite winning endorsements from both the Tyler Index and the Galveston Daily News, his one-term incumbent Democratic opponent, David Culbertson, beat him handily in the 1876 general election. Undaunted, he ran for Harrison County Tax Collector in 1877 and won the post. He resigned for unknown reasons in the same year, and in 1878 was appointed by President Hayes as U.S. Marshal for the Western District of Texas. In the late 1870s, Russell headed an investigation of train robberies allegedly committed by the notorious Sam Bass gang. This had no positive effect on his political career. In November 1882, he ran for election again to the U.S. Congress, this time for the Texas 3rd Congressional District, opposing Democrat James Henry Jones. == Legal problems and prison sentence == In March 1882, Department of Justice agents discovered irregularities in the accounts that Russell kept in his office. Several suits were brought against him during the month. In May, he was charged with misappropriating government funds, arrested and put under a $4,000 bond. More charges were made in early 1883, \\"on the account of irregularities in summoning juries\\". Russell went on trial in San Antonio starting March 29, 1883. By the end of April, Russell was convicted of \\"rendering false accounts to the government.\\" Monetary claims were in the range of 40 to 50 thousand dollars. He was sentenced to two years in prison, to be served at the Illinois State Penitentiary at Chester, Illinois. == Release and return to civilian life == By July 1883, Russell had been assigned to a prison clerkship and to work in the brickyard. Some of Russell's friends and supporters started a campaign for his early release. Russell was released in February 1885, after serving 21 months.

The announcement was years in the planning; in 1998, the then-pastor of the parish lobbied the diocese to buy land for a future elementary and high school. Already, in 2015, 70 students from the St. Thomas Aquinas elementary school were commuting 22 miles to Brophy College Preparatory and Xavier College Preparatory.

The school in Avondale would be the westernmost operated by the Nashville Dominicans and just the second diocesan high school to open west of Interstate 17. Ground was broken for the new school at a ceremony on January 21, 2017.

He attended the Holy Family Convent, Bambalapitiya, S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia and then Ananda College. Soysa joined the Samasamajist movement in 1937 whilst he was a student at University College, Colombo. He dropped out of the University College, and after brief stints at Ceylon Law College and teaching he joined the Lanka Sama Samaja Party, a Trotskyist political party. ==Early politics== In April 1942 he traveled to India to assist in establishing the Bolshevik-Leninist Party of India, which was actively involved in the struggle against British rule in August 1942. Soysa was arrested in Bombay in July 1943, months after the struggle was crushed, where he was detained for 50 days before being returned to Ceylon, and released on parole. ==Parliamentary career== Following the end of the Second World War he contested the 1st parliamentary election, held between 23 August 1947 and 20 September 1947, in the Colombo South electorate, where he polled third. Soysa didn't run in the subsequent 1948 by-election, following the dismissal of the sitting member for Colombo South, Reginald Abraham de Mel, which saw the election of Theodore Frederick Jayewardene, representing the United National Party. He did however challenge Jayewardene at the 2nd parliamentary election, held between 24 May 1952 and 30 May 1952, failing to secure the seat by 5,180 votes. He was elected to the Colombo Municipal Council from the Tibirigasyaya Ward, defeating Kusala Abhayavardhana. At the 3rd parliamentary election, held between 5 April 1956 and 10 April 1956, Soysa ran again for the third time for the seat of Colombo South. This time he was successful, receiving 14,199 votes (50.93% of the total vote) and defeating the sitting member, T. F. Jayewardene, by 5,044 votes. In 1960, Colombo South became a multi-member constituency with two seats in Parliament, following its amalgamation with the Wellawatte/Galkissa electorate. Soysa and Edmund Samarawickrema (UNP) were elected as representatives in March 1960. In July 1960, Soysa was re-elected and J. R. Jayewardene was elected in the place of Samarawickrema. Soysa and Jayewardene were re-elected unopposed in 1965, the first time since 1947, when Hameed Hussain Sheikh Ismail was elected uncontested in the Puttalam electorate, that there had been no contest for a seat in the parliament. The pair also retained their seats in parliament at the 7th parliamentary election, held on 27 May 1970. Soysa supported the coalition, United Front, government that was formed in May 1970 between the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, the Lanka Sama Samaja Party and the Communist Party. He was appointed the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament during the first coalition of 1964; he continued in this post during the United National Party’s government of 1965-70 and the coalition government of 1970-77, a tenure of 13 years. In the second coalition, he acted for N. M. Perera as Minister of Finance on several occasions when Perera was out of the country. He served as the Minister of Housing in the Second Sirimavo Bandaranaike cabinet. In 1977, Colombo South was split up into two electorates, Colombo East and Colombo West. Soysa contested the Colombo East electorate, finishing third, losing to Edmund Samarawickrema. In August 1994 at the 10th parliamentary election, Soysa was elected to parliament as an LSSP member of the People’s Alliance in the Colombo Electoral District. He was subsequently appointed the Minister of Science and Technology in the Kumaratunga cabinet.

United States, 588 U.S. ___ (2019), was a case before the United States Supreme Court dealing with mens rea. The Court held that when a person is charged with possessing a gun while prohibited from doing so under (g), the prosecution must prove both that the accused knew that they possessed a gun and that they knew they held the relevant status.. == Legal background == In 1996, Congress passed the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. Its provisions included 18 USC § 922(g), which specified many classes of so-called \\"prohibited persons\\" who were forbidden to possess a firearm. (a)(2) further stated that \\"...whoever knowingly violates subsection...(g)...of title 922 shall be \\" (emphasis added). The Courts of Appeals repeatedly interpreted this statute as requiring the prosecution to prove only that the accused knew he possessed a gun, not that he knew he was a prohibited person. == Case background == Hamid Mohamed Ahmed Ali Rehaif, a citizen of the United Arab Emirates, was admitted to the United States on an F-1 visa to study at the Florida Institute of Technology. In December 2014 the Institute dismissed him for failing or withdrawing from all of his classes, and in February 2015 his visa was revoked. However, Rehaif remained in the country. He began a curious ritual where he would check into a hotel each evening, requesting a room on the 8th floor facing the Orlando Melbourne International Airport, then would check out the next morning and pay his bill in cash. All the while he frequented a firing range, where he would rent guns and purchase ammunition. After 53 days of this routine, a hotel employee notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation that Rehaif had claimed to have weapons in his room. When questioned, Rehaif admitted to shooting firearms at the shooting range. A search of his room revealed the remainder of the ammunition he possessed. Rehaif was charged with possessing a gun while illegally or unlawfully in the United States, in violation of §922(g)(5)(A). === Lower court proceedings === Rehaif was tried in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida. The prosecution requested a jury instruction that \\"[t]he United States is not required to prove that the defendant knew that he was illegally or unlawfully in the United States\\". Rehaif objected, claiming that the United States was required to prove that he knew his status. The judge overruled this objection, and Rehaif was convicted. He appealed his case to the Eleventh Circuit, which rejected his arguments and affirmed the District Court's judgement under circuit precedent that proof of knowledge of status is not required. == Supreme Court == Rehaif petitioned the Supreme Court for writ of certiorari. On January 11, 2019 the Court agreed to hear his case. Oral arguments were held on April 23, 2019, with Rosemary Cakmis arguing for Rehaif and Allon Kedem arguing for the United States. During arguments, Justice Gorsuch referenced a case around the same issue that he had heard while on the Tenth Circuit, United States v. Games-Perez: \\"As you well know, I had a case where the fellow was told by the judge that he was not a felon when he was convicted. And yet he was put in jail for 10 years afterwards because the government didn't have to prove that he knew his status.\\" Justice Ginsburg seemed concerned about the ramifications of reversal, and whether the thousands of people convicted under the statute would be eligible to seek habeas corpus relief. === Opinion of the court === The court released its opinion on June 21, 2019. In a 7-2 vote, they reversed Rehaif's conviction. Justice Breyer, joined by six other Justices, held that the government must prove both that the accused knew he possessed a gun and that he knew he held the relevant status. Although the Court had previously held that knowledge of status was not required for certain crimes, for example in United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., the conduct was inherently immoral or suspect. Gun possession, on the other hand, is not merely innocent but constitutionally protected in some cases. Therefore, knowledge of the prohibited status is part of mens rea and must be proved by the prosecution. Justice Alito, joined by Justice Thomas, filed a lengthy dissenting opinion. He took issue with the majority applying the law to a theoretical sympathetic defendant, rather than Rehaif whom he characterized as suspicious. == References == == External links == * Category:2019 in United States case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States immigration and naturalization case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court Category:United Arab Emirates–United States relations Category:United States Second Amendment case law Category:Melbourne, Florida Category:Aviation in Florida ","title":"Rehaif v.

Early in her career, she worked on Max Fleischer's Out of the Inkwell series as an inker. In 1930 Bailey moved to Southern California where she began making custom lampshades. In 1932, Bailey applied for a job at Walt Disney Animation Studios and subsequently became a member of the Ink & Paint Department, which was then led by Walt Disney's sister-in-law Hazel Sewell. Bailey began at Disney as an inker and eventually moved up to head of Paint. Bailey began working with the studio when the films Disney made were still in black and white, and when the studio moved into color films with the Silly Symphonies, Bailey worked with Sewell, Walt Disney, and others to collaborate on approaches and palettes. Bailey developed colors to broaden the palette that Ink & Paint could work with, including a sky blue inspired by a dress worn by fellow Painter Betty Kimball. Bailey also developed methods for maintaining consistency of color, noting: \\"We have color charts that we match the paints back to and they have to be rematched every so often because they fade, just sitting on the shelves... So they must constantly be matched back to the original charts, the original colors.\\" When Disney transitioned back into normal production after World War II, Bailey advocated for \\"raising the top salary to attract more stable employees,\\" saying: \\"By raising the maximum on a merit basis, those of outstanding ability would be paid for their contributions. There would be an incentive to excel and to work. It must be known to the girl that there is a future for those who are willing to make a career out of the work; that we are willing to pay for those who excel in both quality and quantity.\\" Beginning in 1954, until her retirement in 1972, Bailey was head of the Ink & Paint Department. She and other department heads regularly attended story meetings to \\"track story updates and decisions that pertained to Ink & Paint.\\" Of the way she trained Inkers and Painters, Bailey remarked: \\"We used to say [it took] about a year for an Inker and about six months for a Painter. Inking is quite a skill the way we used to do it. Lines had to be tapered and you had to be exactly in the center of the pencil line. You couldn't wobble. Some of the girls couldn't smoke or drink coffee--it would make them shaky.\\" Bailey felt that women were particularly well suited to ink and paint work, remarking in a 1958 book: “Inking and painting is precision work that requires neatness and patience. Women seem to have those qualities, plus a necessary feeling for their work.” == Legacy and leadership == Former inker Merle Welton recalled that Bailey threatened to fire her from the department in 1953 for meeting with animators during her lunch break to show them her portfolio. Welton said she called Bailey \\"the Mother Superior because she ran the ink-and-paint department like a nunnery.\\" Former inker Marie Johnston said that Bailey \\"would come around to your desk and say, 'I want you to stop and just look out in the distance, look out the window.' Because it's bad for your eyes, to keep going with that light under [the light boxes]. So they cared about you.\\" Marge Hudson, who left and later returned to the studio after having children, noted that Bailey \\"was the one who hired me back,\\" and said that when she asked Bailey \\"you think they'd rehire an old staggering mother with four kids?\\" that Bailey replied \\"Sure, we need help!\\" Ginni Mack said of Bailey: \\"She had a way about her and she was really respected [with] a certain sort of fear. Grace could hire and fire, everybody knew that. She had this 'thing' you felt [and] you wanted to know if she was in the room, so you wouldn't misbehave.\\" Mack, as well as Bailey's longtime assistant Edle Bakke, both recalled that there was a \\"password\\" among the women of the Ink & Paint Department to indicate to each other that Bailey was in the room. Edle Bakke said of Bailey's management style: \\"She was extremely diplomatic and she tried not to hurt the girls' feelings when she knew she had to reprimand them--or fire them, if they were consistently late, [or] if they made too many errors on the cels, and such.\\" Bailey died in Florida in 1983. In 2000 she posthumously received a Disney Legends Award in recognition of her 40-year career with the Walt Disney Company. == Notes == Category:1904 births Category:1983 deaths Category:Disney people Category:Animators from Ohio Category:Women animators Category:People from Willoughby, Ohio Category:Artists from Ohio Category:Cleveland School of Art alumni Category:Walt Disney Animation Studios people ","title":"Grace Bailey"},{"id":"61526427","text":"Chun-Hway Hsueh () is a Taiwanese materials scientist.

Sacco's seven-year-old son, Dante, would sometimes stand on the sidewalk outside the jail and play catch with his father by throwing a ball over the wall. ==Building== The two story stone building was built in 1817 and was 33' square. Part of the jail was torn down in 1851 to erect a central, octagonal portion and two wings. It resulted in a building with the shape of a Latin cross, and featured Gothic Revival windows. The three tiers of cells radiated out like spokes from the central guardroom. Inmates were housed in the jail until 1992 when the Norfolk County Correctional Center was opened in 1992. A court forced the closure after 13 inmates escaped in 1989. There were at least 27 break outs during the prison's history. ==Hangings== There were two hangings in the central rotunda. First was George C. Hersey on August 8, 1862. Over 300 people received tickets to watch. James H. Costley was hung on June 25, 1875. Again, 300 people watched as his body twitched and convulsed for close to two minutes. One spectator fainted, and others obtained pieces of the hangmans rope to bring home as souvenirs. It was the last execution in Norfolk County. ==Condominiums== In 1999, the jail was converted by the Brookline-based Parencorps into a condominium complex known as Stoneleigh. The sale price was more than $1 million. The 24 luxury condominiums were offered for between $450,000 and $650,000, each with between 1,800 to 2,500 square feet. ==Notes== ==References== ==Works cited== * * category:Norfolk County, Massachusetts category:History of Dedham, Massachusetts category:Buildings and structures in Dedham, Massachusetts category:1817 establishments in Massachusetts category:Prisons in Massachusetts ","title":"Norfolk County Jail"},{"id":"61526521","text":"Anastassiya is a female given name.

Cybersecurity is security as it is applied to information technology. This includes all technology that stores, manipulates, or moves data, such as computers, data networks, and all devices connected to or included in networks, such as routers and switches. All information technology devices and facilities need to be secured against intrusion, unauthorized use, and vandalism. Additionally, the users of information technology should be protected from theft of assets, extortion, identity theft, loss of privacy and confidentiality of personal information, malicious mischief, damage to equipment, business process compromise, and the general activity of cybercriminals. The general public should be protected against acts of cyberterrorism, such as the compromise or loss of the electric power grid. Cybersecurity is a major endeavor of the IT industry. There are a number of professional certifications given for cybersecurity training and expertise. Although billions of dollars are spent annually on cybersecurity, no computer or network is immune from attacks or can be considered completely secure. The single most expensive loss due to a cybersecurity exploit was the ILOVEYOU or Love Bug email worm of 2000, which cost an estimated 8.7 billion American dollars.

It is located east of Barlow Pass near the Mountain Loop Highway and the Monte Cristo area, on land managed by the Mount Baker- Snoqualmie National Forest. Its nearest higher peak is Vesper Peak, to the west, and between them share a high connecting ridge. The peak was named for A. D. (Dick) Sperry, a Silverton mining prospector during the 1890s. The Dick Sperry Picnic Area is near the historic site of the abandoned Sperry-Iverson mine near Silverton. ==Climate== Sperry Peak seen from Sunrise Mine Road Sperry Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. ==Geology== The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences. Sperry Peak, north face The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The “U”-shaped cross-section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. ==See also== * Geography of Washington (state) * Geology of the Pacific Northwest ==References== ==External links== * Sperry Peak weather: Mountain Forecast * Climbing Vesper and Sperry peaks: YouTube Category:Mountains of Washington (state) Category:Mountains of Snohomish County, Washington Category:Cascade Range Category:Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest ","title":"Sperry Peak"},{"id":"61526651","text":"Cristle Collins Judd is an American academic administrator and musicologist serving as the 11th President of Sarah Lawrence College. == Early life and education == Judd is originally from Texas, and earned her bachelor's degree in music performance from the Shepherd School of Music at Rice University.

His family life was troubled by alcoholism and divorce; he took refuge in libraries and art, and by age thirteen decided to be an artist. He was a well-read autodidact, who left school at age seventeen before graduating and remained insecure about his lack of formal education. In the mid-1950s, Schacht moved on his own to the Chicago's near-north Old Town neighborhood and its livelier arts scene. As an adult, he would support himself sporadically through part-time jobs at an antique store, hospital and gay bar, as well as sometimes-paid art gigs at the Indianapolis Museum of Art and Art League of Indiana, and instructing at Columbia College Chicago and an Indiana Arts Commission visiting artist program for high schools.Shortridge Echo. \\"Artist Comes to Shortridge,\\" Shortridge Echo, February 27, 1974.'Round The Square. \\"It's All Downtown,\\" 'Round The Square (Cincinnati), Vol. 1, No. 44, September 23-29, 1974.Karn, Lynn. \\"Godsinsearchofamyth: Drawings by John Schacht,\\" Triad Magazine October 14, 1977, p. 24.Brumleve, Jane. \\"Students Help Schacht Create,\\" The Indianapolis Star, February 23, 1974, p. 138.

Reviews have described Schacht's drawings as intimate, cartoon-like abstractions of flowing, organic forms and sexual symbols that convey \\"the contemporary primal self\\" in a raw style. ===Queer expression=== Later writers have suggested that queerness is both ever-present and repressed in Schacht's work (the most explicit of which was rarely shown in public), citing fugitive S&M; elements, embedded genitalia, abstract cowboy figures in chains or leather, and excessive ornamentation. C.C. McKee writes that the visual ornamentation exceeds mere decoration, suggesting a desire to elude and transcend heteronormative constraints through aesthetic means. New Art Examiner critic Michel Segard observed that Schacht's usage of the penis—as a hieroglyph or meme, rather than erotic form (like the later Keith Haring)—and lone males in erotic contexts reveals a closeted tension between expression and repression. Schacht explored similar themes in a ritual performance that was part of a group exhibition at the Renaissance Society (1976), which also featured Edith Altman, Nancy Davidson and Dennis Kowalski. In the performance, a young, jock-strap-clad man was led into a confined cube space by a rope around his neck, suspended from ceiling hooks by a harness, and strapped to the walls by ropes tied around his body; after he went limp, the ropes were cut and he was deposed, laid on the floor, and wrapped in blankets. ===Paintings on paper=== John Schacht, Untitled watercolor on paper, c. 1970s. While still embedded with personal symbols (chairs, teapots, chinoserie, mandalas, and earlier, characteristic forms), Schacht's paintings differ from his drawings in their increased abstraction, intense colors and wider inspirations and imagery. His paintings feature leitmotifs of ceramic vases, Persian textiles, quasi-psychedelic genitalia, cowboy hats and saloon doors in decentralized, rhythmic compositions that Brooklyn Rail critic Diane McClure and others describe as moving between disorder, play, and a sense of the surreal. Schacht's 1970s paintings include brightly colored, semi-abstract, chaotic still lifes and interiors, stylized portraits of women and 15-foot scroll drawings exploring male and female erotic imagery. The interior still lifes emphasize flattened perspectives and space, rhythmic movement, and a dissolution of the distinction between structure and ornament. The scroll works, painted in golds, silvers, reds and blues, suggest both the spiritual and the erotic. Schacht's later paintings feature morphing organic abstraction and ambiguous character-like forms, painted with curving lines, free-spirited shapes and saturated colors. Critics describe them as displaying spontaneity, impulse and expansion, reigned in by form and intellect; a 1985 series visualized the sensation of sexual play and orgasm through an array of color, ornate design and patterning. ==References== ==External links== *John Schacht website *\\"In a house, Tinted and Patterned\\": John Schacht and Queer Ornament, Iceberg Projects.

He conducted experiments to demonstrate insect senses and perception while also looking at the structures responsible for them. He was the first to identify what he termed as chordotonal organs. A muscular and pear-shaped structure of unknown function found in the larvae of horseflies described by him is now known as Graber's organ. He was the author of several major books on insects including Die Insekten (1877–78). ==Life and career== Gait of a carabid beetle from Die Insekten (1877)Graber was born in Weer to blacksmith Joseph Mathew and Barbara née Posch. He went to school in Innsbruck and a scholarship allowed him to study zoology at the Leopold-Franzens University from 1864 under Camill Heller. He then trained as a teacher and began to teach in high schools from 1867. He obtained a doctorate in 1868 and habilitated in zoology in 1871 with studies under Eduard Oscar Schmidt and wrote a thesis on the orthoptera of Tyrol. He also trained in histology under Alexander Rollett. He became an associate professor in 1876 and joined the University of Chernivtsi where he established a zoology institute. Graber conducted experiments to demonstrate that cockroaches avoided light and sought the dark. He also examined the preferences for colours in various insects. In his book Die Insekten (1877) he made many bold claims some of which are now known to be incorrect. He believed for instance that the queen bee flew around inside the hive. He dissected specimens of a range of insects and noted that they had sensory structures, then given the more generic name of chordotonal organs, which he believed were always involved in sensing sound and other vibrations, although it is now known that many were chemosensory in function. He demonstrated that Blatta germanica responded to sound, now known to be sensed through the anal cerci rather than chordotonal organs as he believed. Graber served as rector of the University of Chernivtsi in 1886-87. One of his students was Anton Ritter von Jaworowski. An organ at the posterior end of tabanid larvae is now known as Graber's organ. The function of this dark pear- shaped muscular structure is unknown. In 1882, Graber described sensory structures in insects that he termed as chordotonal organs. He believed that they acted like strings, stretched between two points, and resonating with external vibrations. Graber married Katharine daughter of Carl Prill, a jewelry box maker in 1868 and they had a daughter Maria (who married Theodor Gartner) and a son Hermann (1873-1939) who became a geologist and teacher. During the war in 1866 he served in the Innsbruck sniper company on the Lombardy border and received a medal for his service. Graber suffered from a cancer, and had been advised to travel south to Italy. He died in Rome where he is buried at Campo Santo Teutonico. ==References== ==External links== * Die Insekten Volume 1 Volume 2 Category:Austrian entomologists Category:1844 births Category:1892 deaths ","title":"Vitus Graber"},{"id":"61526729","text":"Sensorvault is the name of an internal Google database that contains records of users' historical geo-location data.

Subsequent research identified further genetic evidence supporting this distinct subpopulation, as well as demographic differences and evidence for reproductive isolation. The subpopulation was cited as an example of incipient speciation. In 2015, distinct morphological traits were identified for the northern subpopulation and it was recognized as a distinct species, classified as Sebastes diaconus. ==Etymology== The specific epithet diaconus (deacon) refers to an 'acolyte', which is a reference to the specific epithet of the blue rockfish, mystinus, which means 'priest' in Latin. Like the two species, an acolyte and priest are similar in appearance. ==Description== The deacon rockfish has been described as a cryptic species that is difficult to distinguish from the blue rockfish. The deacon rockfish however has more visible stripes in its coloration, whereas the blue rockfish has a 'blotchy' color pattern. As such, prior to the formal classification of the species, the deacon rockfish was referred to as the 'blue-sided rockfish' and the blue rockfish was referred to as the 'blue-blotched rockfish'. The shape of the mouth and front of the face also differs subtly between the two species, with the deacon rockfish exhibiting a longer lower jaw, which results in an underbite. Under dissection, sexually mature female deacon rockfish also have a small pink or cream colored ovary, whereas mature female blue rockfish have a large orange ovary. The shape of sagittal otoliths has been found to subtly differ between males and females, which may indicate secondary sexual dimorphism. ==Genetics== Genetic differences have been identified between male and female deacon rockfish using RAD sequencing. Such differences may reflect the evolution of sex chromosomes in the species or psueuoautosomal regions within the genome (see wider discussion of sex chromosome evolution), or intralocus sexual conflict, although the function and evolutionary significance of these genetic sites is currently uncertain. A potential PCR- RFLP genetic sex marker developed for gopher rockfish does not successfully distinguish male and female deacon rockfish. ==Distribution and habitat== The deacon rockfish is found on rocky reefs and offshore areas from northern California to southern British Columbia. The species is sympatric with the blue rockfish in northern California and Oregon. ==Fishing and management== Deacon rockfish are caught both commercially and recreationally in Oregon. In 2017, the stock assessment for Oregon and California combined deacon rockfish and blue rockfish for management purposes. The stock assessment estimated the combined populations in California to have declined rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s to a low point in 1995 and then increased to a point close to the management target. The stocks in Oregon were estimated as having never experienced the same intensity of fishing as in California with spawning biomass remaining above the management target throughout the history of fishing. In Oregon, nearshore and offshore populations of deacon rockfish are de facto managed as separate stocks in order to comply with wider regulations on Sebastes rockfish fishing, although population genetic evidence does not support this distinction. ==References== ==External links== * Deacon Rockfish, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife * Deacon Rockfish, Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife * Meet the Deacon Rockfish, Oregon Marine Reserves Category:Sebastidae Category:Fish described in 2015 Category:Fish of the Pacific Ocean ","title":"Sebastes diaconus"},{"id":"61526773","text":"Bazlul Karim Falu was a Bangladeshi politician.

He was National Chief of the Order of Knights of Columbus and Rector of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences in Havana. He was named Defender of the Catholic Faith in Cuba, and on July 27, 1950 Pope Pius XII granted him the Pro-Ecclesia et Pontiff distinction for his efforts. He was a benefactor and generous donor to the Catholic Church, and helped build the Iglesia Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria, dedicated to the Virgen from the Island of Tenerife, Canary Islands, where his ancestral roots can be found. In 2008, this cathedral was named a UNESCO World Heritage site. == Early life == Dorta-Duque was born on June 27, 1896, in what was then called Corral Falso de Macuriges, today Pedro Betancourt Province of Matanzas. He studied in Havana; first, in the Pious Schools, then in Colegio de Belen, where he graduated in 1914. He graduated with a Doctorate of Civil Law in 1918 from the University of Havana, where he founded the Journal of Law Students (scientific and informative), and was the President of the Association of Law Students. Along with the presidents of other student organizations, he formed the first University Council, which he chaired. As a law professor, he specialized, in Family Law and Divorce Law. In 1930, he was instrumental in negotiations with the United States regarding the viability of international divorces occurring on the island. Upon graduation, he established his own Law Firm, specializing in Family Law. During the dictatorship of General Gerardo Machado he defended outspoken university professors and students before the Courts and War Councils. He went on to teach at the University of Havana, as Professor of Mortgage Law and, thanks to his management, the School of Agrarian Law was created, of which he was the first Professor. == Family == He married Carmen Ortiz Reyes in 1919, with whom he formed an exemplary family in many ways. They had seven children, all who went on to hold doctorate degrees and serve their communities. Rev. Juan Manuel Dorta-Duque, was their oldest son, who after studying in London, and in Rome at the Vatican, gained a doctorate in philosophy and became a Jesuit Priest. After a long career as an educator, as Director Emeritus of the Belen Alumni Association, he helped establish Belen Jesuit Preparatory School in Miami, where there is a road named in his honor. Carmen Dorta-Duque, held a doctorate degree in education, and was a teacher and principal in several Catholic Schools in Cuba and later in Miami. Manuel Antonio Dorta-Duque, held a doctorate degree in law, and became Attorney General in 1958. After fleeing Cuba, he had a long career as an attorney in Puerto Rico. Franscico Dorta- Duque also obtained a doctorate degree in philosophy and became a Jesuit Priest. He moved to the Dominican Republic where he had a long career as a journalist, and television and radio talk show host discussing religion, politics and current events. Margarita Dorta-Duque, held a doctorate degree in law, and worked alongside her father in his law firm in Cuba. Jorge Enrique Dorta-Duque held a doctorate degree in Mathematics and Physics, and went on to serve as Head of Public Works in Cuba.

Maria Elena Dorta-Duque, the youngest, held a doctorate degree in Library Studies, and became Professor and Director of Scientific Information of the Higher Institute of International Relations, in Cuba == Published works == Dorta-Duque wrote an extensive volume of legal and political essays and laws. In 1922 he published Fundamentals and Reforms in Procedural Law (work awarded by the Bar Association). He also published Summary of an Elementary Course in Civil Law in 1925. and wrote several Legal Works, including The Endorsement in Civil Law, The Code of Soviets, The Analogy in the Causes of Divorce and The Abuse of Law . Among his other works are Explained Mortgage Legislation Program (1926), Civil Law Program (1930) and Possession and Advertising (1932). In 1949, he was chief editor of the political magazine, A Barrer. He also wrote a book, Coursework in Mortgage Legislation. == Famous cases == Dorta-Duque successfully represented the Salesian Congregation and Foundation of Dolores de Betancourt for Destitute Boys and Girls before the New York Supreme court in the law suit brought by Angela del Castillo y Betancourt, contesting the will of Dolores de Betancourt. The executor of the will had passed away, and Ms. Betacourt's estate contained hundreds of thousands of dollars in New York State bonds which were bequeathed to the Foundation. Her daughter contested the will, and it was appealed up to the New York Supreme Court, but Dorta-Duque was successful in protecting the assets of the Salesian Congregation, the Foundations and the Catholic Church. == Sumner Welles negotiations == In 1933, Sumner Welles, the Assistant Secretary of State for Latin American Affairs from the United States, was sent as special envoy to Cuba to help negotiate a settlement during the government overthrow of President Gerardo Machado. in which Dorta-Duque participated. Mediation was a process of understanding between the parties of the government and the bourgeois opposition with a view to neutralizing the revolutionary action of the people of Cuba. On July 1, 1933, the official conversations began between the government of Gerardo Machado and the opposition groups that supported the Mediation. Two daily sessions were held at the headquarters of the United States embassy in Cuba. The government delegation was made up of General Alberto Herrera Franchi, Secretary of War and Navy; Octavio Averhoff, secretary of the Treasury and Mario Ruiz Mesa, of Public Instruction and Fine Arts. And the opposition was represented by Colonel Cosme de la Torriente, from the Nationalist Union; Joaquín Martínez Sáenz, for ABC; Nicasio Silveira, for the Revolutionary Radical Cellular Organization; and Manuel Dorta Duque, led the delegation of the University of Havana; along with Gustavo Aragón and Díaz Balart. == Life in politics == He was the Secretary of the Treasury of Cuba from October 1936 to December 1936. In 1939 he was elected to the Constitutional Assembly by the Republican Action Party. During the 1940 Constitutional Assembly, Dorta-Duque contributed his legal and agrarian knowledge in the discussions and preparation of the Constitution, and was a Constitutional Signatory. In 1944 he was elected Representative to the Chamber in Havana by the Republican Action Party. In the House of Representatives he was president of the Finance Commission. Among the laws he helped to create are the Organic Law of the Court of Accounts, the Organic Law of Budgets (co-author), the Law of the National Bank of Cuba (co-author) and the Law of Free Universities. In 1945, he was Delegate to the Inter-American Conference on the Problems of War and Peace in Mexico City, Mexico. Dorta-Duque was known for his \\"Moral Integrity.\\" When the Party of the Cuban People (Orthodox) was created in 1948, Dorta-Duque entered its ranks. And in 1948, the Liberal-Democratic candidate for President , Ricardo Nunez Portuondo - a member of the political opposition to Dorta- Duque's Orthodox party, included Dorta-Duque's words in his political advertisements - mentioning Dorta-Duque as a paragon of integrity. He was reelected to the House of Representatives in 1950. During this second legislative period, in 1951, he proposed the Moral Rehabilitation Law of Miguel Mariano Gómez Arias, thus annulling the sentence that dismissed him as President of the Republic. Although Gómez Arias died months before the approval of this law, his dignity was restored to the Cuban people. Perhaps the most important political influence of Dorta-Duque was in 1947, when he authored the Cuban Code on Agrarian Reform in the Congress of the Republic of Cuba. This law was so important, that it was brought back into the Free Agrarian debate some 50 years later. In 1997, when faced with food shortages and hunger, the country returned to the principles set forth in his Cuban Code: \\"the land for those who work it\\" and the \\"property for the peasant and free market for the product of the land\\" After the coup d'état of General Fulgencio Batista Zaldívar in 1959, Dorta-Duque ceased to serve as Representative. However, he remained active against the new government, fighting from his private law firm and before the Emergency Courts. == References == Category:Finance ministers of Cuba Category:Members of the Cuban House of Representatives Category:Cuban politicians Category:1896 births Category:1964 deaths ","title":"Manuel Dorta-Duque"},{"id":"61526788","text":"The Andrew Carnegie Library in Corona, California in Riverside County, California, at 8th and Main Streets, was a Carnegie library built in 1905–06. Known also as the Old Corona Public Library, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. With The building was demolished in 1978, but apparently still remains listed on the National Register. The demolition of the building long remained a sore point, with many who fought for the building's preservation. The suggested alternative use for the property was as a fish-fry restaurant, which was never built. In 2010, the property was still an empty lot. It was a Classical Revival work of architect Franklin Pierce Burnham, and was Corona's only example of Classical Revival style. The building served as Corona's public library from 1906 until 1971. A new library was opened in 1971 at Sixth and Main Streets. The library was expanded following a bond vote in 1988. A 1971 photo available from the Corona Public Library shows a library interior, apparently from the modern replacement building. Its architectural significance \\"was acknowledged by its placement on the National Register of Historic Places. However, the building stood 'boarded up and vacant while the city raged about what was to be done with the building' from 1971 to 1978. It was demolished in 1978 and the Heritage Room at the new library was 'started as a compromise between keeping the city's history alive and having a new library building.' Corona's library history dates from an 1893 WCTU reading room, replaced by an 1895 YMCA library, in its turn taken over by the Women's Improvement Club and finally transferred to the city in 1900. The early libraries occupied a succession of rented rooms until Carnegie funding of $10,000 was obtained in March,1905. This was increased to $11,500 due to the intercession of J. A. Flagler of New York, who apparently had ties in Corona in addition to being a close friend of Andrew Carnegie. Ground was broken in August and the building was dedicated July 2, 1906. The building was demolished in 1978.\\" ==See also== *List of Carnegie libraries in California ==References== Category:Carnegie libraries in California Category:National Register of Historic Places in Riverside County, California Category:Neoclassical architecture in California Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1906 Category:1906 establishments in California Category:Demolished buildings and structures in California Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1978 ","title":"Andrew Carnegie Library (Corona, California)"},{"id":"61526791","text":"Marisol Deluna is an American fashion designer based in New York City who specializes in screen-printed fashion accessories, apparel and home décor sold under the label Marisol Deluna New York. ==Early life== Born on June 20, 1967 to Rudolfo (Rudy) and Peggy Luna in San Antonio, Texas, Deluna uses her family's original Spanish surname.

Nilo Masó Miró, a former speed driver, started his motorcycle manufacturing company in 1924 in Barcelona, producing machines powered by 175 and 250 cc two-stroke engines from Villiers and DKW. Alpha became one of the leading Spanish motorcycle manufacturers of the period before the Spanish Civil War. The marque was known for the pleasing aesthetics of its models. After the war, when the import of foreign parts was severely restricted, and like many other manufacturers, the factory turned to the reconstruction of ex-army machines and the construction of auxiliary motors for bicycles. ==MV Alpha== Count Agusta had plans to expand the MV Agusta brand internationally. In post-Civil War Spain, the Franco regime banned the import of motorcycles and also forbade foreign nationals from settling in Spain, or stating a business there. Brothers Mario and Natale Corando intended to set up manufacture of MV machines under licence by a local factory, which had licenses and manufacturing permits and therefore have access to raw materials. A deal was struck with Nilo Masó of Alpha. To provide finance, Enrique Favier and Antonio Sommariva joined the venture and MV Alpha was formed in 1948. In the first models went on sale. They were powered by a 125 cc two-stroke engine and offered as standard, lujo (luxury) and sports models. Power output was 3.2 bhp, and 4.5 bhp for the sports models, giving top speeds of 60 and 70 km/h. A smaller 98 cc model was subsequently produced. Sales were good, but because of the limited facilities of Alpha, production could not be increased. The licence to produce MV motorcycles was transferred to the larger and better equipped Avello factory in the Natahoyo neighbourhood of Gijón in Asturias in 1951, creating the MV Avello brand. ==Demise== The loss of the MV license caused the beginning of the decline of Alpha workshops. In 1953 Alpha collaborated in the construction of the Evycsa motorcycle with four-stroke FITA-AMC engines. Also produced were distribution tricycles (equipped with OSSA and Hispano Villiers engines ) and a 175cc light motorcycle, inspired by the BSA Bantam. The factory finally closed in 1957. ==Resurrection== The name was resurrected in 2014, with 100% Spanish capital, to produce motorcycles and electric bicycles. They planned to produce a cafe racer derived from the Ducati 800SS styled on the Bonneville Salt Flats racers. An electric bike similar to the Bultaco Brinco was also planned. The company was located in the Province of Pontevedra. In 2017, the company introduced lightweight carbon fibre drake discs for bicycles. They were claimed to be the lightest discs available at between 32 and 70 grams dependent of size. ==References== ==Bibliography== * Category:MV Agusta Category:Motorcycle manufacturers of Spain Category:Spanish brands Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1924 Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies disestablished in 1957 Category:1957 disestablishments in Spain Category:Spanish companies established in 1924 ","title":"Alpha (motorcycle)"},{"id":"61526990","text":"Coșula Monastery is a monastery of monks located in the village of Coșula (in Botoșani county), at a distance of 20 kilometers southeast of Botoșani city.

Allen is a British neuroscientist. Allen studies the role of astrocytes in brain development, homeostasis, and aging, and has uncovered the critical roles these cells play in brain plasticity and disease. Allen is currently an associate professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies and Hearst Foundation Development Chair. == Education == Allen conducted her undergraduate studies in Anatomical Sciences at the University of Manchester in England. She completed her doctoral degree in Neuroscience at University College London in the United Kingdom in the lab of David Attwell. She was a postdoctoral researcher in the lab of Ben Barres at Stanford University. == Research == Allen's research focuses on how astrocytes regulate synapses in the brain during disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. In 2012 while she was a postdoc in the lab of Ben Barres, she showed that astrocytes secrete glypican 4 and 6, which is needed to create glutamatergic synapses between neurons. She later expanded the research on glypican 4, showing that it is needed for the postsynaptic neurons to receive inputs. Allen also showed that astrocytes excrete a protein called Chrdl1, which helps the maturation of the brain. It also increased neuroplasticity in the brains of mice. Allen uses ribo-tagging, which is a molecular technique to determine which proteins are made by the ribosomes. This technique allowed her to show that astrocytes make a protein that encourages the breakdown of connections between neurons. == Awards and honours == * Ben Barres Early Career Acceleration Award from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) - 2018 * Pew Scholar - 2015 * Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP) Long Term Fellowship - 2005–2008 * European Molecular Biology Organisation (EMBO) Long Term Fellowship - 2004–2005 * Wellcome Trust PhD Fellowship - 1999–2003 == Selected publications == * * * == References == Category:21st-century British biologists Category:21st-century British women scientists Category:British women biologists Category:Alumni of University College London Category:Alumni of the University of Manchester Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people ","title":"Nicola Allen"},{"id":"61527029","text":"Abdul Momin Mondol is a Bangladesh Awami League politician and the incumbent Member of Parliament of Sirajganj-5. ==Early life== Mondol was born on 1 January 1980.

The painting is a portrait of Joshua Smith, an artist and friend of Dobell. The painting was awarded the Archibald Prize in 1943. The painting took a modernist approach to portraiture; a break with the realism favoured to that date by Archibald Prize entrants. The modernist painting attracted vehement criticism and equally passionate praise. The controversy spilled over from the arts world to the general public, with the Art Gallery of New South Wales having to extend opening hours and later prolong the exhibition. Over 140,000 people viewed the portrait during the exhibition - 10% of Sydney's population at the time. This award was contested in the Supreme Court of New South Wales by Mary Edwell- Burke and Joseph Wolinski on the grounds that the painting was not a portrait but rather a caricature. The case was lost and the award stood. The case was said to have \\"placed art on trial\\" and to have raised \\"questions of what constituted a portrait and what was the relationship of realism to art in general.\\" Smith himself was hurt by the depiction and by the controversy associated with the portrait. In 1990 Smith called the portrait \\"a curse, a phantom that haunts me. It has torn at me every day of my life.\\" Dobell sold the painting to Sir Edward Hayward, a businessman from South Australia. In 1952, the painting was damaged in a fire at the Hayward's home. Dobell himself declined to restore the work. In 1972, Kenneth Malcolm, conservator at the National Gallery in London, undertook a restoration. Malcolm worked from a black and white photograph of the original and the extent of the damage required significant repainting. This restoration created further controversy as some questioned if the portrait could still be considered a work by Dobell. Brett Whiteley's 1978 Archibald Prize winning work Art, Life and the other thing includes a self-portrait of Whiteley holding a copy of Dobell's painting. ==References== Category:1943 paintings Category:Paintings by William Dobell Category:Portraits by Australian artists Category:20th-century portraits Category:Archibald Prize ","title":"Mr Joshua Smith"},{"id":"61527129","text":"Platzi is a Colombian educational platform. ==History== Platzi was founded in Colombia by Freddy Vega and Christian Van Der Henst in 2014. Both met as competitors in their former companies: Cristalab and Maestros del Web. The company was born from a livestream weekly show called “Mejorando.la”, before becoming \\"Platzi\\" in 2015, partially to make the company more amenable to international consumers. In 2015 it received its first venture capital funding. Initial offices for the company were in Bogota, Colombia, and Mexico City, Mexico. In 2014 the co-founders moved to San Francisco after being accepted to Y Combinator Winter 2015 program in Silicon Valley, becoming the first company targeting Latin American to be accepted to the incubator. In the same year it raised $2.1 million from funds like Omidyar Network and 500 Startups. In 2018, the company raised a $6.1 million Series A from Foundation Capital and it expanded to Spain and Brazil.

A sampling of courses available as of 2018 were Programming Foundations, Internet Of Things, Mathematics for Programming, Facebook Ads Platform, Google Cloud Platform, IBM Cloud, Interface Design, and Development with Unity. Platzi has also created employee training courses for corporations, including Microsoft, IBM, Facebook and Google. It has also launched free educational campaigns during elections to provide voters with information about the different parties, issues, and candidates, in addition to days on which anyone can use their lessons for free. In 2015 Platzi began offering English lessons. In addition to its courses, Platzi runs conferences and news broadcast channels for the tech world. ==Students== As of 2017 the platform had about 370,000 students, mainly in Mexico, Colombia, Spain, and the United States. In 2018 the platform had 600,000 students. As of 2019 the platform had more than one million students, 150,000 of which were located in Colombia, and the rest in other countries.

The Mall, The Merrier marks the first on-screen collaboration between Anne Curtis and Vice Ganda, both of whom are regular hosts in the noontime variety show It's Showtime. ==Synopsis== Two siblings, Moira and Morissette, feud over Tamol Mall, a mall they inherited.

The finale scenes were filmed at Marquee Mall in Angeles City, Pampanga. ==Reception== The film received mixed reviews from critics, despite coming in first at the box office. Most of the criticism was directed at its \\"non- existent\\" plot, stale humor and poor use of the shopping mall setting. Oggs Cruz of Rappler lamented what he saw as a wasted opportunity, stating it is \\"more of the same – and messier\\" and \\"while the settings change or the genre it spoofs shift, the elements remain the same. The comedies are all anchored on mean-spirited hilarity, all utilizing a broad moral lesson to make its abject crassness palatable to the families it caters to,\\" comparing it unfavorably to George Romero's seminal zombie film Dawn of the Dead whose department store setting was used to satirize consumerism. Conversely, Jocelyn Valle of PEP.ph gave the film a more positive review, praising the cast, special effects and pop culture references, particularly the feud between the Baretto sisters and the network rivalry between ABS-CBN and GMA Network, a scene of which where Vice's character Moises and a parodic depiction of the living doll Annabelle from The Conjuring, played by Ruffa Gutierrez, get into a hair-pulling fight and wind up in the premises of the GMA-7 broadcast facility. Valle did, however, criticise the \\"lack of a strong supporting character for Vice to throw punchlines at and comedic flair\\" and found Vice's use of a joke pertaining to German dictator Adolf Hitler to be of poor taste in light of Holocaust victims. ==Television release== The film premiered on KBO from May 1–6, 2020 at the time ABS-CBN Channel 2 and its broadcast stations went off air on May 5, 2020, due to the \\"cease and desist order\\" given by the National Telecommunications Commission due to expired franchise, and KBO was not affected in this \\"cease and desist order\\" (due to the channel is on a digital station that is owned by AMCARA, which has its own franchise and where ABS-CBN had a blocktime agreement with the said station) until June 30, 2020 in Metro Manila and July 1, 2020 nationwide.

She was known as \\"the nation's nightingale\\", an epithet given her by writer Mór Jókai. \\"First published in the Time Out Budapest magazine's monthly column \\"Magyar of the Month\\" (2009-2011)\\" ==Personal life== Ludovika Reindl was born 8 September 1850 in Rimaszombat, Hungary, now Rimavská Sobota, Slovakia. She married Jan Blaha, a conductor in the imperial army, when she was 15 years old. He died five years later, but she kept his surname all her life despite marrying twice more. Despite being considered a \\"national icon\\" during her lifetime, she opposed the dignified \\"national prima donna\\" that was being thrust upon her and often crossed the taboos of the epoch by being sexually provocative both on stage and in her private life. She died 18 January 1926 in Budapest. She was buried in the Kerepesi Cemetery, and her funeral drew a crowd of 100,000, including a gypsy band of 200 musicians. ==Career== Blaha's parents were travelling actors, and she first performed aged 15 in Szabadka. She received acting training from the Budapest School of Dramatic Arts. She joined the national theatre five years later and between 1871 and 1900 she played almost 200 parts in plays, mostly Hungarian \\"folk plays\\" or \\"Volksstuck\\", patriotic plays celebrating peasant life. Apart from her theater work, she would also draw crowds at balls, the banquets and torchlight music events organised by the Mulató-klub (The Club of Amusements), and she was also active as an operetta singer. She also appeared in two silent films. The first, A táncz (\\"Dance\\", 1901) was an educational documentary short by Pekár Gyula, while the second, A nagymama (The Grandmother, 1916) sees her play the title role in the Alexander Korda film. She played an important role in popularizing Hungarian gypsy songs. Her final performance in 1908 was in Csiky Gergely's play Nagymama (\\"grandmother\\"). ==Legacy== Lujza Blaha Square in central Budapest was named for her in 1920 to celebrate her 70th birthday. It was the site of the Hungarian National Theatre from 1908 to 1965; this was demolished because of construction of Blaha Lujza tér metro station. Her Neoclassical summer home in the resort town of Balatonfüred, on the northern shore of lake Balaton, has been turned into a hotel bearing her name is a minor tourist attraction of the town. Blaha's grave in the Kerepesi Cemetery Her tomb in Kerepesi Cemetery has been described as \\"one of the finest pieces in the Hungarian national pantheon\\".

She is noted for her long career as a principal dancer with the Dance Theatre of Harlem and as the first African-American woman to lead a ballet company. == Early life == Born into a family of medical professionals, Brown was raised as one of seven children in Augusta, Georgia. As a child she attended Episcopal Day School alongside her brother Stephen, making them the first African- American children to integrate the institution. At the prompting of her mother, Brown began her ballet studies after turning eight years old to help alleviate her habit of falling. In addition to studying with the former New York City Ballet dancer, Ron Colton, Brown was also a summer scholarship student at the Joffrey Ballet school. At the age of 17, after having performed with Augusta Civic Ballet for five years, Colton took Brown to a ballet festival in Virginia to present her with new opportunities. There she was scouted by Arthur Mitchell's co-founder of Dance Theatre of Harlem, Karel Shook, who invited her to join the company in New York. == Career == Joining Dance Theatre of Harlem as an apprentice in 1973, Brown quickly rose through the ranks, amassing a wide repertoire of ballets. In 1984 she was profiled by Jennifer Dunning in the New York Times for her versatility as \\"one of those dancers who is as compelling in plotless ballets as in dramatic works that require her to portray a character\\". As a principal ballerina with DTH, Brown starred in numerous tours all over the world, including performances in Russia—as the first American company to visit the country after the fall of the Soviet Union—and on DTH's historic visit to post-apartheid South Africa. Brown's repertoire included William Dollar's Mendelssohn's Concerto, Arthur Mitchell's Holberg's Suite, John Henry, and The Greatest, Geoffrey Holder's Dougla, Bele, and Banda, David Lichine's Graduation Ball, Carmen de Lavallade's Sensemaya, George Balanchine's Agon, Serenade, Concerto Barocco, Stars and Stripes, and Four Temperaments, Glen Tetley's Voluntaries and Dialogues, Agnes de Mille's Fall River Legend, David Gordon's Piano Movers, Frederic Franklin's Swan Lake, Creole Giselle, Paquita, and Pas de Dix, Billy Wilson's Ginastera, Goh Choo San's Variations Serieuses, Robert Garland's Joplin Dances, John Taras' The Firebird, Alonzo King's Signs and Wonders, and Garth Fagan's Footprints Dressed In Red. While performing with DTH, Brown taught residencies and masterclasses as an associate artist of Arthur Mitchell's Dancing Through The Barriers program, which was created to provide dance education to people of all backgrounds. She was featured in a PBS documentary about the program while teaching at The Kennedy Center. After 22 years dancing with the company, Brown left Dance Theatre of Harlem at the end of its 1995 season to join Atlanta Ballet Center for Dance Education as director of education and diversity. == Directorship == Brown entered the international search to find the next artistic director of Oakland Ballet, a diverse company known for staging reconstructions of important works of the twentieth century. In 2000 she was invited by the company's board to assume leadership of the institution, making her the first African-American woman to direct a ballet company in history and the first African-American to run a formerly all white led ballet company. Following Dance Theatre of Harlem's suspension of operations in 2004, Brown was the only African-American artistic director of a ballet company in the world. During her tenure, Brown worked to further diversify the ballet's ranks so that it more accurately reflected the cultural demographics of Oakland. She also modernized the company's choreographic repertoire while expanding its existing funding structure to create greater financial stability. Brown broadened the repertoire to include more works by choreographers of color, in particular black choreographers. This includes works by Trey McIntyre, Francesca Harper, Dwight Rhoden, Dudley Brooks, and Donald McKayle. Though driven towards creating a fresh dance perspective, Brown remained committed to honoring Oakland Ballet's tradition of presenting classic ballets from the likes of José Limón, Agnes de Mille, Eugene Loring, and Bronislava Nijinska. Acknowledging her mission to create a cultural renaissance, then mayor of Oakland Jerry Brown declared her great news for the city. Additionally she used her profile to challenge the notion that it was difficult to find classically trained dancers of color to hire by speaking out on the issue and recruiting numerous talented dancers of all backgrounds herself. Though praised for elevating Oakland Ballet's profile and raising the technical level of its dancers, Brown was forced to contend with an expanding deficit in the face of lost arts funding. To save Oakland Ballet itself from shuttering, she suspended the 2004 season and focused on a successful $500,000 fundraising campaign that allowed operations to resume with a new roster of dancers in time for the organization's 40th anniversary celebration. Founding artistic director Ronn Guidi returned to lead the organization upon her departure. Brown departed Oakland in 2007 to join University of The Arts, Philadelphia as an assistant professor in dance. During her time in Philadelphia, Brown was awarded a $12,500 research grant to analyze dance movement through computer programming. While developing this research, she met the Lion King associate producer and former Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater star, Aubrey Lynch II who later invited her to join the faculty of the Harlem School of The Arts. Concurrent with this time, she returned to her performance career, joining Paradigm, a dance company founded by Gus Solomon Jr to feature mature dancers. She was awarded a Bessie Award in 2010 for her performances with the group. In 2015, while visiting her hometown, Brown performed alongside her brother, the Broadway performer Russell Joel Brown, saxophonist Wycliffe Gordon, and opera diva Jessye Norman in a fundraiser at Augusta University for the Jessye Norman School of the Arts. The following year she was appointed executive director of Garth Fagan Dance. In 2017 she was invited to Ballet Wichita as guest artistic director. Later that year she was awarded the Harriet Tubman Freedom Award. Since 2018 she has returned to teaching and her research in analyzing movement. == Personal life == Brown was close friends with the ballet star, Mel Tomlinson who appointed her executor of his estate to honor the fact that she was the only person to respond to his call for help after he contracted HIV.

The age of the Baltimore Gneiss has been constrained to 1.0-1.1 Ga. ===Members=== The Gneiss is homogeneous overall, but is recognized as having four subdivisions. These are the layered gneiss member, the augen gneiss member, the streaked-augen gneiss member, and the hornblende gneiss member. Additionally, the Baltimore Gneiss outcrops into three discrete masses of uniform, well-foliated to massive granitic gneiss referred to as the Slaughterhouse Gneiss. The layered gneiss member consists of dark and light layers of gneiss bearing biotite, microcline, quartz, and plagioclase, varying from biotite schist to quartzo-feldspathic granofels interlayered on a centimeter to decimeter scale. The augen gneiss member consists of two belts of fine to medium grained gneiss bearing biotite, microcline, quartz, and plagioclase, with abundant large ovoids (augen) consisting of microcline and/or quartz. The streaked-augen gneiss member consists of uniform, medium-grained biotite-microcline-quartz-plagioclase gneiss, with augen that have a \\"stretched\\" or \\"streaked\\" appearance. The hornblende gneiss member is similar to the layered gneiss member, but with hornblende-bearing dark gneiss accounting for about half of the outcrop area. The Slaughterhouse Gneiss weathers to a pinkish to orange color, and consists of relatively uniform, medium-grained microcline-quartz-plagioclase gneiss with muscovite, biotite, or both. ==Structure== Illustration of an inclusion of the Baltimore Gneiss within the Woodstock Quartz Monzonite The Phoenix, Texas, Chattalolanee, and Towson gneiss anticlines in the Baltimore, Maryland area are all part of a refolded nappe system beneath the Towson anticline. The cores of these nappes consist of the Baltimore Gneiss. The Baltimore Gneiss has been affected by three deformation periods: the Grenvillian, known from radiometric age data, for which nearly all resulting structural features where destroyed or obstructed by later tectonic deformation; the Taconic-Acadian, which involved three phases of folding, amphibolite facies metamorphism, local migmatization, and the development of the gneiss's pervasive structural elements; and the Alleghanian-Palisades, which resulted in predominantly brittle faulting and open folding. The cause of the Grenvillian deformation is uncertain. The Taconic-Acadian deformation was caused by the collision of an ocean floor/island arc terrane with a continental margin or fringing microcontinent in the early Paleozoic. The Alleghanian-Pallisades deformation was caused by continental rifting in the early Mesozoic, and possibly late- Paleozoic trans-current plate motions. ==History== The Grace Methodist Episcopal Church in Baltimore City, an example of a building built in part from \\"Falls Road blue gneiss.\\" The name Baltimore Gneiss was first used by George Huntington Williams in 1892 to describe the variety of widely distributed gneisses in the Baltimore area. ===Usage=== The Baltimore Gneiss has been used in the past as building stone in the Baltimore area. It is thought that some of the first buildings built in Baltimore in the 1700s were constructed of gneiss quarried from Jones Falls. In addition to use in buildings, gneiss from Jones Falls and Gwynn Falls quarries was used for foundations, roads, and curbstones in Baltimore. Some quarrymen referred to the gneiss as \\"blue stone\\" due to the blue-gray color of its fresh surface. The last building stone quarry in Baltimore closed in 1958. ==Type localities== The type locality of the Baltimore Gneiss as described by William Patrick Crowley of the Maryland Geological Survey in 1976 is defined as outcrops along Towson Run from Bellona Avenue to Towsontown Boulevard. Formerly, the type locality was consider to refer to layered gneisses which outcrop along Jones Falls and Gwynns Falls in Baltimore City, however, chemical and textural analysis followed by zircon age measurements determined that these gneisses represent a distinct younger geologic unit. The type locality of the layered gneiss member includes stream cuts along Herring Run for 255 meters on either side of Arlington Avenue bridge near Morgan State University. The type locality of the augen gneiss member includes outcrops along Long Green Creek 385 meters southeast of Glenarm Road bridge. The type locality of the streaked-augen gneiss member includes outcrops along Merryman Branch 125 meters upstream from the Dulaney Valley Road bridge. The type locality of the hornblende gneiss member includes outcrops along an unnamed stream between Malvern Avenue and Boyce Avenue. The type locality of the Slaughterhouse Gneiss outcrops along the Slaughterhouse Branch southeast of the Baltimore Beltway (I-695). ==Notable outcrops== Some notable exposures of the Baltimore Gneiss in addition to the type localities mentioned above include outcrops along the Rapids Trail in the McKeldin Area of Patapsco Valley State Park and along roads around the Loch Raven Reservoir. ==References== Category:Geology of Maryland Category:Geology of Pennsylvania Category:Geology of Delaware Category:Precambrian United States Category:Gneiss ","title":"Baltimore Gneiss"},{"id":"61527727","text":"Ildikó Balog (born 7 November 1977) is a Hungarian gymnast.

He enlisted Pons de Vassal and Isar d’Escodata, both members of the papal court, and procured poisons and wax figurines to bewitch the pope. He first tested the bewitchment against the pope's nephew Jacques de Via. Three wax figurines of the pope, Bertrand du Pouget and Gaucelme de Jean were hidden in loaves and given to messengers to carry into the episcopal palace. However, the messengers' strange behaviour drew the attention of the papal guards, who discovered the figurines. On 23 March 1317 Géraud and everyone else implicated in the plot were arrested. Influential figures from south-west France gravitated towards Géraud's entourage, including Gaillard de Preyssac (bishop of Toulouse and nephew of pope Clement V), Arnaud de Pellegrue (cardinal and rival to John XXII at his election as pope) and the viscount of Bruniquel (Clement V's nephew by marriage). Questioning began on 22 April at the château de Noves and on 5 May the pope commissioned Pierre des Prés and Arnaud de Capdenac to continue the enquiry. The suspects were questioned in secret, meaning the names of major figures implicated in the plot were not revealed. The plot quickly unravelled, with Géraud admitting everything without being tortured and the pope praising des Près's \\"prudence, faithfulness and experience\\". During the questioning Jacques de Via died. On 21 August the pope personally questioned Géraud, who nine days later was found guilty of witchcraft, sacrilege and the murder of Jacques de Via. He was dismissed from his bishopric, handed over to the secular arm and burned at the stake in front of the episcopal palace in Avignon. de Preyssac also lost his diocese, but de Pellegrue went unpunished. 1317 also saw the pope issue a papal bull expanding inquisitors' rights when investigating witchcraft and sorcery, followed by another in August 1326 entitled Super illius specula which made sorcery practically equivalent to heresy. This campaign against sorcery was continued by John's successors from pope Benedict XII to Antipope Alexander V. At the pope's request Pierre des Prés also presided over the trials of Géraud's accomplices, most notably those of Pierre de Saleilles in September 1322 and of Bernard Gasc (a bishop in partibus who had blessed the wax figurines) on 26 November 1322 ==References== Category:Bishops of Cahors category:1317 deaths Category:Failed assassins category:People executed by burning ","title":"Hugues Géraud"},{"id":"61527973","text":"The Aoyate drought was an acute meteorological drought that according to Turkana tradition affected much of the Rift Valley region of Kenya during the late 18th century or early 19th century. ==Naming== The word aoyate is from the Turkana language and means long dry time. It is the word that the Turkana use to describe this dry period in their history. ==Periodization== Lamphear (1988) noted that chronological reckonings based on the Turkana age-set system suggested a date in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries. He notes that concurrent drought traditions suggested in the chronological reconstruction of neighboring communities indicates that the drought affected much of the Rift Valley region. Records of Nile River flood stages date back to the 7th century AD and an analysis of the flood patterns and comparison with water levels in Lake Chad revealed a correlation between high Nile discharge and greater rainfall in equatorial East Africa. The analysis of Nile flood stages indicates a 'Minor Low' for the period 1800 to 1830, this was preceded by a 'Minor High' during the years 1725 to 1800 and was followed by a 'Minor High' which lasted between 1830 and 1870. Studies in Ethiopia by Pankhurst indicated major famines in 1880–1881, 1835 and in 1829. These studies are significant in that the country of Ethiopia borders present-day Turkana county. Meanwhile, Samburu historians interviewed by Straight et. al (2016) state that the Samburu separated from a society known as Burkineji in the wake of the 1830s Mutai. According to a Samburu Laibon interviewed by Fratkin (2011), the Sambur 'Il Kipkeku' age-set were warriors during the period c.1837-1851. The various narratives, records and reports thus point to a long dry period starting about 1800 seemingly peaking with an intensely arid time during the mid-1830s. This would be congruent with Krapf's (1860) mention of a \\"great famine of 1836\\". ==Prelude== There are a number of oral traditions from various communities across much of southern Africa that point to the region having experienced declining rainfall levels from about 1800 to about 1830. This saw the progressive desiccation of lakes, rivers and springs, a phenomenon observed by an employee of the East India Company in the 1820s who noted; ==Effects of the drought== ===Diminished carrying capacity for livestock=== The drought decimated the herds of the Chemwal, thought to have been cervicothoraic-humped Sanga crossbreeds, leading to the disintegration of the community. ===Famine=== Sengwer folklore has it that, \\"It became dry and there was great hunger. The Siger went away to the east to Moru Eris, where most of them died of heat and starvation. So many died that there is still a place there called Kabosan (the rotten place)\\". ===War=== Full scale war flared up between the Turkana and Chemwal. Bands of Turkana warriors forced some Chemwalin northwards to the head of Lake Turkana where they formed the Inkabelo section of the developing Dassanech community. Other Chemwalin were pushed back onto the Suk hills, to the south to be incorporated by the Chok leading to the rise of the ritually important Kachepkai clan while others yet were assimilated by the Turkana where some became a new clan known simply as Siger. The victorious Turkana took possession of the grazing and water resources of Moru Assiger. ===Mass migration=== Other Chemwalin were forced to abandon their highland abodes and fled eastwards where they ran into even drier conditions and a great many died. ==Aftermath== The Aoyate destroyed the lives and livelihoods of many inhabitants of the Rift Valley region. ==References== Category:Climate of Kenya Category:Droughts in Africa ","title":"Aoyate drought"},{"id":"61527982","text":"Indragarh Sumerganj Mandi railway station is a railway station in Bundi district, Rajasthan.

It is now a community center. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. ==History== The area around Hessel was first settled by Europeans in the 1880s. The first school, located just behind the location of the present building, was constructed in 1887. By the 1930s, this school was outdated, and in 1936, a new school was funded through the Works Progress Administration (WPA). The WPA chose architect G. Harold Thompson from Mullett Lake, Michigan to design the new school. Construction began in early 1937, and the new school opened for classes in September 1938, with the auditorium section of the building opened in December. The school served students from grades K-5. After fifth grade, students transferred to the nearby Cedarville School, or, in the case of many Native American children, to the Holy Childhood Indian boarding school in Harbor Springs. In 1958, the Cedarville School was expanded, and all elementary education was transferred to that location. The Hessel School was closed. The building remained empty until 1964, when the school district sold it to Northern Michigan Publishing Company. The company closed in the late 1960s, after which the building was vacant for a time. In 1972, it was sold to Azor D. Sheffield, who remodeled it into a residence. Azor Sheffield died in 2013, and his daughters inherited the property. They listed it for sale in 2014. In 2015, the Sheffield family sold the building to the Hessel School House Corporation, an organization of mostly former Hessel School students or their descendants. The group rehabilitated the building, completing work in 2016. The school now serves as a community center, with arts and nature education, markets, and community and private events. ==Description== The Hessel School is the one-story reddish brick Colonial Revival elementary school building with irregular native limestone detail. The limestone is used as quoins at all corners, and as lintels over the windows and doors. The building is symmetrical, with the main spaced forming an I-shaped footprint. Two small wings extend from the rear of the building at the center. The building has gable roofs, with a small hexagonal central bell tower. The front of the building rests on a concrete slab, while the rear has a basement underneath. The main facade has a central entry covered with a semicircular portico, supported by two Tuscan columns. The entry is flanked by two six over six double hung windows, with a three-pane transom above. The other windows in the building are similar. At each end of the building, the classroom wings project forward. Each contains two windows near the corners. The gable ends above are white-painted wood clapboard are with cornice returns and circular roof vents. The interior of the building contains a central auditorium with two classrooms, one on each side. The main central entrance opens into a vestibule, which continues into the central auditorium space. A stage is located at the rear wall of the auditorium. Off the auditorium are doors opening to the classrooms on each side, and to restrooms. ==References== ==External links== *Hessel School House Category:Schools in Michigan Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1938 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Mackinac County, Michigan ","title":"Hessel School"},{"id":"61528315","text":"Brian Albert Wetheridge (born 13 January 1953), is a male former diver who competed for Great Britain and England.

He also pioneered research on the histories of missions and local churches in South Kyung province. Especially, stemming from his interest in Early Christianity, he sought to promote understanding of the New Testament from a multidimensional perspective. Thus, his writings are ecclesiastically rooted on the biblical view of the church which holds many valuable applications for the present Korean churches. In sum, Dr. Lee can be regarded as one of great church historians for the church.

The son of Edward Clough Taylor and Emma Georgina Taylor (née Badcock), he was born on 27 August 1823 at Appleton- le-Street, Yorkshire. Educated at Harrow School between 1838 and 1842 where he appeared for the school first cricket XI in 1840–41. From Harrow he enlisted in the British Army by purchasing the rank of ensign in the 41st Regiment of Foot in September 1842, with Taylor purchasing the rank of lieutenant in 1844. He made his debut in first-class cricket in 1850 for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against Cambridge University at Fenner's. He made four further first-class appearances in 1850, with two further appearances for the MCC, in addition to playing for Middlesex against Surrey at The Oval, and for the Gentlemen of England against the Gentlemen of Kent at Canterbury. His final first-class appearance came in 1851 for the MCC against Cambridge University. His six first-class matches yielded him 70 runs with a high score of 20. In February 1850, Taylor purchased a captaincy in the 41st Foot but sold he commission in May 1850 and retired from the army. By 1852 Taylor was in the Cape Colony and saw action in the Eighth Xhosa War as a Captain in command of a company of native troops for which he was mentioned in dispatches. Returning to Britain by 1853, he was appointed as adjutant to the 5th West Yorkshire Militia. He was appointed as a deputy lieutenant for the West Riding of Yorkshire in 1855.

Doug Collette, writing for Glide Magazine, gave it five out of ten, saying that right from the start of album opener \\"Heigh Ho\\", \\"it’s apparent Los Lobos inhabit the music as much as it inhabits them. An onslaught of percussion gives way to chanting in Spanish, an arrangement that might just as easily adorn one of the band’s originals.\\" Collette also felt that the band were \\"as tasteful as usual throughout\\". John Metzger of The Music Box magazine gave the album three stars out of five, and said that the original songs aren’t necessarily well suited to Los Lobos’ style, \\"so the success of Los Lobos Goes Disney largely is dependent upon the band’s ability to find a unique perspective for delivering this material ... the results are merely adequate, even if they are passively enjoyable.\\" The Fowler Tribune's Patrick Varine called it \\"a really, really entertaining cover album\\", and said that it \\"plays just as well for kids as it will for adults\\". ==Track listing== == Personnel == Credits adapted from the album's liner notes. ;Los Lobos * David Hidalgo – vocals, guitar, accordion, hidalguera, requinto jarocho, keyboards * Cesar Rosas – vocals, guitar, bajo sexto * Louie Pérez – vocals, guitar, jarana * Conrad Lozano – vocals, bass, guitarron * Steve Berlin – saxophone, flute, percussion, keyboards ;Additional musicians * Cougar Estrada – drums, percussion, keyboards * Vicki Rosas – vocals on \\"Grim Grinning Ghosts\\" ;Production * Los Lobos – producer * Mark Johnson – engineer, mixing * Greg Morgenstein – engineer, mixing * Dave McNair – mastering * Mando Tavares – production assistance * Louie Pérez – art direction * Steve Gerdes – art direction * Anabel Sinn – album design * Louie Pérez III – drawing ==References== Category:Los Lobos albums Category:2009 albums Category:Disney Sound albums Category:Children's music albums Category:Covers albums ","title":"Los Lobos Goes Disney"},{"id":"61529079","text":"Sacred Games logo from the opening sequence of the first season.

She is a member of the Directors Guild of America and has been nominated for an Academy Award. == Career == Born in Pontiac, Michigan, she was raised in Alabama. In her late teens, she moved to New York City and eventually began her filmmaking career. She learned her craft by doing continuity for over 15 years on feature films and working with directors as diverse as Gerald Diamiano, Richard Attenborough, Karel Reisz, Paul Schrader, Jonathan Demme, and Taylor Hackford. While working behind the camera, as a script supervisor, she also acted in Demme's film Last Embrace. This was the beginning of a brief acting career. She played the lead role in the independently produced film noir Variety, which was invited to the Director’s Fortnight at the Cannes Film Festival in 1984. She later had roles in Melvin and Howard, Tootsie, Something Wild, and City of Hope. For a short stretch of time, McLeod worked as a production designer on a series of projects that included PBS’s “Trying Times” written by Beth Henley, and directed by Jonathan Demme, starring Roseanna Arquette. Also, on “Mountainview”, a dance film directed by John Sayles and choreographed by Marta Renzi for “Alive From Off Center” She collaborated with Demme as the production designer on “Swimming to Cambodia.” She teamed up with Jordan Cronenweth and Jonathan Demme as a visual consultant to establish the innovative textural elements for the landmark film Stop Making Sense. She also worked with Demme as an Associate Producer on a documentary for Channel 4 titled Haiti: Dreams of Democracy. McLeod also contributed as the second unit director to John Sayles films Limbo and Silver City. Her next film was “Doll Day Afternoon”, a short she directed for Saturday Night Live. McLeod conceptualized, produced, and directed several Talking Heads music videos. “Nothing but Flowers” was featured at the New York Film Festival. She produced, directed, and co-wrote segments of an AIDS awareness project aired by CBS titled Red Hot + Blue. McLeod directed the Academy Award-nominated short documentary Asylum, about a Ghanaian woman who sought political asylum in the United States to escape female genital mutilation in her home country. The film won a Gracie, and was nominated for an Emmy in 2006. Her first feature-length documentary Seeds of Time premiered at South by Southwest Film Festival and has played in numerous film festivals all over the world. Seeds of Time traces the story of Cary Fowler and his single-handed effort to successfully establish the Svalbard Seed Bank that is now the repository of seed samples from around the world. The film stresses the importance of agricultural diversity, especially given the dire implications of climate change. It won several awards, including the Audience Award at the San Francisco Green Film Festival, Best Film at the Portland Eco Film Festival, and Best Cinematography at Costa Rica International Film Festival.

Reasons for not reporting include fear of reprisal, shame, uncertainty about whether a crime was committed, or a belief that an incident was not sufficiently serious enough to report. As a result, researchers generally rely on surveys to measure sexual violence that is not reported to the police. Estimates of campus sexual assault measured on surveys vary across populations and over time, however a recent review concluded that a \\"reasonable average\\" of around 1 in 5 (20%) of women were sexually assaulted during their time in college. And although much of the research on sexual assault has focused on college campuses, there is evidence that non-students of the same age are actually at higher risk than college students. ==Selected Surveys of Campus Sexual Assault in the United States== Estimates of sexual assault, which vary based on definitions and methodology, find that roughly 6.1 sexual assaults per 1000 students occur annually, and that somewhere between 19–27% of college women and 6–8% of college men are sexually assaulted during their time in college. to 29% === 2015 Campus Climate Surveys === The 2015 Association of American Universities (AAU) Campus Survey on Sexual Assault, one of the largest studies ever of college sexual violence, drew responses from Campus Climate Surveys of 150,000 students across 27 schools, including most of the Ivy League schools. It found that more than 20% of female and 5% of male undergraduates said that they were victims of non-consensual sexual contact, defined as behaviors ranging from unwanted sexual touching or kissing to penetration, through either physical force or incapacitation, since entering college. The overall response rate was 19%. While they noted that low response rates were only an indirect indicator of the reliability of the results, they found evidence that their estimates of sexual assaults may have been biased upward because respondents were more likely to have been assaulted than non-respondents. Most respondents who reported sexual assault to the AAU said they did not report the incident to police or campus authorities because they did not consider the event “serious enough\\" to report, even when it included forced penetration. More than half of those who reported forcible penetration said that they did not report this crime because they did not think it was serious enough.  Non-AAU Campus Climate Surveys  Several universities conducted independent sexual assault studies rather than participating in the AAU surveys. Unlike typical campus surveys that rely on volunteer student responses, the University of Kentucky made their survey mandatory. Diane Follingstad, Director of the Center for Research on Violence Against Women at UK, said that volunteered data is not always representative. “A survey that goes out to a campus is relying on whomever is willing to complete it. There is always a concern that samples are skewed.” She added, \\"As best we understand, we do not know of another survey at a university that includes all their students\\" The UK survey encompassed 80% of students (24,300 respondents), roughly 5,000 students did not participate in time for the first round of data, and students had the option of opting out of questions if they felt uncomfortable answering them. According to preliminary results, 5% of students reported incidents of completed or attempted vaginal, oral, or anal sex that occurred without their consent in the last year. These results were comparable to previous surveys that used similar measures of sexual assault, such as the 2007 Campus Sexual Assault survey. A survey conducted by Rutgers University found that 12% of men and women had experienced some form of sexual assault, while at the University of Michigan, 22% of female students said they had been assaulted in the last year. === National Crime Victimization Surveys === The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) is a national survey administered twice year by the United States Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS). The purpose of the NCVS is to offer a uniform report of the incidence of crime including rape and sexual assault victimizations in the general population. A 2014 assessment by Sinozich and Langton used longitudinal data from the NCVS to measure rape and sexual assault among college aged U.S. women from 1995 to 2013. Their findings indicated that rape, a subset of all sexual assault, had an incidence of 1.4 per 1,000 female students in 2013 during the period studied. The study also found that college aged women (regardless of enrollment status) were assaulted at a significantly higher rate than non-college age women, 4.3 per 1,000 per year versus 1.4 per 1,000 per year, but that women who were not enrolled in college were 1.2 times more likely to be assaulted than college aged women who were enrolled. Rape/sexual assaults per 1,000 females reported on National Crime Victimization Survey (1995–2013). The NCVS is one of the few national level, longitudinal sources of data on rape and sexual assault, and it has a relatively high response rate (88%) compared to other studies of sexual victimization. Data is collected using telephone interviews, which permits clarifying questions, and uses a bounded time frame of six months, limiting the likelihood that results are overestimated due to \\"telescoping\\" (the reporting of events occurring outside of a reference period as though they occurred within the specified period). However, results reported by the NCVS are consistently lower than studies using other methodologies. Researchers, such as Bonnie Fisher and Mary Koss, have charged that the question wording, context, and sampling methodology used on the NCVS leads a systematic underestimate of the incidence of rape and sexual assault. A recent assessment of the NCVS methodology conducted by the National Research Council pointed to four flaws in the NCSV approach: the use of a sampling methodology that was inefficient in measuring low-incidence events like rape and sexual assault; the ambiguous wording questions related to sexual violence; the criminal justice definitions of assault; and the lack of privacy offered to survey respondents (phone interview vs. completely anonymous survey). The authors concluded that these flaws make it \\"highly likely that the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) is underestimating rape and sexual assault.\\" === Campus Sexual Assault Survey (2007) === In 2007 the National Institute of Justice funded the Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) survey, a web-based survey of 6,800 undergraduates at two large universities using multiple explicitly worded questions about sexual victimization. According to the results, 19% of women and 6.1% of men had been victims of at least one completed or attempted sexual assault since entering college. The study's authors also found that the majority of women were assaulted while incapacitated, that perpetrators were usually friends or acquaintances rather than strangers and that Freshmen and Sophomores were at a higher risk for sexual assault than Juniors and Seniors. Christopher Krebs, the lead author of the CSA, cautions that the results from these two schools in no way nationally representative, noting, in a conversation with one reporter: \\"We don’t think one in five is a nationally representative statistic.” and “In no way does that make our results nationally representative.\\". In a follow-up study in 2008, the authors of the 2007 Campus Sexual Assault Survey examined sexual violence experiences at historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). 3,951 undergraduate women from four HBCUs were given the same questionnaire used in the 2007 CSA. The study found that 14.2% of women attending these schools had experienced a completed or attempted sexual assault, and 8.3% had been victims of rape. The authors noted that incapacitated sexual assault was rarer among HBCU compared to non-HBCU students, and suggested that the differences in prevalence rates seemed \\"to be driven entirely by a difference in the rate of incapacitated sexual assault, which is likely explained by the fact that HBCU women drink alcohol much less frequently than non-HBCU women\\". === National College Women Sexual Victimization (NCWSV) survey (2000) === In 2000, the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) updated the 1997 National College Women Sexual Victimization (NCWSV) survey. In it, 4,446 American college women were chosen randomly and surveyed. The effort consisted of behaviorally specific questions that describe an incident in graphic language and cover the elements of a criminal offense, such as \\"Did someone make you have sexual intercourse by using force or threatening to harm you?\\" According to that survey, 1.7% of women had experienced a rape and another 1.1% had experienced an attempted rape in the previous 7 months. === Koss Study (1985) === In 1985, in one of the earliest studies of campus sexual assault, Mary P. Koss, a professor of psychology at Kent State University, conducted a national rape survey on college campuses in the United States, sponsored by the National Institute of Health and with administrative support from Ms. Magazine. The survey, administered on 32 college campuses across the US, asked 3,187 female and 2,872 male undergraduate students about their sexual experiences since age 14. The survey included ten questions related to sexual coercion. Out of the 3,187 undergraduate women Koss surveyed, 207, or 6%, had been raped within the past year. 15.4% of Koss' female respondents had been raped since age 14, an additional 12.1% of female respondents had experienced attempted rape since age 14, and 4.4% of college men reported perpetrating legal rape since age 14. Pdf. The combined figure for rape and attempted rape of women since age 14, 27.5%, became known as the \\"one in four\\" statistic.Hoff Sommers, Christina (1994), \\"Rape research\\", in == Non-US studies == Studies that have examined sexual assault experiences among college students in western countries other than the U.S. have found results similar to those found by American researchers. A 1993 study of a nationally representative sample of Canadian College students found that 28% of women had experienced some form of sexual assault in the preceding year, and 45% of women had experienced some form of sexual assault since entering college. A 1991 study of 347 undergraduates in New Zealand found that 25.3% had experienced rape or attempted rape, and 51.6% had experienced some form of sexual victimization. A 2014 study of students in Great Britain found that 25% of women had experienced some type of sexual assault while attending university and 7% of women had experienced rape or attempted rape as college students. === Report on Sexual Assault and Harassment at Australian Universities (2017) === The 2017 Change The Course study conducted nationally by the Australian Human Rights Commission reported that 21% of students had been sexually harassed during 2015-16 and 1.6% of students had been sexually assaulted during 2016. The most common form of sexual harassment was looking/staring at someone, followed by \\"inappropriate comments\\". Sexual assaults at social events and residential colleges were reported as a particular area of concern. The study was prompted by activism by women's groups on campuses due to claims that universities were not effectively responding to incidents of sexual assault. The Education Minister Simon Birmingham and the Sex Discrimination Commissioner Kate Jenkins threatened repercussions for the university industry, including the 39 universities who took part in the study, if they failed to act to reform campus culture contributing to the issue. The study also found that 87% of students who were deemed sexually assaulted, and 94% of students sexually harassed, did not make a formal complaint or report to their university. ===Selected studies of campus sexual assault=== { class=\\" collapsible uncollapsed\\" + Major surveys of Campus Sexual Assault in the U.S. ! !

It later served in British Army of the Rhine. ==Precursor units== Following the Cardwell Reforms a mobilisation scheme began to appear in the Army List from December 1875. This assigned all Regular Army and Militia units serving in the UK to a theoretical order of battle of eight army corps. The only all-Regular corps, I Corps based at Colchester, had the following units of the Royal Engineers (RE) assigned as Corps Engineers:Army List, various dates.Spiers, pp. 59–60, Appendix 3.Kochanski, pp. 82–3. * A Troop at Aldershot (Pontoons) * Half of C Troop at Aldershot (Telegraphs)Lord & Watson, p 214. * 12th Company and field park at Chatham, Kent During 1876 12th Co was replaced by 31st Co. The 1875 plan was over-ambitious: there were not enough engineers for eight corps and no staff; although there was a post for a Colonel Commanding Royal Engineers with I Corps, the position remained vacant. The Childers Reforms of 1881 only provided for an overseas expeditionary force of one complete army corps, and the revised mobilisation plan of 1886 (codified in the subsequent Stanhope Memorandum of 1891) allowed for an expeditionary force of two army corps, each with a 'field battalion' of RE sappers. In 1887 1st Field Battalion supporting I Corps comprised 7th, 11th, 17th and 23rd Field Companies. The field battalions were shortlived: in 1898 the RE component of each corps was supposed to comprise a pontoon troop, a telegraph division, a balloon section, a field company, a field park and a railway company. The corps remained paper arrangements only, without assigned staff, and when the Second Boer War broke out in 1899 the formations and units assigned to I Corps (now based at Aldershot) proceeded overseas separately, and never concentrated in South Africa.Kochanski, pp. 182–3, 193, 239–48.Dunlop, Chapters 1 & 5, Appendices A & B.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 1–2. After the Boer War the Haldane Reforms of 1908 established an expeditionary force of six divisions with a detailed mobilisation scheme, so that every unit had a defined position in the order of battle and mobilisation was regularly practised. The divisions became permanent formations, but only I Corps among higher formations had the nucleus of a staff, which was provided from Aldershot Command.Dunlop. Chapter 13.Edmonds, pp. 6–7. ==World War I== When mobilisation began on 5 August 1914, the Chief Engineer (CE) of Aldershot Command, Temporary Brigadier-General S.R. Rice, was immediately appointed CE of I Corps and went with it to France. At this date the RE was responsible for the Army's Signal Service, and Major M.G.E. Bowman-Manifold also went as Assistant-Director of Signals for I Corps.Becke, pp. 131–6. As the British Expeditionary Force assembled in France, the following RE troops from Aldershot Command were assigned to I Corps:Edmonds, Appendix 10. * 'A' Signal Company (1st Corps Signal Company)Lord & Watson, p. 219. ** K, L, G and D Sections * No 2 Section, Line of Communications Printing Section * No 1 Bridging TrainWatson & Rinaldi, p. 6. I Corps served on the Western Front throughout the war. RE units were assigned to the corps as required for operations, but by 1916 each corps had two 'army troops' companies, one tunnelling company and one special works company. In September 1918 CE I Corps had the following units under command:Watson & Rinaldi, p. 22. * 133rd Army Troops Company * 135th Army Troops Company * 290th Army Troops Company * 560th (Hampshire) Army Troops Company * 170th Tunnelling Company * 3rd Australian Tunnelling Company At the Armistice on 11 November 1918 I Corps signals were organised as follows:Lord & Watson, p. 234. * 'A' Corps Signal Company ** No 5 (Motor) Airline Section ** No 85 (Motor) Airline Section ** K Cable Section ** AN Cable Section I Corps HQ and its CE staff were disbanded shortly after the Armistice, though 'A' Corps Signals continued in the new Royal Corps of Signals after 1922.Lord & Watson, p. 239. ==World War II== ===Mobilisation=== When I Corps Headquarters mobilised on the outbreak of war in September 1939 it was assigned the following units as I Corps Troops Royal Engineers (I CTRE) under Lieutenant-Colonel G.R.

I CTRE spent the early weeks on tasks around Corps HQ in the Douai area. Then the engineers spent the Phoney War period working on defensive positions. I CTRE attached 221st Fd Co to 1st Division as an additional field company. Its role on the outbreak of hostilities, in conjunction with 1st Division's bridging section, was to open the road from Tournai to Brussels and maintain an important canal crossing.Edwards, pp. 154–5.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol VIII, pp. 10–13. When the German offensive in the west opened on 10 May 1940, the BEF advanced into Belgium in accordance with 'Plan D'. 221st Field Co found itself in the lead, advancing ahead of the scouting armoured cars.Edwards, p. 155.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol VIII, pp. 25–7.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter III. However, the German Army broke through the Ardennes to the east, forcing the BEF to withdraw again, and by 19 May the whole force was back across the Escaut and then went back to the so-called 'Canal Line'.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter IV.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter VIII. The engineers carried out as many bridge demolitions as possible to delay the German advance. 221st Field Co was tasked with destroying bridges along a 10 km stretch of the Brussels–Charleroi Canal to delay the German advance, then to prepare a 'stop line' on the La Bassée Canal.Edwards, p. 156.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol VIII, pp. 28–9. By 26 May the BEF was cut off and the decision was made to evacuate it through Dunkirk (Operation Dynamo).Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter XI.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol VIII, pp. 34–5. I Corps acted as rearguard, the sappers blowing bridges and cratering roads to form a defensive perimeter. Because it was unable to fulfil its usual role of supplying maps, 13th Field Survey Company was sent with the Corps armoured car regiment, 12th Lancers, on 27 May to defend Furnes, where the Belgian commander insisted that he required no help. However, on 29 May the Belgian Army capitulated, leaving a wide gap in the perimeter along the Yser. This gap was filled by the 12th Lancers, a few French troops, and by 13th Field Survey Company and 101st Field Company of I CTRE. They succeeded in blowing all the Yser bridges except at Nieuwpoort, where the Germans already had a bridgehead despite the efforts of the Lancers and Survey Company. However, the enemy were prevented from exploiting this bridgehead.Pakenham- Walsh, Vol VIII, pp. 38–9. The BEF fought to maintain the shrinking perimeter round Dunkirk while the evacuation went on each unit in turndestroying its vehicles and stores before boarding a variety of vessels. One party of 221st Fd Co was on the Queen of the Channel, which was bombed and sunk on 28 May: the passengers and crew were picked up and taken to England aboard the Dorrien Rose. Another party from the company arrived in England the following day on HMS Greyhound. The last troops of the BEF who could be rescued left on 4 June.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter XIV.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter XV.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol VIII, pp. 40–2. ===Home Defence=== After the evacuation, I Corps was reassembled in Northern Command, becoming responsible for both field forces and coast defence artillery on the Yorkshire and Lincolnshire coast. I CTRE was reformed, but 13 Field Survey Co transferred to Northern Command HQ and 221 Field Co returned to the London Division, being replaced by 213 (North Midland) Army Fd Co from 46th (North Staffordshire) CTRE. 277 Corps Field Park Co was also assigned for a while from December 1941. In July 1943 II Corps was disbanded and II CTRE merged with I CTRE. 102 and 107 Field Cos were sent to the Mediterranean Theatre and were replaced by 234 and 240 Fd Cos from II CTRE, while 19 Fd Co joined, having been converted from a field squadron. For the rest of the war I CTRE was organised as follows: * 19 Field Co – from 79th Armoured Division * 234 (Northumbrian) Field Co – from II CTREWatson & Rinaldi, pp. 134–5. * 240 (Lowland) Field Co – from II CTRE * 105 (West Lancashire) Field Park Co From now on, I Corps formed part of Second Army in 21st Army Group, training for the planned Allied invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord) in 1944.Order of Battle of the Forces in the United Kingdom, Part 2: 21 Army Group, 24 July 1943, with amendments, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 212/238. Indeed, I Corps' staff had been studying the engineering problems of an opposed landing since December 1941.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, p. 321. ===Normandy=== I Corps was an assault formation for D Day, attacking with 3rd Division at Sword Beach and 3rd Canadian Division at Juno Beach. While I CTRE under its CRE, Lt-Col R.W.F. Poole, was kept under the direct command of I Corps HQ, a platoon of 19th Field Co was attached to 3rd Canadian Division to assist with beach obstacle clearance once the landings had been made.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, pp. 335–7, 348.Ellis, Normandy, pp. 170–87. Transport crossing 'London Bridge' into the Orne bridgehead during Operation Goodwood. Having failed to seize Caen on D Day, I Corps was engaged in heavy fighting in the area for several weeks. I CTRE's most important role was to increase the bridge capacity across the River Orne and the Caen Canal into the bridgehead captured on D Day by 6th Airborne Division. By the beginning of July three pairs of bridges were in place: * A Class 40 Bailey Pontoon bridge ('York I') built over the locks at Ouistreham by 234 Fd Co and 7 Fd Co (of 6th Army Troops RE), and its continuation ('York II') over the Orne by the same companies * The bridges captured by the airborne forces on D Day, Pegasus and Ranville * Two Class 40 bridges to duplicate Pegasus and Ranville ('London I' and 'London II'), built on 10–11 June by 71 Fd Co and 263 Fd Co (of XII CTRE) Now these were to be supplemented by further work, for which task Poole also had at his disposal five field companies from 18th GHQ Troops, RE (74, 84, 91, 173 and 213) and two from 8th GHQ TRE (89 and 90): * Replacement bridges at Ouistreham Locks ('Tower I' by 19 Fd Co) and its continuation over the Orne ('Tower II' by 234 and 240 Fd Cos) * Strengthening Pegasus and Ranville to take Class 40 loads * A pair of Class 40 Bailey bridges ('Tay I' and 'Tay II') at Blainville-sur- Orne, upstream from Pegasus and Ranville, by 89 and 90 Fd Cos. This additional work had to be carried out in secret, so that five Class 40 routes would be available for VIII Corps' tanks to move into the Airborne bridgehead to launch Operation Goodwood on 18 July. Stores were brought up in advance and concealed, and the actual construction was carried out during the night of 17/18 July. The associated work involved a great deal of improvement to roads and tracks, and lifting of minefields that blocked the routes of advance, and the RE of the attacking divisions had to help out. Although 'Goodwood' failed to achieve a breakthrough, the engineering operations provided a firm base from which I Corps advanced eastwards once the breakout from Normandy was finally achieved in late August.Pakenham–Walsh, pp. 365-7.Ellis, Normandy, p. 335. By this time, First Canadian Army had been activated, and I Corps came under its command. ===Clearing the ports=== Tanks, infantry and sappers advance during Operation Astonia First Canadian Army's next task was to liberate the Channel ports and make them available to supply 21st Army Group. The first of these were captured by I Corps: St Valery-en-Caux on 4 September and Le Havre, in Operation Astonia, 10–12 September. The initial attack at Le Havre was launched by 56th Brigade of 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division, supported by 240 Fd Co of I CTRE and led by the AVREs of 42 Assault Regiment, RE. 'Astonia' was very much a sapper's operation: the port was heavily fortified, but despite setbacks the set-piece operation went well, the defences were overrun and the town captured in 48 hours.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, pp. 385–8.Ellis, Germany, pp. 6–7, 13–5. First Canadian Army then moved on to Antwerp: the city had quickly fallen to 21st Army Group's advanced elements, but there was a prolonged campaign to clear the approaches to the port, after which I Corps held the line of the River Maas for the winter.Ellis, Germany, pp. 69–70, 109–10, 125–7, 238. ===Germany=== In March 1945 21st Army Group stormed across the Rhine and advanced rapidly across Germany. I Corps' role was limited to liberating the Netherlands and securing the lines of communication for 21st Army Group. The German surrender at Lüneburg Heath on 4 May did not end the work for the sappers: for many months they were engaged in repair and restoration of essential services behind the armies and in the occupied zone of Germany. The CE of I Corps had a month to devise a method of clearing 130 wrecked bridges from the Weser to open it to river traffic.Ellis, Germany, pp. 337–42.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, pp. 519–21, 550–1. On 21 May 1945, I Corps was redesignated I Corps district, responsible for Rhine Province and Westphalia as part of British Army of the Rhine (BAOR). In 1946 BAOR built a major () semi-permanent bridge over the River Elbe at Artlenburg, partly as a training exercise. 105 Field Park Company took part, attached to 5th Division, and was responsible for collecting stores before site preparation began on 1 August 1946. The 30-span bridge (Bailey sections on timber trestles) was completed between 12 August and 16 September.Pakenham- Walsh, Vol IX, pp. 549–50. I Corps was disbanded in 1947; its RE companies all appear to have been disbanded in 1945–6. ==Postwar== I (British) Corps was reactivated in BAOR in 1951, and its Corps CRE's HQ reformed as I CCRE at Bielefeld in 1958. In 1969 it replaced 11 Engineer Brigade as the command element for most GHQ RE units in BAOR until 1976 when 11 Engineer Bde was reformed. I (BR) Corps was disbanded in 1992.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 218. ==Commanders== Commanders of I Corps RE included: Chief Engineer (CE), I Corps: * Brig-Gen S.R. Rice, 5 August 1914 * Brig-Gen C. Godby, 11 April 1915 * Brig-Gen R.P. Lee, 14 September 1915 * Brig-Gen E.H.deV. Atkinson 18 May 1918 * Brig-Gen H.W. Gordon, 31 October 1917 Commanding Royal Engineer (CRE), I CTRE: * Lt-Col G.R. Pim, September 1939 * Lt-Col R.W.F. Poole, June 1944 ==Insignia== During World War II, I CTRE wore the normal formation badge of I Corps, consisting of a white spearhead on a red diamond, but with two dark blue diagonal stripes added. ==Footnotes== ==Notes== ==References== * Maj A.F.

The style is similar to that of Michele Sanmicheli. Subsequently, the palazzo passed through numerous families. For some time it was used as a barracks. After a few decades of neglect in the 20th century, the building has been restored. ==Architecture== The facade, facing the Rio Marin, is of four levels with a mezzanine and two noble floors. The first noble floor is decorated with an elegant serliana with white-stone inserts and a balustrade. Both noble floors are underlined by stringcourse cornices, standing out of the pink plaster wall. There is a gable in the central part of the top floor, terminating with a tympanum. Two small chimneys replace those that originally were two high pinnacles. The interior has valuable paintings and decorative works. The palazzo has a garden, which was mentioned in the works of poet Gabriele D'Annunzio and writer Henry James—the palazzo, in fact, seems to be the one in which the stories of Il fuoco (1900) and The Aspern Papers (1888) are respectively set. ==Gallery== Venezia - Palazzo Soranzo (Santa Croce) - Foto di Paolo Steffan.jpgSide view on the facade Rio Marin Venezia.jpgFondamenta Rio Marin ==See also== *Palazzo Soranzo Pisani ==References== Category:Houses completed in the 16th century Soranzo Cappello Category:Baroque architecture in Venice ","title":"Palazzo Soranzo Cappello"},{"id":"61529470","text":"Grupo Desportivo Fabril is a futsal team based in the city of Barreiro, Portugal, that played in the Portuguese Futsal First Division.

Vincent is also known for his work in developing the 2013 School Food Plan, for which he was appointed an MBE; for chairing the Council for Sustainable Business; and for co-authoring seven LEON cookbooks. ==Early life== Vincent was born in Enfield, London and grew up in north London. He attended Chaseside Primary School and Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School, an independent school in north London. Later, he went on to read History at St John’s College, Cambridge, where he obtained a first class degree. While at university, Vincent had his own entertainment production company, setting up and hosting dance and music events. ==Career== In 1993, following his graduation, Vincent went on to work at Procter & Gamble (P&G;) in sales & marketing. In 1997, after four years at P&G;, he moved to management consultancy firm Bain & Co. where he remained for the next seven years. From 2004 until 2007, Vincent was part of a team of three that worked on the whisky and spirits business Whyte & Mackay during its rebranding and business transition under the ownership of Vivian Imerman. ==Leon Restaurants== It was while working at Bain & Co. that the idea for LEON was first developed: > I sat down with a colleague of mine at the time, Henry Dimbleby, and we > decided to write down five business ideas each. Good fast food was common on > both lists. Henry had a vision of doing it in bowls. I had a vision of doing > it more like McDonald’s. Eventually we decided to go down the McDonald’s > route. The idea was simple: \\"If God did fast food.\\" – John Vincent. In 2004, joined by chef Allegra McEvedy as third co-founder, the first LEON restaurant was opened, at Carnaby Street, central London. A year after opening, LEON was named \\"Best New Restaurant in the UK\\" by The Observer. In 2013 it became a founding member of the Sustainable Restaurant Association (SRA), and in 2018 was awarded the Association's top ranking of three stars; in 2017 it won Raymond Blanc's Sustainability Hero award at the Association's \\"Food Made Good\\" awards. Leon Restaurants was also named in the 2017 Sunday Times Fast Track 100. In 2014 Vincent took over day-to-day running of LEON, moving into the role of Chief Executive Officer. Dimbleby left Leon Restaurants' board in 2017. LEON has since expanded internationally and launched its own cookware and tableware ranges. ==The School Food Plan== In 2013 Vincent and Dimbleby were asked to lead an independent review, commissioned by the UK Government of the school food programme. As part of that work they went on to produce an actionable plan called \\"The School Food Plan\\". The plan formed the basis of revised rules on school dinners for pupils throughout the UK. The plan has overseen, among other changes, the introduction of cookery lessons for all children up to the age of 14, universal free school meals for infants, and new standards for the food served to children in schools. The School Food Plan has improved the diet of five million students and served daily across 22,000 schools. Vincent and Dimbleby were both awarded MBEs in 2015 for services to school food. In 2017, Vincent received the Sustainable Restaurant Association's Raymond Blanc Sustainability Hero award along with Dimbleby for their work on the plan. ==Council for Sustainable Business== In 2018 Vincent was invited to help create and then chair the Council for Sustainable Business. The council was established to \\"inspire British business to protect and improve the environment\\", and to advise on how businesses can help achieve the aims of the 25 Year Environment Plan. ==Books and newspaper column== Vincent wrote a column for Metro in 2014 and 2015, and has co-authored and published seven LEON cookbooks; they include: * Book 2, Naturally Fast Food * Book 4, Family & Friends * Book 6, Fast & Free * Book 7, Fast Vegan * Happy Salads * Happy Soups * Happy One-Pot Cooking In November 2019 Vincent is co-authoring a book, Winning Not Fighting, with Wing Tsun martial arts master Julian Hitch. ==Personal life== Vincent married broadcaster Katie Derham in 1999; he proposed on the night they met. https://www.thetimes.co.uk/magazine/the-sunday-times-magazine/how-leon- founder-john-vincent-learnt-to-live-more-sustainably-cqrffnrm0 They have two daughters and live near Haywards Heath, Sussex. == References == Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:English food writers Category:People from the London Borough of Enfield Category:21st-century English businesspeople Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire Category:People educated at Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School Category:Procter & Gamble people Category:Sustainability advocates Category:English restaurateurs ","title":"John Vincent (restaurateur)"},{"id":"61529480","text":"The list of shipwrecks in March 1857 includes ships sunk, wrecked or otherwise lost during March 1857. ==1 March== ==2 March== ==3 March== ==4 March== ==5 March== ==6 March== ==7 March== ==8 March== ==9 March== ==10 March== ==11 March== ==12 March== ==13 March== ==14 March== ==15 March== ==16 March== ==17 March== ==18 March== ==19 March== ==20 March== ==21 March== ==22 March== ==23 March== ==24 March== ==25 March== ==26 March== ==27 March== ==28 March== ==29 March== ==30 March== ==31 March== ==Unknown date== ==References== 1857-03 ","title":"List of shipwrecks in March 1857"},{"id":"61529481","text":"Sonia Fraguas (born 20 November 1977) is a Spanish gymnast.

The two live in a house where they employ Cristina as a housekeeper. Cristina is Jorge's half sister, who was born as a result of the rape of her mother by a crazy domestic worker. Cristina is hostile to Elisa, but when she becomes pregnant, Cristina changes her behavior and shows helpfulness until the son, who also gets the name Jorge, is born. After the birth of the child, Cristina convinces her brother that Elisa had been unfaithful to him. Jorge leaves his wife and takes his son, Elisa returns to live at her uncle's house in the city and Cristina raises the baby as if he were her son in Europe. Eighteen years later, the elder Jorge decides to look for Elisa, and together they find out about Cristina's deception. When Jorge confronts his sister to know the motive of her evil, she confesses that for all those years she lived in love with her brother, and that she was so jealous that she had poisoned all of her brother's previous lovers. Cristina, in her anguish, poisons herself, and before she dies she asks the son she raised not to forget her, and tells him that that Jorge and Elisa will make him believe that she is not her mother. Elisa and Jorge, without knowing about Cristina's last deception, decide to reveal the truth to their son, who immediately despises his true mother and asks her to leave the house. Before leaving, Elisa asks her son to accept a medal with the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe that she had given him in his childhood; her son takes it to throw it into the fireplace, but when he sees the medal, a memory from his childhood of his true mother comes to him, and runs into the arms of his mother. A huge oil painting of the portrait of Cristina that hung over the fireplace falls into the fire, and Elisa and Jorge hug each other with their son as they see how the portrait of the woman who separated them for years is slowly consumed in the fire. ==Cast== *Emilio Tuero as Jorge Llorente *Marina Tamayo as Elisa *Isabela Corona as Cristina *Joaquín Pardavé as Don Luciano *Manolo Fábregas as Jorge - adult (as Manolo Sánchez Navarro) *Dolores Camarillo as Nana *Roberto Meyer as Santiago *Paz Villegas as Servanda *Conchita Gentil Arcos as Doña Meche *Rafael Icardo as Doctor Bustamante *Tony Díaz as Miguel Conde (as Antonio Díaz) *Max Langler as Jerónimo *Carlos L.

He credits his father, Nobert Eden Mukasa, for his interest in critical thinking and his grandfather for his skepticism of religion. By age 12, he was reading through several of the foundational books of humanism, such as the works of David Hume. He was nevertheless interested in religion at a young age; he was beaten at the age of 8 when it was found that he has taken communion without going through the preparatory rites. He attended Catholic high school, but was eventually expelled for refusing to attend mass. ==Humanist Association for Leadership, Equity and Accountability== Mukasa is heavily involved in Uganda's humanist and secular groups. He co-founded the Humanist Association for Leadership, Equity and Accountability (HALEA) in 2007 to promote critical thinking and human rights. Its monthly campus discussions are attended by people of faith and non-believers. It also sponsors students and assists young mothers in acquiring entrepreneurship skills, among other programs. He currently works for the organization, handling legal issues and building a program to train humanist celebrants. As of 2018, Mukasa was Chair of the Uganda Humanist Association. He is a former member of the board of directors of the International Humanist and Ethical Union. In a country where only 0.2 percent of the population identifies as non-religious, his public profile as a humanist and atheist made him a target for religious violence, including an attempted break-in and the burning of his automobile. The police have also been investigating burglaries and harassment against HALEA staff. ==See also== * Irreligion in Uganda ==References== Category:20th-century atheists Category:21st-century atheists Category:Atheism activists Category:Living people Category:Ugandan atheists Category:Ugandan human rights activists Category:Ugandan activists Category:Skeptics Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Kato Mukasa"},{"id":"61529535","text":"Onychostoma rarum is a species of cyprinid in the genus Onychostoma.

She is known for her absurd work, such as her one-woman shows I Lost My Virginity August 15, 2010 and Boss, Whom is Girl. She has also written comedic articles, and written and starred in video content, for media sites such as Adult Swim, Comedy Central, Paste, and Super Deluxe. Along with fellow comedian Caitlin Durante, she co-hosts The Bechdel Cast, a weekly podcast about the representation of women in film. ==Career== Loftus's first job out of college was at The Boston Globe. She was fired from the role when she tweeted after a standup set, “crushing so hard at an open mic that I cum bloods.” A local radio show referenced this as “the end of journalism.” Her often absurdist humor, sometimes bordering on performance art and documented for websites such as Paste, has included pretending to date an American Girl doll, joining Mensa as a joke, selling \\"Shrek nudes\\" with her body painted green to raise money for Planned Parenthood, and attempting to eat a copy of David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest. She has written and performed several one-woman live shows. One is called I Lost My Virginity August 15, 2010. Another show, Boss, Whom is Girl, was workshopped at the Lyric Hyperion Theatre in Los Angeles. It was then brought to the United Kingdom with shows in London and at the 2019 Edinburgh Fringe. Its run at the Fringe was recommended by newspapers such as The Guardian, The Sunday Times, and The Daily Express. In April 2018, a three- part web series she wrote and starred in, Irrational Fears was released on Comedy Central Digital. In summer 2018, she was hired as a writer for the long-running Adult Swim show Robot Chicken. On January 1, 2020 Loftus released a four-part podcast entitled \\"My Year in Mensa\\" that chronicles the events surrounding her applying to join Mensa for the purpose of writing a series of humorous articles for Paste Magazine. ==Credits== ===Live credits=== * Death Wish – Writer/Performer/Director (2014) * Basketball City – Writer (2015) * Bad Art – Writer/Performer (2015) * I Lost My Virginity August 15, 2010 – Writer/Performer (2017) * The Hacker Who Codes – Writer/Performer (2018) * Boss, Whom is Girl – Writer/Performer (2019) * Jamie Loftus, Jamie Loftus – Writer/Performer (2020) ===Film/Television credits=== * Boston PD: Zamboni Crimes Division – Writer/Animator/Voice Actor (2016) * Rat Teens – Writer/Animator/Voice Actor (2017) * Funny or Die Presents – Actor (2017) * Super Deluxe – Writer/Actor (2017–18) * Irrational Fears – Writer/Actor (2018) * Robot Chicken – Writer/Actor (2018) * All About Nina – Comedy Consultant/Voice (2018) * Human Kind Of – Writer/Voice Actor (2018) * The New Negroes – Actor (2019) ==References== ==External links== * The Bechdel Cast website Category:Comedians from California Category:Comedians from Massachusetts Category:American women television writers Category:American women comedians Category:American television writers Category:Living people Category:1993 births ","title":"Jamie Loftus"},{"id":"61529600","text":"Bencsik is a surname.

She served as executive director of the National Indian Brotherhood (NIB), chief administrator of the World Council of Indigenous Peoples (WCIP), and secretary of the Indian Association of Alberta. Marule was president of Red Crow Community College for two decades, and led the creation of several indigenous studies programs. She was previously an assistant professor of Native American studies at the University of Lethbridge. == Early life and education == Marie Smallface was born in 1944 to Emil and Olive Smallface. She had numerous siblings and was raised on the Blood Indian Reservation. Her mother was a cook's helper at a hospital while her maternal aunt was a cook. She was a member of the Fish Eater clan in the Kainai Nation ( Blood tribe) of the Blackfoot Confederacy. Her maternal grandmother, Rosie (née Smith) Davis (Blackfeet, 1873–1983), was born at Fort Benton, Montana, and migrated to Alberta in 1877. She worked for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the court at Fort Macleod as a translator and was a well-known quilter. Smallface and six other students attended school in Cardston at the suggestion of an Anglican Indian priest. Her older brother Allan Smallface served in the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry in Germany. Smallface began attending the University of Alberta (U of A) in 1962. While there, she became active with several First Nations groups including the National Indian Council (a predecessor of the National Indian Brotherhood, NIB), the Canadian Indian Youth Council, the Native Friendship Centre in Edmonton and the Indian Association of Alberta. She represented Alberta in the 1964 Indian Princess pageant competition. Smallface also joined the U of A Club International, where she learned of the politics of decolonization from African graduate students. In 1966, Smallface was one of the first indigenous women to earn a BA in sociology and anthropology at U of A. == Career == === Advocacy === At the suggestion of the U of A's Dean of Women, Mary Saretta Sparling, Smallface became one of the first indigenous women to travel to Africa with the Canadian University Service Overseas (CUSO, now known as Cuso International) from 1966 to 1970. She started at a girls' camp in Northern Province, Zambia, near Lake Tanganyika, before relocating to Lusaka, where she helped to assess a UNESCO- sponsored literacy program. She later worked in community development. Smallface met her South African husband, Jacob Marule, while living in Zambia. He was a refugee of apartheid and an exiled member of the African National Congress and the Non-Aligned Movement prominent in Lusaka when Marule met him. Marule traveled to Tanzania and was influenced by Julius Nyerere's philosophy on African socialism, noting how he worked from communities upward in decolonization politics, respecting local cultures and ways of life. Marule later influenced George Manuel, the first president of the World Council of Indigenous Peoples (WCIP), with this concept of using indigenous philosophy to shape politics. A moped accident left her in a hospital in Lusaka for six to eight weeks. In the fall of 1970, Marule and her husband Jacob moved to Ottawa. There they hosted social and political gatherings, which included politicians as well as Manuel and diplomats from a number of African countries. Jacob Marule worked at an agricultural centre in Kentville, Nova Scotia. Subsequently, they had two daughters and a grand-niece who they raised as their own child. After being recommended by her U of A colleague, Harold Cardinal, Marule was hired by Manuel as an executive assistant at the NIB in Ottawa. She brought an academic perception to the organization which Manuel had lacked. In March 1972, Marule attended the Native Women's Conference to discuss the Indian Act and challenged its contents on the legal status of Indian women married to non-status individuals. As a result of the act, Indian women become non-status Indians upon marrying out of their tribe. In 1972, Marule and her husband provided contacts to Marule in Stockholm, facilitating meetings with the Tanzanian ambassador to Sweden, Michael Lukumbuzya, and Chinese embassy officials. Jacob Marule and Manuel spoke with these officials about Third and Fourth World liberation and the possibility of the NIB visiting the People's Republic of China. George Manuel said later that Marule had been \\"the backbone of the NIB\\" and had shown him the commonalities between the First Nations and other aboriginal peoples and the developing world. Marule helped to plan the first WCIP conference, held in October 1975, and used her contacts in the Third World to gain an agreement for Guyana to host a 1974 preparatory meeting in Georgetown. Attendees included representatives and delegates from Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Greenland, Colombia, and Norway. Marule served as the chief administrator of the WCIP. She was the secretary-treasurer of the NIB for several years and later as executive director with Manuel as president. Marule served as chair of the Blood Tribe Police Commission, the Blood Tribe Elections Appeal Board, and the Indian News Media, and as secretary of the Indian Association of Alberta. === Academia === Marule taught community development and literacy at Nicola Valley Institute of Technology. She joined the faculty at the University of Lethbridge (U of L) in February 1976 as an associated professional officer in the Native Students' Association. Later in 1976, she worked as an academic assistant. In 1983, Marule became an assistant professor of Native American studies in the area of politics and economic development. She left U of L in June 1989 to join Red Crow Community College (RCC). On January 6, 1992, Marule became president of RCC. At RCC, she developed curriculum focused on the needs of indigenous students. She led the creation of the Kainai Studies Program and the Niitsitapi Teacher Education program, to communicate and promote Kainai traditions and knowledge through institutions under their own leadership. Marule aimed to increase the importance of education to her local indigenous community. In other initiatives, Marule connected First Nations knowledge and culture to academic programs in nursing, agriculture, and science. In June 2006, RCC graduated jointly with the U of L its first group of First Nations teachers trained in the Blackfoot Education curriculum. Marule retired as president of RCC in 2014. She was succeeded by Roy Weasel Fat. == Death and legacy == Marule died on December 31, 2014. A memorial service was held on January 10, 2015, at Senator Gladstone Hall on the Blood Tribe Reservation. She had helped to preserve indigenous cultures and language through education, promoting higher learning locally, nationally and internationally. Marule developed inclusive curricula so that education respected cultural heritage and indigenous identity. In 2019, RCC graduated the first class of its Indigenous Bachelor of Social Work program, which was the result of a task force Marule created to assess the community's need for professionals. == Awards and honours == For her advocacy work in education and the human rights of aboriginal peoples around the world, Marule received the 1995 National Aboriginal Achievement Award for education. In 2002, she was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal for outstanding community and education service. Marule received the Alberta Centennial Medal in 2005 for her work in community and education development. Athabasca University presented her with a doctor of letters in 2006. She received a doctor of law from University of Calgary in June 2010. In 2014, Marule received the Esqoao Dorothy McDonald Leadership Award and the Circle of Honour from the Institute for the Advancement of Aboriginal Women. == See also == * List of women presidents or chancellors of co-ed colleges and universities == Notes == == References == Category:1944 births Category:2014 deaths Category:20th-century Canadian educators Category:21st-century Canadian educators Category:Blackfoot people Category:Canadian people of Native American descent Category:Canadian university and college chief executives Category:First Nations academics Category:First Nations activists Category:Indigenous leaders in Alberta Category:University of Alberta alumni Category:University of Lethbridge faculty Category:Women heads of universities and colleges Category:Canadian indigenous women academics Category:20th-century women educators Category:21st-century women educators ","title":"Marie Smallface Marule"},{"id":"61529834","text":"Theoharis is a surname.

It was released in 1988. ==Background== The album presents a version of the score of the musical not previously recorded, including the numbers \\"I have confidence in me\\" and \\"Something good\\" that Rodgers composed for Robert Wise's 1965 The Sound of Music film, as well as the number \\"An ordinary couple\\" that Wise discarded. The \\"Nature music\\" that opens the album is a première recording. ==Recording== The album was digitally recorded on 13-14 December 1987 in Cincinnati Music Hall.Rodgers, Richard: The Sound of Music, conducted by Erich Kunzel, Telarc CD, CD-80162, 1988 ==Cover art== The LP, cassette and CD issues of the album all use the same cover, designed by Liggett-Stashower under the art direction of Ray Kirschensteiner. The photograph of Alpine scenery on the front of the album was taken by Ric Ergenbright. The photograph of von Stade and the album's child performers on the back of the cover was taken by David Katzell. ==Critical reception== Richard Rodgers åleft) and Oscar Hammerstein II in 1945, fourteen years before The Sound of Music was first staged Adrian Edwards reviewed the album on CD in Gramophone in December 1988. The last musical that Rodgers and Hammerstein had created together was greatly beloved, he wrote, but it had never before been made available on disc in a version as all-encompassing as Erich Kunzel's. As well as presenting the musical's theatrical score in its entirety, Kunzel's album included the additional numbers that Rodgers had composed for Robert Wise's much garlanded 1965 movie. (Rodgers wrote his new numbers' lyrics as well as their music, Hammerstein having died in 1960.) The first of these, \\"I have confidence in me\\", was sung by Julie Andrews in the sequence following Maria's journey from her nunnery to her new home in the von Trapp family's villa. The second, \\"Something good\\", was a duet for Andrews to sing with Christopher Plummer's Baron instead of a number that Wise had rejected, \\"An ordinary couple\\". Edwards had previously thought the latter rather \\"commonplace\\", and he had been surprised to find that it was one of the tracks on Kunzel's disc that he most enjoyed. It had been improved by the addition of \\"a charming little verse never before recorded\\", and further enhanced by \\"the mellow duetting of [Frederica] von Stade and Håkan Hagegård\\", \\"with the strings of the Cincinnati Pops providing a lovely velvet-like sheen as a backdrop\\". Hagegård was good, too, in a \\"prettily\\" sung \\"Edelweiss\\". Håkan Hagegård in 2005 (courtesy of the Polar Music Prize) As the Mother Abbess, Eileen Farrell was strong and assured in \\"Climb ev'ry mountain\\", \\"that solo that's an open invitation to sing flat\\", making it seem all the stranger that she had been denied her rightful place duetting with Maria in \\"My favorite things\\". The children cast as the young von Trapps sang cheerfully, and Telarc's engineering was of audiophile grade - the entry of the church organ in \\"Processional\\" was \\"designed to raise the roof\\". The album's only weakness lay in the contribution made to it by its leading lady. Von Stade was fine in some of her music, \\"but when high spirits and some enthusiasm are required, this Maria sounds just world-weary.\\"Edwards, Adrian: Gramophone, December 1988, p. 1066 Roy Hemming reviewed the album on CD in Stereo Review in January 1989. It demonstrated, he wrote, that it was possible to \\"breathe fresh life into the score of a major Broadway musical\\" by entrusting it to a judiciously chosen crossover cast, a US symphony orchestra and a top-class conductor. Erich Kunzel had presented collectors with the most complete edition of The Sound of Music that had ever appeared on the shelves of a record shop. HIs CD included every note of Richard Rodgers's stage score, even including some interludes that had been omitted from the original cast recording, as well as the extra music that Rodgers had composed for Julie Andrews's movie. The singer in Andrews's shoes was Frederica von Stade, \\"a wonderfully warm and vocally glowing Maria\\" who seemed entirely at home in her sabbatical from opera (except when she was called upon to yodel in \\"The lonely goatherd\\"). The veteran Eileen Farrell was \\"genuinely thrilling\\" in \\"Climb ev'ry mountain\\", sounding in better voice than she had done for many years. Håkan Hagegård and Barbara Daniels were both excellent too. Erich Kunzel conducted \\"with the right mixture of bounce, bite and romantic sentimentality.\\" Telarc's engineers had created a variety of acoustics appropriate to the musical's different environments. The organ in the wedding scene and the finale would \\"blow your socks off\\". All in all, the disc was an impressive recording of a radiant performance.Hemming, Roy: Stereo Review, January 1989, pp. 113-116 The album was also discussed in FanfareFanfare, Vol. 17, Issues 3-4, 1989, p. 385, OperaOpera, Vol. 40, Issues 1-6, 1989, p. 247, Michael Patrick Kennedy and John Muir's Collins guide to musicalsKennedy, Michael Patrick and Muir, John: Collins Guide to Musicals, HarperCollins, 1997, p. 332 and Michael Portaniere and Jerry Herman's The Theatermania Guide to Musical Theater RecordingsPortaniere, Michael and Herman, Jerry: The Theatermania Guide to Musical Theater Recordings, Back Stage Books, 2004, p. 340. ==CD track listing== Richard Rodgers (1902-1979) The Sound of Music, lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II (1895-1960), book by Howard Lindsay (1889-1968) and Russel Crouse (1893-1966), suggested by The Story of the Trapp Family Singers by Maria Augusta Trapp (1905-1987) * 1.1 (1:02) Nature music, Orchestra * 1.2 (1:38) \\"The sound of music\\", Maria * 2 (0:14) The Abbey bells * 3 (1:00) \\"Mono chant\\", Sister Bertha, Chorus of nuns * 4 (0:57) \\"Morning hymn\\", Chorus of nuns * 5 (0:08) \\"Angelus bells\\", Chorus of nuns * 6 (0:46) \\"Alleluia\\", Chorus of nuns * 7 (3:03) \\"Maria\\", Mother Abbess, Sister Bertha, Sister Sophia, Sister Margaretta * 8 (2:27) \\"My favorite things\\", Maria * 9 (3:25) \\"I have confidence in me\\", Maria *10 (5:29) \\"Do-re-mi\\", Maria, Children *11 (4:42) \\"Sixteen going on seventeen\\", Rolf, Liesl *12 (3:02) \\"The lonely goatherd\\", Maria, Children *13 (2:46) \\"How can love survive\\", Max, Elsa *14 (3:19) Reprise: \\"The sound of music\\", Maria, Georg, Children *15.1 (0:59) The party scene, Orchestra *15.2 (0:25) Grand waltz, Orchestra *15.3 (0:33) Ländler, Orchestra *16 (2:48) \\"So long, farewell\\", Children *17 (3:22) \\"Climb ev'ry mountain\\", Mother Abbess *18 (2:55) \\"No way to stop it\\", Elsa, Max, Georg *19 (4:10) \\"An ordinary couple\\", Maria, Georg *20 (3:00) \\"Something good\\", Maria, Georg *21.1 (1:11) \\"Processional\\", Organ, Chorus *21.2 (1:47) \\"Confitemini Domino\\", Chorus of nuns *21.3 (0:41) \\"Alleluia\\", Chorus of nuns *22 (2:05) Reprise: \\"Sixteen going on seventeen\\", Maria, Liesl *23 (1:18) Reprise: \\"Do- re-mi\\", Maria, Georg, Children *24 (2:25) \\"Edelweiss\\", Georg *25 (1:52) Reprise: \\"So long, farewell\\", Maria, Georg, Children *26 (1:45) Reprise: \\"Climb ev'ry mountain\\", Mother Abbess, Chorus ==Personnel== Erich Kunzel (left) receiving the National Medal of Arts from President George W.

He is known as the inventor of relativistic quantum cryptography. In 1999 he published the first unconditionally secure protocols for bit commitment and coin tossing, which were also the first relativistic cryptographic protocols. He is a co-inventor of quantum tagging, or quantum position authentication, providing the first schemes for position-based quantum cryptography. In 2005 he published with Lucien Hardy and Jonathan Barrett the first security proof of quantum key distribution based on the no-signalling principle. == Work == ===Field theory=== Kent's early contributions to physics were on topics related to conformal field theory. Together with Peter Goddard and David Olive, he devised the coset construction that classifies the unitary highest weight representations of the Virasoro algebra, and he described the Virasoro algebra's singular vectors. In addition, he investigated the representation theory of N=2 superconformal algebras. ===Quantum cryptography=== Kent is inventor of the field of relativistic quantum cryptography, where security of the cryptographic tasks is guaranteed from the properties of quantum information and from the relativistic physical principle stating that information cannot travel faster than the speed of light (no-signalling). In 1999 he published the first unconditionally secure protocols for bit commitment and strong coin tossing, relativistic protocols that evade no-go theorem by Mayers, Lo and Chau, and by Lo and Chau, respectively. He is a co- inventor of quantum tagging, or quantum position authentication, where the properties of quantum information and the no-signalling principle are used to authenticate the location of an object. He published with Lucien Hardy and Jonathan Barrett the first security proof for quantum key distribution based on the no-signalling principle, where two parties can generate a secure secret key even if their devices are not trusted and they are not described by quantum theory, as long as they satisfy the no-signalling principle. With Roger Colbeck, he invented quantum randomness expansion, a task where an initial private random string is expanded into a larger private random string. ===Quantum foundations=== Kent is a critic of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, as well as the consistent histories interpretation. He has outlined a solution to the quantum reality problem, also called the quantum measurement problem, that is consistent with relativistic quantum theory, proposing that physical reality is described by a randomly chosen configuration of physical quantities (or beables) like the stress-energy tensor, whose sample space is mathematically well defined and respects Lorentzian symmetry. He has proposed Causal Quantum Theory as an extension of quantum theory, according to which local causality holds and the reduction of the quantum state is a well-defined physical process, claiming that current Bell-type experiments have not completely ruled out this theory. He discovered the no-summoning theorem, which extends the no-cloning theorem of quantum information to Minkowski spacetime. ===Other work=== Kent is a member of the advisory panel for the Cambridge Centre for the Study of Existential Risk.Centre for the Study of Existential Risk He has discussed the mathematics of risk assessments for global catastrophes.

He established Hakkemose Brickworks at Taastrup in 1847. ==Early life and education== Langgaard was born on 12 May 1811 in Copenhagen, the son of watchmaker Jens Bartholomæus Langgaard (1782–1832) and Marie Christiane Harm(s) (1784–1822). His father had studied watch-making in Aalborg but moved to Copenhagen in 1806 where he became the manager and eventually owner of a large clock and instrument business. He went bankrupt in connection with the Danish state bankruptcy of 1813. The family then moved to first Berlin and later, Landsberg an der Warthe. After his father's death, Langgaard apprenticed as a watchmaker on Rugen and then moved to Copenhagen where he was employed in Urban Jürgensen. He also brought his younger siblings back to Copenhagen. ==Career== In 1834, Langgaard established the first orthopedic clinic in Denmark at Store Tuborg and was granted a ten-year monopoly. This happened after he had completed studies at Frederiksberg Hospital's Department of Surgery and carried out a successful experiment on a young, hunchbacked girl. Langgaard ran the clinic until 1851. Langgaard was also a prolific inventor. In 1849, he obtained a patent on an orthopedic machine which attracted international attention at the Great Exhibition in London in 1851. He also created a strongman game called The Bull's Head (Tyrehovedet) for Tivoli Gardens as well as a number of other rides for Dyrehavsbakken and other amusement parks. He also obtained a number of other patents, for instance on steam-pipe kettles (rørdampkedler) and inventions related to his interest in the clay industry. Langgaard purchased the farm Hakkemose at Taastrup in 1847 and established Hakkemose Brickworks on 10 November that same year. It developed into the largest brickyard in the country. He also established a production of earthenware and ceramic stoves at the site. His heirs sold it to a British consortium in 1895. ==Personal life== Charlotte Seydewitz Langgaard married twice. His first wife was Henriette Catharine Frederikke Conradine Treschow (1818-1847), a daughter of Andreas Treschow (1794–1846) and Anne Marie Wendel (1797–1864). They were married on 17 December 1835 in Christiansborg Chapel. His second wife was Charlotte Sophie Magdalene Seydewitz (1826-1891), a daughter of Major Carl Christian S. (1777–1857) and Sophie Amalie Møller (1792–1863). They married on 20 March 1849 in the Garrison Church in Copenhagen. He was the father of pianist and composer Siegfried Langgaard and the grandfather of organist and composer Rud Langgaard. He was awarded the honorary title of Justitsråd in 1854 and Etatsråd in 1886. He died on 24 July 1890 and is buried in Frederiksberg Old Cemetery ==See also== * Larpent & Jürgensen ==Further reading== * Langgaard, Christian: En Hundredeaarsdag. I. P.

In September 2020, Wheeler announced her departure from OANN to focus on her future career endeavors. == Early life and education == While in high school, Wheeler began her career in media with the publication of her first political article, \\"Erring on the Side of Life\\". Wheeler received her Bachelor's degree with a major in Political Science and a minor in Homeland Security from Pennsylvania State University. == Career == In 2013, Wheeler partnered with 13 other young conservatives to co-author and publish Young, Conservative, & Why it's Smart to be Like Us. The work rose to #2 on Amazon's Civics bestseller list. On October 26, 2015, Wheeler was introduced as the host of the primetime talk show Tipping Point with Liz Wheeler, which aired weeknights at 9 PM ET/6 PM PT on One America News Network.

In 2018, Wheeler was profiled by Politico magazine as a \\"titan\\" of conservative media alongside Ben Shapiro, Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, Mark Levin, Tucker Carlson, Dana Loesch, and others. In the Politico profile, Wheeler explained why she chose a career in political media: \\"We're at a point that we're replacing God with government. So, instead of debating theology, instead of debating family, we're looking at government and looking to politics for the answers—and that's why everyone is so obsessed with it.\\" Wheeler has been rebuked by media accountability organizations such as Media Matters and Snopes. Wheeler has been accused by the two outlets of disseminating misinformation and propagating conspiracies. Media Matters has alleged that many of her attacks on Planned Parenthood and the Democrats' agenda consist of false information. On August 6, 2019, Wheeler published her first book, Tipping Points: How to Topple the Left's House of Cards, with Regnery Publishing. The book quickly became a Publishers Weekly national bestseller.

In July 1559 Margaret Harington left England with her cousin Jane Dormer wife of Gómez Suárez de Figueroa y Córdoba, 1st Duke of Feria, travelling first to Amboise in France where she met Mary, Queen of Scots, and then remained in the Feria household in Madrid. Feria's other attendants included; a sister of Sir Edward Stradling, a sister of Sir William Pickering, Mistress Paston who later married Sir Henry Newton, with Susanna White the wife of Thomas Tonge Clarenceux King of Arms and a life-long servant of Mary I of England. In 1588 she married don Benito de Cisneros, with a dowry from the Countess of Feria of 20,000 ducats.

Russell's theory is that oxygenic photosynthesis acting upon iron sulfide deposits in volcanic, oceanic vents, allowed the formation of precursors of protein and RNA. Russell studied 360-million-year-old mineral deposits in Ireland, which led to his insight that iron sulphite cells may have provided three-dimensional molds for the first cell walls. Russell was an undergraduate in geology at Queen Mary College of the University of London, took his PhD in geochemistry at University of Durham, taught at the University of Glasgow, and was a visiting Professor at the University of Grenoble. He was NASA Senior Research Fellow at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, and a member of the NASA Astrobiology Institute from 2006 until 2019. Russell has appeared on BBC programmes including Life on Mars and Origin of Life. ===Awards and honours=== In June 2009, Russell was awarded the William Smith Medal from the Geological Society of London for his lifetime contributions to applied geology. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Academics of the University of Glasgow Category:British geologists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Alumni of Durham University ","title":"Michael Russell (scientist)"},{"id":"61530411","text":"The list of shipwrecks in November 1857 includes ships sunk, wrecked or otherwise lost during November 1857. ==1 November== ==2 November== ==4 November== ==5 November== ==6 November== ==7 November== ==8 November== ==9 November== ==10 November== ==11 November== ==12 November== ==13 November== ==14 November== ==15 November== ==16 November== ==17 November== ==18 November== ==19 November== ==20 November== ==21 November== ==22 November== ==23 November== ==24 November== ==25 November== ==26 November== ==27 November== ==28 November== ==29 November== ==30 November== ==Unknown date== ==References== 1857-11 ","title":"List of shipwrecks in November 1857"},{"id":"61530416","text":"The Apostolic Nunciature to Slovenia is an ecclesiastical office of the Catholic Church in Slovenia.

The game was officially released for Microsoft Windows and Linux in April 2019, later becoming available for PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and soon to be on mobile. In Forager, the player progresses by obtaining resources that spawn throughout the world, crafting new buildings, objects, and tools, solving puzzles, and collecting money to buy new lands to explore and utilize. ==Gameplay== Forager combines mechanics commonly seen in idle games with those of an adventure or exploration game. With resources that respawn at a very high rate, the player will find themselves able to harvest massive amounts for crafting and leveling, eventually leading to automated systems to collect resources and produce other products and goods. The leveling system in the game consists of a large grid of unlockable perks, which also may unlock new tools or craftable objects. Everything the player does from harvesting resources, to crafting objects, to killing enemies, has a positive impact on their XP used to advance levels. The player is able to simulate a variety of tasks related to cooking, economics, engineering, farming, fishing, hunting, magic, manufacturing, mining, and more. By obtaining money through crafting, skills, looting, and economic tasks, the player is able to purchase more lands to expand their base, explore new areas, and obtain new classes of resources or encounter new enemies and other NPC. == Development == The creator of Forager, Mariano Cavallero, dropped out of school to develop video games. For a year he learned how to program, but unfortunately nobody was interested in his games at first. After he ran out of money, he moved back home to his mom, who invested her life savings into her son’s projects. He started developing Forager in a Game Jam but eventually ran out of money again. Before giving up, Mariano participated in one last competition, in which he won a trip to the USA to show off his work. A friend he met at a conference was late to a meeting because he was playing Forager. The person he was meeting had to come look for him, and he showed Forager to this person. This person was working for Humble Bundle and offered a publishing deal for Forager. A year after release on Steam the game had sold 600,000 units. ==Reception== Forager received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Nathan Grayson wrote a review on Kotaku calling Forager an \\"extremely well-made\\" game and called it \\"obviously a labor of love\\" while also noting that the game was \\"a crafting game stripped down to its very bones\\" and stating that players may prefer a game with \\"more than pure progression\\". Jeff Ramos on Polygon says that the game's repetitive and tedious nature serve to \\"make the game's bright moments all the brighter\\" and says that \\"in Forager, grinding is almost all I have to do, and I can hardly pull myself away\\" praising the game for its use of grind-heavy mechanics. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2019 video games Category:Indie video games Category:Linux games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games using procedural generation Category:Windows games Category:Humble Bundle Category:Xbox One games ","title":"Forager (video game)"},{"id":"61530528","text":"Cleisostoma aspersum is a species of orchid found in Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam.Cleisostoma aspersum == References == == External links == recurvum Category:Orchids of Bhutan Category:Orchids of India Category:Orchids of Thailand Category:Orchids of Vietnam ","title":"Cleisostoma aspersum"},{"id":"61530531","text":"Mogamad Nazier Paulsen is a Western Cape-based Member of the National Assembly for the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF).

She spent five years working at the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture. From 1992-1994 she served as the acting director of Regulatory and Procedural Development at the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation of the US Department of Agriculture. She represented the Grocery Manufacturers Association for number of years. She is the founder and former executive director of the Caribbean Agribusiness Association: Trinidad and Tobago. In 2003 she semi-retired from the lobbying industry and launched a career as a wine pundit. She served as the Wine Editor of the Alexandria Times. As a wine consultant she branded herself The Vino Vixen and ran a wine blog under that name. She has claimed to have trademarked Vino Vixen. ==State Department career== Stull was appointed as a Senior Advisor to the Bureau of International Organization Affairs shortly after the election of President Donald Trump. Her tenure was contentious with allegations of workplace bullying and harassment as well as undue politicization of the diplomatic service made against her. Stull reportedly engaged in six to eight hostile interactions a day at the BIOA. She objected to a legislative affairs staffer accompanying a Congressional Black Caucus trip as was standard procedure because it contained only Democrats, she reportedly personally accused the staffer of undermining President Trump’s agenda and reassigned their responsibilities. Stull’s State Department career concluded January 11, 2019. At the time of her departure she was under investigation by an internal State Department watchdog and a US House of Representatives committee. Her actions over the course of her State Department career reportedly resulted in at least three Senior and numerous junior staff leaving the department. In August 2019 the Office of Inspector General (United States) found that Stull and Assistant Secretary of State Kevin Moley had engaged in harassment, mistreatment, and retaliation of career state department employees., Review of Allegations of Politicized and Other Improper Personnel Practices in the Bureau of International Organization Affairs, Office of Inspector General, United States Department of State, ESP-19-05 Office of Evaluations and Special Projects, Retrieved 16 August 2019 Rep.

The report characterized the working environment under Stull and Moley to be “vindictive” and stated that “OIG found evidence of leadership and management deficiencies and mistreatment of career employees in the Bureau of International Organization Affairs. These inappropriate practices included disrespectful and hostile treatment of employees, accusations against and harassment of career employees premised on claims that they were ‘disloyal’ based on their perceived political views, and retaliation associated with conflicts of interest,” as well as retaliation against employees who refused to participate in activities over legitimate conflict of interest concerns. Stull’s former office disputed some of the actions described in the report. ===Loyalty lists controversy=== Soon after being appointed to a senior position in the Bureau of International Organization Affairs it was alleged that Stull was creating lists of those perceived as loyal or disloyal to the President. This included reviewing employees social media accounts for hints about their political and social positions. She would personally confront those who she believed to be disloyal and called State Department employees 'Obama holdovers,' 'traitors,' and ‘disloyal,’ to their faces. She was accused of making lists of State Department employees suspected of potential disloyalty to President Trump, as well as private U. S. citizens working for the United Nations and other international organizations. Reporting on these incidents raised the attention of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.

Blakley January 15, 1957. In 1956, Allan Shivers opted not to run for a fourth term as Governor of Texas; Senator Price Daniel, as a sitting U.S. Senator was elected Governor of Texas. Like his gubernatorial predecessor Allan Shivers and Daniel, Blakley was an \\"Eisenhower Democrat\\" who had supported Dwight Eisenhower over the national Democratic Party candidate Adlai Stevenson in 1952 and 1956. Blakley, who had gained prominence in Texas politics for his business successes was, at the time, building a $125 million shopping center and a 1,000-room hotel in Dallas. Governor Shivers, who had been considering appointing a Republican candidate to the Senate seat, instead named Blakley to the United States Senate pending a special election for the seat. Pressured by the Democratic Party in the interests of cooling tensions from the gubernatorial election, Blakley did not seek the remaining term as senator. He hence served for fewer than four months from January 15 to April 28. Ralph Yarborough succeeded him in the special election, winning with a plurality of the vote when the conservatives divided three ways. Thereafter, Texas law was changed to require a runoff between the two leading candidates in a special election if no one had a majority in the first round). Blakley left the Senate saying \\"I shall go back to my boots and saddle and ride toward the Western sunset.\\"http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,913915,00.html Yarborough would be re-elected in 1958 and again in 1964. == Wisconsin == Senator William Proxmire Two-term Republican Joseph McCarthy died May 2, 1957. In the summer of 1957, a special election was held to fill McCarthy's seat. In the primaries, voters in both parties turned away from McCarthy's legacy. The Republican primary was won by Walter J. Kohler Jr., who called for a clean break from McCarthy's approach; he defeated former Congressman Glenn Robert Davis, who charged that Eisenhower was soft on Communism. The Democratic candidate, William Proxmire, called the late McCarthy \\"a disgrace to Wisconsin, to the Senate, and to America\\". On August 27, Proxmire won the election, serving in the seat for 32 years.

Spectacle-making had been established in the town in 1826 when William Beecher had set up a jewelry business there with an apprentice, Robert H. Cole. Cole subsequently bought the business and became the largest shareholder and first president of the American Optical Company. When he retired in 1891 and Beecher died in 1892, the volume of production in the town was about two million frames and a million pairs of lenses per year. ==Military contractor== ===U.S. Army Air Corps D-1 sunglasses=== The first aviator style sunglasses contracted by the US military in 1935 were the U.S. Army Air Corps D-1 Sunglasses made by American Optical. They have a conspicuous USAC engraving on the hinged bridge. The D-1 flying goggle assembly was standardized on 13 August 1935, and was actually a pair of sun glasses with a rigid frame and plastic insulated arms. The D-1 sunglasses were superseded by the more comfortable AN6531 flying sun glasses (comfort cable) in November 1941. ===AN6531 military sunglasses=== AN6531 sunglasses with Type 1 AN6531 lenses made by American Optical In the second half of the 1930s and early 1940s, a group of American firms kept developing sunglasses. The military \\"flying sun glasses (comfort cable)\\" were standardized in November 1941. They were produced in huge quantities (several million pieces) for pilots and sailors. The lenses were made to a joint standard shared by the U.S. Army Air Corps and the U.S. Navy. As a result the lens carried an \\"AN\\" (Army/Navy) specification number: the AN6531. The U.S. Government specified the shape of the lens and the color, which was initially a green tinted lens that transmitted 50% of incoming visible daylight. This AN6531 Type 1 lens proved insufficient to protect pilot’s eyes from sun glare so this lens was superseded by the darker AN6531 Type 2 lens in rose smoke. Various contractors made the frames and ground the lenses. These included American Optical, Bausch & Lomb, The Chas. Fischer Spring Co., Willson Optical and Rochester Optical Co. Frame and hinge design varied slightly from contractor to contractor. Despite being designed for utility, these glasses had advanced properties: teardrop-shaped and convex lenses, plastic nose pads and a prominent brow bar and featured flexible cable temples. The nickel plated frame was made of a copper based alloy to prevent offsetting compasses. the \\"teardrop\\" shape lens of the AN 6531 was designed to accommodate Air Force pilots who were constantly looking down at their instrument panel while in flight, and influenced all future Aviator style lens shapes. The AN6531 Comfort Cable aviator sunglasses frame kept being issued by the U.S. military as No. MIL-G-6250 glasses after World War II with different lenses as Type F-2 (arctic) and Type G-2 aviator sunglasses but fitted with darker lenses until their substitute the Type HGU-4/P aviator sunglasses became available in the late 1950s. After World War II AN6531 Comfort Cable aviator sunglasses were available for civilians on the surplus market. ===Type HGU-4/P aviator sunglasses=== American Optical HGU4/P \\"Original Pilot Sunglass\\" (Flight Goggle 58) In 1958 American Optical created the Flight Goggle 58 according to the then new U.S. Air Force Type HGU-4/P aviator sunglasses standard. Type HGU-4/P sunglasses feature semi-rectangluar lenses with less lens surface area and are lighter compared to the preceding Type G-2 sunglasses. The HGU-4/P design frame allowed the visor to reliably clear the aviator's spectacles when a flight helmet is worn, and covers the full field of vision. The frame additionally features bayonet temples designed to slip under a flight helmet or other headgear and were more compatible with oxygen masks. They are commercially known as \\"Original Pilot Sunglass\\", and were issued by the U.S. military since 1959 to pilots shortly after the HGU4/P was officially recommended by military optometrists in November 1958. The HGU-4/P design frame is also issued to military personnel that require various corrective clear or other type of lenses and allows corrected vision through the full field of vision. Besides the military type HGU-4/P aviator sunglasses were also issued to and used by NASA astronauts. HGU-4/P aviation flight glasses are still built to the guidelines of the MIL-S-25948 military specification, a document detailing the manufacturing specifications. One of the many specifications is that the neutral grey lenses used in Type HGU-4/P aviator sunglasses must transmit between 12% to 18% of incoming visible daylight whilst providing 'true' color and contrast distribution. The military HGU-4/P Aviator and the Modiﬁed HGU-4/P Apache spectacles intended for Apache attack helicopter aircrew are under regular review to determine their functionality. ==References== Category:1869 establishments in Massachusetts Category:Eyewear companies of the United States Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1869 Category:Optics manufacturing companies Category:Sunglasses ","title":"American Optical Company"},{"id":"61530709","text":"Corpus Christi () is a 2019 drama film directed by Jan Komasa and written by Mateusz Pacewicz. It premiered at 2019 Venice Film Festival Venice Days section. It was also shown in the Contemporary World Cinema section at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival. At Venice Days, the film won the Europa Cinemas Label Award and the Edipo Re Inclusion Award. It was also selected as the Polish entry for the Best International Feature Film at the 92nd Academy Awards, making the final nomination. The film tells the story of a Polish ex-convict who wishes to join the priesthood, and cons his way into becoming a priest of a village. ==Plot== Daniel has a spiritual awakening while serving his sentence in a youth detention center for second-degree murder, but his criminal background prevents him from pursuing his dream to become a priest once he is released. He is assigned to work in a sawmill in a village, and while visiting the local church, he pretends to be a priest. The vicar of that church meets Daniel wholly believing his lie, and leaves him in charge of the church while he goes to rehab for a medical problem. Daniel begins performing all the duties of priesthood, and enjoys it. The parishioners enjoy his unorthodox methods, even his unexpected claim from the pulpit to be a murderer, but they have mixed feelings when he starts asking about a recent car accident that caused a lot of trauma in the community. The more time he spends there, he begins to uncover the village's deep secrets: it is still unclear whether the car crash was actually an accident, but the mayor insists that the issue has been put to bed. The biggest point of contention is whether the driver should be allowed to be buried in the village cemetery with the other victims. Daniel discovers that after months, the cremated remains still haven't been buried anywhere, and many in the village had sent hateful, threatening letters to the widow. He and his new friend Marta confront the villagers about this, showing them the letters with their handwriting, and Daniel decides to go forward with a funeral at the cemetery. Marta is thrown out of the house by her mother for bringing out the letters, and she asks to stay at the temporary rectory with Daniel; while there, they make love. During the funeral, many of the villagers put aside their hate and pay their respects, and at the end of the ceremony, the priest from Daniel's youth detention center arrives, having been tipped off that the village's new priest is an impostor. He tells Daniel to pack his bags immediately, but Daniel sneaks out a window and goes to the church to celebrate his \\"farewell Mass\\". During the Mass, he removes his vestment and shirt, showing all his tattoos, and leaves the church. Daniel is sent back to jail where he again has to face the brother of the man he murdered. At the detention center Daniel fights the brother of the boy he murdered and after gaining the upperhand in the fight he is allowed to walk free by other inmates. ==Cast== * Bartosz Bielenia as Daniel * Aleksandra Konieczna as Lidia the sexton * Eliza Rycembel as Marta Sosińska * Leszek Lichota as the Mayor * Łukasz Simlat as Father Tomasz * Tomasz Ziętek as Pinczer * Barbara Kurzaj as the Widow * Zdzisław Wardejn as Father Wojciech ==Production== The script for Corpus Christi was written by Mateusz Pacewicz with consultation help from Krzysztof Rak, but after director Jan Komasa read it, he felt the story and especially the character of Daniel needed to be pushed further, so he added a \\"troubled background\\" to Daniel's story. Komasa has also said that the car accident that caused such trauma for characters in the film is a symbol for the 2010 Smolensk air disaster, in which 96 people died in a plane crash, including Poland's president and top officials. The film's cinematography was shot in a \\"a grim, desaturated palette\\". The film's production ran into controversy because a man claimed the film was actually based on his real life experiences and his efforts to get in contact with the film's producers were met with silence. The producers have said that the film is not based on this man's life, and instead on various cases of fraud in the priesthood. Pacewicz has said that fake priests are a fairly common occurrence in Poland, and every couple months a new case is discovered; they are often \\"about the need for a sort of social security for the underprivileged to become a trustworthy priest which is a great form of social status for many\\". Most of the filming took place in Jaśliska, south- eastern Poland. One of the scenes was filmed on a barge at Lake Rożnów in Tabaszowa. ==Awards== Corpus Christi was nominated for Best International Film at the 92nd Academy Awards. The film also won 11 Polish Academy Awards including Best Film, Best Director, Best Script, Best Actor. The film also won ten awards at the Gdynia Film Festival, including Best Director, Best Script, Journalists' Award and Audience Award. It won the Silver Star and Best Actor Award for Bartosz Bielenia at the El Gouna Film Festival, and a Special Mention at the Reykjavik International Film Festival. At Luxembourg's CinEast, the film won the Special Jury Prize and the Critics' Prize. Bartosz Bielenia also won the award for Best Actor at the Chicago International Film Festival and Stockholm International Film Festival. He also won the Shooting Stars Award for the most promising up-and-coming European actor. ==Reception== ===Critical response=== The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 97% with an average score of 7.84/10, based on 75 reviews. The website's critical consensus states, \\"Led by an impressive performance from Bartosz Bielenia, Corpus Christi thoughtfully and engagingly examines questions of faith and redemption\\". It also has a score of 77 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 20 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".https://www.metacritic.com/movie/corpus-christi Variety's Peter Debruge called the film \\"stunning\\" and \\"quietly subversive\\", despite a few plot points that feel like a soap-opera to him. \\"Bielenia is never less than totally compelling,\\" wrote Christy Lemire for RogerEbert.com, adding that \\"this is a complex character full of layers and contradictions.\\" The Washington Post's Ann Hornaday described the film as \\"an absorbing, spiritually attuned drama\\" and added that \\"Bielenia presents the perfect embodiment of haunted asceticism\\" while \\"Komasa's careful framing and lighting reveal him to be innocent-looking one moment and more menacing the next\\". Writing in the Polish magazine Polityka, Janusz Wróblewski described the film as more suspenseful than the classic Western films, and lauded the ways in which it exorcises the complexities of Poland's past. ==See also== * List of submissions to the 92nd Academy Awards for Best International Feature Film * List of Polish submissions for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film ==References== ==External links== * Category:2019 films Category:2019 drama films Category:Films about Catholicism Category:French drama films Category:French films Category:Polish drama films Category:Polish films Category:Polish-language films ","title":"Corpus Christi (2019 film)"},{"id":"61530749","text":"Semyon Alekseevich Kamenev (, 1895 14 March 1938) was an educator, professor, writer, Soviet propagandist of atheism and a scientific worker in the study of problems of religion and atheism.Каменев Семен Алексеевич (1895) Semyon Kamenev was born in the village of Semenovka (), Kursk uyezd, Kursk Governorate.

That May he took aboard a party of English sailors under John Cook which had split with Bartholomew Sharp's raiders. Among Cook's crew were William Dampier and Edward Davis; they left Sharp's camp with the help of native guides, whom they paid using trinkets bought from Tristan's men. Tristan rejoined the larger fleet after transferring the Englishmen to another ship, but became separated from them and was forced to flee after encountering several Spanish warships near Bocas del Toro. In late 1682 he was back in the Caribbean where he met again with Jan Willems off of Ile a Vache. Among Willems’ crew were Cook and his sailors, who rejoined Tristan after their own ship had been confiscated. Soon afterwards Cook and the English sailors stole Tristan's ship while he and his French crew were ashore. Tristan eventually met Nicholas van Hoorn, who in 1683 gave him a replacement vessel for a combined assault on Veracruz alongside Michel de Grammont. Tristan sailed with Grammont through 1685, raiding Campeche and other targets before leaving late that year for Guinea. In 1688 Tristan sailed to Jamaica; as a French Protestant (Huguenot) he was no longer welcome in Catholic France and so he became a naturalized British subject. He was commanding a merchant vessel on trading (possibly smuggling) voyage to Panama in 1693 when the Spanish seized his vessel and hanged Tristan with all his crew. Jamaican Governor William Beeston traded angry letters with Spanish officials, condemning their harsh treatment of British citizens; the Spanish Audiencia President responded that Tristan was “known to be one of the greatest pirates in America. Had he been brought in alive, I should have punished him.” ==See also== *Jacob Evertson - Another corsair who briefly sailed with Tristan when he left Ile a Vache. ==Notes== ==References== Category:17th-century pirates Category:Year of birth missing Category:French pirates Category:People executed for piracy Category:1693 deaths Category:Piracy in the Caribbean ","title":"Jean Tristan (pirate)"},{"id":"61531220","text":"The Frank & Seder Building is a , 7-story, former department store building completed in 1918 on Smithfield Avenue in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. The building is a contributing structure in the Pittsburgh Central Downtown Historic District. As of 2019, the historic building is being renovated as a mixed-use facility, Smith & Fifth, with 40 apartments on the upper two levels, of office space, and of retail space spread over the first 2 floors, and underground parking. ==Frank & Seder== Russian Jewish immigrants Isaac Seder and Jacob H. Frank started a wholesale women's wear business in the early 1900s, then switched to retail, opening a downtown Pittsburgh store in 1907. The business grew, expanding into a department store, and adding locations in New York City, Philadelphia and Detroit. The Pittsburgh Frank & Seder building was expanded in 1913. On January 27, 1917 a fire engulfed the retail shopping district in downtown Pittsburgh bordered by Wood St, Forbes Ave, Smithfield St, and 5th Ave. The Frank & Seder department store at 344 Fifth Avenue was completely destroyed, the Grand Opera House, the Hilton Clothing Company and a dozen other businesses were significantly damaged. The Frank & Seder building damages were valued at $600,000, total losses were valued at $4 million. Even though Frank & Seder sustained a complete loss of the building they had been in since 1907, construction of a new building began shortly after and was completed in 1918. Several labor organizations staged strikes, accompanied by violence, against Frank & Seder and four other major Pittsburgh retailers from 1953 to 1954. National Department Stores acquired the Frank & Seder group of stores in 1923, including Frank & Seder, Inc. (Pittsburgh); Lewin-Nieman Co. (Pittsburgh); Fink Co. (Philadelphia); Frank A Seder Co. of Philadelphia and Frank & Seder Co. of Detroit. The Pittsburgh Frank & Seder store closed in 1958. ==Redevelopment history== In May 2012 Oxford Development Company, then owner of the Frank & Seder building, unveiled plans to replace the building with a 33-story, $238 million tower named 350 Fifth Ave (updating the current 441 Smithfield address). Oxford revised the project twice, in 2014 reducing the height to 20 stories and in early 2015 changing to 29 stories with eight stories of parking and a $200 million budget. Although Pittsburgh had an office occupancy rate over 94% at the time, Oxford was unable to secure the two large tenants of over to start construction on the proposed tower. Oxford eventually abandoned the project and sold the building to Stark Enterprises in January 2017 for $10.4 million. Stark plans a $63 million redevelopment of the building into of office space spread over three floors, with 40 apartments on the upper two levels, and of retail space spread over the first 2 floors, and underground parking.

It was constructed in 1880–82 and designed by the London architect James Piers St Aubyn. St Peter's has been Grade II* listed since 1960. ==History== St Peter's was built to replace the Church of St Peter the Poor Fisherman as parish church of Revelstoke. The existing church had become dilapidated and was at an inconvenient distance for many residents of Noss Mayo. Furthermore the chapel of ease of 1839 in the village was deemed too small to adequately serve the population as a parish church. Edward Baring, who purchased the estate of Membland in 1877, offered to construct a new church at his expense. The foundation stone was laid on 10 September 1880 by Mrs. Edward Baring in the presence of a large crowd of spectators. Some of the clergy members present included the rector of Revelstoke, Rev. H. Farwell Roe, Rev. Duke Yonge of Newton Ferrers and the Archdeacon of Totnes, Ven. Alfred Earle. No contractor was sought for the construction of the church; local tradesmen carried out the work under the estate Clerk of works, Mr. G. W. Crosbie. Construction work had reached roof level by October 1881, and the church nearly completed when it was consecrated by the Bishop of Exeter, Frederick Temple, on 6 September 1882. ==Architecture== St Peter's Church and Noss Mayo. St Peter's is built in the Perpendicular style and designed to accommodate 250 persons. It cost approximately £14,000 to build. The church is built of local stone with dressings in Dartmoor granite, slate roofs and woodwork in English oak. The inside is made up of a nave, north and south aisles, chancel, west tower, south-west porch and vestry. Owing to the steep site, the vestry was constructed beneath the north aisle and accessed by stairs under an apse. The embattled tower, approximately 70 feet high, contains eight bells and chiming apparatus supplied by Messrs. John Warner & Sons. The four clock faces installed below each belfry window were made by Mr. Jump of London. Much of the interior's carved woodwork was undertaken by Mr. Harry Hems of Exeter and the organ supplied by J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd of London. Decoration of the church's interior continued throughout the decade, with much of the paintwork and stained glass being carried out to the design and under the supervision of Mr. J. T. Fouracre of Stonehouse. The ongoing work was described in 1886 by the Totnes Times and Devon News as \\"making the interior as elegant as the graceful lines of the edifice itself\\". A window memorial to Lady Revelstoke, following her death in 1892, was installed in 1893 and also supplied by Fouracre and Son. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Churches in Devon Category:Grade II* listed churches in Devon Category:Churches completed in 1882 ","title":"St Peter's Church, Noss Mayo"},{"id":"61531301","text":"Cidramus or Kidramos, also known as Kidrama, was a town of ancient Phrygia and later of Caria, inhabited in Roman and Byzantine times.

The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with five bays at the back of a Cour d'honneur facing onto St Mary's Gate; there were three large round-headed windows and two doorways on the ground floor (one door for the crown judge and one door for the nisi prius judge) and there were Tuscan order columns at the corners. The complex was expanded by the completion of judges' lodgings: the lodgings, which were built to a design by John Welch with seven bays on the east side of the Cour d'honneur, were completed in 1811. The courtroom was the setting for the trial of Betty Sorrel in the novel Adam Bede by George Eliot published in 1859. The building continued to be used as a facility for dispensing justice but, following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1888, which established county councils in every county, it also became the meeting place of Derbyshire County Council. In the early 20th century, the county council commissioned additional accommodation at No. 16 on the north side of St Mary's Gate (now the Cathedral Quarter Hotel) and at No. 29 on the south side (now Middleton House). The complex was further expanded by the addition of an early 18th century former public house bearing the coat of arms of George III and known as the \\"King's Arms and County Hotel\\": the building, which was converted into a library to a design by George Henry Widdows with seven bays on the west side of the Cour d'honneur, was completed in 1934. After the County Council moved out to Smedley's Hydro in 1955, the County Hall in Derby operated solely as a courts complex.

After her husband Myers Y. Cooper was elected governor of Ohio in 1929, Kinney Cooper decided to create a library housing the works of Ohioans. ==Personal life== Kinney Cooper was born to parents Joel and Sarah Kinney on January 12, 1874. Her father was a former Major during the Civil War and worked as a lawyer. Growing up, Kinney Cooper attended Walnut Hills Christian Church where she met her future husband, Myers Y. Cooper. She graduated from Woodward High School in 1892. She married Cooper on December 15, 1897 and they had two children together; Raymond K. Cooper and Martha Anne Cooper. ==Career== In early 1929, she moved into the governor’s mansion with her husband. As she was unpacking, Kinney Cooper came across stacks of books and large bookshelves but realized that none of them were written by Ohio authors. This inspired her to establish the Ohioana Library Association, an organization with the goal to preserve Ohio's cultural heritage. Directed by Depew Head, the Martha Kinney Cooper Ohioana Library was created to specifically house the works of Ohioans. Kinney Cooper established relationships with various authors and interests groups to expand the library. Each spring, she would host a tea for Hamilton County authors at her Cincinnati home. She also developed a friendship with members of the National League of American Pen Women. One such member, Clara Heflebower, would go on to serve as secretary of the Ohioana Library committee. By the 1931, the library already held more than 600 volumes. As a non-profit, all the books were collected through the authors themselves. Ohio was the first state to found a library of the works of its own authors. She continued to enlist help from interest groups, such as the Ohio Federation of Women’s Clubs, to help her collect and file books written by Ohioans. As a result, the library outgrew its space in the governor’s mansion and was relocated to the State Library of Ohio. By January 2001, the library again relocated, this time to 274 E First Avenue. In 1942, the Ohioana Book Awards was established to honor Ohio authors in Fiction, Nonfiction, Poetry, and Juvenile Literature. Kinney Cooper remained active with the library until her death in 1964. On August 30, 1978, Kinney Cooper was posthumously inducted into the Ohio Women's Hall of Fame. == References == Category:1874 births Category:1964 deaths Category:Women librarians Category:Women in Ohio Category:Christians from Ohio Category:Woodward High School (Cincinnati, Ohio) alumni ","title":"Martha Kinney Cooper"},{"id":"61531476","text":"Mike Sosene-Feagai (born 17 April 1993) is an Samoan born, New Zealand raised, United States rugby union player.

He was responsible for establishing the line between St. Regis on the St. Lawrence River and the Lake of the Woods. During his travels north, he began to form his collection of minerals that was considered one of the best in private hands in the country for many years. Delafield was a member of many scientific associations, both in the United States and in Europe.

The anniversary of the 1997 handover of Hong Kong to China on 1 July saw large daytime protests. In the evening of that day, protesters stormed the Legislative Council Building and defaced symbols, with police only moving in after midnight. This incident, which was sharply condemned by the government of Carrie Lam, did however not lead to a split between peaceful and violent protesters. Observers linked the understanding of the non-violent protesters for the violent wing to the lack of willingness of the Lam government to engage in dialogue about the protesters' five demands. Apart from major protests on Sundays, there were also mostly peaceful demonstrations during the week. A pattern became established such that peaceful daytime protests were followed by violent clashes between protesters and police at night. Police continued to draw criticism for its heavy-handed tactics. A further landmark event in the evolution of the protests was the Yuen Long attack on 21 July. White-shirted gangs descended on Yuen Long station and wrought havoc in chaotic scenes, with a vast number of calls of citizens to police being unanswered until the attackers had retreated. This led to a further loss of faith of protesters and their sympathisers in the integrity of the police force, and also further worsened their views of the Hong Kong government. The government and representatives of the force would change their framing of the attack several times over the course of the following year. == Events == === 1 July protests === annual 1 July march at the Jardine's Bazaar shopping district. As the city marked the 22nd anniversary of its 1997 handover to China, the annual pro-democracy protest march organised by CHRF claimed a record turnout of 550,000 while police placed the estimate around 190,000; independent organisations using scientific methods calculated that participation was in the region of 250,000 people. Earlier in the day, Devil's Peak saw a white vertical protest banner with words roughly translated into \\"Mourning in Pain\\" (「痛心疾首」). Later in the day, at the annual flag-raising ceremony in the morning outside the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, police used pepper spray and batons to disperse protesters. Before the march, youths had begun besieging the Legislative Council building. The march was later diverted to Chater Road in Central due to the people amassed in front of the Legislative Council. At around 9 pm local time, hundreds of protesters stormed the legislature after breaking through the glass walls and metal doors of the building. Protesters caused extensive damage by ransacking the premises, damaging portraits of former pro-Beijing presidents of the Legislative Council, and smashing furniture. Protesters spray-painted slogans, hung up signs and erected barricades. During the occupation, 25-year-old student Brian Leung Kai-ping presented a new 10-point manifesto calling for greater freedom and democracy, and increased autonomy from Beijing. The police started using tear gas to disperse protesters around the LegCo at 12:05 am, and reached the building 15 minutes later. Carrie Lam's \\"lack of positive response to the public\\" was cited as the reason for the occupation and the acts of property damage; the deaths from suicide also sparked anger and desperation among the protesters. During Carrie Lam's press conference at 4 o'clock in the morning, she acknowledged the peaceful and orderly march but strongly condemned the \\"violence and vandalism in the storming of the Legislative Council building\\". Lam evaded questions regarding recent deaths. The Hong Kong Journalists Association criticised the government for omitting the unanswered questions from the official transcript, while Information Services Department responded that the transcript released was not a \\"verbatim\\". After the protest, demonstrators and legislators condemned the Hong Kong police for deliberately allowing protesters to ram the glass doors and windows of the LegCo in front of cameras and television crews for hours, without any arrests or clearance. The police explained that their decision to retreat was after \\"considering a number of factors.\\" By early 5 July, there had been at least 66 arrests and first formal charges laid in connection with the incident.

According to organisers, about 8,000 were in attendance, while police cited 1,300 in attendance. The gathering of mothers and allies shared solidarity with young protesters and condemned the government for being indifferent to Hong Kong people's demands. === 6 July Reclaim Tuen Mun Park === On 6 July, people marched in a protest organised by the Tuen Mun Park Sanitation Concern Group. The protest aimed at condemning mainland Chinese middle-aged women singers and dancers, also known by the nickname \\"dai ma\\" (大媽), which literally translates to \\"big mothers,\\" and the elderly men who gave these women \\"donations\\" for the noise disturbance and annoyances they have caused in Tuen Mun Park. Conflicts between the police and the protesters brew as the police escorted a person who allegedly assaulted the marchers away while using pepper spray on the protesters. The organiser claimed that nearly 10,000 people attended the protest. === 7 July Tsim Sha Tsui march ===  Daytime rally  230x230px The first anti-extradition bill protest in the Kowloon side of Hong Kong was held on 7 July in Tsim Sha Tsui. Before the march, organisers had promised that it would be a peaceful rally. The rally started from Salisbury Garden at 3:30 pm, heading to the West Kowloon MTR station. The march ended at around 7 pm. The march was then officially called to an end at 7:30 pm. The organisers claimed more than 230,000 attended the march, while police estimated around 56,000 only. 230x230px Protesters marched along Nathan Road and Canton Road, which mainland tourists frequent because of the presence of a long string of luxury stores. The protest was aimed at giving a good impression to these visitors, hoping to raise their awareness of the issues and support for their cause. Hard copy booklets about the extradition bill in Simplified Chinese were distributed to mainland tourists, to bypass mainland web censorship. About 200 protestors assembled near the ferry terminal by the China Hong Kong City Centre, chanting in Mandarin and urging the shoppers to join the demonstration. As a precaution, water barricades had been also set up by the police, with checkpoints to confirm the passengers' identities; the MTR Corporation had stopped selling tickets for journeys during noon-time. Protesters and residents condemned the action, complaining it unnecessary and unreasonable. This was the largest protest in Hong Kong solely mobilised by netizens and in Kowloon area to date.  Night-time clashes  After the end of the march at 7:30 pm, around 300 protesters left the West Kowloon station and headed to Canton Road again. They proceeded up Nathan Road and arrived at Mong Kok to find police amassed on Shantung Street, where there was a stand-off for around 20 minutes. Riot police, most of them refusing to exhibit an identification number or warrant card arrived, assaulting protestors and journalists alike. By the end of the night, at least six arrests were made. The following day, lawmaker Lam Cheuk- ting requested an independent investigation of police conduct, called for a review of video that may show the use of excessive force, and stated that failure to have warrant cards visibly displayed may be a violation of the law.  10 July subsequent protests  On 10 July, two rival protests were held outside Wan Chai Police Headquarters. Around a dozen protesters from the pro- democracy Labour Party called on the police to launch a criminal investigation. The protesters presented as evidence five pieces of video footage purportedly showing officers assaulting demonstrators even after they had been pinned down. However, they were referred to the force's internal investigation unit – the Complaints Against Police Office. Around a dozen protesters from the pro-establishment Anti-black money, anti-Hong Kong independence concern group filed a police report claiming that pro-democracy lawmakers: Jeremy Tam, Au Nok-hin and Roy Kwong were involved in the violent night clashes. === 10 July Yau Tong's Lennon Wall tension === On 10 July, a few youngsters constructed a makeshift Lennon Wall on a pillar outside the Yau Tong MTR exit. They were soon surrounded and intimidated by tens of mostly middle-aged pro-government residents who were suspected of being off-duty policemen from nearby Yau Mei Court, which contains a \\"disciplined staff quarters\\" for police. The crowds built up at night, growing into the hundreds. Numerous scuffles then broke out between a hundred pro-government residents and a much larger crowd protecting the youngsters. Hundreds of police arrived and formed a defence line on the staircase leading from the MTR exit. They were accused of not stopping the violence of the pro-government residents against the youngsters. The conflict persisted for hours and did not subside until 1 a.m. on 11 July. At least three arrests were made, including two retired police officers for common assault. === 13 July Reclaim Sheung Shui === On 13 July, a protest was organised in Sheung Shui for opposing mainland Chinese parallel trading, with 30,000 attendees claimed by the organiser. It was largely peaceful for the first two hours. However, as it went on, the organiser and protesters refused to follow the authorised route, which had Sheung Shui Station as the destination. Instead, they marched on Sheung Shui Plaza, occupied some roads and started clashing with the police who accused them of unlawful assembly, triggering an hours-long standoff which lasted until late night. Hong Kong press watchdogs later complained about police having jostled a handful of journalists. During the skirmishes, a number of dispensaries were vandalised by the protesters because they were thought to be complicit in the mainland Chinese parallel trading. After the riot police resumed traffic by dispersing the crowd, they chased the crowd onto a footbridge leading to Sheung Shui Station, when a young man suddenly attempted to jumped off the footbridge for escape, but was hindered by police from jumping. He was arrested on suspicion of illegal assembly. Legislator Andrew Wan was also hit by a police baton. ===14 July Journalists' silent march=== Protester handing their complaint letter to police representative on 14 July. On 14 July, at 10:30 am, journalists and others in the media industry held a silent march from Harcourt Garden in Admiralty to Police Headquarters in Wan Chai; then on to the Chief Executive Office to protest against police attacks on the press. Journalists at the front of the march held a large banner that read \\"Stop Police Violence, Defend Press Freedom.\\" They called on the Chief Executive to defend press freedom and enforce the Pledge to Uphold Press Freedom decree, which she signed in 2017. The rally was jointly organised by Hong Kong Journalists Association, Hong Kong Press Photographers Association, Independent Commentators Association, Journalism Educators for Press Freedom, as well as staff associations of Ming Pao, Next Media and RTHK. It was attended by approximately 1,500 people. === 14 July Sha Tin march ===  Daytime rally  In addition to hanging vertical protest banners on hills and outside of buildings, Hong Kong protesters also use boats to showcase their vertical protest message horizontally moving along the river. A group called \\"Shatin Commons\\" claimed responsibility for hiring a boat on Shing Mun River to showcase their white-font-on-black fabric demanding the government to \\"Withdraw The Diabolical Bill\\" (「撤回惡法」) on 13 July. The following day in the afternoon, the first anti-extradition bill protest in the New Territories side of Hong Kong was held on 14 July in Sha Tin. The rally started from Chui Tin Street Soccer Pitch near Che Kung Miu at 3:10 pm, passing Hong Kong Heritage Museum, heading to the Sha Tin station Bus Terminus. Protesters chanted \\"all five demands must be fulfilled\\" and \\"Hong Kong police break laws.\\" Sha Tin residents organized a protest carrying two black-and-white contrasting vertical protest banners: the white banner with black words stated \\"Mourning In Pain\\"(「痛心疾首」) and the black banner with white words demanded \\"Withdraw The Diabolical Bill\\" (「撤回惡法」 ). The first batch of protesters arrived at the destination at around 4:45 pm, and the march ended officially at 7:15 pm. The organiser claimed more than 115,000 marchers, while police estimated around 28,000.  Evening clashes  After the march, protesters moved to the streets near Sha Tin Jockey Club Swimming Pool. They set up barricades and threw objects including traffic cones and bottles at police at about 5 pm. Shortly afterwards, around 20 officers responded with pepper-spray. During the stand-off, nearby residents tossed down necessities, including water bottles, umbrellas and cling wrap, to support the protesters. At 6 pm, dozens of officers moved closer to the protesters but kept a distance, while warning the crowd to leave with a loudspeaker. Tension rose when a police officer attempted to remove the mask worn by a protester without showing his warrant card. As the authorisation according to the Letter of No Objection had expired, protesters moved to the nearby shopping mall, New Town Plaza. At 8:55 pm, police warned the crowd that those who did not leave they would face arrest. Ten minutes later, police raised the red warning flag. At 10 pm, police started using pepper spray on some protesters in the plaza. While protesters were trying to leave via MTR, riot police blocked the entrance of the train station from inside the mall. Meanwhile, another group of riot police followed behind protesters as they proceeded to the station engaging in a tactic called \\"kettling – thereby unnecessarily trapping demonstrators\\" – which sparked reactions from cornered protesters. At the same time, MTR Corporation announced that trains would bypass Sha Tin station. Both protesters and bystanders were trapped inside the plaza until the police started letting people enter the railway station later that night. Fearing that other protesters would not being able to leave, some individuals stopped the train's doors from closing to ensure that all protesters could evacuate. After some chaos, at around 11 pm, MTR announced that the service would gradually resume. Protesters then started to leave via MTR and the police started to disperse. Lawmaker Jeremy Tam questioned the need for the police to block the entrance to the train station and bring about conflict which could have been avoided. Pro-democracy lawmaker Au Nok-hin, who was there that night, also asked why demonstrators were given no pathway to leave, and called the policing tactics \\"rubbish.\\" Pro-Beijing lawmakers, on the other hand, claimed demonstrators were perpetrating \\"organised violent acts\\" and stated that \\"no one should insult the police [or] damage their morale.\\" Chief Executive Carrie Lam stated that police \\"exercised restraint when they were being attacked by those whom I describe as 'rioters'.\\" By the end of the night, at least 22 people had been hospitalised, several in critical and serious condition; and at least 40 arrests had been made.

Night of 14 July. === 15 and 16 July accountability protests === Following the Sunday night clashes with police at New Town Plaza, on Monday evening about 100 demonstrators and local residents gathered at the mall to petition property owners about their responsibility and participation in the previous night's events. Activists surrounded the customer service desk to demand answers from Sun Hung Kai Properties. On Tuesday, several hundred people turned up again and demanded answers, accusing property owners of assisting police in the raid that led to numerous hospitalisations and arrests. Protesters chanted \\"shame on Sun Hung Kai for selling out Hongkongers\\"; many also walked through the mall and created Lennon Walls with post-it note messages containing their grievances. In a Facebook post, mall management denied involvement, saying they had not invited police onto the premises. === 15 July hunger strikers' march === On the evening of 15 July, a dozen hunger strikers (many of whom had been on strike for over 12 days), along with 2,400 protesters marched from Admiralty Centre to the Chief Executive's official residence – Government House. They called for the protesters' five demands to be answered and requested dialogue with Carrie Lam. While waiting for an audience with Lam, demonstrators created a post-it note Lennon Wall along the Government House complex walls. After waiting for over an hour, democracy activists left by about 11 pm, and marched back to Admiralty Centre. Carrie Lam did not make an appearance. === 17 July elderly march === Elderly marching on 17 July in support to the youths in the anti- extradition bill protests. A group of seniors, dressed in white, marched from Chater Garden to the Central Government Complex on 17 July 2019. Organisers estimated that 9,000 had participated, while police put the figure as 1,500. During the \\"silver-hair\\" rally organised by Chu Yiu-ming, participants showed their support for the frontline youths. They reiterated the five key demands of the democracy movement and hoped the march would clear the stereotype that all senior citizens held pro-establishment views. Reverend Chu Yiu-ming called on Carrie Lam to \\"repent\\" and urged compassion, asking her to stop dividing society by criminalising young protesters. Demonstrators carried massive vertical protest banners and smaller homemade placards, one of which said 'Children, daddy has come out', and upon reaching government buildings wrote demands onto yellow ribbons and tied them to a metal fence. Another black- with-white fonts vertical protest banner carried by marchers horizontally along the rally stated \\"Against Structural Violence; We Demand Genuine Universal Suffrage\\" (「反對制度暴力 我要真普選」). Actress Deanie Ip also attended, holding a banner that said \\"Support youth to protect Hong Kong.\\" === 21 July march === Social workers silent march Five social workers associations in Hong Kong, including the Hong Kong Social Workers' General Union, staged a silent march on 21 July. The protesters condemned Carrie Lam for ignoring people's demands and shifting the responsibility to resolve social conflicts to counsellors, social workers, and non-governmental organisations. According to organisers, about 4,000 were in attendance, while police cited 1500 in attendance. CHRF march The CHRF announced that the police had approved a march on Sunday, 21 July, from Admiralty to the Court of Final Appeal, despite earlier requests by the police to delay the march till August. The police, fearing the risk of increased violence, stipulated in its letter of no objection that the march would avoid Admiralty and end at Luard Road in Wan Chai, and must end no later than midnight on the basis of public safety and public order – conditions more stringent than those placed on previous marches. The CHRF claimed that 430,000 people attended the protest, while the police put the figure at 138,000. Some protesters advanced beyond the police- mandated endpoint for the protest and marched to the Court of Final Appeal, the intended destination, and to Sheung Wan as the police began to retreat. Major roads and thoroughfares in Admiralty and Central were occupied by protesters, and the water barriers surrounding the Police HQ were turned into a Lennon Wall. Some protesters surrounded the Hong Kong Liaison Office in Sai Ying Pun, threw eggs and black ink at the building, and defaced the Chinese national emblem outside the Office. Another group of demonstrators vandalised the Central Police Station. Scuffles broke out next to Shun Tak Centre. Protesters threw bottles at the police while the police used five rounds of rubber bullets and 55 canisters of tear gas and 24 sponge grenades to disperse the protesters. The government condemned the protesters for besieging the Liaison Office. File:Hong Kong Demonstration 20190721 Causeway Road-1.jpgThe CHRF march in the afternoon.

File:190721 HK Protest Incendo 25.jpgProtesters burned some items during the stand-off.  Yuen Long white-clad gang attack  In the evening, as scuffles in Sheung Wan were taking place, men wearing white shirts and armed with iron bars and wooden clubs gathered in Yuen Long, a town in the New Territories. At around 10 pm, they started indiscriminately attacking people and damaging cars on the street. They were reportedly targeting those wearing black, the dress code for the democracy rally on Hong Kong Island, but also made attacks on journalists and bystanders, including a woman holding a child and a pregnant woman. Soon afterwards, about a hundred white-shirted men, mostly wearing masks, appeared at Yuen Long railway station and indiscriminately attacked people in the concourse, on the platform and inside train compartments. Two police officers who arrived at 10:52 pm left the station as they judged that they were in need of back-up. Thirty police officers arrived at the station at 11:20 pm, but the assailants had left. However, white-shirted assailants returned after midnight to launch a second wave of attacks on passengers; no police officers were present at the scene. Among the injured were Legislative Council member Lam Cheuk-ting and two reporters; another journalist's equipment was also smashed. At least 45 citizens were hospitalised, including three in a serious condition and one in a critical condition. In a statement shortly after midnight, the Hong Kong government condemned both the white- shirted attackers and protesters for their confrontations and injuries despite repeated warnings by police. The local police call centre was overwhelmed by a flood of calls between 10 pm and midnight. According to The Washington Post as many as 24,000 emergency calls were placed regarding the incidents that night. Yoho Mall, the shopping mall next to Yuen Long station had also apparently failed to reach the police. The hundreds that turned up at a police station near Yuen Long to report the incident found the door shuttered. Overnight, the police confronted the mobsters in Nam Pin Wai Village and confiscated several steel bars, though no arrest was made due to the lack of evidence. Following these incidents, various news media published video documentaries detailing the timeline of the attacks. The tactic of using gangsters to silence protest is well known in mainland China, where local authorities hire thugs to deal with both petitioners and residents unwilling to leave their homes. The delayed police response to reports of violence was heavily criticised by activists and legislators. Officials blamed the delay on staffing constraints due to protests elsewhere while Legislator Eddie Chu said there was \\"clear collusion between police and the gangs.\\" Police officials denied the allegations and Chief Executive Carrie Lam said accusations of co-operation with gangsters were \\"groundless\\" and \\"insulting\\". These attacks appeared to repeat the pattern of Triad attacks seen during the 2014 Umbrella Movement, when there was also a lack of timely police response. On the following day, 30 protesters demonstrated at Yuen Long police station to condemn the attacks and the delayed police response, the alleged collusion between police and triad gangs. Hundreds of social workers then marched to the same police station to report the violence. Legislator Junius Ho's alleged involvement in the attacks prompted protesters to trash his office in Tsuen Wan. On 26 August, two men were charged and held without bail in relation to the Yuen Long attacks. Of the 30 people who had been arrested, with some of the alleged to have links to organised crime syndicates, only four individuals were charged as suspects. Court hearings were scheduled to begin on 25 October. === 26 July airport sit- in === The sit-in protest in the arrival hall of the Hong Kong International Airport on 26 July. A sit-in, organised in the arrival hall of Hong Kong International Airport by airline industry workers, airport staff, and the Cathay Pacific Flight Attendants' Union, aimed to engage with arriving tourists and raise awareness about the on-going democracy movement. Before the sit-in, the Airport Authority removed some seats to provide more space to the protesters, and marked out areas where loitering was not allowed. Additional security and staff were deployed. Thousands of protesters gathered in the arrival halls of Terminal 1. Dressed in black, they handed out leaflets and pamphlets to tourists in several languages, including Japanese and simplified Chinese, while chanting \\"Welcome to Hong Kong, stay safe\\" and \\"free Hong Kong.\\" A television monitor showed police action toward protesters in previous demonstrations, and the Yuen Long violence. A Lennon Wall allowed protesters to leave their own supportive messages. A petition collected more than 14,000 signatures from aviation workers, tourists and residents, demanding police arrest those who participated in the Yuen Long violence and asking for an independent inquiry into the allegedly excessive force used by police. === 27 July Reclaim Yuen Long === Despite a police ban on the rally, thousands turned up on 27 July to protest the violent mob attack in Yuen Long the previous Sunday. Prior to the protest, a man was arrested for the stabbing of a pro- democracy activist dressed in black. The protesters marched on the main roads in Yuen Long, and surrounded the Yuen Long police station. Leonard Cheng, the president of Lingnan University, joined the march as an observer and became the first university chief to attend a protest since the Umbrella Revolution in 2014. The organisers claimed an attendance of about 288,000. To disperse the protesters, the police fired tear gas in a primarily residential area and in the evening, the stand-offs between the protesters and the police escalated into violent clashes inside Yuen Long station. ===28 July protest === Protesters in Chater Garden on 28 July. The day before protests, police approved a sit-in at Chater Garden, a public park in Central, but banned the demonstration to be held in Sheung Wan. On 28 July, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in the park and marched on the streets towards Causeway Bay and Sai Wan in defiance of police restrictions. They chanted in Cantonese: \\"Hong Kong police, knowingly break the law\\" () and \\"Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times\\" (). Police firing tear gas to protesters in Sheung Wan on 28 July. Protesters arrived at Hennessy Road, outside Sogo Hong Kong, and constructed barricades. At the same time, a smaller group of about 200 protesters headed west towards the Liaison Office of the Central Government. Police and riot-police arrived shortly after, warning protesters of \\"unlawful assembly.\\" At night, the stand-off evolved into violent clashes. Police fired numerous rounds of tear gas, rubber bullets, sponge grenades and pepper spray to disperse protesters. Police stated that protesters removed railings from streets, threw bricks, set fire to items, pushed a metal cart with papers on fire, and used a Y-shaped catapult to shoot metal balls at police. At least 16 people were injured and 49 were arrested for rioting and possessing offensive weapons. ===30 and 31 July solidarity rallies === Lau Cha Kei pointed his gun against citizens in Kwai Chung on 30 July 2019. On 30 July hundreds of protesters gathered outside of the Kwai Chung Police Station after news spread that a majority of the 49 people arrested during confrontations with police on Sunday at Sheung Wan would be charged with rioting – an offence punishable by ten years in prison. Police used pepper spray and batons to disperse the crowd. One police officer who had been surrounded was seen pointing a gun loaded with beanbag rounds at protesters. Police said that the officer was \\"protect[ing] his life and personal safety\\". Similar solidarity protests occurred that night at Tin Shui Wai police station, where hundreds had gathered to support two young people who were arrested during an altercation at a Lennon Wall. During the demonstration, fireworks were launched out of a moving vehicle into the assembled crowd. At least 10 were injured in the attack. Three men were arrested two weeks after the attack. On 31 July demonstrators gathered at the Eastern District Court to support the 44 people due to face rioting charges. Amnesty International released a statement, calling the definitions of illegal assembly and rioting under Hong Kong law \\"so broad they fall far short of international standards\\" and further stated that \\"individuals facing these sweeping charges would [not] have a fair chance of defending themselves at trial.\\" A group of local prosecutors also released a public letter, asserting that the decision to prosecute was politically motivated because it failed the two criteria of whether there was adequate evidence and a reasonable prospect of conviction, or whether it was in line with public interest. ==Counter-protests== On 15 July, dozens of protesters from ten Pro-Beijing groups including the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB) held a demonstration in support of the Police and condemned the protesters for violently attacking the police. On 17 July 70 members from the DAB and Politihk Social Strategic including lawmakers Ann Chiang, Elizabeth Quat, Wilson Or and Junius Ho Kwan-yiu held demonstrations outside the Wan Chai Police Station to express their support for the police, urge them to rethink their operations when dealing with ongoing protests and called the government to ban protests until September. On 18 July, around 30 supporters from the Pro-Beijing organisation of The Friends of Hong Kong Association held a demonstration outside the Wan Chai police's headquarters to show their support. They also donated 10 million Hong Kong dollars to the police welfare fund. On 19 July 20 members from the pro-Beijing group, the Justice Alliance led by Leticia Lee held a demonstration out the Police Headquarters, where they delivered 10,000 juice boxes to the police and called on officers to \\"show no mercy\\" to protesters. On 20 July, a demonstration organised by pro-Beijing coalition Safeguard Hong Kong Alliance occurred at Tamar Park to show solidarity for the police and support for the extradition bill. The organisers claimed that 316,000 attended, while police cited 103,000. Chan Pak-cheung, Maria Cordero, Elsie Leung and Maria Tam, former police chief Tang King-shing, and pro-Beijing legislators Regina Ip and Starry Lee attended and took turns giving speeches on the stage. == References == Category:2019 in Hong Kong Category:Timeline of the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests ","title":"Timeline of the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests (July 2019)"},{"id":"61531740","text":"Jan Komasa (born October 28, 1981) is a Polish film director, screenwriter, and producer best known for directing Suicide Room (2011), Warsaw 44 (2014), and Corpus Christi (2019), which was nominated for the Best International Feature Film at the 92nd Academy Awards.

Several of the peaceful daytime protests were held by social groups such as families, the elderly, and various professions, showing that the movement, which had centered around the five demands, had garnered a breadth of support that went considerably beyond that of the Umbrella Movement. On 5 August, a general strike was held. On that day and in other instances, peaceful protests gave way to scenes of violence, mostly occurring at night. In some instances, white-shirted armed groups were attacking protesters and even passersby caught up in the conflict, although not at the scale of the Yuen Long violence of 21 July. Protesters aimed at drawing international attention through extended sit-ins at the airport. There and elsewhere, an eye injury of a female protester who had served as frontline medical staff became an iconic label of the protests. At the airport protests, a mainland journalist was violently tackled by protesters to whom he had not revealed his identity. Protesters later apologised for this incident, calming suddenly rising tensions within the movement and also satisfying some, though not all, pro-establishment lawmakers. Heavy-handed police tactics, which included the first use of water cannons and live warning shots, only served to fan the protests continuing throughout the city. Lam would announce the full withdrawal of the bill on 4 September, a step which she appeared to have suggested earlier to the central government but met with rejection. The Chinese government upped its public rhetoric regarding the protests, and while international observers considered it unlikely that mainland armed forces would intervene, the observation of military vehicles in a stadium across the border in Shenzhen led some observers to think otherwise. The Prince Edward station attack on 31 August caused attitudes of protesters and their supporters towards the police to become even more damningly negative. It also strengthened beliefs that the police was being used by the local government as a tool to handle the political root causes of the protests. == Events == === 1 and 3 August rallies ===  Financial sector  On the night of 1 August, hundreds of staff from about 80 different financial institutions participated in a flash mob rally at Chater Garden in Admiralty. Protesters were also concerned about incidents of alleged police collusion with triad gangsters and demanded respect for rule of law. At least 700 financial sector workers have posted images of staff cards in support of the upcoming 5 August city-wide general strike. The organiser stated 4,300 attended the flash-mob.  Medical sector  Medical professionals in the rally on 2 August, with the banner \\"Condemn police obstructing rescue operation\\" in Chinese. On the evening of 2 August, medical professionals held a rally at Edinburgh Place, Central. President of the Hong Kong Public Doctors' Association spoke critically of arrests being made inside hospitals while people are seeking treatment, and also spoke out about excessive use of tear gas by police against democracy activists. Organisers estimated 10,000 medical professionals attended the rally. This was the third medical sector protest in a week. About 1,500 health care specialists had previously assembled at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Yau Ma Tei to raise concerns about the coordinated attacks of 21 July that occurred in Yuen Long MTR station. Medical students and graduates also held an assembly in the Chinese University of Hong Kong on 26 July. About 1000 people joined the assembly according to the organisers.  Civil servants  Civil servant rally on 2 August. Shortly after the medical sector rally began at Edinburgh Place, another rally had also started in Chater Garden held by thousands of civil servants. By 6:45 pm the park was already overflowing with people, prompting police to close nearby Chater Road to traffic. Former chief secretary Anson Chan and former Secretary for the Civil Service Joseph Wong both urged an independent inquiry into police misconduct and defended freedom of expression, questioning the validity of Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung's warning about the risks of joining the rally and \\"breaching the principle of political neutrality.\\" Wong stated, \\"The first line [of the civil service code], which I wrote, is to safeguard the rule of law. Rule of law is higher than our loyalty to any official, any chief executive. No one is above it.\\" Musician and activist Denise Ho also spoke at the rally, and encouraged broad participation at the upcoming 5 August general strike. Ho said that there was safety in numbers, and that the government is more likely to respond to continuous pressure and indefinite strike actions. While police estimated attendance of 13,000, the organiser claimed 40,000 civil servants participated at the rally. === Ma On Shan police station blockades ===  1 August  On 1 August, a police station in Ma On Shan was surrounded by a large number of protesters demanding the release of demonstrators facing riot charges from the previous week's protest. Photos show protesters hurling bricks that were dug out from pavements towards the police station, shattering windows. At around 3:50 am, riot police cleared away the protesters.  2 August  On 2 August, hundreds gathered in response to police raids and arrests made for possession of protest supplies. At 11 pm, a crowd assembled near the Sha Tin police station and constructed barricades. By 1 am the protest shifted to the Ma On Shan police station, after word was received that the eight arrested individuals were being held there. Activists attempted to pry open the metal shutters, vandalised building walls, and removed the \\"Ma On Shan Police Station\\" sign. Riot police arrived on the scene and by 3:15 am the crowds had dispersed.  3 August  On 3 August, democracy activists again returned to Ma On Shan police station for the second consecutive night. They demanded the release of the eight arrested protesters, including pro-independence activist Andy Chan Ho-tin, who had been arrested the day before during a police raid on a building in Fo Tan and charged on suspicion of offensive weapons. The group of about 100 protesters banged on the metal shutters, threw hell money to curse the officers inside, and some painted graffiti messages such as \\"liberate Hong Kong\\" and \\"all consequences are at your own risk.\\" Riot police began clearing the crowds at 10:45 pm. The police attempted to enter Park Belvedere, a private residential building, angering both protesters and residents. The police also allegedly threw pepper bombs at people on a bridge. === 3 August protests === A planned and approved march started from Anchor Street Playground at 3:30 pm. Protesters in the front of the rally held a banner that read \\"Police have too much power\\" (); a popular slogan for the day was \\"Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our time\\". Marchers urged people to join in the general strike on 5 August. The front of the rally arrived at Cherry Street park at 5 pm, but some protesters did not follow the designated route, and headed directly to Mong Kok and Tsim Sha Tsui instead; other protesters first arrived at the park and then followed on to Mong Kok and Tsim Sha Tsui. At around 6:30 pm, protesters moved barricades into the toll plaza of the Cross-Harbour Tunnel in Hung Hom, blocking vehicles and then disappeared. Around 9:30 pm, riot police fired tear gas on protesters in both Tsim Sha Tsui and Mong Kok. Several arrests were made. A small group of protesters also removed the Chinese flag near the Star Ferry pier in Tsim Sha Tsui and threw it into Victoria Harbour. After having received multiple shots of tear gas, protesters moved to the police station at Wong Tai Sin, then left via MTR. Riot police followed and arrested several alleged protesters in the Wong Tai Sin Station. However, the presence of riot police officers angered nearby residents, who requested police to release those arrested and leave the district. They threw umbrellas and set off fire extinguishers. Shortly after, police officers fired tear gas at residents to disperse the crowd, which then went to protest at the nearby police station and Disciplined Services quarters. Dormitory residents showered residents and protesters with sticks, glass bottles and firecrackers from the building. After multiple shots of tear gas, protesters retreated and occupied Lung Cheung Road, then dispersed after. At the same time, multiple protesters surrounded Mong Kok Police Station. Riot police also arrived shortly and arrested protesters. Some of those arrested stated that they were only passers-by or local residents, and not protesters. Two foreign nationals, a Filipino and a South Korean, were arrested by authorities who suspects their involvement in the protest. The Filipino was Hong Kong Disneyland employee who was wearing black at the time of his arrest and the South Korean a restaurant worker. This is believed to be the first arrests of expatriates since the escalation of the protest in June. Protesters in Causeway Bay on 4 August. === 4 August protests === The demonstrations on 4 August began with a permitted march in Tseung Kwan O, starting from Po Tsui Park at 2 pm, with organisers stating around 150,000 protesters in attendance. During the rally, protesters threw bricks towards the police station breaking windows. They chanted \\"Hong Kong police knowingly break the law\\" and \\"Shame on the corrupt police\\". Police officers then appeared with police dogs and protesters dispersed. At night, the crowds occupied Po Shun Road. Riot police arrived to disperse crowds, and they unreasonably attacked a passer-by. Another rally appeared in Kennedy Town after the Tseung Kwan O rally. By the evening, protesters defied the police ban and marched towards Sheung Wan. However, by about 7 pm police deployed tear gas canisters and routed the group to Causeway Bay, where thousands of protesters setup blockades and occupied areas of the shopping district. Then again by 10 pm riot police attempted to clear the streets with the use of tear gas. Near the end of the Kennedy Town protest, some protesters went and blocked the Cross-Harbour Tunnel and a small group of protesters sprayed graffiti on the sculpture at the Golden Bauhinia Square. At the same time, a group of protesters gathered at Wong Tai Sin police station, protesting their way of force to the residents in the 3 August protest. Fearing that the police may deploy heavy force following 3 August scuffles, some protesters opted to occupy sections in Ngau Tau Kok and Kwun Tong. At night, various protests and police operations were done in Mei Foo, Wong Tai Sin, Tin Shui Wai, Ma On Shan, and Lam Tin. Eastern Harbour Crossing and Tseung Kwan O Tunnel were temporarily blocked during the protests. === 5 August general strike === There was a city-wide general strike on 5 August, with protests and sit-ins in different districts. The Cross-Harbour Tunnel was affected by street blockades, major roadways were obstructed and train lines stalled, as thousands of workers across 20 different sectors participated, putting pressure on the government to meet protesters' demands. At least seven major rallies and organising assemblies were held throughout areas of Hong Kong. The main rallies took place in Tamar Park in Admiralty, Sha Tin Town Hall, Tuen Mun Park, Discovery Park in Tsuen Wan, Wong Tai Sin Square, MacPherson Playground in Mong Kok and Tin Hau Temple Fung Shui Square in Tai Po. Workers from various industries as well as several trade unions had announced in advance that they would join the strike. The government of Hong Kong issued a statement, urging citizens to not participate in the strike as it would \\"undermine further the local economy that is facing downside risks.\\" Employees at Hong Kong Disneyland announced work stoppages. Many air traffic controllers called in sick, and over 200 flights were cancelled while only one of the airport runways was operational. Carrie Lam held a press conference at 10 am, condemning those who joined the strike, and stated that they are \\"destroying Hong Kong\\". She continued to support the police force and rejected the five demands by protesters. Pro-Beijing legislator Ann Chiang voiced her disappointment towards Lam's speech with a Facebook post, stating that Lam had raised many issues but offered no solutions. Meanwhile, the Hang Seng Index started to drop during Lam's conference and fell 2.9% by the midday break. In the evening, protesters near the North Point neighbourhood and Tsuen Wan were attacked by two groups of stick wielding men, some wearing white shirts and another group in professionally printed blue shirts. The scuffles were brief and unexpected, and similar in nature to the 21 July Yuen Long attacks. However, unlike the Yuen Long attacks, protesters in North Point fought back. Later in the night several police stations were blockaded by protesters and vandalised. Police arrested 148 people by the end of the day. To disperse the protesters, the police force used more than 800 canisters of tear gas, a record number for Hong Kong, in 14 out of 18 districts in Hong Kong. As the police used tear gas in close proximity to many densely populated residential areas, many residents, children, and pets were affected. On 6 August, Chairwoman Carol Ng of the Confederation of Trade Unions (HKCTU) stated: \\"If there is still no proper response from the government ... I presume it is possible to have another strike.\\" The HKCTU helped to organise the 5 August general strike. They estimated 350,000 people had joined the strike. About 290,000 attended protests and rallies city-wide, while the remainder stayed home and away from work that day.

Protesters threw eggs at the police while the police used tear gas to disperse the protesters. Legislator Helena Wong condemned the police over the treatment of the protester, calling the arrest \\"extremely disrespectful of women\\". Responding to the criticism, Yolanda Yu, senior superintendent said that the protester was \\"struggling vigorously\\" and therefore required male police officers to subdue her. === Solidarity protest of laser pointer arrest ===  6 August  Hundreds gathered at Hong Kong Space Museum with their laser pointers in protest of selective legal enforcement and the arrest of Fong. 7 August 2019 In the afternoon of 6 August, Hong Kong Baptist University student union president Keith Fong was arrested in Apliu Street, Sham Shui Po district. Plainclothes officers said that they approached him as \\"he was acting suspiciously\\". Fong ran away but was caught. He was searched and 10 laser pointers, were found in a plastic bag. Fong stated that he purchased those laser pointers for stargazing, while passers-by supported him and chanted \\"release him\\". However, police officers arrested him for \\"possession of offensive weapon\\". Fong then complained of feeling unwell after he was choked by the officers and was taken to Caritas Medical Centre. His parents, along with Baptist University principal Roland Chin and lawyers, went to the hospital to visit him. Chin asked the police ensure students are treated fairly. The student union and other citizens voiced their anger, condemning police for their abuse of power and described it as part of a broader campaign to intimidate and silence democracy activists. They questioned how laser pointers could become an \\"offensive weapon\\", a police representative responded in a press conference that several police officers in previous protests were injured due to laser beams that were pointed at them. At night, around 300 protesters gathered outside Sham Shui Po Police Station, chanting \\"triads\\" and \\"mafia cops.\\" Police fired several tear gas to disperse the crowd, and arrested several protesters, including Sha Tin District Councilor Wong Hok-lai, for \\"unlawful assembly\\".  7 August  Protesters pointing their laser pointer to a newspaper held, mocking the police's demonstration. 6 August 2019 On 7 August, a group of teachers and staff members from HKBU held a press conference supporting Fong and condemning police's excessive force. They stated that the arrest is \\"unexplainable\\" and question the selective police enforcement with \\"unreasonable definition of offensive weapon\\". They also said that the freedom granted by the Basic Law is shaken by the police's action. In a police press conference in the afternoon, police representatives stated that the laser pointers he purchased were in fact \\"laser guns.\\" They attempted to demonstrate the \\"laser gun\\" Fong purchased is able to burn a hole in a paper by pointing it to a black area of a newspaper and holding it steadily for 20 seconds at very short distance. According to Stand News, hundreds of shoppers have since been searching for laser pointers with many shops completely sold out. At night, a group of protesters gathered at Hong Kong Space Museum and shined laser pointers on the wall of the museum, some chanted slogans like \\"laser pointer revolution\\" and joked \\"Is the building on fire yet?\\" They hoped to show support to Fong and voice condemnation of his arrest by police, and to show that laser pointers are neither offensive weapons nor effective enough to cause a fire. Protesters also sang the song \\"I Am Angry\\" from Cantopop band Beyond. Fong was detained 48 hours without any criminal charges, and then released on 8 August. === 7 August lawyers' silent march === Secretary for Justice on 7 August 2019. A silent march by lawyers was staged on 7 August, the second one since 6 June. Around 3,000 legal sector professionals, in black, marched in silence from the Court of Final Appeal in Central to the Department of Justice's office at around 12:45 pm. The group of protesters stated that Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng frequently departed from usual procedures and well-established guidelines, and accused Cheng of bias in selecting prosecution cases. They quoted the difference in prosecuting the arrest of anti-extradition bill protesters as \\"rioting\\", versus prosecuting the arrests in the Yuen Long incident as \\"unlawful assembly.\\" Furthermore, the rioting charges against the anti-extradition bill protesters were fast-tracked ahead of prosecution of the perpetrators of the Yuen Long violence, which occurred weeks before the protesters were arrested. Barrister Kevin Yam stated \\"All we want is justice, all we want is consistency, we don't want to see thugs get away while the best of our youth get prosecuted.\\" They believed that this was the latest evidence of a decline of the rule of law. Campaigners voiced concern over the use of excessive force and asked for an independent commission of inquiry. Teresa Cheng refused to meet the lawyers when they arrived at her office. === 8 August Catholics march === On Thursday night, around 1200 Catholics held a candlelight march through Central before finishing outside the Court of Final Appeal. The march organised by four Christian organisations, called for the government to heed to the protesters demands and called for both sides to exercise restraint, stop the violence and sit down to reach an agreement to help society move forward. === 9–11 August airport sit-ins === A second airport sit-in was held in the Hong Kong International Airport, which continued for three consecutive days. Protesters hoped to gain international support by having a \\"warm welcome.\\" Unlike previous sit-ins, this demonstration was not approved by the Airport Authority. Extra security measures were put in place, with authorities preventing anyone without a boarding pass from entering the check-in area. Thousands gathered in both Terminal 1 and 2 by 6 pm. Dressed in black, democracy activists handed out leaflets and pamphlets to tourists in several languages, including English, Ukrainian, Spanish, and German. A large banner reading \\"Liberate HK\\" was also unfurled from the second floor balcony. Demonstrators chanted and sang Do You Hear the People Sing? Due to the protests, all flights in and out of the airport were cancelled since Monday (12 August). The protest was said to have disrupted as a result of the public assembly at the airport. === 9–14 August Paper-burning protests === A paper-burning protest was held in Wong Tai Sin and Sha Tin, in line with traditional Chinese customs during the Ghost Festival. Protesters burnt joss paper and threw hell money and attempted to light a bundle of incense sticks using laser pointers. They also threw hell money with Carrie Lam's face and a paper doll representing Junius Ho into a burning bin. 5 people were arrested by the police in Wong Tai Sin. Another paper-burning protest was held in Sham Shui Po. Similarly, protesters burnt joss papers and images showing the faces of Carrie Lam and Police Commissioner Stephen Lo outside the Sham Shui Po police station. The protest was largely peaceful. The police then dispersed the protesters by shooting tear gas inside the police building complex and deploying riot police. Another similar protest was held in Tin Shui Wai, in which riot police arrested 5 protesters. === 10 August protests === Two generally peaceful protests occurred on Hong Kong Island. Early in the morning, hundreds of senior citizens marched from Wan Chai police HQ to Chief Executive's Office and handed out petition letters requesting the police to \\"lay down their offensive weapons\\". The protest was followed by a family rally named \\"Guard our children's future\\" in Edinburgh Place. Hundreds of parents showed up with their kids to demand the government to respond to the demands of the protesters. The parents then marched to the Government HQ and displayed banners drawn by children and balloons. Less than a thousand protesters protested in Tai Po in the afternoon despite a police ban on the protest. Protesters gathered in Tai Po bus station and marched past the original destination, Kwong Fuk Road Football Ground. It was generally peaceful. Protesters chanted slogans including \\"liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times\\" and \\"our five demands must all be fulfilled\\", and yelled \\"rubbish\\" and \\"triad\\" at the police. Around 6 pm, as the protesters were surrounded by the police, they moved to Tai Wai and New Town Plaza in Sha Tin and obstructed various locations, though protesters in Tai Wai dispersed after the police used tear gas. The protesters then moved to different districts in Hong Kong, including Kowloon Bay, Kwun Tong, Tsuen Wan, and Wong Tai Sin, but they dispersed before the riot police began to advance. The Cross-Harbour Tunnel was blocked temporarily. In Tsim Sha Tsui, tension rose when a police officer arrested a bystander. Protesters besieged the police station, and the police used tear gas to disperse the protesters.

File:190810 HK Protest Incendo 23.jpgRiot police showing the \\"blue flag\\", warning protesters to disperse. === 11 August protests === Despite a police ban on the protest, thousands marched in the Sham Shui Po region at 2 pm. Demonstrators marched from Maple Street Playground, set up roadblocks on Yam Chow Street, Cheung Sha Wan Road and besieged the Sham Shui Po Police Station. At 5 pm, the police dispersed protesters using tear gas, though some tear gas canisters landed on a pedestrian footbridge nearby, affecting both journalists and residents. Democracy activists moved on and besieged the police station in Tsim Sha Tsui. The police set up a defence line near the Lane Shopper's Boulevard district and fired bean bag rounds that ruptured the right eye of a female protestor. At 8 pm, protesters moved to Kwai Chung and besieged the Kwai Chung police station. Riot police dispersed the protesters. Demonstrators fled to Kwai Fong station and television footage showed police had fired tear gas and several rounds of rubber bullets from inside the station. Some protesters retreated to Mei Foo station and set up roadblocks on Kwai Chung Road, while another group besieged the police station again. Traces of irritant smoke were still found inside Kwai Fong station the following day. MTR Corporation, responding to the incident, said that it was \\"very regretful\\" and urged the police force to consider the safety of its staff and commuters during law enforcement actions. An approved gathering was held in Victoria Park at 1 pm, though the police issued a Letter of Rejection to a protest that was to be held in the Eastern District. However, some protesters occupied major roads and intersections near the Sogo Hong Kong department store in Causeway Bay, while some moved along to Wan Chai, where a molotov cocktail was thrown during clashes with police. Red banners were seen posted throughout the North Point region, calling for Fujianese residents to defend their neighbourhood. Protesters had largely avoided marching to North Point, where democracy activists were previously assaulted by stick-wielding men, allegedly the local Fujianese residents, during the 5 August general strike. However, tensions rose in the region when locals dressed in red attacked two journalists and two other people. Protesters in Causeway Bay on 11 August 2019. In Causeway Bay, several people disguised as protesters were seen and caught on video tackling and arresting other protesters with the help of the police force at 10 pm. Around ten men dressed as protesters were seen and caught on video passing from under a staircase at a tramstop guarded by the police. This led to allegations that the police used undercover officers to infiltrate into the demonstration. When journalists approached one of these men, he refused to show his warrant card and told the press to \\"put down the camera.\\" During a police press conference on 12 August, Deputy Police Commissioner Tang Ping-Keung defended the use of disguised \\"decoy officers\\" and stated: \\"I can say that during the time when our police officers were disguised ... they [did not] provoke anything. We won't ask them to stir up trouble.\\" The violent arrest of a young man was filmed—he was pressed by more than one undercover police officer to the concrete road with so much force on his head that he lost at least one front tooth. The protester is not seen to have been resisting arrest and is heard apologising in the video, begging for mercy, and yet the police rubbed his face on the rough concrete road, leaving him with a blood-covered face. The arrest of another protester, during which a police officer was found putting a stick inside his backpack, was filmed. The police force was accused of planting evidence to frame the protester. The police defended the tactic, saying that the protester had held the stick before he was arrested. Some protesters then moved to Quarry Bay Station and a brief standoff with police followed. The Special Tactical Unit then chased democracy activists down an escalator in Tai Koo Station and fired guns with pepper ball rounds, targeting protesters within a very close range and aiming directly at their heads. Police officers were also filmed by journalists and seen using their batons to beat fleeing protesters. The Civil Rights Observer organisation condemned police actions due excessive use of force and the possibility of causing a stampede. Further conflicts occurred when protesters besieged the Sha Tin police station. Disgruntled by aggressive policing strategies and excessive use of force, residents in Sha Tin, Quarry Bay, Sai Wan Ho, Taikoo Shing, and Whampoa Garden gathered to drive off the police away from their neighbourhoods and homes. In Tsuen Wan, pedestrians were assaulted by men wearing white shirts. By the end of the night, police had made dozens of arrests following the numerous flash-mob style police station blockades and in the many clashes during city-wide street protests that day. The escalation in arrests and new more assertive police tactics come within days of the Hong Kong Police Force bringing back from retirement Alan Lau Yip-shing, a former top officer who oversaw police strategy during the Umbrella Movement and Mong Kok Fishball Revolution. On 8 August, Lau was appointed deputy commissioner on special duty for a period of six months. Beginning on 9 August, Lau met with all top brass to discuss strategy and was charged with assisting the police commissioner to \\"enhance strategic command and oversee [large-scale] public order events.\\" The Hospital Authority reported that due to the events of 11 August, as many as 54 people were being treated for injuries, with two in serious condition. === 12–14 August police brutality protests === The events of 11 August had sparked controversy, as several protesters, including a woman who was allegedly shot in the eye by the police, were seriously injured by police actions that day. A demonstration against police brutality was organised in response and held at the Hong Kong International Airport on 12 August. Sit-ins and roving protests began by 1 pm, as thousands of people turned up to speak out about police violence. Many held signs and chanted slogans such as \\"police go back to China\\" and \\"evil police eye for an eye\\", while some protesters organised mobile \\"Lennon Wall\\" on their bodies during the protests. Due to the large amount of protesters going to the airport, the traffic to the airport was congested. At around 3 pm, the thousands of protesters had exceeded the capacity of the two main arrival halls, and the overflow of incoming protesters then congregated in the departure halls. As many as 5,000 democracy activists may have been involved in the demonstrations. By 4 pm, the Airport Authority announced that all other flights had been cancelled for the rest of the day, except for departure flights that had completed the check-in process, and the arrival flights already heading to Hong Kong. At the same time, there were rumours and news about the arrival of riot police and the clearance of the airport. Most protesters then left, while some stayed with the remaining travellers who were stuck in the airport. On 13 August, protesters demonstrated again at Hong Kong International Airport as the airport reopened following the airport's closure from the day prior. Protesters had used luggage trolleys as physical defence for themselves during Tuesday's protest at the airport. Passengers struggled to get through the airport as protesters had blocked the path to the gating area. As a result of the continued protests, at 4:30 pm, Hong Kong airport officials announced that check-ins were suspended for the remainder of the day at least. Members of British pop rock band The Vamps became stranded at the airport due to the protests. In an interview from the airport with Good Morning Britain on 13 August, the band publicly expressed their support for the protesters. On the same day, protesters cornered a man suspected of being a mainland security officer. The man was severely beaten, and was taken away a few hours later by the police. Shortly afterward, another man with a press vest was questioned by protesters about whether he was truly a reporter. He was seen taking photos of protesters' faces and told protesters he is actually a \\"traveller\\". Protesters gathered around him and requested him to show his press passes, though he refused. Protesters then discovered a blue T-shirt with the words \\"I Love Hong Kong Police\\", which was identical to the shirts attackers wore in an attack before. His Chinese passport, identity card, and diary were also taken. Protesters tied him up and he was then taken away by first-aiders. He was later identified as Fu Guohao, a Global Times journalist. The violence against Fu Guohao has been condemned by the Program Director of Committee to Protect Journalists, Carlos Martinez de la Serna, who stated that \\"Journalists from all outlets must be allowed to cover the demonstrations in Hong Kong without having to fear for their safety.\\" HKJA also condemned the violence and urged reporters from Chinese media outlets to display their credentials clearly to avoid similar incidents from happening again. Protesters offered apologies in the morning of 14 August. On 14 August, the court issued an interim injunction to restrict the protests inside the airport. Some continued to protest but they stayed inside the areas allowed by the Airport Authority.

Medical staff held a banner that read \\"Hong Kong police attempt to murder Hong Kong citizens.\\" A similar protest by medical staff was held that same day at Princess Margaret Hospital in Lai Chi Kok. Another demonstration was held on 13 August, by health care workers in at least 7 public hospitals, including Prince of Wales Hospital, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Queen Mary Hospital, and Tuen Mun Hospital. Demonstrators wore black in solidarity with the on-going democracy movement. Demonstrators covered their right eyes with gauze to support the female protester whose right eye was shot by the police. A doctor at the Tuen Mun Hospital protest stated that these solidarity rallies were a \\"direct response\\" to the shooting of that woman on 11 August. These protests were held during lunch breaks and hospital operations were not affected. On 14 August, hospital staffs from Ruttonjee Hospital and Tang Shiu Kin Hospital joined the protest. A total of 15 public hospitals have held protests since the 11 August incident. On the same day, people wearing red T-shirts harassed the medical staffs at Princess Margaret Hospital, where the injured journalist Fu Guohao was hospitalised. Also on 12 August, a group of front-line medical workers called for an indefinite strike, requesting that the government respond to the five demands of the protest movement. A total of 15 public hospitals have held protests since the 11 August incident. === 16 August rally === The Hong Kong Higher Institutions International Affairs Delegation, an association composed of students from the 12 local universities and colleges, held a rally named \\"Stand with Hong Kong – Power to the People\\" in Charter Garden. Protesters asked the US and the UK to provide assistance and urged both governments to enact sanction on the officials responsible for causing the protests. Exiled activists, including Ray Wong Toi-yeung and Brian Leung Kai-ping recorded video messages for the crowds. Organisers claimed that 60,000 people attended, though the police put the figure at 7,100. === 17 August teachers march === The Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union organised a march named \\"Safeguard the next generation, let our conscience speak\\" to support Hong Kong students and show solidarity to the arrestees. Despite heavy rain, thousands of teacher wearing black marched from Charter Garden to Government House. HKPTU claimed that 22,000 people attended, while the police put the figure at 8,300. === 17 August Reclaim To Kwa Wan-Hung Hom === The protest was initially set to be held on 27 July, though it was later moved to 17 August to prevent clashing with \\"Reclaim Yuen Long\\". The police initially banned the protest, though they approved when it adopted a shorter route. Protesters marched from Hoi Sham Park to Whampoa station to call the government to solve the community issues brought by an excessive number of mainland tourists in the region and condemn police brutality. The branch offices of pro-Beijing parties DAB and HKFTU were vandalised, and protesters hurled eggs at the offices. Protesters placed pineapples, a slang for homemade explosives, outside HKFTU's office, reflecting their role during the Hong Kong 1967 leftist riots. Some protesters marched back to To Kwa Wan and Kowloon City and occupied sections of Ma Tau Wai Road and To Kwa Wan Road. Some protesters also moved to Mong Kok, Jordan and Yau Ma Tei and besieged the Mong Kok police station. Overall, approximately 20,000 joined the rally. === 18 August rally === The Civil Human Rights Front initially applied to hold a march, though only a rally in Victoria Park was approved. The march was called to condemn police brutality and reiterate the five core demands after the 11 August incident. Due to the sheer number of people showing up, MTR's trains skipped Causeway Bay station, Tin Hau station and Fortress Hill station. A massive amount of protesters waited on Hennessy Road, Gloucester Road, and Kings Road for hours to get into the park. At 3:29 pm, former Legislative Councilors Leung Kwok-hung and Lee Cheuk-yan led the protesters towards Charter Garden, Central, the march's original end point, along Hennessy Road in defiance of the police's ban. Protesters soon spilled over onto Yee Wo Street, Pennington Street, Jardine's Bazaar and Lockhart Road. Kowloon Motor Bus was forced to cancel all routes crossing the Cross-Harbour Tunnel. Near the end of the rally, protesters briefly occupied sections of Harcourt Road outside the Government Headquarters, though some protesters called the people who stayed to go home to ensure that the protest can end peacefully. According to CHRF, 1.7 million protesters attended the rally and an additional estimated 300,000 protesters marched between Central and Causeway Bay, but could not enter the park due to overcrowding. The police put the figure at 128,000 at peak of those only in Victoria Park football areas. According to Bonnie Leung, CHRF's vice convenor, the high turnout rate had \\"revitalized\\" the campaign against the extradition law, and that should Carrie Lam not respond to protesters' demands, her administration will face tougher and more radical measures from protesters. The association also intended to apply for a judicial review questioning the police ban, which it regarded as unjustifiable. The government recognised that the protest was largely peaceful, though it criticised the marchers for inconveniencing the public as they occupied major roads on Hong Kong Island during the march.

Protesters sat silently in the station, and stood up for a moment of silence every hour. Some protesters also covered their right eyes to remember the victim whose right eye was ruptured during the 11 August protest. Protesters and the police began a brief stand-off near the end of the sit-in. Protesters sprayed a firehose and threw soaps on the floor while making makeshift blockades to slow police's advance. Both protesters and the police retreated peacefully later. === 22 August secondary school students demonstration === At Edinburgh Place in Central, near City Hall, thousands of secondary school students gathered to oppose the extradition bill legislation. Near the end of the rally, many students chanted \\"September 2, class boycott!\\" in reference to the planned strikes set to begin on the first day of classes. === 23 August accountants march === In the afternoon, around 5,000 accountants marched silently from Charter Garden to the Government HQ. The march, organised by pan-democratic Legislative Councilor Kenneth Leung, was the first march since 1997 that involved accountants. PwC allegedly offered free lunch to employees to prevent them from attending the march. === 23 August \\"The Hong Kong Way\\" === On the evening of 23 August, an estimated 210,000 people participated in \\"The Hong Kong Way\\" campaign, to draw attention to the movement's five demands. The action was inspired by a similar event that occurred in the Baltic States 30 years ago. Participants assembled at 7 pm on pavements along the three main MTR lines in Hong Kong – the Tsuen Wan line, Kwun Tong line and Island line — and to hold hands, creating three human chains totalling 50 kilometres long, stretching across both sides of Hong Kong harbour. More than 1,000 trail runners and hikers also scaled Lion Rock, a landmark that symbolises to many the spirit of Hong Kong and lighted their trail with torches.

On 24 August, a protest was held in Kwun Tong to oppose the extradition bill, however the primary theme of the march was to resist government installed surveillance equipment. The protest was initially banned by the police, though the ban was lifted after the route of the protest was changed. Thousands of people marched from Tsun Yip Street Playground to the Zero Carbon Building in Kowloon Bay. During the march, protesters expressed concerns about recently installed smart lampposts enabled with facial recognition and video surveillance capabilities. Many worried that the lampposts would be used to further restrict freedom in Hong Kong, as China continues to tighten its grip. During the protest, one of these smart lampposts was knocked down and dismantled. At around 4:15 pm, protesters began to occupy sections of Wai Yip Street near Ngau Tau Kok Police Station and hurled objects at the police, while the police responded by using tear gas, beanbag rounds and pepper balls to disperse the protesters. Some protesters then retreated to Telford Garden and sprayed water hose at officers, and the police used tear gas and sponge grenade in return. Kwun Tong Road was briefly occupied by both the police and the protesters. At night, protesters moved to Wong Tai Sin, Lok Fu and Sham Shui Po. Before the protest began, MTR suddenly announced that stations between the proposed march area, Choi Hung station and Tiu Keng Leng station, would be closed, and claimed the move was necessary to protect MTR facilities and staff safety. Many criticised this decision as an act to restrict freedom of protest, and that by closing these stations, MTR had caused greater disturbance to the public. MTR also arranged special trains for the officers. Protesters criticised MTR for co-operating with the police and called it the \\"railway of the Communist Party\\". Following the Kwun Tong protest, Richland Gardens's management suddenly changed the passcodes for all buildings. People wearing black and residents who were not carrying their resident card could not enter their homes. Disgruntled residents then surrounded the management office. Security guards called the police, who arrested two residents and used pepper spray on the crowds. The march's organiser, Ventus Lau, was arrested for \\"unlawful assembly\\" after the protest, even though the police had approved the march. The day after the Hong Kong Way human chain peaceful protest event, two black-with-white-font 15-meters long banners were put up over night on Lion Rock. One reads \\"Evil Police Brutality \\" (「黑警濫暴」) and the other says \\"This Regime Kills\\" (「殺人政權」). === 25 August Tsuen Wan protest === The march was held in the Kwai Tsing District and the Tsuen Wan District. Similar to the Kwun Tong protest, the police lifted the ban after the organisers changed the route of the protest. On 25 August, thousands of protesters marched from Kwai Chung Sports Ground to Tsuen Wan Park. MTR also closed Kwai Fong station, Tsuen Wan station and Tsuen Wan West station temporarily. Near Yeung Uk Road, some protesters occupied a section of Yeung Uk Road and created makeshift roadblocks. The police used tear gas to disperse protesters, who threw petrol bombs. The police also deployed two specialised crowd management vehicles equipped with water cannon, firing it twice in the span of one hour. This was the first time the trucks were deployed. The march ended abruptly, but the protests spread to different districts around the city. Several protestors damaged a Fujianese owned mahjong school in Yi Pei Square, claiming the school are associated with a previous knife attack in Tsuen Wan on 5 August. The first usage of live bullets during the protests occurred on this day. During an incident where multiple police officers were being chased and attacked by a crowd of protesters with makeshift weapons, one police officer fell on the ground, and another police officer fired a warning shot at the sky. More guns were drawn by the police and pointed to protesters and journalists, but they did not fire again and later retreated. Police later explained that they had no choice after being surrounded by protesters, but some residents questioned whether their action was necessary. One man with an umbrella knelt in front of an advancing police officer who had drawn a gun, in an effort to persuade the officer not to shoot. The man was kicked by the officer. Hong Kong police had responded by saying that the officer used his leg to \\"push him away\\". The protest later spread to Tsim Sha Tsui, Cross-Harbour Tunnel, Sham Shui Po and Wong Tai Sin. For both marches in Kwun Tong and Tsuen Wan, the police had used 215 canisters of tear gas, 74 rubber bullets, 44 sponge grenades and four bean bag rounds.

File:Hong Kong protests - Tsuen Wan March - 20190825 - IMG 20190825 180613.jpgStandoff between protesters and the police at Yeung Uk Road === 25 August Police Relatives Connection protest === At the same time as the protests in Tsuen Wan, the Police Relatives Connection, a group claiming to represent relatives of members of the police force, staged a march from Edinburgh Square in Central to the Chief Executive's Office in Admiralty to give a letter outlining their own version of the \\"five demands\\". Their demands were for Lam to respond to public demands, senior police commanders to plan operations to minimise clashes, establish a platform for dialogue between the force and the public, for officers to remain disciplined, and to create an independent inquiry into police misconduct (a key demand of the protests). However, due to a lack of response, they submitted their letter at police headquarters in Wan Chai, where they also expressed appreciation for officers' efforts to preserve order, recited the force's passing out oath, and criticised police brutality. Organisers claimed that 400 people marched, while police counted 270. They said that the police were drawn into a political problem and admitted some police officers lost control of their emotions while performing their duties. === 28 August aviation industry rally === Protesters gathered in Edinburgh Place against Cathay Pacific on 28 August 2019. As of 28 August 20 aviation staff professionals had been sacked or had resigned after Beijing exerted pressure on companies to crack down on the anti-government movement. Demonstrators gathered in Edinburgh Place, Central around 4 pm to support Rebecca Sy On-na, a 17-years employee of Cathay Dragon and chairwoman of the 2,000-member Dragon Airlines Flight Attendants Association over her Facebook posts and to protest against the airline's alleged political persecution and white terror towards employees linked to the protest movement. The protesters later marched to Pacific Place, a luxury shopping centre that houses the headquarters of Swire Pacific, the majority shareholder in Cathay Pacific Airways. The rally was organised by Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions, which stated around 2000 attended, while Police stated 730 attended. === 28 August #MeToo rally === On the evening of 28 August, a #MeToo gathering was held in Chater Garden to protest alleged police misconduct during a strip- search of a female arrestee. Thousands attended the demonstration, and the woman involved in the incident appeared on stage to address the crowd. The slogan of the event was \\"Stop Hong Kong police's use of sexual violence.\\" Several weeks prior, in early August, police were similarly accused of violating the rights of another woman while taking her into custody.

The screenings were mostly held outdoors. Evgeny Afineevsky, the director of the short film, previously wrote a letter of support for the Hong Kong activists. As the anti-extradition protests continued, more hill-top vertical protest banners were put out to show solidarity with those who were arrested. The yellow eight-meter long vertical protest banner read \\"Redress Riot, Release Chivalry\\" (「平反暴動釋放義士」). === 30 August social workers protest === The Anti-extradition Bill Social Welfare Alliance, a group made up of dozens of social workers, protested outside the Social Welfare Department in the afternoon demanding more protection and support. They stated that they attend protests to offer humanitarian support to young participants, and to help people leave safely. Despite this program of peaceful social outreach, the police have arrested many of their colleagues on suspicion of taking part in illegal assemblies. === 30 August animal lovers rally === Hundreds of animal lovers turned up in the evening at Chater Garden in Central to urge the police to stop using tear gas because of the harmful impact it has on pets, strays, and even police dogs. The participants stated they are extremely concerned about the deployment of tear gas, saying it is unclear how the toxic chemicals would affect nearby animals since the animals’ sense of smell is much more acute than that of humans, and it stands to reason that they would be more seriously affected when exposed to chemical crowd control agents. === 31 August protest === Hong Kong police storm Prince Edward station and attack protesters on 31 August 2019 Following a police ban on a protest applied by the Civil Human Rights Front and the arrests of several high-profile activists including Agnes Chow and Joshua Wong, and pan- democratic Legislative Councilors including Jeremy Tam, Au Nok-hin and Cheng Chung-tai, hundreds of thousands protesters defied the police's ban and joined a Christian march in Wan Chai, while others occupied major roads in Causeway Bay. Some protesters besieged government headquarters and threw bricks and petrol bombs, whereas the police used tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon trucks, which sprayed coloured liquid on protesters for easy identification. Protesters later set up a line of defence near the Police Headquarters at Hennessy Road by starting a huge fire, though it was extinguished by a water cannon truck. Protesters soon retreated back to Causeway Bay and Tin Hau, where undercover cops arrested several protesters. One of the undercover cops also fired a warning shot inside Victoria Park. The remaining protesters soon spread to Kwun Tong, Mong Kok and Tsim Sha Tsui. See also: 2019 Prince Edward Station attack After a quarrel between some protesters and several middle-aged men inside Prince Edward station, a group of Special Tactical Squad officers rushed into the train cabin and assaulted both protesters and commuters who were inside, beating them with batons and releasing pepper-spray. According to witnesses, police simply stormed the station and beat the people inside without making any arrests, and police were accused of continued and excessive force against passengers who were not resisting. Police also chased and beat citizens inside Yau Ma Tei station. MTR later suspended services on five of its lines. The police assault on passengers inside various MTR stations sparked anger from nearby citizens who then besieged the Mong Kok police station. Residents besieged the Chai Wan Police Married Quarters after the arrest of District Councilor Chui Chi-kin, though they dispersed after the police fired tear gas. Protesters also damaged the gates inside Hang Hau station. On 1 September, Amnesty International released a statement calling for an investigation into police conduct during the events of 31 August in which police beat and pepper-sprayed people aboard an MTR train at Prince Edward station. According to Tam Man-kei, Director of Amnesty International Hong Kong, the behaviours of the police on that day \\"fell far short of international policing standards\\" and he described the police's operation as a \\"rampage\\". Convenor of the pan-democratic camp, Claudia Mo, called the incident a \\"licensed terror attack\\" as the police injured innocent bystanders. Hilltop vertical protest banners: On the five- year anniversary of Beijing's refusal to grant universal suffrage to Hong Kong as guaranteed by the Hong Kong Basic Law, two yellow vertical protest banners showed up on Beacon Hill. They were about 15-meters long and demanded \\"We Demand Genuine Universal Suffrage\\" (「我要真普選」) and \\"Retract August 31 Decision\\" (「撤回人大831」). 831金鐘 15.jpgProtesters marching in the roads in Hong Kong Island. 831金鐘 01.jpgPolice using blue-dye water canon to disperse and identify protesters. 831金鐘 05.jpgProtesters with umbrellas when being dispersed by tear gas. 831銅鑼灣 01.jpgPolice shooting tear gas canisters. 831銅鑼灣 03.jpgFire created by protesters as a line of defence. ==Counter- demonstrations== During the afternoon of 2 August, around 40 people from three pro-Beijing groups including New Millenarian, called for the sacking of any civil servants who will join the protest rally in the evening, stating those who join are violating the principle of political neutrality. Around 100 protesters gathered outside the US consulate general on 3 August to condemn alleged US interference in Hong Kong internal affairs. On the same day, another larger rally occurred in Victoria Park organised by Politihk Social Strategic. It called for an end to the violence and support for the Hong Kong Police, with Junius Ho taking stage to give speeches. While police estimated 26,000, the organisers claimed that 90,000 people took part in the event. On 6 August, around 40 supporters from the DAB and Hong Kong Fujian Women Association held a rally outside Police HQ in Wan Chai to show support for the Police in dealing with anti-government protesters. On 8 August, about 30 Pro- Beijing protesters gathered in Tsim Sha Tsui Star Ferry Pier, and demanded that those who threw the national flag into the sea be brought to justice for insulting the national flag and emblem. At the same time, 100 supporters from Politihk Social Strategic held a rally outside the Wan Chai Police headquarters, demanding the suspended extradition law bill to be resurrected and an inquiry into whether pro-democracy lawmakers have been instigating the recent protests, which they called \\"riots\\". On 10 August, three pro-police rallies organised by Safeguard Hong Kong Alliance took place. Around 300 people gathered at Central Police Station in Sheung Wan to show their support, while 50 supporters gathered outside Kwun Tong Police Station and 245 people from the Hong Kong Fujian Association showed up in North Point. On 11 August, outside of Toronto in Markham, Ontario, Canada, a solidarity protest occurred in support for the Hong Kong Police, Hong Kong Government and the Chinese government, promoting the theme of 'Supporting Stable and Prosperous Peace, Hong Kong and China will be better tomorrow'. On 14 August, dozens of protesters gathered outside the Hong Kong Journalists Association headquarters for their perceived lack of response to a Global Times reporter being beaten up at the Hong Kong Airport by anti-extradition bill protesters. However the Hong Kong Journalist Association did issue a statement expressing regrets that the mainland media reporters were blocked when they filmed the demonstrators and condemned the violence against journalists. To avoid any misunderstandings, journalists should to clearly display their press badges when interviewing large-scale demonstrations in Hong Kong to facilitate the public's identification. The public can also exercise their rights to decide whether to accept interviews and filming by relevant organisations. On 16 August, about 20 supporters from pro-police group Protect Hong Kong League urged the Hospital Authority to ban medical staff from wearing surgical masks at work. They claim that the use of surgical masks reminds the police of recent protesters, impeding police's enforcement of law and causing conflict inside government institutions. On 17 August, a pro-government rally organised by the Safeguard Hong Kong Alliance occurred in Tamar Park. Organisers said 476,000 people including pro-government politicians and business leaders joined the demonstration, but police stated only 108,000 attended. Over the 16–18 August weekend, protests in support of China and the Hong Kong Police took place in Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, London, Paris, Vancouver, Toronto and Calgary. On 24 August, a protest against RTHK's allegedly biased reporting took place outside RTHK headquarters in Kowloon Tong. The protest was organised by Politihk Social Strategic, which claimed 10,000 people were in attendance, while police stated only 1200 were present. They claimed RTHK engaged in biased reporting, and that it should represent the voice of the government as it is Hong Kong's public broadcaster. The protesters later engaged in scuffles with the media reporting the protest as they surrounded individual reporters and photographers, hitting cameras and throwing punches. The Hong Kong Press Photographers Association and Hong Kong Journalists Association condemned the violent behaviour of protesters during the rally. However no arrests were made. Politihk Social Strategic chairman Tang Tak- shing claimed that the journalists at the scene had provoked protesters. On 28 August, around 50 people from the pro-Beijing group, Real Hongkongers' View held a rally outside HK government buildings in Admiralty. They called on the government to introduce a law banning face masks at protests, following the example of France, stating that violent protesters needed to stop hiding their identities with masks and be held responsible. On 29 August, around 40 members from the DAB and HKFTU held a rally calling for the government to introduce an anti-mask law saying it would help end violent protests in the city. The DAB stated \\"overseas studies showed that people were more likely to take violent action when they were masked\\", while HKFTU stated the law will \\"stop the criminal acts of the extreme radicals, and to safeguard peace in society\\". == References == Category:2019 in Hong Kong Category:Timeline of the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests ","title":"Timeline of the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests (August 2019)"},{"id":"61531767","text":"Soudabeh Babagap (; also transliterated as Sudabe Babagap) is an Iranian documentary filmmaker, poet, and painter.

On 27 July 1997 Turang was ordained bishop by Cardinal Julius Darmaatmadja. Turang officially succeeded Manteiro at the latter's death on 10 October 1997. Turang caused some controversy in the Indonesian Catholic community when he reprimanded a priest named Romo Yohanes Subani. Subani who is an educator and instructor at St. Michael High Seminary in Kupang, did not kiss the bishop's ring on January 10, 2013 after a joint Christmas celebration at Kupang Cathedral Church, causing Turang to publicly admonish Subani in front of the congregation. Both Turang and to a lesser extent Subani were criticized for their conduct.

Rubel attended Ruthven Consolidated High School beginning in 1968, where she played on the basketball team in her freshman and sophomore years, averaging 35 and 47 points per game respectively. Coach Richard Barber stated that she was \\"as good a player as we've had in the 20 years I've been here\\".Britni de la Cretaz (August 2019), \\"Flagrant Foul, Longreads In 1970, she married and had a daughter. In 1971, she approached the school about rejoining the basketball team to pursue a possible college scholarship. However, a rule of the IGHSAU forbade married women and mothers from participating, meaning that if she were allowed to do so, it \\"would effectively disqualify all of Ruthven's girls' teams from being able to compete in any sports\\". When Rubel was denied eligibility again in the 1971–72 season, she filed suit against the IGHSAU for violation of her civil rights. The suit noted that the rules discriminated against female students, as male students were permitted to be married and/or fathers and still participate in sports. Shortly before the hearing scheduled to argue the case, IGHSAU reversed course and ruled that Rubel was eligible. In January 1972, the court ruled \\"IGHSAU had violated the constitutions of both the United States and the state of Iowa by barring married and divorced women and mothers from participating in high school sports.\\" Rubel ultimately completed her senior year at Ruthven on the basketball team, although she contends that IGHSAU unjustly prevented her from qualifying for the state tournament in that year.

After the war he reach the rank of counter-admiral. == Early life == Shabalin was born on to a Russian peasant family in the rural village of Yudmozero. After completing secondary school, he began working on a fishing trawler in Murmansk in 1930. Later he graduated from courses at the local technical school in 1935 and worked as a navigator until 1936 when he entered the navy. Initially posted to the Baltic Fleet, he was transferred as a foreman 2nd rank to the Northern Fleet in 1938 after undergoing training. In May the next year he was put in command of a torpedo boat, and later that year he entered the Winter War. In 1943 he became a member of the Communist Party. == World War II == In August 1941 Shabalin, at the time a junior lieutenant, was placed in command of TKA-12, a D3-class motor torpedo boat of the 1st Separate Torpedo Boat Division. In that capacity he was tasked with guarding an area near the main base of the Northern Fleet, where he made his first attack on an enemy vessel in September 1941. He went on to sink a submarine, six vessels, and shoot down a plane by the start of 1944 for which he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 22 February 1944. In May 1944 he was promoted to being a detachment commander within his unit. During the Petsamo-Kirkenes offensive he twice managed to brake through enemy lines to reach the port of Liinahamari for a landing on the night on 13 October 1944, which resulted in the awarding of his second gold star on 5 November. Despite his lack of theoretical military education he nevertheless used well-thought- out tactics, such as gliding toward enemy vessels after turning off the motor to avoid detection before opening fire at close range. On a mission to search a fjord with Viktor Leonov, they captured two German officers, who later provided useful information to headquarters under interrogation. In 1945 he transferred to the Baltic Fleet. == Postwar == After the war he graduated from the Caspian Higher Naval School in 1951, and then from the Voroshilov Naval Academy in 1955, after which he held various high positions.

Set in Mississippi in 1955, the novel tells the true story of the abduction and murder of African-American teenaged boy Emmett Till as well as the trial of his murderers through the point of view of Till's fictionalized white friend Hiram Hillburn. The novel received mixed, but mostly positive reviews and won the International Reading Association Children's Book Award for Young Adult Fiction in 2003. ==Plot== In 1955, Hiram Hillburn, a sixteen-year-old white male, lives in Arizona with his father. He resents his father for moving the family from Greenwood, Mississippi when he was nine, away from his beloved Southern grandfather. Despite his father's concerns about letting him go due to the racial tensions in the city, Hiram is given permission to spend the summer visiting his grandfather in Mississippi. At the train station he meets his grandfather's housekeeper Ruthanne and her visiting cousin Emmett Till, a fourteen-year-old African American boy from Chicago. After reuniting with his grandfather, he begins to notice his grandfather's culturally ingrained racism. He meets Emmett again whom he rescues from drowning in a river. They begin talking and realize they have a lot in common. Hiram runs into his old friend R.C. Rydell with whom he joins on a fishing trip where R.C. harasses and assaults Emmett. While Hiram does not participate, he does not help Emmett either and feels guilty. A few days later, R.C. tells Hiram that he is going with some white men to talk to a young African-American man who offended a white woman at a grocery store. Concerned for this young man, Hiram calls the police. However, the police are unhelpful to Hiram; they refuse to act, stating the boy from Chicago has to learn some manners. At this point, Hiram realizes they are talking about Emmett. Emmett is reported missing shortly after and his corpse is found in the river a few days later with a cotton gin pulley around his neck. Two white men are arrested for kidnapping and go on trial for the murder of Emmett. Hiram delays his trip home to serve as a witness for the trial due to the information he had told the police. His grandfather wants him to stay out of the trial to avoid the drama, but Hiram wants to help find justice for Emmett causing contention between the two. Hiram stays for the entire trial, despite not being called as a witness and the suspects are acquitted of murder at the relief of Hiram's grandfather. Hiram becomes suspicious after seeing his grandfather sell his blue truck but his grandfather becomes angry when Hillburn confronts him about it. After running into his neighbors, Hiram learns that his grandfather was spotted with the suspects on the night of Emmett's disappearance. Hiram, again, confronts his grandfather about this information upon which his grandfather unapologetically admits to being involved. Having been absent since the night Emmett went missing, Hiram runs in R.C. who tells him that he considered participating in Emmett's abduction but decided instead to escape his abusive living situation and move to Jackson, Mississippi where he had been living ever since. When Hiram prepares to return to Arizona, he expects an apology from his grandfather but is disappointed to never receive one. He meets his father at the railway station whom he begins to tell everything, repairing their previously broken relationship. ==Publication== Author Chris Crowe was unfamiliar with the Emmett Till case before researching for his book Presenting Mildred D. Taylor. In one of Taylor's essays, she described how she was affected by the Till murder as a child. After researching the case, Crowe determined that, despite its wide coverage at the time, most people were unfamiliar with the case and was excluded from most United States history classes. Crowe wrote Mississippi Trial, 1955 in order to teach American young adults about the case. He decided to tell the history of the murder and trial through a fiction story as a way to appeal to young adults.

Luís Fróis described the castle as the second best castle in Japan at the time. After the loss of Battle of Yamazaki, Mitsuhide tried to return to the castle but he was killed on the way.

In 1586, Asano Nagamasa abandoned the castle and moved to Ōtsu Castle by Toyotomi Hideyoshi's order. (Stones and materials were transferred to Ōtsu Castle.) Nowadays nothing remains of the original castle, and a statue of Akechi Mitsuhide stands in Sakamoto Castle's park.

The factory was founded in 1936 and closed in 1969 but was relaunched as a brand in 2012. The revived brand has since 2016 been owned by Rosendahl Design Group. ==History== The Aarhus-based wholesale company Holst & Knudsen (founded 1904) was a leading Danish supplier of porcelain to hardware stores across the country. The porcelain was imported from leading manufacturers in central Europe. After a while the company began to import undecorated porcelain and had it then decorated at subcontractors. One of these subcontractors was Kjøbenhavns Porcellains Maleri which was taken over by Holst & Knudsen in 1924. In the early 1930s, foreign exchange controls almost stopped the import of the cheap German porcelain. These events caused Holst & Knudsen to establish their own production of porcelain. Porcelænsfabrikken Danmark was therefore established by the company in a former sugar refinery close to Lyngby station in 1936. The factory was led by dr.techn. Søren Berg. Porcelænsfabrikken Danmark was at the peak of its production responsible for the production of one third of all Danish porcelain. The Dan-ild series was introduced in the mid-1950s. Ceramist Axel Brüel worked as an artistic consultant for the company in the 1950s and 1960s. The factory closed in 1969 and its buildings have later been demolished. ==Revival of the brand== Christian Elving from Karakter registered the tradenames \\"Porcelænsfabriken Danmark\\" and \\"Lyngby Porcelæn\\" in 2011 and bought all rights and renderings from the old company in 2012. The new company subsequently began to relaunch many of the original Porcelænsfabrikken Danmark designs as well as introducing new designs under the same brand. Rosendahl Design Group purchased Lyngby Porcelæn from Karakter in 2016. ==References== ==External links== * {https://www.lyngbyporcelaen.dk/om-lyngby-porcelaen Official website] Category:Ceramics manufacturers of Denmark Category:Companies based in Lyngby- Taarbæk Municipality Category:Danish companies established in 1936 Category:1969 disestablishments in Denmark da:Porcelænsfabrikken Danmark ","title":"Porcelænsfabrikken Danmark"},{"id":"61532353","text":"Ruth McGinnis (1910 – 16 May 1974) was a Straight pool player from the United States. ==Early life== McGinnis stated playing pool at the aged 7 in her father's barbershop pool hall on South Main Street in Honesdale, Pennsylvania. She was a prodigious player at a young age, making a run of 47 at the age of about 10. She was the captain of the varsity basketball team that won the Pennsylvania state championship in 1928. McGinnis scored 36 points in one game, and 341 across the 15 games in the series. ==Pool career== In 1943, she completed training as a physical education teacher at Teachers' College. Whilst at Stroudsburg, she participated in a number of sports, including soccer, golf, softball and field hockey. She also served as a lifeguard, and is said to have saved a man from drowning. McGinnis found it difficult to secure a teaching post after leaving Stroudsburg, and joined a programme called \\"Better Billiards,\\" organised by the National Billiards Council of America, which sponsored McGinnis to visit pool halls and promote pool. The visits usually involved her giving a short talk, demonstrating some trick shots, and playing against representatives of the venue. She travelled around 28,000 miles a year, and over 200,000 miles in less than ten years. In 1942, McGinnis became the first woman to compete in a major tournament, the New York state meet, and in 1948 became the first woman to enter the world pocket billiard tournament. In the absence of an organised championship, she was informally acknowledged as the world women's champion from 1932 to 1940. She played 1,532 exhibition matches in that period, losing only 29. In 1934, she was assigned the title of Queen Billiard Player of the World by the World Billiards Association. ==Later life== In the mid-1950s, McGinnis graduated from East Stroudsbourg State Teachers College, and from 1960 was teaching physically challenged children at the S. A. Douglas School in Philadelphia. She died of cancer aged 64 in 1974. McGinnis was posthumously inducted into the WPBA Hall of Fame in 1976, and into the Billiard Congress of America Hall of Fame in 1997. A marker commemorating McGinnis has been erected in Honesdale, Pennsylvania in 2016 by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission. ==References== ==External links== *1946 Ruth McGinnis Billiards Champion YouTube video. *Ruth McGinnis: The Queen of Billiards Smithsonian Magazine article by Eliza McGraw, 22 March 2018.

The mausoleum is located twenty-one kilometres via asphalt road from near-by Cetinje and it was built on the idea of Croatian sculptor Ivan Meštrović. It was built on the same location of the Njegoš Testament Church which Njegoš had built in 1845 with the intention of being buried there and which he dedicated to his predecessor Petar I Petrović-Njegoš (who is canonized as Saint Peter of Cetinje in the Serbian Orthodox Church). The church suffered damage from bombardment in both World Wars. In 1974, despite protest from the Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral and local Orthodox Christians, the old church was ordered demolished by a commission of the League of Communists of Montenegro led by Veljko Milatović and today's mausoleum was built. ==History== Prior to his death, Njegoš had asked to be buried atop Mount Lovćen, in a chapel dedicated to his predecessor Petar I Petrović-Njegoš. He had designed himself, and oversaw its construction in 1845. Following his death in October 1851, Njegoš was interred at the Cetinje Monastery. His remains were transferred to Mount Lovćen in 1855. They remained there until 1916, when during the First World War, Montenegro was occupied by Austria-Hungary and the Habsburg occupiers decided to erect a monument to Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph on Mount Lovćen. Not wishing for a monument to the Austrian Emperor to be located on the same perch as a symbol of South Slavic national feeling, Austro-Hungarian authorities demanded that Njegoš's remains be moved back to Cetinje. The Montenegrins had little choice in the matter and the remains were removed under the supervision of Serbian Orthodox clergy so that the Austro-Hungarians would not be accused of desecration. By the end of the war, Njegoš's chapel was severely damaged. Local authorities negotiated with the Yugoslav government for years over the question of where, when and at whose expense Njegoš was to be buried. Montenegrin officials favoured restoring the original chapel, while the authorities in Belgrade opened a competition over the designs of a planned mausoleum. Some of the plans differed greatly from the original Byzantinesque building. Due to lack of funds, plans for a mausoleum were discarded by 1925 and the original church building was reconstructed. In September 1925, in the course of a three-day ceremony sponsored and attended by Yugoslavia's King Alexander and Queen Maria, the chapel was rededicated and Njegoš's remains were reburied. Historian Andrew B. Wachtel writes: \\"The tone of the event, which was described extensively in the Yugoslav press, bordered on a piety more appropriate for the treatment of a saint than a writer.\\" At the end of the Second World War, Yugoslavia came under communist rule. In 1952, Yugoslavia's communist authorities decided to replace Njegoš's chapel with a secular mausoleum designed by Ivan Meštrović. Wachtel suggests that this was done to \\"de-Serbianize\\" Njegoš and eliminate any trace of the chapel's Byzantine design. In the late 1960s the chapel was demolished, and a mausoleum was constructed by 1971. Njegoš's remains were transferred back to Mount Lovćen in 1974, and the mausoleum was officially inaugurated that year. ==Legacy== Njegoš and his burial spot used to be mentioned in the popular Montenegrin Serb folk song Oj, svijetla majska zoro which (with revised lyrics) has been the national anthem of Montenegro since 2004. From 1945 to 1992, the previous Njegoš Testament Church was featured in the coat of arms of the Socialist Republic of Montenegro and from 1992 to 1994 in the coat of arms of the Republic of Montenegro.

America and Haiti to expand wartime production of rubber in the Haitian countryside. This program was established in 1941 and ran until it was largely discontinued in 1944.Smith, Matthew J. Red & Black in Haiti: Radicalism, Conflict, and Political Change, 1934–1957. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2009. ==Background== During the outbreak of World War II, an axis blockade cut off American rubber supplies from Malaya and the Dutch East Indies. In 1939, the United States Department of Agriculture began a program to develop rubber production in the tropical Americas. Haitian president Sténio Vincent requested an agricultural advisor from the United States, and on the recommendations of Thomas Barbour and David Fairchild, Thomas A. Fennell was selected and was sent to Haiti. In 1940, Harold F. Loomis of the USDA conducted a rubber survey of Haiti, and the Haitian Ministry of Agriculture agreed to set up rubber experimental station. The USDA then sent Harley Harris Bartlett to bring Hevea brasiliensis plants from the Philippines to Haiti. In 1941, Bartlett successfully transported 4,800 rubber plants. The same year, Élie Lescot succeeded Vincent as president of Haiti. ==Establishment== The Lescot administration believed that large scale rubber production in Haiti would stimulate the economy. In 1941, the Export-Import Bank in Washington granted $5 million for the development of rubber plantations in Haiti. A company was established, named the Société Haïtiano-Américane de Développement Agricole. Thomas Fennell was brought on as president and general manager with Haitian Minister of Agriculture Maurice Dartigue serving as vice president. SHADA was granted a 50 year lease on 150,000 acres of land, along with a 50 year monopoly on the export of all natural rubber from Haiti. Although financed and supported by the US, the Haitian government retained 100% of SHADA stock. In 1942, SHADA switched focus from Havea to Cryptostegia under contract of the US Rubber Reserve Company (later the US Rubber Development Corporation). An estimated 47,177 acres were cleared for the cultivation of the cryptostegia vine in 1943. Farmers in Haiti's northern countryside were lured from food crop cultivation to meet increasing demand for rubber. Lescot was a huge proponent for SHADA, believing the program was the solution to modernizing Haitian agriculture. However, the company began forcibly removing peasant families from Haiti's most arable tracts of land. Additionally, nearly a million fruit-bearing trees in Jérémie were cut down and peasant houses were invaded or razed. Dartigue was alarmed, and wrote to Fennell asking him to respect \\"the mentality and legitimate interests of the Haitian peasant and city-dwellers.\\" By 1944, it was clear that the program was failing. Yields did not meet expectations, and rubber exports were deemed insignificant. A severe drought from 1943-1944 further crippled the harvest. A US military report stated \\"The worst thing that can be said of SHADA is that they are doing [their operations] at considerable expense to the American taxpayer and in a manner that does not command the respect of the Haitian people\\". The US government offered $175,000 as compensation to the 35,000 to 40,000 displaced peasant families after recommending the program's cancellation. In early 1944, The Rubber Development Corporation sent a delegation to cancel the cryptostegia contract. Lescot feared SHADA's termination would add the burden of higher unemployment, as at its height over 90,000 people were employed by the company. His plea to continue operation until the end of the war was denied. A few months later, all cryptostegia producing lands were razed and returned to the original owners, and Fennell resigned. SHADA continued small scale production of sisal and Havea under direction of J. W. McQueen. By 1953, the company was no longer in operation. ==References== Category:Haiti–United States relations Category:Agriculture in Haiti ","title":"Société Haitiano-Américaine de Développement Agricole"},{"id":"61532421","text":"Crisfield is a surname.

He won the first international bodybuilding contest in 1904, appeared in early silent films, and toured the United States as a vaudeville performer. He was physical director at the Los Angeles Athletic Club from 1907 to 1949. ==Biography== \\"Edna Tempest\\" (Georgia K.

Treloar attended high school in Manistee, Michigan, where his father was superintendent of schools until 1897. Chicago hosted the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, a six-month world's fair that attracted tens of millions of visitors. Showman Florenz Ziegfeld created an evening vaudeville production at the city's Trocadero nightclub, centered around German bodybuilder Eugen Sandow.Graeme Kent, The Strongest Men on Earth: When the Muscle Men Ruled Show Business, (Biteback Publishing, 2012). Twenty-year-old bodybuilder Treloar was hired to be one of Sandow's onstage assistants.David L. Chapman, Sandow the Magnificent: Eugen Sandow and the Beginnings of Bodybuilding (University of Illinois Press, 1994). The production opened on August 1, 1893, and consisted of a series of athletic acts--acrobats, cyclists, trapeze artists--interspersed with musical interludes (during which food and drink were served). Sandow appeared in the third hour, flexing and striking the poses of famous statues. After various demonstrations of feats of strength, the show's climax was Sandow lifting a barbell with a large wicker basket attached to each end. While held in the air by Sandow, the baskets opened to reveal a man inside each. At the end of the Fair, Treloar toured with the production to the West Coast and elsewhere. Treloar enrolled in the Lawrence Scientific School of Harvard College in 1894. He studied independently under lecturer Dudley Allen Sargent, director of the Hemenway Gymnasium, and perhaps the foremost American expert on physical education. His first year, Treloar rowed on both the varsity and freshmen crew teams.George Saltonstall Mumford, Twenty Harvard Crews (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1923), p. 102. \\"His rowing was crude, but he was a man of remarkable physique.\\" He set University strength records--lifting with his legs, and with his back.\\"Strength Test Records,\\" The Harvard Crimson, June 18, 1896.

After running his own store for six years, he purchased a store in Skowhegan. His new business was destroyed by fire in 1904, but he was back in business in a temporary store within 36 hours. He eventually found a new home beneath the Oxford Hotel at 78 Water Street. This building too burned down, in 1908.\\"Item 20925 - Oxford Hotel fire, Skowhegan, 1908\\" - Vintage Maine ImagesThe Bulletin of Pharmacy, volume XX, January to December 1906 The Yarmouth building became Roger Vaughan's Rexall Pharmacy from 1945 to 1963.

Next door, at number 128, is a 1925-built house now used as the NYA admissions office. ===Bridge Street=== This house, at number 132 Bridge Street, was built in 1870 and has its \\"integrity intact\\", according to a surveyor Bridge Street crosses the Second Falls at the Sparhawk Mill. It connects to Main Street to the south and Willow Street to the north. 17 Bridge Street was built in 1852 and used as the parsonage for the First Parish Church between 1862 and 1997. Meanwhile, 21 Bridge Street was built in 1851 as a duplex for mill owners Mitchell and Loring. The original wooden 1811 NYA school building was removed to the adjacent Bridge Street \\"just below the residence of the late Charles O. Rowe, the father of William Hutchinson Rowe, roughly where number 28 Bridge Street, built in 1860, is today.Images of America: Yarmouth, Alan M.

Sparhawk Mill is at number 81. This brick mill was built in the 1840s, replacing a wooden mill dating to 1817, but its top half was rebuilt in 1855 after a fire. Crossing the river, directly across from the Sparhawk Mill tower is 80 Bridge Street, which was built as the office for the above business in the early 1880s. Its architect was Francis H. Fassett. The Royal River rushing by the Sparhawk Mill on Bridge Street en route to the First Falls The 1840-constructed former home of George G. Loring, built by Phillip Kimball, stands on the hill overlooking the falls at 100 Bridge Street. Boarding houses, which still exist today at 107 and 109 Bridge Street, were built in 1890 on the crest of the northern Bridge Street hill, providing accommodation for weavers, seamstresses and bobbin boys of the mills. In 1848, mill-owner Philip H. Kimball built the house at 125 Bridge, which is today's Charron residence. Number 132 was built in 1840.132 Bridge Street, Yarmouth, ME 04096 - Redfin The run-down building at 148 Bridge (at its intersection with Willow Street) has been vacant since the early 2000s. It was built in 1826. ===East Main Street=== East Main Street (which changes from State Route 115 to State Route 88 here) crosses the bridge at the First Falls and has been a route to the northeastern part of Yarmouth (and into Freeport) since the founding of the town. 35 East Main Street, built in 1848. Behind it is number 43, which dates from 1780 35 East Main Street was built in 1848. Its brick basement was once used as a store. Shipbuilder Jeremiah Baker lived here between 1857 and around 1871. 38 East Main Street was built by shipbuilder Albion Seabury in 1844. Directly opposite, number 43 was originally owned by Jonathan True in 1780, a clothier who owned a store at Lower Falls. It was later associated with Dr. David Jones and David Pratt, one of Yarmouth's earliest shipbuilders. The three-story 51 East Main Street, built in 1810 Number 49 was moved here in 1817 by Major Daniel Mitchell and later expanded by Daniel L. Mitchell. As of 2018, the nine-over-six windows, entry door and surround, trim and siding are all original. 51 East Main Street was built in 1810 and was once the home of William Stockbridge, a prominent merchant, ship owner and town treasurer. It operated as the main building of the Royal River Cabins until the 1940s. Number 56 was built, likely by clockmaker Lebbeus Bailey, in 1792. It was also associated with Albion Seabury. Next door, at 64 East Main, is a home built by Augustus True in 1865. Number 68, at the corner of East Main and Yankee Drive, was built in 1780 by Peter Weare, a sawmill and gristmill owner. It has also served as a tavern, a general store and, between 1900 and 1907, a girls’ school. Close to the East Main and Spring Street split, number 96 was likely built by Samuel Buxton and later occupied by Nathaniel True. 100 East Main Street was built in 1810. Around twenty years later it became Asa Bisbee’s blacksmith shop. Next door, number 112, was built by Jacob Jones around 1818. Just beyond the junction with Willow Street stands number 129, which was built by Madison Northey around 1865. Samuel Kinney lived at number 148 around 1813. It was built in 1810. ===High Street=== High Street, a cul-de-sac, is off the northern section of Portland Street. Rocky Hill Road runs from the end of High down to Marina Road. Shipbuilder Elbridge Hutchins lived at 5 High Street, which was built in 1900. 73 High Street, built in 1868, was the home of John R. Gooding. 85 High Street was built by Solomon Sawyer in 1877 and remained in his family until 1984. ===Lafayette Street=== Lafayette Street is what State Route 88 becomes upon its entry to Yarmouth from Cumberland Foreside. It was originally known as Atlantic Highway. 28 Lafayette Street, which stands beside the stone marker honoring Walter Gendall, was built in 1750 according to one source or, according to another, in the 1920s. Across the street at number 33, Reed's Machine Shop was built in 1927. It has been owned and run as the current business since 1973 by Stephen Welch.\\"Yarmouth is looking to reconnect itself\\" - Portland Press Herald, August 2, 2012 ===Marina Road=== Marina Road is the right-hand turn at the Staples Hill split with Main at East Main. It was one of the two access roads to the harbor from Main Street. Original owner Peter Allen tore down the Hannah Russell House at 3 Marina Road and built the current structure in 1881. Until 2018 it was home to the business Women to Women. Herman Seabury, a shipyard foreman, was the original owner of 9 Marina Road in 1890. It remained in his family for sixty years. Number 22 is believe to date from around 1800. The last building on Marina Road before the Lafayette Street intersection is number 59. Built in 1900 by Harry Dean as a tea room, it later became a shoe- repair shop, an antique store and an office. It is now a nutritionist business. ===Pleasant Street=== 51 Pleasant Street has been the home of several notable Yarmouth residents, including master shipwright Giles Loring 71 Pleasant Street was built in 1750 and has its \\"integrity intact\\", according to a survey co-ordinator Originally where the Atlantic Highway continued from today's Route 88 out of Cumberland Foreside, and part of the route of the trolley cars of the Portland and Yarmouth Electric Railway Company's runs at fifteen-minute intervals. It was also the access road to the wharves before the Lafayette Street hill was paved. Several people pertinent to the shipbuilding industry lived on Pleasant Street, including Captain William Gooding. Shipbuilder Giles Loring lived at the 1840-built number 35. The original owner of number 44, which was built in 1860, was a ship captain. Daniel M. Stubbs built the circa-1859 number 50. It was purchased in 1864 by photographer Charles Gustavus Gooding. Several notable members of Yarmouth's seafaring past have lived in the brick number 51, which was built in 1831: mariner Enos Chandler, master shipwright Lyman Fessenden Walker and Giles Loring. William Gooding Jr. built number 68 around 1846. It remained in the family for 103 years. The cape at number 71 was built in 1750.71 Pleasant Street, Yarmouth, ME 04096 - Redfin Number 85's original owner, in 1848, was yeoman and shipbuilder Henry Hutchins. Shipbuilder William Gooding lived across the street at the 1843-constructed number 86. Number 97, built in 1846, is a well-preserved Greek Revival. Its door surround, entablatures at the windows, pilasters and cornice make it eligible for listing. Built in 1730, 112 Pleasant Street is believed to be one of the oldest homes in Yarmouth. The cape at number 125 is a well-preserved, high-style Greek Revival with details including an entry surround with a tablet and sidelights. It also has an attached barn. Penelope Seabury lived in the cape at number 135, which dates from 1830. The home at 166, at the inside of the curve down to Lafayette Street, is believed to have been built around 1844. Meanwhile, number 242, the final home on the right before Lafayette Street, was built in 1836. ===Gooding's End=== At the apex of the Pleasant Street corner is Gooding's End, named for the family involved in shipbuilding down at the harbor. Henry Gooding lived at number 7, built in 1874. Number 25, built in 1840, was originally part of the Royal River Cabins on Route 88. It is believed this cabin was the one Eleanor Roosevelt stayed in when in Yarmouth in the 1940s. ===Portland Street=== The northern (village) end of the street is the historic part. The southern section, across Route 1, eventually leads to Portland. The former District Number 3 schoolhouse still stands at number 12 Portland Street. It was the superintendent's office for several years. Its original architect was Francis H. Fassett. Ammi Storer, the original owner of a business in the brick building at the corner of Main and Portland, lived at number 17. He built the house around 1867. Shoemaker Tristram Cleaves lived next to the schoolhouse at number 18, which was built in 1840. In an 1875 photograph of the northern end of Portland Street, with the Universalist church in the background, Englishman Captain Henry Newton's house (number 34, built in 1856) is visible on the right.Images of America: Yarmouth, Alan M. Hall (Arcadia, 2002), p.15 Dr. William ParsonsOld Times in North Yarmouth, Maine and painter Gad Hitchcock previously lived there. Leon Gorman, the grandson of Leon Leonwood Bean, also lived here until his death at the age of 80. He was, at the time of his passing, the wealthiest person living in the state of Maine, having had a reported net worth of $860 million. The original owner of number 23, which was constructed in 1850, was a blacksmith. Number 29, including its barn, is eligible for listing as an example of well- preserved Greek Revival design. Reuben Cutter, a shoemaker and postmaster, was the original owner of number 37 around 1839. Another blacksmith, Dexter Hale, was the original owner of number 47 in 1838. At number 61 (near the intersection with High Street), is the 1833 Federal-style cape that was owned by Davis Moxcey, a local shipwright in the early years of shipbuilding. Halfway along this northern section of Portland Street, at number 115, is a three-story Federal-style building that was once a tavern, built around 1810 by Colonel Seth Mitchell. It was later occupied by Deacon John Webster, in 1820, and Captain Eben Lane and his son-in-law Irving True. Lane ran it as a tavern from around 1857 until after 1871. After 1915, Ralph Redfern used the property for a dairy that became known as Old Tavern Farm. Number 159, the last house on the right before the gas station, is a cape with high-style Greek Revival details, including oval windows framed with garlands set in the cornice. It is eligible for listing \\"due to its architectural merit.\\" ===Storer Street=== Off the northern end of Portland Street, Storer Street runs behind the First Parish Church. It is named for Ammi Storer, who was the first to run a business in the brick building at the corner, next to the church. Number 23 was originally the home of papermaker William Hawes in 1850. The house was moved from Main Street around 1867 when the church was built. ==Brickyard Hollow== Brickyard Hollow, before it was filled in. Photo taken from where the Route 1 overpass is today, looking northwest The section of town between the Upper Village and Lower Falls was known as Brickyard Hollow, named for the brick-making business that was located across the street from the Masonic Hall (now the restaurant Gather) at 189 Main Street, which was built in the 1870s. A muddy valley up until the beginning of the 20th century, the Hollow was eventually reclaimed as a civic center by laying down a two- foot layer of black ash, from Forest Paper Company, to level it out. After constructing two new schools, the Merrill Memorial Library and a war memorial, town officials also decided to rename the area Centervale in order to improve its image. The name did not last, however.Images of America: Yarmouth, Alan M. Hall (Arcadia, 2002), p.37 ===Main Street=== 163 Main Street, now a business, was built around 1843 Sylvanus Blanchard lived in the brick building at 158 Main Street around 1847, before moving to number 317. As of 2018, the original barn is still attached. The cape at 163 Main Street was built around 1843. 171 Main Street, on the eastern corner of the York Street intersection, dates from about the same year. Across the intersection, at 179 Main Street, is a Greek Revival cape built in 1842. A lithograph from 1851, depicting the area of Main Street serviced by York Street, shows the home of George Woods and, next door, the Yarmouth Institute, which he established as direct competition with North Yarmouth Academy. Although it attracted students from as far afield as Cuba, his institute lacked an endowment and closed after five years. Woods sold the building to Paul Blanchard in 1853. It was torn down in 1930. In 1859, while serving in his new role as chancellor of the University of Pittsburgh, a lawsuit involving his dispute with NYA precipitated the split in Yarmouth's First Parish Church.Images of America: Yarmouth, Alan M. Hall (Arcadia, 2002), p.17 In 1890, Yarmouth built a large new school building on the site of the present, 1975-built town hall and police station. Grades 5 to 8 were on the first floor; the high school occupied the upper level.Images of America: Yarmouth, Alan M. Hall (Arcadia, 2002), p.39 A three-story high school was constructed next to this in 1900. When all of the high-school students were sent to North Yarmouth Academy in 1930, the building became another elementary school. In 1974, both buildings were demolished to make way for the current construction. In 1903, six years before his death at the age of 76, Joseph Edward Merrill donated the funds to build a new library. The architect was Alexander Longfellow, a nephew of the poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Also involved in the library's construction was John Coombs, father of George and Albert. Despite the occasional flood, town offices were eventually established in the library's basement.Images of America: Yarmouth, Alan M. Hall (Arcadia, 2002), p.41 The flooding was partly caused by the blockage of Cleaves Brook (where today's police station is) — which formerly drained the whole center of town — when Brickyard Hollow was filled in. Brickyard Hollow, around where the town hall now stands, looking east towards NYA This house, at 261 Main Street, was built in 1879 as the home of Sylvanus Cushing Blanchard. Camp Hammond is visible in the background on the left. The carriage house on the right is now the parking lot of InterMed The much-altered building in 2019 Directly across the street from the library stood the Dumphy house and barn. These were auctioned off in 1921, creating more public space in Centervale.Images of America: Yarmouth, Alan M. Hall (Arcadia, 2002), p.42 In 1904, the town's Civil War veterans sought permission to place a soldiers monument in front of the new schools. With funds lacking, it was put off until after World War I (during which 106 Yarmouth residents served),Yarmouth Revisited, Amy Aldredge when the project was completed in tandem with a board of trade plan to erect a bandstand. The resulting octagon structure, in the Doric order, was adorned by a plaque to the veterans. The words \\"Memorial To Men of Yarmouth in War Service\\" appeared just below the roof line. The structure was inadequately maintained, however, and had to be removed when rotting boards resulted in injuries.Images of America: Yarmouth, Alan M. Hall (Arcadia, 2002), p.43 In 1929, a new centralized post office was built to the east of the present 1932-dedicated Anderson-Mayberry American Legion Hall (named for servicemen Edgar Anderson and Edwin Mayberry, who died from the Spanish flu while based at Fort Devens). On the left side of this building was the Fidelity Trust Company. The bank failed early in the Great Depression of the 1930s.Images of America: Yarmouth, Alan M. Hall (Arcadia, 2002), p.38 To the east of the post office stood the Knights of Pythias Hall. It became the Pastime Theatre in the 1920s, then Yarmouth Theatre between 1942 and 1956. Harriman's IGA Foodliner moved here in the late 20th century from its Main and West Elm Streets location. A KeyBank (formerly Casco Bank) and the parking lot for NYA's Priscilla Savage Middle School now stand in its place. During the middle of the 20th century, in the plaza across Cleaves Street that formerly housed a 7-Eleven and, until 2017, Anthony's Dry Cleaners & Laundromat, was the Dairy Joy ice-creamery, in front, and the Korner Kitchen (formerly the Snack Shack) behind it. Across the street, at the intersection of Main and School Streets (in the building filled by People's United Bank), the post office occupied its final location before its move to Forest Falls Drive. Ship owner Cyrus Foss Sargent's home stands at 251 Main Street. It ran as the Village Inn between 1916 and 1920. In 1867, the building at 261 Main Street (across from Hancock Lumber) was built for Sylvanus Cushing Blanchard. Later owners of the house include Joseph Hodsdon, proprietor of Hodsdon Shoe Company, and Dr. Fiore Agesilao Parisi. 273 Main Street, which stands at the entrance to Camp Hammond, is a \\"highly-altered former church\\" built in 1880. On January 2, 2009, twenty-six businesses located at 500 Route 1 were destroyed in an arson attack. The entire block, located near to the point at which Route 1 passes over Main Street, was pulled down shortly thereafter. Damage was estimated to be between $2 million and $4 million. Everett Stickney, of Exeter, New Hampshire, was convicted of starting the fire, along with another one in York, Maine, later that evening.\\"Arsonist could get 20 years in prison\\" - Portland Press Herald, November 12, 2009 On November 12, 2009, Stickney was sentenced to an eleven-and-a-half-year prison term and ordered to pay $3.7 million in compensation.\\"Arsonist to serve 11 years, pay $3.7M to businesses displaced in Yarmouth, York\\" - The Forecaster, November 12, 2009 The building was replaced in 2008 and several businesses have moved in. ===School Street=== School Street, which runs beside and behind the library, takes the motorist on and off Route 1 South. In 1889, Dr. Herbert Merrill had a dental practice in the rear of his house, built four years earlier, in Brickyard Hollow on Main Street. It has since been moved to 26 School Street.Images of America: Yarmouth, Alan M. Hall (Arcadia, 2002), p.44 It is the building now occupied by InSight Eyecare on the InterMed campus. ===York Street=== York Street takes the motorist on and off Route 1 North. Number 17 dates to around 1852, while number 22 was built around 1850. ==Upper Village== Andy's Handy Store, at the corner of Main and East Elm Streets in the Upper Village, looking east from Latchstring Park in 2008. Known locally as Handy Andy's, it was the location of the first phone call between Yarmouth and PortlandAccording to a plaque inside the store The same view in 1947 In contrast to today, people who lived near \\"the Corner\\" of Elm and Main Streets in the 19th century would not think of shopping at the Lower Falls end of the latter thoroughfare. For over 150 years, much of the retail activity in the Upper Village occurred in the area of the old brick stores at 355–359 Main Street. Some of the oldest buildings on Main Street are those on its southern side, clustered between the Catholic and Baptist churches.Images of America: Yarmouth, Alan M. Hall (Arcadia, 2002), p.26 The Daniel Wallis house at 330 Main Street, for example, was built around 1810. Around the middle of the 19th century, Captain Cushing Prince, Jr. (b. 1786, d. 1869)Cemetery Records at YarmouthMEHistory.org moved here from his historic house on Greely Road. ===Main Street=== Businesses and residences in the Upper Village and the area around the intersection of Main and Elm Street, which officially became known as Yarmouthville in 1882, are listed below, roughly from west to east. This brick building, built in 1862 by Samuel Fogg and Ansel Loring, used to house (from left to right) Marston's dry goods store and Leone R. Cook's apothecary The southern side of Main Street, looking southeast from Main and East Elm Streets. The building on the right, formerly Samuel True York's grocery store, no longer exists A 2018 view A 1947 view from the Elm Street intersection A house that stood at the corner of Main and East Elm was moved to 45 Baker Street around 1890.Architectural Survey Yarmouth, ME (Phase One, September, 2018 - Yarmouth's town website) In the mid-to-late 1870s, diagonally across from where Handy Andy's now is, was Jeremiah Mitchell's \\"Temperance House\\"Old Times in North Yarmouth, Maine, p. 758 tavern. Mitchell died in 1869, aged about 31. The inn's location later became the site of Wilfred W. Dunn's house, then, between 1959 and 1972, Norton's Texaco gas station. It is now Latchstring Park.Images of America: Yarmouth, Alan M. Hall (Arcadia, 2002), p.33 After his death in 1811, the family of Dr. William Parsons moved into a colonial home, built around 1790 by its first occupant, Ebenezer Corliss, where the single-story building now stands at the corner of Main and West Elm Streets. The house was torn down in 1950.Images of America: Yarmouth, Alan M. Hall (Arcadia, 2002), p.32 The existing building, at 366, constructed in 1945 but since widened, formerly housed a pool hall, Edgar Read Smith's grocery store, Harriman's IGA Foodliner, and Turner's Television sales and service business. Sam York's grocery store, located to the east of the Parsons residence, was built in 1890. Like the Parsons' residence, it too is now gone. Adelaide Abbott's millinery shop, located to the east of York's. The building that housed George H. Jefferd's harness shop (today's 358 Main Street) was built in 1890. Isaac Johnson's barbershop was located above Jefferd's. The post office, opened in May 1882. Its first postmistress was W.L. Haskell, followed by Joseph Raynes in 1886. He remained in the position for 28 years, leaving the post in 1914 to Beecher True Lane. Anna Tibbetts Douglass followed in 1919. This branch was closed in 1928, and a village carrier system began at the central office. At the corner of Main and East Elm Streets stood a nail mill in 1807. (East Elm Street was known for a period as Mill Street, before today's incarnation was given its name.) In 1891, what was then Nathaniel Foster's pottery was torn down, after about fifty years in existence, and a new building was constructed. Since then, more than thirty different business or owners have set up here, including, between 1906 and 1935, Arthur and Harry Storer's hardware store, Storer Bros.Images of America: Yarmouth, Alan M. Hall (Arcadia, 2002), p.31 It was later John Ambrose Griffin's hardware store,Images of America: Yarmouth, Alan M. Hall (Arcadia, 2002), p.30 and became Andy's Handy Store – named for original proprietor, Leland \\"Andy\\" Anderson. In 1935, a 31-year-old Anderson combined the two wooden buildings of Griffin's and an adjacent grocery store (which sold produce \\"at Portland prices\\"). Now named \\"Handy's\\", it became occupied by OTTO Pizza in 2014.\\"New owners plan to transform Andy’s Handy Store in Yarmouth\\" - Portland Press Herald, December 16, 2014 William Marston's dry goods store (founded in 1859; closed circa 1968).Images of America: Yarmouth, Alan M. Hall (Arcadia, 2002), p.21 Located next door to Marston's was Leone R. Cook's apothecary, where Frank Bucknam was an apprentice. Harold Roy \\"Snap\\" Moxcey's barbershop, which he ran with his father Clarence (\\"Pop\\"), was located at the corner of Main and Center Streets, across Center Street from the Baptist church.Images of America: Yarmouth, Alan M. Hall (Arcadia, 2002), p.27 The building was moved around 1990 and now stands on the property of 463 Lafayette Street, across from the Ledge Cemetery. Ernest C. Libby was an employee with the Moxceys for thirteen years before opening his own barber shop on Center Street. To the right of the barbershop was Claude Kingsley's candy-distribution business. A barber shop, beside the Baptist church, was owned by Charlie Reinsborough. The Italianate number 347 is significant for its association with Captain Richard Harding, a sea captain, town clerk and state representative. 343 Main Street was the home of Smith's General Store for \\"much of the 1900s\\". It also had a couple of American Oil Company gas pumps just off the sidewalk.SmithsGeneral.com - About 339 Main Street was the home of local miller Amassa Baker, built in 1800. Coombs Bros.

Robert Bernstein, born in Germany, saw his business burn down in July 1913.Aftermath of fire at Bernstein's Store, Yarmouth, 1913 - Maine Memory Network He reopened the store in a new location across the street. St. Lawrence House – a hotel built, where the Mobil gas station near Camp Hammond stands today, to take advantage of the Atlantic and St. Lawrence Railroads coming through town. Circa 1872, it was renamed the Baker House, after its owner Jeremiah Baker (he previously lived at what is now 35 East Main Street, overlooking his shipyard, between 1857 and around 1871). It was the first of several name changes, including Royal River Hotel (when owned by O.E. Lowell in the late 19th century), U.S. House, Westcustogo House and Yarmouth Hotel. The expected tourists never materialized, and the hotel burned down in 1926. Grange Hall stood behind the hotel. Lowell Hall was in the second story of the stable. J.O. Durgan's daguerreotype salon (located just to the east of the hotel; later Gad Hitchcock's coffin and casket showroom). Alson Brawn's jewelry shop (at what was then 73 Main Street; formerly Sidney Bennett's Yarmouth Market, now Hancock Lumber). 309 Main Street, at the eastern corner of Mill Street, is an 1850s–1880s house. An elm tree in front of Marston's store had a bulletin board nailed to it, upon which local residents posted, as early as 1817, public notices, circus posters and satirical comments about town affairs. Like almost all of Yarmouth's elms, it became afflicted by Dutch elm disease and was cut down in 1980. ===Baker Street=== Baker Street, near the Baptist Meeting House, connects Church and Cumberland Streets. Number 22, a cape with a central chimney, is believed to have been moved from near 233 West Main Street. It was on its current site by 1859. Number 40 dates to 1850. It is the former home of John L. Lovell. Number 45 was moved from the corner of Main and East Elm around 1890. It was built at its original home in 1825. ===Center Street=== This circa-1777 home stands at 33 Center Street. It was originally the home of Dr. Ammi Mitchell Captain Samuel Baker's house, at 32 Center Street Center Street is off the southern side of Main Street and connects to Cumberland Street. It was formerly known as Woodbury's Lane. Another barber shop, Larry's, stood on Center Street. 20 Center Street is the home of Winslow Station, which served as the town's only fire station from 1953 until the mid-1990s. It was used by the fire department until 2004. The building, which was constructed in 1930, is dedicated to Carl H. Winslow, who was the fire chief for forty years.\\"Yarmouth seeks proposals for historic fire station\\" - The Forecaster, June 28, 2017 32 Center Street, a brick side-hall Greek Revival, was the home of Captain Samuel Baker circa 1850. The circa-1777 home of Dr. Ammi Mitchell stands at 33 Center Street. ===Church Street=== The Old John Corliss House, at 35 Church Street, dates from 1800 Church Street runs between West Elm Street and Hillside Street, ending at the Baptist Meeting House. John and Julie Dunn ran a store at 3 Church Street. Reuben Byram built the building at 6 Church Street in 1804. It is believed that Otis Briggs Pratt built the house at 14 Church Street, on land owned by Silas Merrill, between 1807 and 1812. Silas Merill also lived here. It later served as the homestead for the potter Nathaniel Foster and remained in the family until 1910. An 1804 Federal-style house stands at 21 Church. The Old John Corliss House, at number 35, dates from 1800. Reverend Thomas Green (b. 1761, d. 1814),\\"Rev Thomas Green\\" - Georgetown Historical Society the first pastor at the nearby Baptist church, lived at 40 Church. ===Cumberland Street=== Cumberland Street runs between South Street and Hillside Street, crossing West Elm Street en route. Captain Joseph Bucknam lived at 3 Cumberland Street, a home built by Jeremiah Loring in 1848. A Catholic church was built on Cumberland Street in 1879. The location was chosen out of fear that it would be vandalized if it was built on Main Street, for Yarmouth was a prevalently Protestant town at the time. The structure still stands as a private home, having moved to 73-75 Cumberland Street, but it is turned sideways to the street. ===East Elm Street=== East Elm Street, from its junction with Main Street. The horse trough in view here now stands at the intersection of Main and Center Streets Today's 40 East Elm Street was the home of potter Joel Brooks from 1850, but it was built in 1810. Brooks' pottery buildings stood behind the houseEarly New England Potters and Their Wares, Lura Woodside Watkins - Google Books East Elm Street (formerly known as Gooches' Lane) — that is, the eastern half of Elm Street — leads to North Road. It crosses the Royal River at the park just beyond the Fourth Falls and passes Royal Junction at Depot Road. James Smith lived in the 1801-built number 15. Andrew Haven and James J. Humphrey lived at the 1835-built number 27. It is a \\"well-preserved historic duplex with matching attached barn. Retains extensive original historic fabric and all aspects of integrity.

One of the longest roads in Yarmouth, it connects West Main Street to Greely Road in Cumberland. 48 Hillside was built in 1858, according to one source, while another places it in the 1810s. ===Mill Street=== Not to be confused with an early name for East Elm Street, today's incarnation used to be the main access road to the mill at the Third Falls. Henry Caswell, a blacksmith, lived at the brick number 31 Mill Street, across the St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad (then the Grand Trunk Railway). His business was directly across the street on what is now greenspace. The house was later owned by the Forest Paper Company for fifty years. ===South Street=== 1 South Street, built in 1840 South Street is off the southern side of Main Street and connects to West Elm Street, either directly or via Cumberland Street. It was laid out in 1848 as part of Yarmouth's first modern housing development.Images of America: Yarmouth, Alan M. Hall (Arcadia, 2002), p.24 Farm land was given over to house lots and sold to merchants and sea captains, such as Ansel Loring and Perez Blanchard. 1 South Street, the former home of Dr. Nat Barker, was built in 1840. He lived there was his wife, Catherine, in the 1930s and 1940s.1 South St, Yarmouth, ME 04096 - Redfin 10 South Street was formerly Alec Mansfield's garage. Dr. Lewis Whitney built the Greek Revival number 25 in 1849. It was purchased the following year by sea captain Joseph R. Curtis, whose family it remained in until 1983. Numbers 33 and 37 were originally built jointly; the lot was split in 1858. George W. Springer lived at number 33 after this split. Ship captain Perez Blanchard lived at number 49. Frederick Gore (1860–1930), the manager of Forest Paper Company, lived at number 62, at the corner of South and Cumberland Streets, with his wife, Angie. George Coombs, a partner in Coombs Brothers Confectionary Company, lived next door at number 74. In 1909, his brother, Bert, established a Ford dealership on South Street.Images of America: Yarmouth, Alan M. Hall (Arcadia, 2002), p.23 ===West Elm Street=== West Elm Street was an early route into Portland, prior to the Presumpscot River being bridged at Martin's Point in Falmouth Foreside, hence one of its former names was \\"Portland road\\". It was also known as Chapel Street for a period. Since West Elm Street was a key stagecoach stop, a large barn was built beside Mitchell's tavern (where Latchstring Park now stands) to house horses. The house of Richmond Cutter still stands at the southern corner of Church and West Elm Streets. Two doors further south from Cutter's house, a Methodist church was built in 1898 to mark a revival of the religion. The church was disbanded thirty years later and the building became a meeting place for a fraternal group. The building, now painted yellow, has been converted into a residence. 22 West Elm Street dates to around 1870. Potters David and Robert Cleaves lived at the Greek Revival number 30. Mason Reuben Byram lived in the three-story number 36. Number 43 dates to around 1875. Jeremiah Loring was the original owner of number 52. Number 53 dates to the mid-19th century Reuben Byram built number 58 for his daughter Louisa. The Greek Revival number 62, whose 1874 barn is accessed from Center Street, dates from the 1840s. 65 West Elm is circa 1850. At the northwestern corner of the Cumberland Street intersection stands number 73. It was built by Leonard Williams around 1863 and remained in his family for the next ninety years or so. Captain Alfred Small lived in the 1870s-built number 95. At the northwestern corner of the intersection with Deering Street stands number 111, designed by John Calvin Stevens and Albert Winslow Cobb for Captain Claudius Lawrence. ===West Main Street=== West Main Street (still Route 115) leads into North Yarmouth. The original owner of number 5, the first house on the northern side of West Main, was Captain Samuel Drinkwater in 1803. It later passed to his brother, Captain Joseph Drinkwater. A hospital, run by Mrs Gilbert, was on the site now occupied by Coastal Manor nursing home at 20 West Main Street. One of the two buildings dates to around 1860; the other around 1835. A 1973 survey dates number 17, a duplex, to 1807; however, a town assessor says 1860. 27 West Main Street, the Louis P. Pomeroy House, is circa 1890. In 2009, the owner found a shingle signed by Mr. Pomeroy confirming he was the home's builder (additional marking discovered in 2020 on the house front with date May 25, 1889), John Calvin Stevens and Albert Winslow Cobb are confirmed architects via house plans on file at Yarmouth Historical Society. Mr. Pomeroy grew up across the street and eventually built the house. He is also credited with several other projects including the original Town Hall and schools and Main Street Baptist church. The cape at number 43 was built for yeoman Matthias Storer around 1802. The Alexander Mills House, at number 54, is circa 1796. Cyrus Kingsley lived at number 57 around 1865. A 1973 survey suggests number 60 was built in 1790. 65 West Main Street originates from around 1800. Deacon Jacob Mitchell lived at number 89. It was later owned by Henry Barbour, who operated a dairy farm. There are two brick schools at 117 and 121 West Main, just beyond the Sligo Road intersection. The first, the District Number 4 school, was built around 1841 and repaired in the 1890s. In 1847, teacher William Osgood had 74 students; as such, a second school was built beside the original soon after.Images of America: Yarmouth, Alan M. Hall (Arcadia, 2002), p.36 The second building was likely built around 1856. Both schools closed in 1992, when Harrison Middle School opened. A large wooden building located at the intersection of West Main Street and Sligo Road, next to the old brick schools, served as the town hall between 1833 and 1910. It was here that the 1849 debates took place that led to Yarmouth's secession from North Yarmouth.Images of America: Yarmouth, Alan M. Hall (Arcadia, 2002), p.8 124 West Main Street, which is turned sideways to the road, dates to 1810. William M.R. Lunt was the original owner of number 139, circa 1856. Number 154, at the eastern corner of Bates Street, dates to around 1880. John Cutter, yeoman and grandson of Ammi, was the original occupant of number 163, circa 1795. The house sits at the top of a small hill. 190 West Main, a cape, dates to the early 19th century. A 1973 survey indicates number 195 was constructed in the 1870s. 233 West Main Street is an imposing three-story, fifteen-room Italianate mansion that was built for ship captain Reuben Merrill (b. 1818, d. 1875) in 1858. Merrill, who was married to Hannah Elizabeth Blanchard and had four children, was killed while aboard his clipper Champlain when it ran aground near the Farallon Islands, San Francisco. After making sure his crew was safely aboard lifeboats, Merrill was hit by a piece of falling rigging, fell overboard and drowned. Neither Merrill's body nor the ship's haul of railroad iron was ever recovered. His eldest son and first mate, Osborne (b. 1849), witnessed his father's death and never went to sea again, bringing to an end the family's seafaring ways. The home is one of three known surviving works of Portland architect Thomas J. Sparrow. It was built by John Dunham, a local master builder. In 2011, the Merrill family leased the home to Maine Preservation, a historic preservation organization.\\"The house that Reuben built\\" - Portland Press Herald, July 1, 2011 At the eastern corner of the intersection with Fieldstone Drive, number 284, stands a circa-1792 cape. Formerly the home of Nathan Safford. ==Mayberry Lane== Mayberry Lane is off the northern section of Portland Street, most visible if coming from the village because it runs at an angle from where the Lindquist Funeral Home stands. Number 9 dates from around 1837. ==Spring Street== The final name of State Route 88 as it passes through Yarmouth, Spring Street runs from the East Main Street split to Route 1 at Cumberland Farms. The northern section of number 19 was formerly the Spring Street Market. At the split of Spring Street and East Main Street stands number 20, a former gas station and hair salon. Number 66 was built in 1807, according to the assessor, or in the 1850s, per the Village Improvement Society. The cape at number 67 dates to the late 18th or early 19th century. Meanwhile, a survey conducted in the 1970s alleges that number 68, now significantly altered, originates from 1820. The final home before the western section of Bayview Street, number 114, was originally built on Brown's Point, at the eastern end of Bayview, and moved here in 1868. Number 141, past Bayview Street on the eastern side of Spring Street, was formerly the site of Frost's gas station. It is now home to a couple of businesses. ==Summer Street== A side street off West Main Street, connecting to Bates Street. A 1973 survey dates 14 Summer Street to the 1880s; a town assessor places it in 1910. ==Willow Street== Connects East Main Street to Route 1 opposite the Hannaford plaza. The first house on the left from East Main Street, number 4, was moved there in 1964 to make way for the parking lot of the Sacred Heart Catholic Church on Main Street Number 22 was the home of John Fitts. Horace Stubbs, a carpenter, was the original owner of number 26. 30 Willow Street was moved to this location from near the corner of East Main Street and Yankee Drive, when it was Samuel W. Stubbs' house. ==Broad Cove== Headstone of Reverend Tristram Gilman, located near the southern entrance to the Ledge Cemetery The area surrounding Broad Cove, at Yarmouth's southern extremity, contains several historic homes amongst newer builds. Gilman Road, which was laid out in 1780 to give access to Larrabee's Landing, is named for the Reverend Tristram Gilman,\\"Gilman, Tristram, 1735-1809. Tristram Gilman sermons and other papers, 1728-1808: Guide\\" - Harvard University Library a New Hampshire native who was the fourth pastor of the nearby Old Ledge Church for forty years – from 1769 until his death. He was the original 1771 occupant of the Gilman Manse house at 463 Lafayette Street, later the home of Merrill Haskell. John Calvin Stevens was hired to undertake the 1905 renovation of the property. Captain Francis E. Young lived between the two cemeteries. He is buried in the Ledge. The garrison number 60, built circa 1730 and directly opposite the Pioneer Cemetery, was the former home of the Ledge Church's first minister, Reverend Ammi Ruhamah Cutter. (Cutter was succeeded in the role by Englishman Nicholas Loring, who is buried in the Ledge cemetery.) Perez B. Loring lived there in the mid-19th century. For the second half of the 20th century, it was home to Charles and Anita Stickney, who purchased it from Henry P. Frank. Charles Stickney bought his father's company, Deering Ice Cream, in 1956. It had twenty locations in three states in its peak years.\\"Charles E. \\"Stick\\" Stickney Jr. Obituary\\" - Portland Press Herald, December 8, 2011 He died in 2008 at the age of 89; Anita died eight years later, aged 90.\\"ANITA (COOPER) STICKNEY\\" - Legacy.com 120 Gilman Road, near the northeastern corner of the intersection, was built in 1773. Its barn is mid-19th century. Moving east, crossing Princes Point Road, eight historic homes exist in the stretch leading up to Cousins Island. On the left (number 146) is formerly that of Captain Joseph Drinkwater and his wife, Anna. The house was built in 1844, and his family owned it until 1873. Captain Sumner Drinkwater purchased it in 1902, and it remained in his family until 1979, ending 107 consecutive years of Drinkwater ownership. Next, on the right, is 161, once the home of Samuel Allen Prince. Further down, on the left at 210, opposite the entrance to the Fels-Groves Preserve, is a circa-1817 brick house once inhabited by Captain Reuben Prince (b. 1792, d. 1870) and his wife, Deborah Prince (née Drinkwater; b. 1794, d. 1878), the parents of neighbor Samuel. Upon Reuben's death, the house passed to his son, Harlan, and remained in his family until his death. Arthur and Josie Fels bought the homestead in 1907. ==Larrabee's Landing== The former home of Charles Bucknam at 68 Larrabee's Landing Larrabee's Landing looking east, with Callen Point on the right Three homes exist around the Gilman and Larrabee's Landing Road triangle. First, an 1817-built house on the left, is formerly that of Mrs. Drinkwater. Next, beyond Burbank Lane, at 38 Larrabee's Landing Road, is the former home of Mrs. Bucknam. The original part of the house dates from 1835 and is believed to have been expanded by William Bucknam for his mother. It later became the home of New Hampshire natives Nelson and Fannie Burbank, for whom Burbank Lane was built. They owned and operated Burbank Farm from 1913 to 1936. The house of Charles Bucknam, at number 68, is the final home before Royall Point Road. It was built in 1835. The only house originally on Royall Point Road was the farmhouse at the current number 70. Nearby Callen Point was where Captain Walter Gendall (d. 1688),\\"Captain Walter Gendall: A Biographical Sketch\\" - Doctor Charles E. Banks (1880) an Englishman, was shot while taking supplies to his troops building a fort on the eastern side of the river. There was a wharf which served the farm. At the end of Barn Road, which is off Highland Farms Road (formerly Vaill Point Road), is Parker Point's (formerly Mann's Point), named for Yarmouth's first inn owner, James Parker (b. 1689, d. 1732).\\"Colonial Tavern Keepers\\" This was home to one of the garrisons set up to protect against Native Indian attacks. ==Princes Point== 68 Princes Point Road, located just north of Whitcombs Way, is the former schoolhouse of District Number 2. It was converted to a home around 1940. The 1831-built home at 420 Princes Point Road, a short distance north of the Morton Road intersection, is the former residence of Captain Nicholas Drinkwater, Sr. Captain Sumner Drinkwater (b. 1859, d. 1942) was born in this house. Mrs. Snell lived at the southeastern corner of the Old Town Landing Road and Morton Road intersection. (Morton Road is named for Harry Newbert Morton, who built the first house on the street.\\"Evelyn Yates Obituary - Yarmouth, ME  Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram\\" - Portland Press Herald, March 29, 2017 Morton, a lobsterman, moved to Yarmouth in 1929 and remained there until his death at the age of 89.) A 1944 map shows Bucknam Point Road and the unnamed road slightly to the west that Umpire Way connects to. These are both off Morton Road.1944 map of the area hosted on University of New Hampshire's servers In the early 1880s, Princes Point began to develop as a summer colony. For several years it had become a favorite camping spot for the villagers and the inhabitants of the inland parts of the town who came here for clam bakes and picnics. The town road ended at the John Allen Drinkwater barn, and here a large gate opened into the pasture which included the two points now known as Princes and Sunset Points. Captain Rotheus Drinkwater also had a home a stone's throw away. Captain John Cleaves fenced off a spot on his farm, at today's number 581, for the same purpose. The first cottage was built in 1884. It was later known as Battery Point Cottage. Others soon built nearby, including Dr. Herbert A. Merrill, Leone R. Cook, George H. Jefferds, Thomas and Nellie Johnston and Wilfred W. Dunn. The first to take up a lot on the western promontory now known as Sunset Point was Samuel O. Carruthers. In 1894 a wharf was built, and the steamer Madeline made two trips daily from Portland, stopping off at the Cumberland and Falmouth Foresides. The short- lived electric railroad running the same route forced the discontinuation of the service. In 1899, a four-story hotel of about thirty rooms, named Gem of the Bay, was built on Princes Point by Cornelius Harris. It was destroyed by fire in October 1900 after two seasons in business. ==Drinkwater Point== Named for Captain Theophilus Drinkwater, son of Allen and Hannah Drinkwater. His house, built in 1791 by his grandfather, Nicholas, stood at the southern end.\\"Old Times: a magazine devoted to the preservation and publication of documents relating to the early history of North Yarmouth, Maine\\" Theophilus was married to Louisa Drinkwater. They had three children — Cornelia Amanda, Hannah Gray and Ferdinand. Captain James Munroe Bucknam's 115-acre farm\\"Cumberland County, Maine - Captain James Monroe Bucknam\\" - Raynorshyn.com extended west to where Bucknam Point Road is today. His house is today's number 215, which was built in 1740 and later became the main building of the Homewood Inn development, whose property extended to the north and west. Bucknam wed Caroline Pierce Drinkwater in 1843 and they had five children together — Nicholas, Clarence Leland, Caroline Augusta, Clarence Loraine and James M., Jr. They were married for 26 years, until 1869, Caroline's death. He married for a second time the following year, to Abbie Frances Twombly, with whom he had another two children — Caroline Prince Bucknam and Albion Levi.\\"Genealogical and Family History of the STATE OF MAINE\\" - DunhamWilcox.net Nine years after Abbie's death, he married for a third time, to Edna A. Marston, widow of William. Seaborne Drive and Channel Point Road appeared on a 1944 map of the town, as did the Homewood Inn development, which attracted guests from 1912 to 1992. ==Churches== Of the eight churches in Yarmouth, five date from the 19th century or earlier and are listed on the National Register of Historical Places. The oldest remaining church, the North Yarmouth and Freeport Baptist Meetinghouse, was built in 1796. Three of these historic churches are located on Main Street; they are (from east to west): ===First Universalist=== First Universalist The First Universalist (formerly known as the Central Parish Church) is located at 97 Main Street. It was built in 1860 for an Orthodox Congregational parish, and is one of the state's few surviving churches designed by architect Thomas Holt. It became its current denomination (Unitarian Universalist Association) in 1886. It became listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. The site was formerly occupied by Jenks's Tavern. ===First Parish Congregational=== First Parish Congregational Church The First Parish Congregational, at 116 Main Street, was built in 1867. It was designed by Portland architect George M. Harding, and it is the third incarnation of churches built for the town's Congregationalists. Charles Augustus Aiken was ordained a pastor here in 1854. The First Parish Congregational was originally known as the Meeting House Under the Ledge and was located facing Casco Bay at the intersection of Route 88 and Gilman Road. It was built from material floated down the Royal River from the First Falls and hauled up by oxen from Larrabee's Landing (named for Benjamin and Thomas Larrabee, two brothers who settled there in the 1720s), further down Gilman Road towards Cousins Island. The path down to the water still exists. The landing was one of the most important in Yarmouth up until the late 1870s, when erosion caused the whole thing to slide into the channel. The Ledge church, which was founded on November 18, 1730, was torn down in 1836, sixteen years after it was abandoned by the Parish. Yarmouth's early Calvinists fired one minister because he suggested that many people are worthy of salvation. Reverend Tristram Gilman, on the other hand, declared in a sermon that Thomas Jefferson was the Antichrist. Of a settlement that originally contained a school, a tavern and a cemetery of Indian fighters, only the cemetery and the ledge doorstep of the church remain. The weathervane, which was the final addition to the steeple, was mounted in 1838 as a shipping guide on an iron rod atop the ledge overlooking the \\"Old Ledge\\" Meeting House by a group of Yarmouth residents. They had raised funds to buy the weathervane from Solomon Winslow, who had removed it from the site after the building's demolition. The weathervane is now on display at the Yarmouth History Center, but its old supports still exist up in the woods beside Route 88. They are passed by the West Side Trail.\\"About the Weathervane\\" - Yarmouth Historical Society's website A second, larger cemetery, known as Ledge Cemetery, was established in 1770. Tristram Gilman died in 1809. Francis Brown, an 1805 graduate of Dartmouth College and later its president, was invited to preach before the Congregational church. Brown accepted the position of pastor, with the proviso that the church, which had been in use for nearly eighty years, be discontinued.Yarmouth Revisited, Amy Aldredge The second church (known as Old Sloop) was built in 1818, at the eastern corner of Main and Bridge Streets (at present-day 121 Main Street), but it was abandoned in 1868 and torn down in 1879. (Lorenzo L. Shaw later lived here in a carriage house, but it burned down in a fire in 1967.) Brown married Elizabeth Gilman, the eldest daughter of his predecessor. Their son was Samuel Gilman Brown. Samuel's son, another Francis Brown, was a theologian. Those who were against the building of the new church incorporated themselves as the Chapel Religious Society. The present church was built on the other side of Main Street in 1867 and dedicated the following year. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. A plaque commemorating the 275th anniversary of the church was laid on November 18, 2005. The church's steeple is illuminated every night, sometimes in honor of a member or a relative. ===First Baptist=== First Baptist Church The First Baptist Church, at 346 Main Street, was built in 1889. It was designed by John Calvin Stevens.Images of America: Yarmouth, Alan M. Hall (Arcadia, 2002), p.28 The other two are: ===Cousins Island Chapel=== Cousins Island Chapel Cousins Island Chapel, at 414 Cousins Street, was built in 1895. It has been holding non-denominational services since 1954 in a former Baptist church.\\"Is there room in Yarmouth for a new church congregation?\\" - Bangor Daily News, April 23, 2015 It is listed on the National Register of Historical Places. ===Baptist Meeting House=== North Yarmouth and Freeport Baptist Meetinghouse The North Yarmouth and Freeport Baptist Meeting House (known locally as the Old Meeting House or the Meetinghouse on the Hill) at 25 Hillside Street was built in 1796. It has been twice altered: by Samuel Melcher in 1825 and by Anthony Raymond twelve years later. It ceased being used as a church in 1889, when its congregation moved to the structure now on Main Street. The 1805 bell was transferred to the new home. The meeting house was unused for less than a year. It was purchased for $1,000 and converted into the town's first library and antiquarian society and known as Yarmouth Memorial Hall. It was donated to the town in 1910 and used for town meetings until 1946, at which point they were moved to the Log Cabin on Main Street. During World War II, the belfry was used an airplane-spotting outlook post in the Civil Defense System. Twelve townsfolk per day manned the tower in two-hour shifts. In 1946, the Village Improvement Society (founded in 1911) agreed to maintain the interior of the meeting house. In 2001, the town and the society restored the building, from its granite foundation to the barrel-vaulted ceiling.

Its reputation as a center promoting historical study and modern relations between the two countries was built by such figures as Rabindranath Tagore and Tan Yun-Shan. The library is known for a major collection of Chinese books and journals, especially Buddhist scriptures and texts. ==The beginning== Cheena Bhavana was a part of Tagore's grand concept of the world making its home in a single nest, Tan Yun- Shan was the person who built and developed Cheena Bhavana. He was born in Hunan province of China and belonged to a distinguished family of scholars. A calligraphist, poet, essayist, author and writer, Tan was also a linguist trained in Chinese classical literature and philosophy. In his personal life he was a devoted Mahayana Buddhist and a Confucian scholar versed in Confucian classics, Laozi (Lao-Tze)’s philosophy, and Chinese metaphysics. He gained the reputation of being able to satisfy all with his sober approach and his politeness left a mark in the minds of those with whom he came in regular contact. Rabindranath Tagore discovered Tan Yun-Shan in Malaya in 1927, three years after his historic visit to China. Inspired by the poet’s message of peace and understanding, Tan arrived in Santiniketan and immersed himself in cultural dialogue with the intellectual elite of the ashram. At the same time, he engaged himself in Indological studies. India and China had for ages a rich tradition of cultural exchange. The names of Faxian (Fa Hien), Xuangzang (Hiuen Tsang) and Yijing (I-Tsing) were well-known, but there had been a break of a thousand years in such exchanges. The idea struck both the poet and the Chinese scholar that a permanent institute could serve as a nucleus for cultural exchange. Tan Yun-Shan went to China in 1931, to acquaint people there about the ideals of Tagore's Visva Bharati and garner support for cultural cooperation. With a warm response for cultural cooperation, the Sino- Indian Cultural Society was initiated at Nanjing in 1933. He returned to India the next year and a similar society was set up in 1934. The Cheena Bhavana was established in 1937. He spent over 30 years in its service. ==The building== At Santiniketan Tan Yun-Shan realised that his work required a separate hall/ building but Visva Bharati, then a private institution, was short of funds. Tan decided to move around to collect money for the purpose and he took on odd jobs to support himself. He went to Singapore, Rangoon and China for the purpose. Tan came back to Santiniketan in 1936 with adequate funds (Rs. 50,000) for his cherished China Hall and 100,000 books (collected with the support of the Sino-Indian Cultural Society). Tagore was thrilled and allotted land in the heart of Santiniketan for construction of Cheena Bhavana. The hall was designed in collaboration with Surendranath Kar and Tang supervised its construction. The building was completed in record time. Nandalal Bose, Benode Behari Mukherjee and others from Kala Bhavana adorned the hall with beautiful frescoes and relief work. Chinese calligraphy written by Lin Sen, the President of China, was placed in the centre-front on the building with similar calligraphy by Tai Chi-Tao at centre-rear. Tan planted trees all around the building. On 14 April 1937, Cheena Bhavana, the first institute of its kind in India, was formally inaugurated by Indira Gandhi. Tan was appointed its first director. However, in view of Visva Bharati’s grim financial situation Tan refused to take a salary. The Chinese government provided him an honorarium. Mahatma Gandhi, in his message to Tagore said: “May the Chinese Hall be a symbol of living contact between China and India”. Jugal Kishore Birla donated Rs. 5,000 to start research activities. Fund collection continued. In 1942, Chiang Kai-shek, the Chinese nationalist leader and supremo, and Madame Chiang, visited Cheena Bhavana. They were pleased with the progress of the institution that had already received financial support from China and announced a further donation of Rs. 50,000. In 1957, during a trip to India, Zhou Enlai, the Chinese premier, visited Santiniketan. He came to Cheena Bhavana and donated Rs. 60,000 for a memorial to Tagore. ==The institution== Tagore died in 1941. He had planted the seed that had started germinating. It was left to Tan, almost single-handedly, to make it grow, in spite of barriers and vicissitudes. He made it a ‘monumental edifice’. Even after Visva Bharati became a central university Tan helped to maintain its magnificent stature. Two characteristics that developed in Cheena Bhavana under Tan Yun-Shan are notable. First, it led to the establishment of Chinese studies in other places in India. Second, for a considerable period, teachers for the new institutes were drawn from Cheena Bhavana. It is thought that Cheena Bhavana was more than a mere academic institution and its special achievements are having a permanent value. First, it generated new ideas about Sino-Indian culture that flew out and permeated the environment. Second, it became a sort of a model and functioned as a cradle of Sino-Indian affection. Third, it functioned as a link and bridge between India and China. ==Some linkages with Cheena Bhavana== Some important linkages with Cheena Bhavana are given below: *1939 – The first Chinese Buddhist Mission to India led by Taixu spent a week at Santiniketan as guests in Cheena Bhavana. *1940 – Tai Chi-Tao, Buddhist scholar and admirer of Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore visited Santiniketan *1941–1945 – Chin Ke-Mu spent several semesters in Cheena Bhavana and returned to Beijing University as a Professor of Sanskrit. *1941–1943 – Karuna Kusalasaya spent two years as research scholar and assisted the Director. He returned to Thailand as professor of Sanskrit at the Buddhist University in Bangkok. *1941–1946 – Rev Pannasiri from Ceylon spent five years in research work. *1942 – Rev Fa Fang from China studied Indian Buddhism as a research scholar at Cheena Bhavana for three years, studied the Southern School of Buddhism in Ceylon, taught at Santiniketan for two years before going back to China. *1942 – Wu Bei-Hui joined Cheena Bhavana, carried out research in Sanskrit and Hindi for ten years and returned to Beijing University as Professor of Sanskrit. *1945 – Prabodh Chandra Bagchi joined as Senior Research Fellow and Director of Research under Chinese Government Felowship. Then he went to Beijing University and finally became vice- chancellor of Visva Bharati University. *1945 – P.V.Bapat joined as senior research fellow and professor. *1947 – Sisir Kumar Ghosh joined Cheena Bhavana as research fellow and joint editor of the Sino-Indian Journal. He later became head of the English department. *1950–1965? - Jan Yun-hua, a researcher and writer, did his PhD from Cheena Bhavana and joined McMaster University in Canada. *1953–1954 - Luther Carrington Goodrich from Columbia University came as visiting professor of Sinology at Santiniketan. *1955–1960 - Walter Liebenthal, German Indologist, Sinologist and Buddhist scholar, was director of the Sino-Indian Institute (Cheena Bhavana?). *2014 – The Chinese President Xi Jinping conferred the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence Friendship Award on the Cheena-Bhavana on 19 September, 2014 at a function in New Delhi for its contribution to uphold The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, strengthening people to people friendship and promoting world peace and development. ==A Tagore in Cheena Bhavana== Amitendranath Tagore, grandson of Abanindranath Tagore, was amongst the earliest students of Cheena Bhavana in 1942–1943. He was also selected for a study trip to China in 1947. He completed his Ph D in Chinese and taught at Cheena Bhavana for some time, went to USA on a scholarship, returned to Santiniketan, and finally joined Oakland University in Michigan, USA. In an interview published in The Telegraph, in 2012, Amitendranath Tagore provided some interesting insights. First, all five students were provided with a scholarship of Rs. 30, a gift from Madame Chiang Kai-Shek to Prof Tan. Second, Every Wednesday, Prof Tan used to stay mauna (silent). When he spoke in the evening all the students gathered round him, and Mrs. Tan served everybody some Chinese meal, with ingredients from her vegetable garden. ==Courses== Cheena Bhavana is the oldest centre for Chinese studies in this sub-continent, and functions as the department of Chinese language and culture of Visva Bharati University. It offers the following Chinese language courses. While the undergraduate syllabus covers Chinese literature (prose and poetry) and a comprehensive introduction to China, the post graduate syllabus goes into more detailed study of Chinese literature, philosophy, politics and Buddhist literature in Chinese. Both the courses lay adequate emphasis on the language and its usage: *BA (Hons) – 40 seats *MA – 45 seats *Ph D Cheena Bhavana has started a certificate course in Chinese for armed forces personnel at Panagarh military base. ==Library== Cheena Bhavana library has a collection of about 44,000 books, along with 4,300 books received as gifts. The library has about 200 users and a daily transaction of 30 books. Renmin Ribao (China's highest circulated newspaper) and 13 China- related journals are available. It has facilities for accessing 120 TV channels directly from China. With its treasure house of rare and valuable books, it is the best of its kind in preserving Chinese books and journals in South Asia.Chiang Kai-shek, the Chinese nationalist leader, had donated rare and precious literature to Cheena Bhavana. Zhou Enlai, Prime Minister of China, presented 12,638 books to Cheena Bhavana library. The importance and highlights of the library are suitably summarised here: “The Chinese Library in Cheena-Bhavana owes its existence to professor Tan’s herculean efforts. It consists of 100,000 volumes including the Sung Edition (10th Century A. D.) and the reproduction of the CH’ing or the so-called Dragon Edition (1936) of the Buddhist Tripitaka along with many separate volumes of important Buddhist works and a large number of selected Chinese works representing the Chinese classics, history, philosophy and literature. Ten sets of the Shanghai edition of the Chinese Buddhist Tripitaka were presented to the library by the Chinese people of which Professor Tan has presented nine sets to the universities in India. This edition of the Tripitaka contains 1916 different books consisting of 8,416 Fascicles of which most were translated from Sanskrit and the originals are now lost in India. It took about twelve hundred years to translate them into Chinese. The translators numbered more than two hundred, all of them were great scholars, both Indian and Chinese.” ==Reviews/ Opinions== Cheena Bhavana has featured as a symbol of Sino-Indian friendship in the speeches of India’s national leaders – Rajiv Gandhi in Tsinghua University in 1988, Narasimha Rao in Peking University in 1993, K.R.Narayanan in Fudan University in 1994 and Peking University in 2000, Atal Bihari Vajpayee at Peking University in 2003, and Pratibha Patil at Beijing in 2010. In 2017, Ma Zhanwu, China’s consul general in Kolkata said in Santiniketan that all school children in China read Rabindranath Tagore as Tagore’s work is part of the Chinese school curriculum. He said that he was happy to know that 117 students were studying Mandarin at Cheena Bhavana. ==See also== * Notable people associated with Santiniketan ==References== ==External links== * Santiniketan has a collection of photographs showing wall paintings at Cheena Bhavana by Nandalal Bose and other interesting art objects at Santiniketan.

The project was timed for the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first enslaved Africans in the Virginia colony in 1619. It is an interactive project directed by Nikole Hannah-Jones, a reporter for The New York Times, with contributions by the newspaper's writers, including essays on the history of different aspects of contemporary American life which the authors argue have \\"roots in slavery and its aftermath.\\" It also includes poems, short fiction, and a photo essay. Originally conceived as a special issue for August 20, 2019, it was soon turned into a full-fledged project, including a special broadsheet section in the newspaper, live events, and a multi-episode podcast series. The project has sparked criticism and debate among prominent historians and political commentators. In a letter published in The New York Times in December 2019, historians Gordon S. Wood, James M. McPherson, Sean Wilentz, Victoria Bynum and James Oakes expressed \\"strong reservations\\" about the project and requested factual corrections, accusing the project of putting ideology before historical understanding. In response, Jake Silverstein, the editor of The New York Times Magazine, defended the accuracy of the 1619 Project and declined to issue corrections. In March 2020, historian Leslie M. Harris, who served as a fact-checker for the 1619 Project, wrote that the authors had ignored her corrections, but that the project was a needed corrective to prevailing historical narratives. In September 2020, renewed controversy arose over edits that had been made to the project without accompanying editorial notes, which critics—including Brett Stephens of the Times—claimed showed the New York Times was backing away from some of its more controversial claims. In response, senior figures at the Times defended the 1619 Project and the Times' editorial practices. Project creator Nikole Hannah-Jones was awarded the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for Commentary for her introductory essay to the 1619 Project. ==Background== The 1619 Project was launched in August 2019 to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the arrival of enslaved Africans in the English colonies and its legacy. The first enslaved Africans in the English colonies of mainland North America arrived in August 1619. A ship carrying 20–30 people who had been enslaved by a joint African-Portuguese war on Ndongo in modern Angola, landed at Point Comfort in the colony of Virginia. == Project== The project dedicated an issue of the magazine to a re-examination of the legacy of slavery in America, at the anniversary of the 1619 arrival of the first slaves to Virginia, challenging the notion that the history of the United States began in 1776. The initiative quickly grew into a larger project. The project encompasses multiple issues of the magazine, with related materials in multiple other publications of the Times as well as a project curriculum developed in collaboration with the Pulitzer Center, for use in schools. The project employed a panel of historians and had support from the Smithsonian, for fact-checking, research and development. The project was envisioned with the condition that almost all of the contributions would be from African- American contributors, deeming the perspective of black writers an essential element of the story to be told. ===August 14 magazine issue=== The first edition, which appeared in The New York Times Magazine on August 14, 2019, published in 100 pages with ten essays, a photo essay, and a collection of poems and fiction by an additional 16 writers, included the following works: The essays discuss details of modern American society, such as traffic jams and the American affinity for sugar, and their connections to slavery and segregation. Matthew Desmond's essay argues that slavery has shaped modern capitalism and workplace norms. Jamelle Bouie's essay draws parallels between pro-slavery politics and the modern right-wing politics. Bouie argues that America still has not let go of the assumption that some people inherently deserve more power than others. === Unannounced revision of initial claims === In September 2020, lead 1619 Project writer Nikole Hannah-Jones criticized conservatives for their depiction of the project, arguing that it \\"does not argue that 1619 is our true founding.\\" Atlantic writer Conor Friedersdorf responded on Twitter by citing statements from Hannah-Jones arguing that 1619 was the nation's true founding. Philip Magness noted in a Quillette essay that the claim that the project aimed to \\"to reframe the country's history, understanding 1619 as our true founding\\" had been removed from the opening text of project's page on the New York Times' site without an accompanying correction notice. Magness argued that this showed that the Times was quietly revising its position. This unannounced substitution was decried by the conservative National Association of Scholars, which published a public letter in reaction to the change, asking for the revocation of the project's Pulitzer prize. Responding to the criticism, Hannah-Jones said that the argument about dating the founding to 1619 was self-evidently metaphorical. In an opinion column in the New York Times, Bret Stephens wrote, \\"These were not minor points. The deleted assertions went to the core of the project's most controversial goal, 'to reframe American history by considering what it would mean to regard 1619 as our nation’s birth year'\\", and argued that \\"The question of journalistic practices, however, raises deeper doubts about the 1619 Project’s core premises.\\" This column led to tension within the Times, and prompted statements by Times executive editor Dean Baquet, publisher A. G. Sulzberger and New York Times Magazine editor Jake Silverstein in support of the 1619 Project. Responding to criticism, Hannah-Jones wrote on Twitter, \\"Those who've wanted to act as if tweets/discussions about the project hold more weight than the actual words of the project cannot be taken in good faith\\", and that \\"Those who point to edits of digital blurbs but ignore the unchanged text of the actual project cannot be taken in good faith.\\" ===Accompanying material and activities=== The magazine issue was accompanied by a special section in the Sunday newspaper, in partnership with the Smithsonian, examining the beginnings of the transatlantic slave trade, written by Mary Elliott and Jazmine Hughes. Beginning on August 20, a multi- episode audio series titled \\"1619\\" began, published by The Daily, the morning news podcast of the Times. The Sunday sports section had an essay about slavery's impact on professional sports in America: \\"Is Slavery's Legacy in the Power Dynamics of Sports?\\". The Times plans to take the project to schools, with the 1619 Project Curriculum developed in collaboration with the Pulitzer Center. Hundreds of thousands of extra copies of the magazine issue were printed for distribution to schools, museums and libraries. The Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting has made available free online lesson plans, is collecting further lesson plans from teachers, and helps arrange for speakers to visit classes. The Center considers most of the lessons usable by all grades from elementary school through college. ==Reception== ===Reaction from historians=== Beginning in October 2019, the World Socialist Web Site published a series of interviews with prominent historians critical of the 1619 Project, including Victoria E. Bynum, James M. McPherson, Gordon S. Wood, James Oakes, Richard Carwardine and Clayborne Carson. In an essay for The New York Review of Books, historian Sean Wilentz accused the 1619 Project of cynicism for its portrayal of the American Revolution, the Civil War and Abraham Lincoln, who Wilentz wrote is \\"rendered as a white supremacist.\\" In December 2019, five leading American historians—Sean Wilentz, along with McPherson, Wood, Bynum, and Oakes—sent a letter to the Times expressing objections to the framing of the project and accusing the authors of a \\"displacement of historical understanding by ideology.\\" The letter disputed the claim, made in the Hannah-Jones' introductory essay to the 1619 Project, that \\"one of the primary reasons the colonists decided to declare their independence from Britain was because they wanted to protect the institution of slavery\\". The Times published the letter along with a rebuttal from the magazine's editor-in-chief, Jake Silverstein. Wood responded in a letter, \\"I don't know of any colonist who said that they wanted independence in order to preserve their slaves [...] No colonist expressed alarm that the mother country was out to abolish slavery in 1776.\\" In an article in The Atlantic, Wilentz responded to Silverstein, writing, \\"No effort to educate the public in order to advance social justice can afford to dispense with a respect for basic facts\\", and disputing the factual accuracy of Silverstein's defense of the project. Also during December 2019, twelve scholars and political scientists specializing in the American Civil War sent a letter to the Times saying that \\"The 1619 Project offers a historically-limited view of slavery.\\" While agreeing to the importance of examining American slavery, they objected to the portrayal of slavery as a uniquely American phenomenon, to construing slavery as a capitalist venture despite documented anti-capitalist sentiment among many Southern slaveholders, and to presenting out-of-context quotes of a conversation between Abraham Lincoln and \\"five esteemed free black men.\\" The following month, Times editor Jake Silverstein replied with notes from the research desk, concluding that the scholars had requested the inclusion of additional information, rather than corrections to existing information. In January 2020, historian Dr. Susan Parker, who specializes in the studies of Colonial United States at Flagler College, noted that slavery existed before any of the 13 Colonies. She wrote in an editorial in The St. Augustine Record that \\"The settlement known as San Miguel de Gualdape lasted for about six weeks from late September 1526 to the middle of November. Historian Paul Hoffman writes that the slaves at San Miguel rebelled and set fire to some homes of the Spaniards.\\"’1619 Project’ ignores fact that slaves were present in Florida decades before Writing in USA Today, several historians among them Parker, archaeologist Kathleen A. Deagan also of Flagler, and Civil Rights activist and historian David Nolan all agreed that slavery was present decades before the year 1619. According to Deagan, people have \\"spent their careers trying to correct the erroneous belief,\\" and Nolan said that in ignoring the earlier settlement, the authors were \\"robbing black history.\\"Ellis, Nicquel Terry (1 January, 2020). \\"Forget What You Know about 1619, Historians Say. Slavery Began a Half-Century before Jamestown.\\" USA Today. Retrieved 15 October 2020. In March 2020, historian Leslie M. Harris, who was consulted for the Project, wrote in Politico that she had warned that the idea that the American Revolution was fought to protect slavery was inaccurate, and that the Times made avoidable mistakes, but that the project was \\"a much-needed corrective to the blindly celebratory histories.\\" Hannah-Jones has also said that she stands by the claim that slavery helped fuel the revolution, though she concedes she might have phrased it too strongly in her essay, in a way that could give readers the impression that the support for slavery was universal. On March 11, 2020, Silverstein authored an \\"update\\" in the form of a \\"clarification\\" on Times website, correcting Hannah-Jones's essay to state that \\"protecting slavery was a primary motivation for some of the colonists.\\" This \\"clarification\\" was reportedly prompted by a private warning to Silverstein by Harvard classicist and political scientist Danielle Allen that she might go public with criticism if the passage on the revolution were not corrected. ===Journalistic reaction=== The 1619 Project received positive reviews by Alexandria Neason in the Columbia Journalism Review, and by Ellen McGirt in Fortune magazine, which declared the project \\"wide-reaching and collaborative, unflinching, and insightful\\" and a \\"dramatic and necessary corrective to the fundamental lie of the American origin story.\\" Andrew Sullivan critiqued the project as an important perspective that needed to be heard, but one presented in a biased way under the guise of objectivity. Writing in The Week, Damon Linkler found the 1619 Project's treatment of history \\"sensationalistic, reductionistic, and tendentious.\\" Timothy Sandefur deemed the project's goal as worthy, but observed that the articles persistently went wrong trying to connect everything with slavery. In the National Review, Phillip W. Magness wrote that the Project provides a distorted economic history borrowed from \\"bad scholarship\\" of the New History of Capitalism (NHC), and Rich Lowry wrote that Hannah-Jones' lead essay leaves out unwelcome facts about slavery, smears the Revolution, distorts the Constitution, and misrepresents the founding era and Lincoln. The World Socialist Web Site criticized what its editors consider the Times reactionary, politically motivated \\"falsification of history\\" that wrongly centers around racial rather than class conflict. Marxist political scientist Adolph Reed dismissed the 1619 Project as \\"the appropriation of the past in support of whatever kind of 'just-so' stories about the present are desired.\\" In February 2020, a rival project called the 1776 Project, published under the aegis of The Washington Examiner, was launched by a number of African-American academics who dispute the narrative of the 1619 Project. On October 9, 2020, New York Times columnist Bret Stephens stated in an op-ed that the 1619 Project \\"has failed,\\" pointing to \\"avoidable mistakes\\" in the Project's central claims.Stephens, Bret. October 9, 2020. \\"The 1619 Chronicles.\\" The New York Times. Calling it \\"a thesis in search of evidence, not the other way around,\\" Stephens cites historians who have been critical of the Project themselves, and argues that the editors at The Times, \\"however much background reading they might have done, are not in a position to adjudicate historical disputes.\\" Stephens also criticized the New York Times Magazine for surreptitiously editing the published text of the Project. ===Political reaction=== The publication of the project received varied reactions from political figures. Democratic Senator Kamala Harris praised the project in a tweet, stating \\"The #1619Project is a powerful and necessary reckoning of our history. We cannot understand and address the problems of today without speaking truth about how we got here.\\" On the other hand, several high-profile conservatives criticized the project. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, for instance, criticized the project as \\"brainwashing\\" \\"propaganda,\\" in a tweet, and later wrote an op-ed characterising it as \\"left-wing propaganda masquerading as 'the truth'.\\" Republican Senator Ted Cruz also equated it with propaganda. President Donald Trump, in an interview on Fox News, said, > I just look at—I look at school. I watch, I read, look at the stuff. Now > they want to change—1492, Columbus discovered America. You know, we grew up, > you grew up, we all did, that's what we learned. Now they want to make it > the 1619 project. Where did that come from? What does it represent? I don't > even know. In July 2020, Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas proposed the \\"Saving American History Act of 2020\\", prohibiting K-12 schools from using federal funds to teach curriculum related to the 1619 project, and make schools that did ineligible for federal professional-development grants. Cotton added that \\"The 1619 Project is a racially divisive and revisionist account of history that threatens the integrity of the Union by denying the true principles on which it was founded.\\" On September 6, 2020, Trump responded on Twitter to a claim that the State of California was implementing the 1619 project into the state’s public school curriculum. Trump stated that the Department of Education was investigating the matter and, if the aforementioned claim was found true, federal funding would be withheld from Californian public schools. On September 17, Trump announced the 1776 Commission to develop a \\"patriotic\\" curriculum. ===Awards=== Project creator Nikole Hannah-Jones was awarded the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for Commentary for the introductory essay to the 1619 Project. The award cited her \\"sweeping, provocative and personal essay for the ground-breaking 1619 Project, which seeks to place the enslavement of Africans at the center of America's story, prompting public conversation about the nation's founding and evolution.\\" In October 2020, the National Association of Scholars (NAS) published an open letter with 21 signatories calling on the Pulitzer Prize Board to rescind Hannah-Jones' prize due to its claim that \\"protecting the institution of slavery was a primary motive for the American Revolution, a claim for which there is simply no evidence.\\" New York University's Arthur L.

It was designed by cartoonist Pedro León Zapata and installed over a period of years in the late 1990s; it depicts cartoon Venezuelan people driving, with several vehicles having important Venezuelans from history behind the wheel. ==Background== The Venezuelan architect and designer Carlos Raúl Villanueva began designing the Central University of Venezuela (UCV)'s University City of Caracas campus in the 1940s, beginning construction in the 1950s during a time of prevailing modernism in Latin America. Villanueva had a stylistic ideology for the project he called the \\"Synthesis of the Arts\\"; combining the arts and architecture and creating artistic pieces that could also serve functional purposes. Villanueva died in 1975, before Pedro León Zapata began work on Conductores de Venezuela. Zapata was a cartoonist, working for newspaper El Nacional for 50 years, and had also been trained as a painter and muralist. His artwork was characteristically critical of the government, and he often depicted the everyday reality of life for regular Venezuelans. In 2005, he was awarded a PhD by UCV, where he was also a professor. ==Design and construction== Part of the design includes a list of 'credits' for the work. Zapata developed his own mural method, which he used for the work, when he was a student of Diego Rivera in Mexico. He was commissioned by the municipal mayor Antonio Ledezma and the university. In a 2008 interview, Zapata said that they promoted him as the mural's artist by referring to him as a painter, but that they secretly wanted him to make it a cartoon, and so he resolved to make it \\"a caricature done by a painter\\". He also said that he \\"wanted to entertain drivers stuck in traffic\\". The mural is made of 45,000 stoneware tiles, each 20 x 20 cm, cooked at the Pienme plant by ceramist Ricardo Ceruzzi, using monocooking furnaces. It was installed by the company Cerámica Carabobo. It is 165 metres long and 11 metres tall and has experienced deterioration since its construction, but has also been the focus of restorers due to being large and popular. The name translates to \\"drivers of Venezuela\\", with the mural depicting historic figures like Simón Bolívar, Simón Rodríguez, Teresa de la Parra, Armando Reverón, and José María Vargas driving vehicles. ==Response== The mural marks the boundary of the University City of Caracas campus at its northeast and was installed in 1998 and 1999. It is sometimes called Conductores del país and is described as an \\"open-air gallery\\" that gives residents of Caracas a \\"sense of belonging\\". Zapata said that the mural belongs to all of Caracas, but he loved it dearly himself and said that it was one of the largest murals in Latin America not just in size but for giving him the chance to bring some color to the university he loves, adding that it \\"took over [his] heart\\". Dr. Silvio Llanos de la Hoz commented on the mural, writing that it does not reflect the Synthesis of the Arts in the way the rest of the campus artworks do, and that its message did not have a Kandinsky influence but was more concerned with Venezuela's social present at the time. ==References== Category:Ciudad Universitaria de Caracas Category:Murals ","title":"Conductores de Venezuela"},{"id":"61533187","text":"Martha Teichner is an American television news correspondent, currently working with CBS News and a frequent contributor on CBS Sunday Morning. ==Biography== Teichner was born in Traverse City, Michigan.

He built the luxury Baldwin Hotel and Theatre in San Francisco and bought vast tracts of land in Southern California, where a number of places and neighborhoods are named after him. In 1947 the state and county acquired the land to create an arboretum around the lake and historic Reid-Baldwin structures. ==Reconstruction== Without a good roof adobe structures can be damaged fast.

She was one of the first Asian American actresses to have a leading role in a U.S. television series, Love is a Many Splendored Thing (1967), regarded as the first American soap opera to portray an interracial relationship between an Asian woman and a white man. She also appeared in films such as War Hunt (1962), Cheyenne Autumn (1964), and Targets (1968). ==Career== Born in Los Angeles, Hsueh made two films as a child actress, China's Little Devils (1945) and Intrigue (1947), on which her father served as a technical adviser. In the early 1960s she appeared in the Korean War drama War Hunt (1962) and the John Ford Western Cheyenne Autumn (1964). According to author Jon Abbott, \\"her exotic appearance kept her busy in the spy shows of the period, including The Man From UNCLE, I Spy, and The Wild, Wild West.\\" In 1967, she was cast as the female lead in the CBS soap opera Love is a Many Splendored Thing. The series was initially intended as a continuation of the 1955 film of the same name, which told the story of an interracial relationship between an American reporter and a Eurasian doctor. Hsueh portrayed Mia Elliott, the daughter of the couple in the original film. However, CBS censors became uncomfortable with the series' portrayal of an interracial romance between a Eurasian woman (Hsueh) and a white American doctor (Robert Milli), and Hsueh's character was written out of the series within one year. Her most prominent film role was as Boris Karloff's personal assistant in Peter Bogdanovich's Targets (1968). She had only a few small parts in film and television in the 1970s; her final acting role was in House Calls (1978). ==Personal life== Hsueh was the daughter of Wei Fan Hsueh, who was born in Nanking, China, and Evelyn Postal, who was of Native American and Scottish-Irish descent. She majored in education at the University of California at Los Angeles. On January 16, 1965, she married Daniel Carr, whom she had met during filming of Cheyenne Autumn.

She also serves as the co-director of the Navigating Work Place Conflict Executive program and the Constructive Collaboration Executive program. Thompson's research has been focused on the topics of negotiation, group decision making, analogical reasoning and creativity. She has written over 130 scientific articles and book chapters. She is the author and editor of eleven books including Creative Conspiracy: The New Rules of Breakthrough Collaboration, Stop Spending, Start Managing: Strategies to Transform Wasteful Habits, Making the Team: A Guide for Managers, The Mind And Heart of the Negotiator and The Truth about Negotiation. Thompson is a fellow of the Association for Psychological Science. == Education == Thompson received a B.S. in Speech from Northwestern University in 1982 followed by an M.A. in Education from University of California, Santa Barbara in 1984. Subsequently, she returned to Northwestern University where she received her Ph.D. in Psychology in 1988. == Career == After completing her Ph.D., Thompson joined the University of Washington as an Assistant Professor of Psychology. In 1994, she had a one year fellowship at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences. She left University of Washington in 1995 to join Northwestern University as the John L. & Helen Kellogg Distinguished Professor of Management and Organizations and an Adjunct Professor of Psychology. In 2001, she was endowed the J. Jay Gerber Distinguished Professorship of Dispute Resolution and Organizations at Northwestern. From 1995 to 2006, Thompson served as the director of Behavioral Research Lab at Kellogg. In 1997, she became the director of Kellogg Team and Group Research Center and the Leading High Impact Teams Executive Program. In 2013, she was appointed the director of Constructive Collaboration Executive Program. Thompson is a fellow of the Association for Psychological Science. She has served on the selection panel of the Decision, Risk, and Management Program at the National Science Foundation and its program review committee. Along with her work in academia, Thompson has worked as a speaker, consultant, and trainer for several companies. == Research and work == Thompson's research is focused on the topics of creativity, innovation, teamwork and social psychology. She has also done considerable research on negotiation, focusing on how men and women negotiate, how to improve negotiation skills and the role of emotions in negotiation. === Negotiation === Since the beginning of her career, negotiation has been a focus of Thompson's research. Initially her work on negotiation was focused on why managers often fail to reach win-win negotiation agreements. She wrote her first paper in the area in 1988 titled 'Groups as Mixed Motive Negotiations' in Advances in Group Processes: Theory & Research. In the 1990s her research discussed biases in negotiation, behavior and negotiation, and how training, experience, and feedback impacts negotiation skills. She spent most of the 1990s researching and writing about negotiation. Some of her work during this time also included perceptions of fairness in negotiation, and negotiations in teams.Thompson, L. & Loewenstein, G. (1992). Egocentric interpretations of fairness and negotiation. Organization Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 51, 176-197. In 1998, Thompson wrote the book The Mind and Heart of the Negotiator. The book discusses on how people can negotiate better. Used as an undergraduate and graduate course book, it has been translated into Mandarin, Portuguese and Korean. The 7th edition of the book was published in 2019. In the early 2000s, Thompson began studying the impact of gender on negotiation skills.Kray, L., Thompson, L., and Galinsky, A. (2001). Battle of the sexes: Gender stereotype confirmation and reactance in negotiations. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 80 (6), 942-958. She also wrote about how negotiation can be taught and learned as a skill. Some of her research during the early 2000s in this area dealt with how emotion influences negotiation behavior and outcomes.Anderson, C. & Thompson, L. (2004). Affect from the top down: How powerful individuals' positive affect shapes negotiations. Organizational Behavior & Human Decision Processes, 95 (2), 125-139. In 2006, Thompson edited the book, Negotiation Theory and Research and in 2008 she wrote the book, The Truth About Negotiations. Published by Financial Times Press, the book has been translated into six languages. The second edition of the book was published in 2013. In the early and mid 2010s, Thompson's research in this area returned to teams and negotiation. In the late 2010s, Thompson conducted research on how divergent and convergent thinking can impact negotiation performance. In 2018, she conducted further research on how negotiation differs for men and women. Her research highlighted that men lie in negotiations more often than women because men approach negotiation as a competition whereas women approach it as an opportunity to build connection. === Groups, teams and creativity === In 1996, Thompson wrote a chapter titled 'Conflict in Groups', published in Social Psychology: Handbook of Basic Principles. It marked the beginning of her research on team and group performance. She wrote about group decision making and social cognition in groups in the late 1990s. Later she conducted research on the factors that impact creativity in groups and how it can be improved.Thompson, L. (2003). Improving the creativity of organizational work groups. Academy of Management Executive, 17 (1), 96-109. In 2000, she wrote the book, Making the Team: A Guide for Managers. The book explains how teams should be designed to function optimally. It also highlights the skills needed to become a productive part of a team. Making the Team's 6th edition was published in 2017. It has been translated into Korean and Russian. In 2001, she wrote the book Tools for Teams. She was the co-editor of the 2007 book Conflict in Organizational Groups: New Directions in Theory and Practice. In the late 2000s, Thompson conducted research on creativity in groups and organizational teams. She collaborated with Hoon-Seok Choi to produce an edited book, Creativity and Innovation in Organizational Teams. In the late 2010s, some of her work in this area dealt with the topic of conflict in groups and creativity in groups. In 2013, she wrote a paper titled 'Why Teams Need a Creative Conspiracy for Success'. The paper led to the 2013 book titled The Creative Conspiracy: The New Rules of Breakthrough Collaboration. In the book she described collaborations that are conscious, planned and focused on creativity as a creative conspiracy. The book discusses keys to the kind of collaboration which makes teams more effective and how leaders can get their teams to be more creative. Reviewing the book, BussinessLIVE wrote that \\"her advice is practical and is applicable to everything from start-up teams trying to come up with new ideas to musicians working together to advertising account executives and creative directors developing pitches.\\" Some of her research in this area has focused on brainstorming and how brainstorming can be made more productive. Her research highlighted that a session of brainwriting before brainstorming can increase the number of ideas generated as well as the creativity of ideas. Her research in this area has also highlighted that people can be primed for creativity by asking them to share embarrassing stories prior to brainstorming session. === Organizational behavior and social psychology === Thompson has conducted research and written about various topics in organizational behavior and social psychology aside from her work on negotiation, teams and creativity. Her early work in this area has dealt with the evaluation of events, perception of justice, fairness and conflict resolution.Thompson, L. & Nadler, J. (2000). Judgmental biases in conflict resolution and how to overcome them. In M. Deutsch & P. Coleman, (Eds.) Handbook of constructive conflict resolution: theory and practice, Ch. 10, 213-235. Thompson co-edited the book Shared Cognition in Organizations in 1999. The book was a compilation of articles on the topic of shared knowledge. Administrative Science Quarterly reviewed the book positively and wrote that \\"perhaps the most admirable feat achieved in this book is the breadth of perspectives presented.\\" In 1999, Thompson began a collaboration with cognitive psychologists Jeffrey Loewenstein and Dedre Gentner to study analogical reasoning in managers. Her article, 'Avoiding missed opportunities in managerial life: Analogical training more powerful than individual case training' marked the beginning of several research projects focused on how to help managers apply knowledge from classroom training to business situations.Thompson, L., Loewenstein, J. and Gentner, D. (2000). Avoiding missed opportunities in managerial life: Analogical training more powerful than individual case training. Organization Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 82 (1), 60-75. In 2003, she edited the book The Social Psychology of Organizational Behavior: Key Readings. It featured a number of articles in the field of organizational behavior, with focus on micro-organizational behavior. In 2008, Thompson wrote the book Organizational Behavior Today. The book explains key organizational behavior concepts such as the influence of people on organizations, differences between leadership and management, teamwork and levels of communication. The book has been translated into Mandarin. In early 2010, some of Thompson's work was focused on envy at workplace and decision making in organizations.Menon, T. and Thompson, L. (2010). Envy at work. Harvard Business Review, April, 74-79. In 2016, she wrote the book Stop Spending, Start Managing: Strategies to Transform Wasteful Habits. Co-authored with Tanya Menon, the book discusses people-related problems that organizations face. Menon and Thompson interviewed one thousand managers and executives to collect data for the book. They discuss five spending traps - The Expertise Trap, The Winner’s Trap, The Agreement Trap, The Communication Trap, and The Macromanagement Trap - that managers often fall into and how to avoid such situations. She discussed the key findings of the book in a Google author talk in 2017. === Online & virtual learning === Towards the end of 1990s, owing to the increase in the use of technology, some of Thompson’s research examined electronically-mediated negotiations and how analogical encoding affects negotiation.Thompson, L., & Nadler, J. (2002). Negotiating via information technology: Theory and application. Journal of Social Issues, 58 (1), 109-124. She conducted an initial experiment examining how managers negotiate differently using email versus face-to-face negotiations. She conducted more studies that examined texting versus email negotiations.Morris, M., Nadler, J., Kurtzberg, T. & Thompson, L. (2002). Schmooze or lose: social friction and lubrication in e-mail negotiations. Group Dynamics, 6 (1), 89-100. In 2015, Thompson created a 'video-shorts' series that provided 3-minute practical advice to managers on how to brainstorm, negotiate, and develop team charters. Soon after, Thompson developed a sub-hour best practice video series called, “Negotiation 101” and “Teamwork 101” that was also publicly available. In 2015, Thompson developed a MOOC titled High Performance Collaboration: Leadership Teamwork and Negotiation. The course available through Coursera teaches leadership skills, negotiation strategies and team management. In 2019, Thompson developed and launched an interactive course called, 'Negotiating in a Virtual World'. She launched this in the full-time MBA program at Kellogg and also at the executive level. == Personal life == Thompson has two sons and one daughter. She is an avid cyclist. She is a USA cycling national time trial champion. In 2010, she won a masters time trial championship at the world level. == Awards and honors == *1989 - S.

It became the first Lithuanian-language play performed in public in present-day Lithuania when a group of Lithuanian activists staged it on 20 August 1899 in Palanga (then part of the Courland Governorate, Russian Empire). The play depicts an episode from the everyday life of the Lithuanian village – a resourceful man swindles money from a naive woman and escapes to the United States. Due to its relevant plot, small cast, and simple decorations, the play was very popular with the Lithuanian amateur theater. It became one of the most popular and successful Lithuanian comedies of all time and continues to be performed by various troupes. ==Plot synopsis== Vincas, a resourceful tailor, gets a job with a struggling peasant Bekampis who desperately needs 200 rubles to repay his debts to Jew Faibčikas. In an inn, Vincas meets Antanas, an old acquaintance from their native village. Antanas is looking for a bride and has an eye on Agota, Bekampis' daughter. Vincas agrees to act as an intermediary – arrange a loan from Antanas to Bekampis and a marriage between Agota and Antanas. However, Vincas seduces naive Agota with stories about the easy life in America and convinces her to steal the money from her father. They plan to use the money to escape to America. Agota steals the money, but Vincas locks her in a bathhouse and runs away to America alone. The play is rather simple and was well suited for the illegal amateur theater of the time. It depicts a scene from the ordinary lives of Lithuanian villagers and provides relevant commentary on the Lithuanian emigration to United States instead of more abstract or artistic characters or plot. Similar fraud and deception was described in Lithuanian newspapers of the time. It was also easy to stage as it needed only simple decorations and a limited cast (seven men and two women). ==History== ===Publication=== During the Lithuanian National Revival, resisting various Russification and Polonization efforts, Lithuanians increasingly become more culturally active – published and distributed Lithuanian-language publications that were outlawed by the Lithuanian press ban, organized secret Lithuanian-language schools for children, established secret societies (cultural and educational societies were officially allowed only after the Russian Revolution of 1905), and hosted evenings with music, dances, games, and occasional amateur theater performances. Since there was a dearth of Lithuanian-language plays that could be performed during such evenings, Lithuanian monthly Varpas announced a contest for Lithuanian plays. Brothers Vilkutaitis using pen name Keturakis (it is not known which brother was the main author) submitted comedy America in the Bathhouse. Vincas Kudirka, editor of Varpas, liked the play and brought it to the christening of a daughter of Jonas Jablonskis in 1894. The gathering included other intellectuals who read the play. Few months later, during užgavėnės in 1895, Jablonskis staged the play in a school dormitory of the Mitau Gymnasium. Future President of Lithuania Antanas Smetona played the role of Faibčikas. Kudirka had the play published in 1895 in Tilsit, East Prussia (now Sovetsk, Kaliningrad Oblast). The first edition, 5,000 copies, sold for 10 kopeks. It was republished in 1905 in Saint Petersburg by Eduards Volters (1,000 copies). Ten percent of the proceeds were earmarked for the widows and orphans of the Russo-Japanese War. It was further republished in 1921 and 1937 in independent Lithuania and in 1966 in Soviet Lithuania. ===First performances=== Organizers of Amerika pirtyje in Palanga. Liudas Vaineikis sits in the middle with the poster. The play was popular. It was staged by different communities of Lithuanian Americans at least five times before the performance in present-day Lithuania in 1899. In the Russian Empire, the play was performed in Saint Petersburg on 12 February 1898 and in Riga on 25 April 1898. In 1899, Liudas Vaineikis, a Lithuanian physician living in Palanga and an active Lithuanian book smuggler, suggested to Gabrielė Petkevičaitė-Bitė to stage a public Lithuanian theater performance. Since Palanga was part of the Courland Governorate, Lithuanian activities attracted far less attention than in the Kovno or Vilna Governorates and it was much easier to obtain an official permit. Petkevičaitė started organizing the play. She selected America in the Bathouse as it was easy to stage and already approved by the state censors and recruited Povilas Višinskis to help with finding actors. They managed to get access to a shed owned by the Tyszkiewicz family that was built for performances by traveling troupes. There was only one performance on . Despite various difficulties and a last-minute police interruption, the performance was a success and even netted a profit of 100 rubles that was donated to Vincas Kudirka. Vaineikis obtained a permit to stage America in the Bathhouse in Libau (Liepāja) during the winter break on 16 January 1900. The actors were mostly the same as in Palanga; Višinskis also recruited Jonas Biliūnas to play the role of the matchmaker. The same group managed to obtain permits to stage a different comedy, Devil Trapped (Velnias spąstuose), on 21 July in Libau and on 23 July in Mitau (Jelgava), but when Višinskis hung Lithuanian posters in Pašvitinys and Joniškis, the permits were revoked and actors were arrested and questioned by the police. ===Later performances=== The play became very popular and was performed by various groups illegally. Various peasants hosted the play in their barns, particularly in Suvalkija. For example, future Prime Minister Juozas Tūbelis staged the play in his father's barn in 1901. The play was also staged outside of Lithuania. Birutė Society staged it on 25 February 1900 in Tilsit, East Prussia (now Sovetsk, Kaliningrad Oblast). It was staged legally in Saint Petersburg in 1902 (three performances) and 1904. Mykolas Sleževičius staged the play in Odessa in 1904, while two performances took place in present-day Latvia in Subate in February 1904 and in Grīva in December 1904. When the Lithuanian press ban was lifted in 1904 and cultural societies were allowed in 1905, there were a number of legal performances in Lithuania, including on 31 October 1904 in Šiauliai (Kazimieras Venclauskis played Bekampis; Vincas Kapsukas turned the gathering into a political protest against the Tsar), on 6 February 1905 in Vilnius, by the Daina Society on 5 March 1905 in Kaunas, by politician Kazys Grinius on 28 May 1905 in Marijampolė, composer Stasys Šimkus on 2 November 1905 in Jurbarkas. The play was staged in Moscow in 1907. By World War I, it was performed over a hundred times. The play continues to be a part of the Lithuanian theater repertoire. The Kaunas State Drama Theatre staged the play in 1974 (director Valdas Lencevičius). In 2014, the theater staged the 700th performance in Rumšiškės. In 2014, the play was performed in Georgian at the Rustaveli Theatre in Tbilisi. In October 2016, Musical Assemble Ainiai premiered a new interpretation by Nerijus Petrokas, musical comedy Is America in the Bathhouse?!

On 28 June, five separate fires in Hà Tĩnh Province destroyed hundreds of hectares of forests and threatened nearby residential areas. The largest fire happened at around 1:00 pm at a protected forest area in Nghi Xuân District which quickly spread due to the sunny, dry weather and strong winds. Forest fires also struck the Hương Sơn District the following days with 20 places in the district experiencing fires. On 7 July, another fire occurred at around 1:00 pm on Thanh Vinh Mountain in Liên Chiểu District. == Responses == Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc urged the nation and local authorities to strengthen measures to prevent and contain the spread of the forest fires, detect fires and mobilise forces to extinguish fires before they spread. The Prime Minister also asked leaders of Bình Định, Đà Nẵng, Hà Tĩnh, Khánh Hòa, Nghệ An, Ninh Bình, Phú Yên, Quảng Bình, Quảng Nam, Quảng Ngãi, Quảng Trị, Thanh Hóa and Thừa Thiên-Huế provinces to implement urgent measures to prevent and fight forest fires. Furthermore, he urged the Vietnamese electricity board to co-operate with local authorities and related agencies to ensure the safety of the national electricity distribution system and be alert to any incidents that might affect power supply. The local government in Thừa Thiên-Huế Province mobilised a team of 1,000 forest rangers, firefighters, policemen and soldiers together with reserve soldiers to contain the spread of the fires. Similar measures were instituted by other affected provinces. Deputy chairman of the Nghi Xuân District People's Committee announced that by 10.30am on 30 June, a forest fire in Xuân Hồng Commune of Hà Tĩnh Province was brought under control and officials continued to patrol the area. == Aftermath == Most of the fires, including those in the Nghệ An Province, have been identified by the authorities as being caused by hot weather with the spread escalated by strong winds. The fire in Đà Nẵng started on the top of a mountain, and accompanied by strong winds and hot weather, was difficult for firefighters to access. It was brought under control in three hours on 7 July 2020. The cause of the fire is still under investigation. One of the fires which occurred on 5 August in Thừa Thiên-Huế Province was caused by people offering incense and joss paper that were spread by strong winds to nearby vegetation consisting of pine trees with the authorities taking two hours to stop the fires before the fire started again at 7.30pm. The investigation on the fires in Hà Tĩnh was resolved with the arrest of a local Vietnamese man for accidentally causing the fire while burning rubbish in his home area located near the forest. == See also == * Environmental issues in Vietnam * 2019 Southeast Asian haze == References == Category:2019 in Vietnam Category:Environment of Vietnam Category:June 2019 events in Asia Category:July 2019 events in Asia Category:August 2019 events in Asia Category:2019 wildfires Category:Fires in Vietnam ","title":"2019 Vietnam forest fires"},{"id":"61534009","text":"Brenda Mensah known professionally as Bree Runway, is an English singer, rapper and songwriter born and raised in Hackney, London.

Canyon View cost $78 million to build at a lower cost per square foot than the district's four other schools; $33 million of the total came from the Arizona School Facilities Board, with the remainder of the cost being financed by a voter-approved bond. DLR Group designed the school complex, which features a variety of informal settings. Teachers do not have fixed classrooms; classes rotate through the school's different spaces, with glass walls separating classrooms. Another feature of the campus is an accelerator, in a separate building, that is open to the community and also houses an auditorium and the school's broadcast studio and maker space. The school facility is also the subject of an experiment being conducted by DLR on bio-phase change materials to reduce energy consumption and cooling costs.

It is located in a former Farmer Jack supermarket. It is named after George Washington Carver. ==History== A Highland Park teacher named Birdlene Esselman established it in 1999. Mark Binelli wrote in The New York Times that Esselman was \\"beloved\\". The for- profit company Mosaica Education initially operated the school, acting as an educational management organization (EMO). The charter school was initially authorized by Highland Park Schools, the local school district. In 2000 it entered into a mortgage for funds used to pay $7.1 million to acquire the school's current campus. Michigan law does not require for leasing or property acquisition for charter schools to be in fair market value and Binelli stated that the resulting real estate prices paid by the schools are \\"wildly inflated\\". In 2017 Oak Ridge Capital employee Scott VanderWerp stated that due to the high area crime rates and poor conditions of area buildings, \\"I think you’d readily agree that that building and land isn’t worth $5- or $6 million. Quite candidly, it’s probably worth $500,000 or $600,000.\\" The school's 2008 mathematics and English standardized test scores for 4th grade students were invalidated after cheating had been discovered. Several teachers had given improper assistance during tests and had opened test packets prior to the designated times. it is managed by Midwest Management Group. That year it changed its authorizer to Bay Mills Community College out of concern that the Highland Park school district may collapse. Sylvia Brown, who came from Highland Park and resided in a suburban community, became the principal in fall 2016. In 2017 the school was still paying the loan made in 2000. It had about 560 students in 2016, and about 550 in 2017. ==Operations== In 2016 the state government of Michigan paid $7,300 to the school for each enrolled student. The authorizer took about 3% of the per-student funds. ==Facility== The building has a capacity of 650. Binelli stated that the building was in poor repair as the school lacked the funds to do maintenance. Around that year the school was in the process of refinancing its debt with oversight from a for-profit creditor, Oak Ridge Financial. Binelli wrote that Oak Ridge \\"was performing the sort of oversight normally handled by a school district.\\" ==Student body== the school had approximately 550 children enrolled. ==Performance== In mid-2017 the Michigan Department of Education ranked the school's performance in the lowest percentile. In 2017 Binelli wrote that \\"Carver probably isn’t the sort of institution where most school-choice proponents would send their own children.\\" Regarding the proliferation of charter schools, Binelli concluded that \\"The story of Carver is the story of Michigan’s grand educational experiment writ small.\\" ==Student discipline== In 2013 the school participated in the \\"Students for Peace\\" competition in order to reduce the amount of fighting on campus; in 2012 91% of the students had received suspensions because they participated in fighting. ==See also== * List of public school academy districts in Michigan ==References== ==External links== * George Washington Carver Academy Category:Public K-8 schools in Michigan Category:Charter K-8 schools in the United States Category:Charter schools in Michigan Category:1999 establishments in Michigan Category:Educational institutions established in 1999 ","title":"George Washington Carver Academy"},{"id":"61534103","text":"Claude Durand in 2011 Claude Durand (1938-2015) was a French publisher, translator and writer.

Korogho is a simple hall church dated to the end of the 10th or beginning of the 11th century. It is known for a lintel with unique sculptures in relief, illustrating various stages of quarrying and construction. The church is inscribed on the list of Georgia's Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance. == Layout == The Korogho church stands south of the village of Korogho, Dusheti Municipality, Mtskheta-Mtianeti region, on a slope of a high rocky mountain in the Khada gorge in the historical province of Mtiuleti. The church is a small and architecturally simple structure, measuring 10.8 × 7.6 m. It is built of local flagstone and schist. The elements such as vaults, conch, pilasters, piers, window frames, and cornice are made of dressed stone. Korogho is a hall church design, covered with a gable roof, its interior being divided into two naves in the western part. The sanctuary is rectangular in plan and tripartite, all three parts vaulted with conches. Close to the church there are a three-storey defensive tower, small chapel, and ruins of several accessory structures. An 11th-century ivory icon of the Theotokos and a cross with the depiction of the Savior, found in a den of the church, is now on display at the Georgian National Museum in Tbilisi. == Sculptures == The church is notable for its sculptural decoration. In the northern entrance of the church, there is a reused stone with a relief depicting three donors, one of them holding a plan of the church. A lintel on the western façade, made of large hewn plates, is adorned with sculptures depicting various aspects of construction work, from quarrying, transporting, and finishing of the stone to the workers taking refreshment. The scenes converge on an image of Our Lady of the Sign at the top of the gable, while on its either side are images of work in process, including transporting building materials, which would have been a major effort given the location of the church on the top of the mountain. The western façade also bears two inscriptions carved in a medieval Georgian asomtavruli script and paleographically dated to the 12th century. == References == Category:Buildings and structures in Mtskheta-Mtianeti Category:Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance of Georgia Category:Georgian Orthodox churches in Georgia (country) Category:10th-century churches ","title":"Korogho church"},{"id":"61534174","text":"Angie's List is an American home services website. Founded in 1995, it is an online directory that allows users to read and publish crowd-sourced reviews of local businesses and contractors. Prior to July 2016, Angie's List was a subscription-only service, but is now free to all home owners as a subsidiary of ANGI Homeservices Inc. ==History== William S. Oesterle and Angie Hicks founded Angie's List in 1995. The idea resulted from Hicks's search for a reliable construction contractor in suburban Columbus, Ohio, on behalf of Oesterle, a venture capitalist who was Hicks's boss. Hicks moved to Columbus to join Oesterle in creating Columbus Neighbors, a call-in service and publication with reviews of local home and lawn care services. The name and concept were based on Unified Neighbors in Indianapolis, Indiana. Hicks went door-to-door, signing up consumers as members and collecting ratings of local contractors. After Hicks recruited over 1,000 members in Columbus within one year, she turned to Oesterle to raise money from investors to develop the business. In 1996, the company bought Unified Neighbors from its creator and moved the company's headquarters to Indianapolis. By 1999, the database of local services and reviews was moved to the Internet. In the following years, the customer base and business relationships grew throughout the United States, while expanding coverage to include additional services, such as health care and auto care. In 2017, the company announced in a press release that they had 2 million subscribers in the year 2013. In August 2015, it reported 3.2 million paid members. In July 2016, Angie's List was made a freemium service; the basic membership tier, which includes access to more than 10 million reviews, was made free, alongside subscription tiers offering additional functionality. ==Ratings methodology== Angie's List members grade companies using a report-card-style scale, which ranges from A to F; these ratings are based on the following criteria: price, quality, responsiveness, punctuality and professionalism. Each company has its own page, which is composed of a description of its business along with the customer reviews. The aggregate grade is drawn from the combined reviews and grades given to the businesses from the consumers. ==Criticism and controversies== A 2017 investigation by a Chicago news station found that many Local 'Angie's List Certified' contractors are unlicensed to do work. David Segal found that when subscribers post a negative review of a company to Angie's List, a staff member discusses it with the subscriber in an attempt to rectify the situation. After they \\"fix the problem\\" they will remove the complaint. ==Litigation== According to The Washington Post, in March 2007 SCS Contracting Group sued Angie's List and two members for libel because of negative reviews of the company. One of the sued members remarked, \\"if [contractors are] able to sue, then the value of Angie's List depreciates.... People aren't going to be willing to submit reviews if they could be threatened with a lawsuit.\\" On October 7, 2008, the plaintiffs dismissed the complaint against the two members. Summary judgment was later granted in favor of all defendants. In 2014, Angie's List Inc. paid $2.8 million to settle a lawsuit alleging that it automatically renewed members at a higher rate than they were led to believe. In August 2016, Angie's List has agreed to settle three lawsuits for a payment of $1,400,000. The class action lawsuits focused on Angie's List's acceptance of advertising payments from service providers, and whether those payments affect service providers’ letter-grade ratings, reviews, and place in search- result rankings. Angie's List denies plaintiffs’ claims, but disclosed that revenue from service providers can affect the order of search-result rankings of the service provider under certain settings. ==Financial information== In 2010, Angie's List raised a total of $25 million in capital from investors. In September 2010, Wasatch Funds and Battery Ventures invested $22 million. In November 2010, Saints Capital led an additional funding of $2.5 million. On November 17, 2011, Angie's List began trading on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker symbol ANGI. It priced 8.8M shares at $13 and opened for trading at $18, a 33% premium. Shares have remained below $13 since March 2014.Public Record, NASDAQ Before 2015, the company had been dependent on capital infusions from investors to stay afloat. Angie's List had its first profitable year since its founding in 1995 in 2015. In 2013, investors worried that the company had been in business for more than 18 years, yet never had shown an annual profit, and that valuations of the company were unrealistic based on the actual revenue the company produces. But by 2015 growth estimates indicate a significant earnings-per-share growth, with a long-term growth rate at 19%. Combine this with stock estimates rising in 2015 by 13.3%, some Securities research firms such as Zacks Investment Research indicated ANGI is well- positioned for future earnings growth. On May 2, 2017, IAC/InterActiveCorp, owner of HomeAdvisor, announced that it had agreed to acquire Angie's List for $8.50 per-share (valuing the company at over $500 million). On October 1, 2017, IAC merged Angie's List and HomeAdvisor, renaming the merged company to ANGI Homeservices, retaining Angie's List ticker symbol and stock history. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Companies based in Indianapolis Category:Online marketplaces of the United States Category:American review websites Category:American companies established in 1995 Category:Internet properties established in 1995 Category:1995 establishments in Ohio Category:2011 initial public offerings Category:IAC (company) Category:2017 mergers and acquisitions ","title":"Angie's List"},{"id":"61534185","text":"Johannes Fatio Johannes Fatio (14 June 1649 – 28 September 1691) was a Swiss surgeon who worked in Basel. He performed the first successful separation of conjoined twins in 1689. He was publicly executed two years later for his role in the 1691 Basel revolution. ==Biography== Johannes Fatio was born on 14 June 1649 in Basel to Johann Anton Fatio, a merchant, and Christina Henricpetri. His father was of Italian Protestant descent and his mother came from a well known Basel family. Fatio enrolled in medicine at the University of Basel in 1662, aged 13, but never studied there. He completed an apprenticeship as a barber surgeon and was admitted to a barber surgeon's guild in 1672. Fatio befriended , a professor of medicine, with whom he performed dissections and surgical demonstrations on cadavers at the University of Basel. After Glaser's death in 1675, Fatio completed a medical degree at the French University of Valence. Upon his return to Basel in 1678, his application for recognition as a qualified physician was denied because Basel did not recognise foreign degrees. Despite his unofficial standing, he established a successful surgical and obstetric practice in Basel over the next decade. Fatio was an innovator in paediatric surgery, describing procedures for numerous birth defects including hypospadias, imperforate hymen, exomphalos and imperforate anus. His writings (published posthumously) also provides advice on resuscitating newborn babies with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. In 1690, Fatio joined a secret committee of discontented Basel citizens planning to rebel against the Basel parliament. When members of this revolutionary committee were appointed to parliament in 1691, Fatio was charged with rewriting the Basel constitution; his new constitution was extremely progressive. Counter- revolutionaries captured him on 21 September 1691, imprisoning and torturing him. He was publicly executed by beheading a week later on 28 September 1691. ==Separation of conjoined twins== Fatio performed the first successful separation of conjoined twins in 1689. The female twins, born to Clementia Meijerin on 23 November 1689 in a village near Basel, were first taken to physician Samuel Braun, who consulted Fatio. Fatio in turn consulted several other physicians including Nikolaus Eglinger, regarded as the official physician of the city of Basel, and Theodor Zwinger. Many doctors and high- profile members of Basel society were witness to the separation procedure. The separation of the twins, who were joined at the xiphoid process, was performed by ligature in three stages over nine days. After the separation, Fatio and Braun each cared for one twin, and each stump was said to have healed within ten days. The first case report was published by physician in 1689. Multiple contemporaneous reports, including Zwinger's 1690 recount, credit Fatio as the surgeon who performed the separation. Fatio's own account was only published in 1752, 61 years after his death, as part of an obstetric handbook aimed at midwives titled Der Arzney Doctor, Helvetisch-Vernünftiche Wehe-Mutter. It was the only manuscript of Fatio's that was not burned by authorities at the time of his arrest and subsequent execution. ==References== Category:1649 births Category:1691 deaths Category:17th-century surgeons Category:17th-century Swiss physicians Category:Swiss surgeons Category:People from Basel-Stadt ","title":"Johannes Fatio"},{"id":"61534213","text":"Rajni Patel was an Indian politician and barrister.

He served as a member of National Assembly from 2006 to 2012 at Sosa District of Bucheon, and also used to be the deputy parliamentary leader and spokesperson of Grand National Party, the predecessor of Liberty Korea Party. Cha is a controversial figure accused of various hate speeches, as an example when he criticized the families of the victims of MV Sewol tragedy using harsh words. == Early life == Cha was born in Seoul in 1959 and attended for Yongmoon High School nearby Korea University. He earned a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science and Diplomacy and a Master's Degree in Political Science from Seoul National University. His father was a refugee from North Korea. He was detained by the Agency for National Security Planning during the early 1980s and conscripted to Gangwon. After being discharged, he joined a labour movement where he met Kim Moon-soo, the leader of the labour movement who later became the Governor of Gyeonggi as well as whom he built a close relationship with him. He then became a member of Seoul Labour Movement Union following Kim, and subsequently led its Central Committee following the detention of Kim. During this time, he met Seo Myong- hui, also graduated from Seoul National University, and married in 1988. == Political career == Kim Moon-soo, former Governor of Gyeonggi Province that Cha used to aid. Cha started his political career from the left-wing Popular Party in 1989 as the party's chief in Guro 1st constituency. The party participated in legislative election in 1992 where it gained no seats and therefore was deregistered under the then electoral law abolished in 2014. According to JoongAng Ilbo, his ideology was shifted to right, from Marxism to social democracy, then capitalism during this time. Same went for Kim and both joined the right-leaning Democratic Liberal Party in 1994. Cha subsequently became an aide to Kim following the Kim's election in 1996. He also assisted Lee Hoi-chang, the former presidential candidate and the Chairman of the now- defunct Grand National Party (GNP), as well as Sohn Hak-kyu, the ex-Governor of Gyeonggi and the predecessor of Kim. Cha ran as the MP candidate for Bucheon Sosa following the resignation of Kim running for Gyeonggi governorship. He defeated Kim Man-soo of the ruling Uri Party with a high margin. He then became the deputy parliamentary leader of his party. He served as the GNP spokesman after his victory in 2008 election. He became well known for 2 issues in 2010, one for known as \\"Emperor's meal\\" and the another was when he brought an elaphe schrenckii into the National Assembly building. Cha lost to Kim Sang-hui in 2012. He ran for the same constituency against him in 2016, but also defeated. He opposes LGBT rights. On 1 July 2019, Cha declared to withdraw his endorsement towards Hwang Kyo-ahn, the-then President of the LKP, for \\"praising\\" the Trump-Kim-Moon DMZ meeting. On 20 August 2020, it was announced that Cha tested positive for COVID-19 after having attended an anti- government rally on 15 August. == Controversies == === Insult against Park Won-soon === On 11 October 2011, Cha provoked a controversy after calling Park Won-soon, the oppositions' sole candidate for the Mayor of Seoul, as \\"an extreme socialist supporting pro-North Korean forces\\". A Democratic MP named Moon Hak-jin mentioned that \\"from his harassment, perhaps he fears Park\\". Another MP named Yoo Sun-ho criticised his statement as \\"it is such as using viruses to kill vaccines\\". === Sinking of MV Sewol === On 16 April 2019, Cha faced a huge protests following his defamatory remarks against the bereaved family of MV Sewol tragedy. The previous day, he posted on Facebook that \\"they use their children's death till f***ed up\\". He also stated that \\"they're keep passing the buck to Park Geun-hye and Hwang Kyo-ahn but both of them are NOT related to the incident... maybe because they were brainwashed by left-wing bastards\\". He later deleted his post, deactivated his Facebook account, and apologised about it, but then was reported that he was not regretting about his mistake. His remarks was widely condemned by the other parties, including the ruling Democratic, Bareunmirae, PDP, etc. On 22 April, MBN banned him from performing on any of their programmes, and the bereaved of the tragedy filed a lawsuit against him. On 4 June, he reactivated his Facebook account and updated a post; several medias considered that he had no intention to apologise for his remarks. === Moon Jae-in the \\"Commie Bastard\\" === On 6 June 2019, 2 days after he reactivated his Facebook, Cha again provoked another controversies for his Facebook post. At the post, he did not just called for the impeachment of the President Moon Jae-in but also urged the other MPs to call Moon as \\"commie bastard\\" for \\"praising\\" Kim Won-bong. The ruling Democratic Party asked the LKP for expelling him from the party. Bareunmirae, who also criticised Moon's remark, blamed Cha as \\"totally abnormal\\". In contrast with it, LKP President Hwang Kyo-ahn replied that the true \\"hate speech\\" is when calling a person's remark as \\"hate speech\\". Cha repeated his remarks on 17, 23 and 29 June, with additional words \\"dunce\\", and asked Moon to go to North Korea. === Anti-Japanese movement === On 28 July 2019, Cha criticised anti-Japanese movement as the \\"shallow idea of Moon\\". He added that Moon is a \\"nerd\\" who doesn't deserve to be a leader. Park Jin-sung, a poet, criticised him by writing a poem. === Sexual slur incidence === On 8 April 2020, Cha again provoked a controversy when he mentioned that some of bereaved families were involved in \\"threesome party\\" at an election debate 2 days ago. Some sources reported that the United Future Party (UFP) was considering to sack him from the party. The party president Hwang Kyo-ahn has apologised for the incident. == References == == External links == * Cha Myong-jin on Twitter * Cha Myong-jin on Facebook Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:South Korean politicians ","title":"Cha Myong-jin"},{"id":"61534351","text":"John McLean (–1890) was a Scotsman who emigrated to British North America, where he became a fur-trapper, trader, explorer, grocer, banker, newspaperman, clerk, and author. He travelled by foot and canoe from the Atlantic to the Pacific and back, becoming one of the chief traders of the Hudson's Bay Company. He is remembered as the first person of European descent to discover Churchill Falls on Canada's Churchill River and sometimes mistakenly credited as the first to cross the Labrador Peninsula. Long overlooked, his first- person accounts of early 19th-century fur trading in Canada are now valued by historians. Under the pen name Viator (Latin for \\"Traveler\\"), his letters to newspapers around Canada also helped shift public opinion away from yielding the western territories to the United States during the Alabama Claims dispute over damages for British involvement in the American Civil War. ==Life== ===Early life=== A period map showing the extent of British knowledge of present-day Canada around the time of McLean's birth John McLean was born in Dervaig or beside the Loch Bà on the Isle of Mull in Scotland in 1797,. on 24 July 1798, in 1799, or on 14 December 1800. ===With the North West Company=== He joined the North West Company in the winter of 1820, reaching Montreal in January 1821. Before leaving for his three-year apprenticeship in May, he studied French for several months with two other trappers under the anglophile curate of St Michel d'Yamaska, Pierre Gibert. The same year, the NWC merged with its long-time rival the Hudson's Bay Company. McLean's apprenticeship transferred to the new company, but his memoirs show that he never abandoned his preference for the old one: \\"From 1674 to 1813 the Hudson's Bay Company slumbered at its posts along the shores of Hudson's Bay, never attempting to penetrate beyond the banks of the Saskatchewan, until the North-Westers led and cleared the way\\"... \\"the chief advantages the Hudson's Bay Company now possess, they owe to the adventurous North-West traders; by these traders the whole interior of the savage wilds was first explored; by them the water communications were first discovered and opened up to commercial enterprise; by them the first trading posts were established in the interior; by them the natives were first reconciled with the whites; and by them the trade was first reduced to the regular system which the Hudson's Bay Company still follows. When all this had been done by the North-West Company, and they had begun to reap the rewards of their toils, and hardships, and dangers, and expenditure,then did the Honourable Hudson's Bay Company, led on by a British peer, step forward and claim, as British subjects, an equal right to share the trade.\\" ===With the Hudson's Bay Company=== An engraving of Chats Falls, c.1840 F.A. Hopkins's portrayal of an HBC freight canoe (1869) An engraving of Churchill Falls, c.1890 Ballantyne's fictionalized portrayal of life at Fort Chimo An engraving of an HBC station, c.1880 A period map showing the extent of British knowledge of present-day Canada around the time of McLean's retirement Ottawa River John McLean entered the service of the Hudson's Bay Company at a most interesting and critical time in its history, during the suicidal strife between the Hudson's Bay and North West Companies. He worked on the Ottawa Riverthe present-day border between Quebec and Ontariountil 1833. During his apprenticeship, he moved progressively further upcountry, from Lake of Two Mountains, to Chats Falls in April 1822, to Fort Coulonge in June 1823. He then directed a post at Lac de Sable on the Lièvre in the wilderness north of Ottawa and Montreal. He spent nine years fending off company rivals, cultivating relations with indigenous trappers, and improving the post's profitability only to be removed to a new territory once things had become easy. He lamented that he \\"had now served the Hudson's Bay Company faithfully and zealously for a period of twelve years, leading a life of hardship and toil, of which no idea can be formed except by those whose hard lot it may be to know it by experience... what was my reward? I had no sooner succeeded in freeing my district from opposition, than I was ordered to resign my situation to another who would enjoy the results of my labour.\\" McLean's account of his journey across the continent is another of those invaluable récit de voyage that enable us to piece together the history of the Canadian North-west in its earlier days. New Caledonia Ordered to the Western Department on the Pacific, he travelledmostly by canoefrom Montreal up the Ottawa, crossed Lake Nipissing to the French River and the sheltered northern bays of Lake Huron, passed Sault Ste Marie into Lake Superior and Fort William on Thunder Bay, stopped on the north shore of Lake Winnipeg at Norway House in Rupert's Land (now Manitoba) for further orders, and finally followed thempast Cumberland House in present-day Saskatchewan and Athabasca and Fort Dunvegan in present-day Alberta and down the Peace Riverto New Caledonia (present-day British Columbia), where he expected \\"to fare like a dog\\". Reaching Fort St James on Stuart Lake on 28 October 1833,. however, he had nothing but praise\\"I do not know that I have seen anything to compare with this charming prospect in any other part of the country; its beauties struck me even at this season of the year, when nature having partially assumed her hybernal dress, everything appeared to so much greater advantage.\\" He also complemented Fort Alexandria on the Fraser, his post from March to May the next year, for its scenery, friendly indigenous neighbours, and good food. In September 1834 or 1835, he went to Prince George, then known as Fort George, whose former trader's servants had all been massacred by the locals a few years earlier but which McLean reported as peaceable and prosperous during his time there. Having received permission from the governor of the Hudson's Bay Company to return to headquarters, McLean departed Stuart Lake on 22 February 1837. He passed Fort Alexandria on March 8th, Kamloops on March 18th, Onkanagan on March 28th, and Colville on April 12th. Reaching Norway House in June, he found Governor George Simpson holding the council for the company's Northern Department. McLean, although eligible, was passed over for promotion to chief trader in favour of two other agents. He took this as a personal slight from Gov. Simpson, but Simpson's personal records seem to be complimentary and indicate he was simply following seniority. While at Norway House, McLean married the Métis Margaret Charles; they had one child together, John McLean Junior, before she died the following year. He reached the company headquarters at York Factory in July, eventually receiving instructions to replace Erland Erlandson as the factor of the Ungava District, recently established based on the praise of the area by the Moravian missionaries Kohlmeister and Kmoch following their 1811 visit. Ungava Bay At his base at Fort Chimo (present-day Kuujjuaq, Quebec) up the South River (present- day Koksoak River) from South (Ungava) Bay, McLean was only contacted and resupplied from the outside world by brig. once a year. \\"Surrounded by a country that presents as complete a picture of desolation as can be imagined\\", he avoided lingering there and instead personally led expeditions southeast across the Labrador Peninsula in an attempt to establish overland contact with Fort Smith (present-day North West River, Labrador) at the mouth of the Naskaupi River on Lake Melville, the furthest extent of Esquimaux Bay (now Hamilton Inlet). He expected discovering such a route would lead to his promotion within the company, and his predecessor Erlandson had already accidentally demonstrated its feasibility in 1834 when his attempt to reach Mingan on the St Lawrence had been redirected to Lake Melville by his five Innu guides... On 2 January 1838, he and his men headed out on dogsleds. to take a route up the Koksoak from Erlandson's maps and reports, following the Caniapiscau and Swampy Bay Rivers to Lake Michikamau and the Naskaupi, reaching Fort Smith on 16 February, having taken 46 days to cover . On the way back, their guides fell sick with severe flu and became delirious with fever; game became scarce; and McLean divided his party, taking few provisions and running ahead with a clerk to send supplies back to the rest. Meeting no food on the way, one sled dog starved to death and the two were obliged to eat the other\\"what we considered, in present circumstances, 'food for the gods'\\"to make it back to Fort Chimo. The first party sent south from the fort returned with only one of the missing men, and McLean was obliged to send a second group who returned with the rest of them on 26 April. Having established that the known routes to Hamilton Inlet were impractical, he learned from the locals about the George River to the east. He founded Fort Siveright (present- day Kangiqsualujjuaq) on the eastern shore of its mouth to serve as a salmon and seal fishery... He sent a team under Erlandson to Indian Head Lake to establish Fort Trial as a waystation and depot for the supply route to for outposts further south. After the Koksoak cleared of ice on 25 June 1839,. McLean travelled up Ungava Bay to the George River, which they followed despite its low water until its head of navigation. They then passed overland to where Erlandson had established Fort Nascopie on Petitsikapau Lake. Attempting to complete the route without Innu guides, they got lost and reached the upper Churchill, discovering the Grand Falls (now Churchill Falls). McLean considered it \\"stupendous\\" and \\"one of the grandest spectacles in the world\\", although a hydroelectric project subsequently almost eliminated its flow after 1970. Compelled to return, they reached Fort Chimo on September 20th. He attempted a different route the next year, while William Henry Allen Davies of the company's Esquimaux Bay District led a expedition up the Churchill from Fort Smith. Realizing that Davies had reached almost as far as Churchill Falls, McLean was able to use his report and friendly advice from indigenous locals. to find a route up the George, through a series of lakes around the falls, and along the Naskaupi to Lake Melville in 1841. The company immediately adopted this final route and promoted McLean to chief trader. (Further exploration from Fort Smith eventually showed that the route sought by Finlayson and Erlandson leading directly from Ungava Bay to the St Lawrence was completely impracticable, the forests southwest of Lake Melville being too boggy for travel and their lakes too shallow for the large trading canoes used by the HBC.) Although a more efficient route had now been established, the Hudson's Bay Company still found the Ungava District unprofitable and Gov. Simpson ordered that its ships be sent only every other year. The company opted against giving the district a proper cartographer and contented itself with rough sketch maps, like that compiled under McLean's direction in 1840. McLean's inland route continued to be used, but to supply Fort Nascopie from the south. Feeling isolated and abandoned, McLean took the first furlough in his career, leaving Fort Chimo in 1842 to visit his mother in Scotland, passing York Factory, New York, and Montreal on his route.. The forts he had established were abandoned. The entire Ungava District was eliminated in 1843, while from May to June McLean led a team including a royal magnetic survey under John Henry Lefroy from Lachine (in present-day Quebec) to Norway House. Lefroy reported him \\"a person of intelligence and information beyond what one might expect from a man who has all his life been scraping beaver skins together at remote stations\\" and complimented his flute playing. Mackenzie River The poor conditions at Fort Chimo had so damaged McLean's health that he threatened Governor Simpson with his resignation if he were appointed to \\"a second Ungava\\". With the company refusing to buy back his stock, however, he was forced to remain working and was sent to Fort Simpson (in the present-day Northwest Territories) on the Mackenzie above the Great Slave Lake. He headed the Mackenzie River District from there until June 1844, when Gov. Simpson informed him that he had been only an acting director, that the more senior agent Murdoch McPherson would be assuming permanent command of the district, and that McLean would be obliged to serve under him as a deputy. After a fruitless two years of appeal to the company's governor and board in London, he retired on 1 June 1846. After twenty-five years spent almost continually in the fur-trade, McLean quit the service of the Hudson's Bay Company. Gov. Simpson denied his request for a pension. ===Later life=== Guelph during McLean's time there He had married Clarissa Eugenia Evans, daughter of the missionary and linguist James Evans, in 1845 or 1846 and settled with her in Guelph, Canada West (in present-day Ontario). He built for himself a stone house in Guelph in 1847, which is still standing, at No. 21 Nottingham Street. While there, he managed a grocery store on Market Square for four years, wrote his memoirs, and sired five children. (Two died in infancy, leaving his son Archibald and Eugenia and another daughter to succeeded him.) He opened and managed a branch office of the Bank of Montreal from his house and hired his old companion Erlandson to work there. He helped set up the Guelph Herald, a Conservative newspaper. He was well-read in English, French, and Gaelic and could speak several of the major languages of Canada's indigenous peoples, such that the native traders who visited the town \\"invariably\\" called upon him.. He became an important member of the town and in 1856 laid the cornerstone for the Norfolk Street Wesleyan Methodist Church (the present Lakeside Hope House). By then, however, his financial position had been ruined when he was obliged to repay £1300 stolen from the bank in two incidents in September 1855. (McLean's wife and historians have tended to finger Erlandson for the theft as he left an unexpectedly large estate at his death, but at the time McLean supported his friend and employee and accepted responsibility for the loss.) With what he had left, he moved to nearby Elora, where he served as court clerk for the next 25 years. His wife died 6 May 1858 at the age of 32.. For some years his mother-in-law, Mrs. Evans, lived with him, and cared for his children. Following the American Civil War, when Britain had assisted the Confederacy with blockade running and commerce raiding because of its textile mills' reliance on American cotton, the victorious United States had cancelled its Canadian free trade agreement and demanded enormous reparations. For a time, American expansionists, Canadian separatists, and British anti-imperialists all seemed to support the transfer of the western wilderness of British North America rather than resolving the issue monetarily. It was largely unpopulated and the Hudson's Bay Company had long portrayed it as frozen wastes useless for settlement, mostly to dissuade competitors and the encroachment of farmers and civilization into its trapping grounds. Alarmed by this possibility and unwilling to accept the territories' loss to the Americans (inter alia, he considered the War of 1812 to have been an act of unprovoked aggression), he wrote to newspapers across Canada under the name \\"Viator\\", vividly detailing the beauty and resources of the Canadian west and advocating the purchase of Rupert's Land from the Hudson's Bay Company. His letters to his hometown Elora Lightning Express were reworked into a short book under the name Remarks on the Great Nor'-West. His accounts have been credited with shifting Canadian public opinion against the land transfer, increasing political pressure to find a separate resolution to the dispute. (In the end, the HBC surrendered Rupert's Land to the British Crown, which granted it to the Canadian Confederation; the Confederation assumed British Columbia's debts and promised a transcontinental railroad to secure its consent to admission; and Britain paid off the United States with $15.5 million, more than twice what the US had spent on the Alaska Purchase.) McLean left Elora in 1883 for Victoria, British Columbia. After revealing his identity as \\"Viator\\" in 1889, he died there at the home of his youngest daughter Eugenia O'Brian on 8 March or 8 September 1890. John McLean was buried in the Presbyterian Plot in Ross Bay Cemetery. ==Works== * , considered a major source on Canada's fur trade.. 2nd ed. in 1932 edited by W.S.

This began with the Lan Xang art then Isan art by Chinese and Annamese artisans and has continued to the near present, which is a period that the temples in the Isan were generally determined to be built like those in Bangkok.

The act was introduced in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Parliament, on 19 July 2019 by the Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment, Thawar Chand Gehlot, in light of the lapse of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2018 (Bill No. 210-C of 2016). The 2019 act and the immediately preceding 2018 bill, were both preceded by a 2016 version. They were met with protests and criticism by transgender people, lawyers, and activists in India. The 2016 bill was sent to a standing committee which submitted its report in July 2017. Following this, the Lok Sabha tabled and passed a newer version of the bill in December 2018. However, it did not incorporate many of the committee's recommendations. Although members of the opposition criticised the 2019 act and assured transgender people that they would not vote in favour of it, it was passed by the Lok Sabha on 5 August 2019 and by the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament, on 26 November 2019. The president assented to it on 5 December 2019, upon which the act was published in the Gazette of India. It has been in effect since 10 January 2020 following a notification of the same in the Gazette on the same day. Following protests by the queer community against the 2016 and 2018 bills, the 2019 act has done away with few of the severely criticised provisions of the 2018 bill, such as the criminalisation of begging and the establishment of a district screening committee to process applications for issuance of transgender person certificates. However, it fails to incorporate yet other principles in line with the Supreme Court judgment in National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India (NALSA v. UOI) in 2014, such as the right of transgender people to declare their self- perceived gender identity without undergoing sex reassignment surgery, and reservations in jobs and educational institutions. The act has also been criticised for imposing less punishment for crimes against transgender people compared with punishment for crimes against cisgender people. On 27 January 2020, the Supreme Court issued a notice to the central government in a petition challenging the constitutionality of the act. In January 2014, while judicial pronouncement in the NALSA petition was pending, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment published an Expert Committee Report on issues relating to transgender people, after consultations with transgender people. Tiruchi Siva, of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party, had introduced the Rights of Transgender Persons Bill in 2014, in the Rajya Sabha, which was passed by the house in 2015. It stayed pending in the Lok Sabha, during which the 2016 bill was tabled, and lapsed following the dissolution of the house prior to the 2019 general elections. Parties such as the Indian National Congress and Communist Party of India (Marxist) had promised in their respective electoral manifestoes for the 2019 elections to, respectively, withdraw the 2018 bill — while introducing a new one consulting members of the queer community — and pass one based on the 2014 bill. ==History and background== Hijras in eastern Bengal, circa 1860 On 15 April 2014, the Supreme Court of India delivered its judgment in National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India (NALSA v. UOI), in which it recognised the rights of transgender people in India and laid down a series of measures for securing transgender people's rights by mandating the prohibition of discrimination, recommending the creation of welfare policies, and reservations for transgender people in educational institutions and jobs. The judgment upheld the right of a transgender person to self-perceived gender identity, guaranteed by the Constitution of India, in the absence of sex reassignment surgery. The 2014 judicial mandate was affirmed by the judgments of the Supreme Court in Justice K. S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) and anr. v. Union of India and ors. (2017) and Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India (2018). The judgment in NALSA v. UOI also noted the presence of transgender people in India throughout its history, and made reference to the hijra, kinnar, and jogta communities, spread across the country and elsewhere in the Indian subcontinent. While the decision in the NALSA petition was still pending, an Expert Committee Report on issues relating to transgender people was published in January 2014, after consultations by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment with transgender people in August 2013. In this context, Tiruchi Siva of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party introduced a private member's bill in the Rajya Sabha, namely the Rights of Transgender Persons Bill, 2014 (Bill No. 49 of 2014). The government had initially asked Siva to withdraw the bill due to there being \\"some anomalies\\" in the text; however, the opposition had a majority in the house and the bill was unanimously passed by the Rajya Sabha on 24 April 2015. The bill was welcomed by queer rights activists in India. However, some transgender people noted their absence from the entire process and called for their recommendations to be sought. The Rights of Transgender Persons Bill, 2014 was the first private member's bill to be passed by the Rajya Sabha in thirty-six years and by the Parliament as a whole in forty-five years. Between 1947 and 2015, only sixteen private member's bills were passed. The 2014 bill underwent significant changes when the government drafted its own version of the bill, omitting provisions in the 2014 bill. After recommendations were received from transgender people, the bill was sent to the Ministry of Law and Justice. It came to be known as the Rights of Transgender Persons Bill, 2015. Later, on 26 February 2016, the bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha for debate by Baijayant Panda of the Biju Janata Dal party. He argued that the bill would help extend constitutional rights and end discrimination against transgender people, allowing them to live a life of dignity. The bill was discussed in the Lok Sabha on 29 April 2016. Siva stated that he will not be withdrawing the 2014 bill. While the 2014 bill passed by the Rajya Sabha was still pending, the government tabled the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2016 (Bill No. 210 of 2016), on 2 August 2016, following the reconstitution of the Lok Sabha after the 2014 general elections. The 2016 bill had various provisions which were reportedly regressive and inferior to those in the 2014 bill. The bill was met with criticism and protests from Indian transgender people and was referred to the standing committee, which submitted its report in July 2018. The Lok Sabha tabled and passed a newer version of the bill with twenty-seven amendments on 17 December 2018. The bill was once again met with severe criticism and protests across India, as it overlooked the recommendations made by the standing committee and the suggestions that had been offered by transgender people. The 2018 bill lapsed due to the dissolution of the Lok Sabha. With the house's dissolution, the Rights of Transgender Persons Bill, 2014 that was still pending before the Lok Sabha also lapsed. Following the reconstitution of the Lok Sabha after the 2019 general elections, the bill was reintroduced on 19 July 2019 by the Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment, Thawar Chand Gehlot. Before this the bill had been approved by the union cabinet on 10 July 2019. The bill was passed by a voice vote in the Lok Sabha on 5 August 2019, amidst commotion in the house following the revocation of the state of Jammu and Kashmir's special status by the Parliament on the same day. The bill was introduced in the Rajya Sabha by Thawarchand Gehlot on 20 November 2019, upon which it was passed without any amendments on 26 November 2019 following a motion to refer it to a select committee that failed by 77 noes against 55 ayes. The bill received presidential assent on 5 December 2019, following which the Ministry of Law and Justice published it in the Gazette of India as Act No. 40 of 2019. The act came has been in effect since 10 January 2020 after a notification of the same in the Gazette by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. ==Statutory provisions== The 2018 bill criminalised begging, which many transgender people in India, such as the hijras and jogtas, engage in as a ritual-custom, while some rely on it for livelihood. It had also mandated applications be made to the district magistrate for screening through a district screening committee before the issuance of transgender person certificates. The screening committee was to be composed of five people including a chief medical officer, district social welfare officer, psychologist/psychiatrist, and a representative of transgender people. The 2018 bill had also not provided for mandatory reservations for transgender people and mandated lower punishment for crimes against transgender people, as compared to punishment for crimes against cisgender people under the Indian Penal Code. It also ensured a family-life for transgender children, by prohibiting their separation from their family, without taking into account harassment and discrimination they may face within their family as a result of which they may voluntarily choose to be separated and to reside instead with other transgender people. A transgender child, as per the provisions, can be separated from their family only by a court order. Similar to the 2019 statute, the 2018 bill also required one to undergo sex reassignment surgery to be legally recognised as a man or a woman in official documents. The 2019 act does away with only a few of the criticised provisions of the 2018 bill, such as the district screening committee and the criminalisation of begging. The statutory provisions of the 2019 act prohibit discrimination against transgender people. Similar to the 2018 bill, the 2019 act includes intersex people, hijras, jogtas, and kinnars within its definition of transgender people, as well as trans-men, trans-women, and genderqueers, though these latter terms are undefined. Both the 2019 act as well as the 2018 bill describe a transgender person as someone whose gender does not match with the gender assigned to them at birth. Under the provisions of the 2019 act, a transgender person can apply to the district magistrate for a transgender person certificate which will give them the right to change the name on their birth certificate and have all documents updated accordingly. However, similar to the 2018 bill provisions, a transgender person can be identified as male or female only after applying for a revised certificate to the district magistrate, post sex reassignment surgery. The 2019 act also protects transgender children and provides for states and institutions to come up with adequate policies to ensure the welfare of transgender people. Similar to the provisions of the 2018 bill, under the provisions of the 2019 act a transgender child can be separated from their family by a court order. However, unlike the Rights of Transgender Persons Bill, 2014 neither the 2018 bill nor the 2019 act provide for reservations for transgender people in educational institutions and jobs. The 2014 bill had provided for two per-cent reservations in educational institutions and public employment. Similar to the 2018 bill, the 2019 act provides for punishment for crimes against transgender people, which stands as an imprisonment for a term not less than six months but which may extend to two years and a fine. The 2019 act, as well as the 2018 bill, also provide for the constitution of a National Council for Transgender Persons. On 18 April 2020, the government published Draft Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Rules, 2020 in exercise of its powers under the 2019 statute, seeking comments and suggestions on the same from the public. ==Criticism and reactions== Protests against the 2018 bill in Mumbai, in December 2018 The 2018 bill passed by the Lok Sabha was widely criticised by transgender people, activists, students, and lawyers. Transgender people protested in various cities in India calling the provisions regressive and in violation of the Supreme Court's 2014 judgment in NALSA v. UOI. The criminalisation of begging under the 2018 bill was to affect transgender people in India, such as hijras and jogtas, who engage in begging as a ritual-custom while some rely on it for livelihood. It was alleged by critics that the provision establishing the district screening committees left gaps for incompetence and prejudice. Hindustan Times reported that even if the provision of a district screening committee existed to prevent imposters from seeking benefits of government welfare schemes, such an arrangement cannot be made at the expense of transgender people's right to self-determination. The definition of transgender people under the 2018 bill, retained by the 2019 act, was reported by Frontline to be different than how transgender identity is understood internationally. The 2018 bill and 2019 act have been met with protests by transgender people. The day of their passing has been referred to some transgender people as a \\"black day\\" and as \\"gender justice murder day\\". Others described them as \\"draconian and discriminatory\\". After the 2018 bill was passed by the Lok Sabha in December, members of the opposition in the Rajya Sabha had stated they will not let the bill pass in its present form in the Rajya Sabha. Protestors alleged the 2018 bill institutionalises violence and decried what they saw as neglect of the recommendations made by the standing committee and by transgender people. Transgender people called the requirement of applications to be made to the district magistrate for issuance of transgender certificates, the lesser punishment for crimes against transgender people, and the absence of provisions on mandatory reservations for transgender people regressive to the judicial mandate of the Supreme Court in 2014 in NALSA v. UOI, thereby violating their right to equality and other fundamental rights. In the run-up to the 2019 general elections to the Lok Sabha, the Indian National Congress had promised in its electoral manifesto to withdraw the 2018 bill and introduce a new one, in consultation with members of the queer community. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) supported the passing of the 2014 bill in its electoral manifesto. In April 2019, transgender rights activist Laxmi Narayan Tripathi, met the then Bharatiya Janata Party National General Secretary, Ram Madhav, asking the party to introduce a revised bill if it were to return to power. Madhav assured her that he would address the concerns of the transgender community. Soon after news reported that the 2019 bill was approved by the union cabinet, transgender rights activists held a press conference in Delhi to address the issue. On 24 November 2019, two days before the bill was passed by the parliament, protests were staged by the queer community in New Delhi and Bengaluru as part of the Delhi queer pride parade and the Bengaluru Namma Pride March, respectively. The legislation also drew criticism from the All India Mahila Congress and opposition from parliamentarians including Jaya Bachchan and Sasmit Patra, while Derek O’Brien and Tiruchi Siva also expressed their concerns before the house. After the legislation was passed by the parliament, transgender people and activists protested against the legislation, organised meetings to address the situation, and urged the president not to sign and give his assent to the bill. There were also protests by the queer community against the act as part of the Mumbai pride parade in February 2020. The legislation has been criticised by Human Rights Watch and the International Commission of Jurists. On 27 January 2020, the Supreme Court issued a notice requiring the central government to respond in a petition challenging the constitutionality of the 2019 legislation, filed by judge and transgender rights activist Swati Bidhan Baruah. On 12 June 2020, the Supreme Court issued notice to the government in another petition filed challenging the constitutionality of the statute, tagging it with the petition filed by Baruah. ==See also== *LGBT rights in India *Human rights in India *National Council for Transgender Persons ==References== ==External links== * Category:Transgender rights in India Category:Modi administration Category:Transgender law Category:2019 in Indian law Category:Acts of the Parliament of India 2019 ","title":"Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019"},{"id":"61534494","text":"Joseph Girard may refer to: *Joseph Girard (Canadian politician) (1853–1933), Canadian politician *Joseph Girard (Swiss politician) (1815–1890), Swiss politician *Joseph Girard (historian) (1881–1962), French historian, librarian and museum curator *Joseph W.

The Great Northern Railway was authorised in 1846 and was to build from London to York via Newark and also a \\"Loop Line\\" via Lincoln. The GNR leased and operated the East Lincolnshire Railway. The construction proceeded in stages, and the line from Peterborough through Boston to Lincoln opened in 1848. The East Lincolnshire Railway from Boston to Grimsby opened in the same year. Gradually the GNR filled in the space between the Loop Line and the coast. East-west connections were developed, and holiday and excursion traffic proved a huge development. The haulage of coal from the Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire coalfields to London and East Anglia was a lucrative traffic. There was relatively little competition from rival railways in the area, and the network as a whole was successful. However the rural character of many of the lines meant that commercially they were of limited success. In 1879 the GNR had to concede the construction of a joint railway with the Great Eastern Railway, which abstracted considerable revenue from the mineral traffic income. After about 1965 many of the lines declined substantially, and in 1970 a widespread closure took place, leaving only key routes from the former GNR network. ==Origins to authorisation== The Great Northern Railway in Lincolnshire in 1848After the commercial success of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (opened 1830), a number of schemes were promoted for longer distance railways. The Railway Mania took hold, and a huge number of railway projects were promoted, in many cases with little care in design, and investors scrambled to subscribe to them, hoping to make a quick fortune. In 1844 the London and York Railway was proposed; it met with fierce opposition: from the railways controlled by George Hudson, which already provided a railway connection to the north of England, and from rival schemes. The extent of the proposed London and York undertaking dwarfed that of any railway project in this country before or since: a \\"leviathan undertaking\\".Charles H Grinling, History of the Great Northern Railway, 1845 – 1895, Methuen and Co, London, 1898, page 21 The deposited plans consisted of: * The main line, London to York: 186 miles; * A loop line off the main line, from Peterborough to Bawtry via Boston and Lincoln: 86 miles; * A branch from Bawtry to Sheffield: miles; and * A branch from Doncaster to Wakefield: miles.John Wrottesley, The Great Northern Railway: volume I: Origins and Development, B T Batsford Limited, London, 1979, , page 14 In the 1846 session of Parliament, the London and York Railway was successful in gaining authorisation, on 26 June; it changed its title in the process to the Great Northern Railway.Wrottesley, volume 1, page 17 However the Bawtry to Sheffield branch was rejected, in favour of a rival scheme, the Sheffield and Lincolnshire Junction Railway.Wrottesley, volume 1, page 21 The Wakefield branch too was lost, but a line from Askern (north of Doncaster) to Methley (near Leeds) was authorised to the Great Northern's ally, the Manchester and Leeds Railway.Grinling, page 61 ==East Lincolnshire Railway== The gNR lines in 1850The East Lincolnshire Railway was authorised on the same day as the Great Northern Railway in 1846. It was to be an independent railway from Boston to Grimsby via Louth. The directors of the GNR immediately arranged to lease the ELR; in doing so they secured nearly all of Lincolnshire into their control. \\"Somewhat improvidently\\" the ELR proprietors were guaranteed a permanent 6% lease rental.Wrottesley, volume 1, page 23 The lease of an unbuilt railway was feasible, because the lease payment was to be 6% of the paid-up capital, which was minimal at first. The promoters of the East Lincolnshire Railway had intended that their Boston terminus should be on the Haven bank at the end of Pulvertoft Lane but, under pressure from Boston Town Council during the passage of their bill through Parliament, they decided to use the GNR's station in the town.Neil R Wright, The Railways of Boston: Their Origins and Development, Richard Kay Publications, Boston, 1971, , page 17 Having taken control, the GNR now managed the construction of the East Lincolnshire Line. The East Lincolnshire Company remained in existence, handling the lease charge and dividend payments, but now took a back seat. It was still in existence at the grouping of the railways in 1923 following the Railways Act 1921.David Wragg, LNER Handbook: the London & North Eastern Railway 1923 – 1947, Haynes Publishing, Yeovil, 2011, , page 12 ==Taking stock== The Board were elated to have secured authorisation of their line, and reviewed what should be done in the light of the loss of the Sheffield branch. The GNR's authorised line was from London to York, dividing into two routes between Peterborough and Bawtry: a direct line through Grantham, Newark and Retford, (which soon became known as the \\"Towns Line\\",) and a roundabout route via Spalding, Boston and Lincoln (which was called the \\"Loop Line\\"). They converged at Bawtry because the intended GNR Sheffield branch was to connect there, but that had been cut out of the authorisation, and the Sheffield and Lincolnshire Junction Railway was authorised to make a similar line. The Board decided that the Loop Line should join the Towns Line further north, at Rossington, a few miles south of Doncaster. In 1847 a Parliamentary Bill was submitted to authorise the necessary line from Gainsborough to Rossington,Wrottesley, volume 1, page 25 but it was rejected in Parliament.Wrottesley, volume 1, page 27 ==Construction and first openings== Faced with 319 miles of railwayLondon to York 186 miles; Loop Line 86 miles; East Lincolnshire Line 47 miles. to construct, the Board decided to prioritise on construction of the Loop Line and the East Lincolnshire Line, as they presented easier technical challenges. In fact the first part of the network to open was on the East Lincolnshire Line, from Louth to Grimsby; it opened on 1 March 1848. On the same day the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway opened its line from Brigg and New Holland to Grimsby. New Holland gave access by ferry to Kingston upon Hull. The Great Northern Railway worked the trains on the East Lincolnshire Line, and it was agreed with the MS&LR; that each company's trains would operate throughout between New Holland and Louth. The East Lincolnshire Railway had originally planned a separate station, but it had been agreed that the GNR would use the MS&LR; station. This opening was followed by the section from Louth to FirsbyWrottesley says that Firsby was spelt Firstby at the time, but it is impossible to corroborate that. Ludlam repeats it, but that is merely derivative. Allen, writing a geographical history in 1834, consistently used Firsby, and it seems likely that the variant spelling is a transcription error by Wrottesley. on 3 September 1848. The final stage was opened on 2 October 1848Date from Wrottesley. Grinling and Ludlam say 1 October, but that was a Sunday. from Firsby to a temporary station at Boston.A J Ludlam, The East Lincolnshire Railway, Oakwood Press, Headington, 1991, , page 6Wrottesley, volume 1, pages 33 and 34Grinling, page 79Thomas Allen, The History of the County of Lincoln from the Earliest Period to the Present Time, published by John Saunders Junior, London, 1834, volume II, page 147 The East Lincolnshire Line was complete. ==Construction of the Loop Line to Lincoln== The GNR in 1852So far as the GNR's own network was concerned, the Directors had decided to concentrate on construction of the Loop Line, as that was technically simpler than other areas. A large section of the GNR Loop Line was soon ready, and 58 miles from Walton Junction (near Peterborough) to Lincoln via Boston opened on 17 October 1848. GNR trains reached Peterborough over the Midland Railway's line, and passengers and goods could reach London from Peterborough over the Eastern Counties Railway or the London and North Western Railway.Grinling, pages 79 and 80 The GNR Lincolnshire Loop was alongside the Midland Railway at the present-day Werrington Junction. It is likely the temporary connection was made there. There was no community named Werrington at the time, and Walton was the nearest identifiable settlement. The GNR provided a temporary engine shed at \\"Walton\\" so evidently the Midland Railway hauled the GNR trains to and from Peterborough,Wrottesley, page 37 Near the Grand Sluice at Boston, the East Lincolnshire Line and the Loop Line converged, and passed awkwardly as a single line between Witham Town and the River Witham.Wrottesley, volume 1, page 34 The GNR obtained an Act on 1 August 1849, for a deviation at Boston by-passing the single line section, and enlargement of the stations at Boston and Lincoln. The Boston deviation, consisting of 52 chains of double track including 13 chains on the East Lincolnshire Line was commissioned on Sunday 11 May 1850, making the Loop and East Lincolnshire Line double throughout.Wrottesley, volume 1, page 37 For a while the steam packets on the River Witham continued to operate between Boston and Lincoln, and the railway introduced a fourth class at a very low fare of a halfpenny a mile. The steam packets did not give up the fight until 1861.Wrottesley, volume 1, page 51 ==Lincoln northwards== The original intention had been to build from Lincoln to Bawtry, via Gainsborough. At Bawtry the Loop Line was to join the Towns Line, and there would also be a branch from Bawtry to Sheffield. However the Sheffield branch had been thrown out by Parliament in 1846. The Board had considered what to do and they decided that it would be better if the Loop Line continued from Gainsborough to join the Towns Line further north, at Rossington, a few miles south of Doncaster.Wrottesley, volume 1, page 31 This required a fresh Act of Parliament, but this too was thrown out in 1847, and again the following year. With construction progressing, it was becoming urgent to find a way of connecting the north end of the Loop Line. The MS&LR; had powers to build a line that would shorten the route between Lincoln and Retford. This had been authorised in 1846 as the Sheffield and Lincolnshire Extension Railway, which was then amalgamated with others to form the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway. The GNR asked the MS&LR; to commence construction of this line. Although the MS&LR; had shelved the project, it proved very co- operative and ordered its construction. The line was 8 miles long, and became known as the \\"Leverton Branch\\". Meanwhile the Lincoln to Gainsborough section of the Loop Line was ready. Captain Wynne of the Board of Trade inspected the line on 29 March 1849, but refused permission to open until signals were provided at the swing bridge at Brayford Mere (Lincoln). They were duly provided, and the line was opened on 9 April 1849. The route made a junction with the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway at Gainsborough; GNR trains reversed at the junction and used the MS&LR; station at Gainsborough. At this stage the MS&LR; line did not yet cross the River Trent; the two routes converged and ended together at the river bank.Wrottesley, volume 1, page 41 From 17 July 1849 the MS&LR; crossed the Trent and ran through to Sheffield via Retford and Worksop.Wrottesley, volume 1, page 42 ==Reaching Retford, Sheffield and Doncaster== The Towns Line had not been neglected: the section from Retford to Doncaster opened on Tuesday 4 September 1849. It made a junction at Retford with the MS&LR; route from Lincoln. This enabled the GNR to run trains from Peterborough to Leeds, via Boston, Lincoln and Gainsborough, then over the MS&LR; to Retford, and thence on its own line northwards, using running powers and agreements to reach Leeds from there.Wrottesley, volume 1, page 43 In May 1850 the GNR understood that the Leverton branch was ready, and published an intended opening date for its own services of 1 July 1850. However the MS&LR;, previously co-operative, physically blocked the line on that day, and the GNR had to continue to send its traffic round via Gainsborough. The GNR intended to run trains to Sheffield, for which it had running powers, and the MS&LR; could run to Lincoln. The argument seems to have been resolved, resulting in the Leverton Branch being used from 7 August 1850. This shortened the route to Leeds, as well as enabling the Sheffield service.Wrottesley, volume 1, page 49 The matter looked different from the MS&LR; point of view: > The Leverton line was fit to carry goods traffic (but not passenger traffic > owing to the absence of signalling) and on 26th January Allport [General > Manager of the MS&LR;] was instructed to start working goods trains over it. > But the Great Northern thwarted this by refusing to allow MS&L; trains to > pass between Sykes Junction and Lincoln. The line was eventually opened on > 7th August, when the Great Northern, adopting a more reasonable attitude, > made use of it to introduce a through service between Doncaster and Lincoln > via Retford.George Dow, Great Central: volume 1: the Progenitors, 1813 – > 1863, Locomotive Publishing Co Ltd, London, 1959 The GNR was reconsidering > the northern part of the route to York, and on 6 June 1850 it agreed with > the York and North Midland Railway to use that company's line from > Knottingley to York, and to abandon the GNR's plans for its own line to > York. ==Towns line opened== The GNR in 1867On 7 August 1850 the GNR opened the southern end of its line from Peterborough to London.Wrottesley, volume 1, page 54 On 15 July 1852 the rest of the Towns Line opened to goods, and on 1 August 1852 to all traffic. Through trains to the north were transferred to the Towns Line.Wrottesley, volume 1, page 76 This meant that as soon as Kings Cross station opened fully on 14 October 1852Wrottesley, volume 1, page 79 the entire network as originally authorised in 1846 was open, with the exception of the Gainsborough to Bawtry section, which had been abandoned. The approval of a Gainsborough to Rossington line remained to be secured. ==Grimsby Fish Dock co-operation== The MS&LR; formed a subsidiary in 1854 to build and operate a fish dock at Grimsby, in collaboration with the Midland Railway and the GNR: the Grimsby Deep Sea Fishing Company was formed and several vessels were purchased. The dock was equipped with an icehouse, and fishermen's cottages were built. After two years, each of the three companies had lost about £2,000, and in 1858 the GNR board recommended that the company be wound up and the vessels and plant sold.Wrottesley, volume 1, page 89 ==Consolidation== Having built the authorised lines, the GNR did not at first seek to build new lines within Lincolnshire, and was reluctant to assist independent lines. ==Essendine railways== The independent Stamford and Essendine Railway opened in 1856. Stamford was an important town, but it already had a Midland Railway connection, and the new route requiring a change of trains at Essendine was unpopular. The associated Bourn (later spelt Bourne) and Essendine Railway opened in 1860. In an effort to encourage traffic the Stamford and Essendine company extended southwards to Wansford, opening in 1867. These lines were worked by the GNR, and later acquired by the company, but they were both commercially unsuccessful.Peter Paye, Great Northern Railway Branches from Stamford, Lightmoor Press, Lydney, 2017, Wrottesley, volume 1, pages 138 to 149 ==Boston, Sleaford and Midland Counties Railway== The Boston, Sleaford and Midland Counties Railway opened between Grantham and Boston through Sleaford, in two stages, in 1857 and 1859. Coupled with the Ambergate, Nottingham, Boston and Eastern Junction Railway which had opened in 1850 and connected Nottingham to Grantham, the line provided an important west to east route, connecting the East Midlands to the east coast of Lincolnshire. Both lines were worked by the GNR.P Howard Anderson, Forgotten Railways: volume 2: the East Midlands, David St John Thomas, Newton Abbot, 1985, , pages 111 to 113Robin Leleux, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain, volume 9: the East Midlands, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1976, , pages 123 to 127 ==Gainsborough to Doncaster== The GNR in 1922By an Act of 25 July 1864 the GNR at last obtained powers to build its Gainsborough to Doncaster line; it had been trying since 1847. It was authorised to raise £408,000 in share capital for the purpose.Wrottesley, volume 1, page 150 The Act also provided for flattening the old line from Sykes Junction to Gainsborough. Bridges over the numerous watercourses were approached by short steep gradients. This section was temporarily closed on 1 December 1864; trains ran to Gainsborough via Retford for the time being. The new line was to have a bridge over the River Trent, but to save considerable expense an agreement was made with the MS&LR; for the GNR to use its bridge at Bole (the River Trent crossing at Gainsborough). This change of plan was approved by an Act of 28 June 1866. The new line from Trent West Junction to Black Carr Junction with the Towns line near Doncaster, and the rebuilt line from Sykes junction to Trent East junction were brought into use for goods on 1 July 1867, and for passengers on 15 July 1867. Construction involved unusually heavy earthworks, to keep the formation almost level, the steepest gradient being 1 in 300. The passenger train service consisted of four each way between Lincoln and Doncaster on weekdays and one each way on Sundays. About 17 daily coal trains were diverted over the new line. The GNR ceased to exercise its powers between Sykes junction and Retford in 1868. Stations were at Marton, Lea (on the earlier line) and Gainsborough, Beckingham, Walkeringham, Misterton, Haxey, and Finningley.Wrottesley, volume 1, page 166 ==Honington to Lincoln== A branch had been authorised by the Lincoln and Bourn Railway Act of 1864. It was cut back to run between Honington, east of Grantham, and Lincoln, and it opened in 1862.Grinling, pages 203 and 217 ==Spilsby branch== On 1 May 1868 the Spilsby branch opened; it was a short line from Firsby (on the East Lincolnshire line) where the junction faced Louth. The independent company was constantly short of money, and for some years the GNR gave it a subsidy to keep it operational. The GNR worked the line.Paul Anderson, Railways of Lincolnshire, Irwell Press, Oldham, 1992, , page 63 ==Skegness branch== Skegness was becoming an important resort by the seaside, and the Wainfleet and Firsby Railway opened in 1871. In this case too the junction at Firsby faced Louth. The line was worked by the GNR, with eight trains each way every weekday. Passengers completed their journey to Skegness by road until 1873, when an extension of the branch line to Skegness was opened.Stephen Walker, Firsby to Wainfleet and Skegness, KMS Books, Boston, 1987, , pages 7 and 8 ==Sleaford and Bourn Railway== The Sleaford and Bourn Railway was opened in stages in 1871 and 1872. The railway changed its spelling of Bourn to Bourne in 1872. The line was owned by the GNR.John Wrottesley, The Great Northern Railway: volume II: Expansion and Competition, B T Batsford Limited, London, 1979, , page 10 ==Nottingham to Skegness avoiding Grantham== The Ambergate, Nottingham, Boston and Eastern Junction Railway had constructed a line from Nottingham to Grantham and the Boston, Sleaford and Midland Counties Railway had built a line east from Grantham. There was a significant mineral flow from Nottingham to the Lincolnshire towns, as well as a developing holiday and excursion traffic. The GNR built the Sedgebrook and Barkstone (later spelt Barkston) Junction Line, connecting the two routes and avoiding Grantham. It opened in 1875.Wrottesley, volume 2, pages 26 and 27 ==Louth to Bardney Line== A railway was planned connecting Louth to Lincoln; the plan was to give Lincoln a direct route to Grimsby via Louth. Although authorised, the Louth and Lincoln Railway Company was unable to raise enough money to build the line. Eventually it was sold on, and the route shortened to run between Louth and Bardney. At Bardney the connection was installed facing Boston, making through running inconvenient. The line opened in stages between 1874 and 1876. It was never commercially successful, and was reluctantly taken over by the GNR in 1883.A J Ludlam, Branch Lines of East Lincolnshire: volume 1: Louth to Bardney, published by Lincolnshire Wolds Railway Society, 2015, ==The GN and GE Joint Line== The haulage of coal from Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire to the south of England and East Anglia was extremely lucrative, and for many years the Great Eastern Railway, connecting the GNR at Peterborough, had sought to get a larger part of the trade. Several attempts had been made to be permitted to build northwards, consistently refused by Parliament. The GNR could see that Parliamentary opinion was moving in favour of the GER and that it was only a matter of time before that company was granted its desire. The GNR proposed a Joint Line between Doncaster and March; this would involve a new line from Spalding to Lincoln, and transfer of the Lincoln – Gainsborough – Doncaster (Black Carr Junction) line to joint control. This became the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Line, implemented in 1882 and 1883. The Great Eastern route from March to Huntingdon was also transferred to joint control. The GER profited immensely from this new arrangement, bringing coal to East Anglia, and also to London via Cambridge. The March to Huntingdon transfer was supposed to enable the GNR to use that line for mineral traffic to avoid the congested lines south of Grantham, but the route involved reversal at St Ives, and was of limited practical value.Wrottesley, volume 2, page 98 The GNR chairman defended the scheme on the basis that sharing the Joint Line was better than enabling the GER to build a competing line.C T Goode, The Great Northern & Great Eastern Joint Railway, published by C T Goode, Anlaby, 1989, Wrottesley, volume 2, pages 51 to 53 The line from Spalding to Ruskington opened on 6 March 1882. The GNR March-Spalding, and the GER Huntingdon-St Ives and Needingworth junction-March lines were transferred to the Joint Committee. The remainder of the new line, Ruskington to Sincil junction, Lincoln, and an avoiding line, in July and August 1882.Wrottesley, volume 2, pages 95 and 96 ==Louth and East Coast Railway== The Louth and East Coast Railway opened a line from Louth to Mablethorpe in 1877. Mablethorpe was a rising seaside resort, and the railway connection helped it considerably. However as elsewhere in Lincolnshire, the junction was laid facing against the dominant traffic.Anderson, page 67 ==The route for Skegness traffic== Skegness had proved an extremely popular seaside resort, particularly with excursionists. All excursion trains had to reverse at Firsby, and a south curve there was considered essential. The Board of Trade sanctioned it for passenger traffic on 24 May 1881. Barkstone (later spelt Barkston) North curve was opened on 29 March 1882, enabling through running from Newark and the north towards Lincoln. The GNR asked for the doubling of the line from Firsby to Skegness but the Wainsfleet and Firsby Railway was not prepared to find the money. Some palliative improvements were carried out in 1883.Wrottesley, volume 2, page 94 ==Sutton on Sea== The Sutton & Willoughby Railway & Dock Co was authorised in 1884 to build from Willoughby on the East Lincolnshire Line to Sutton on Sea and build docks there; authorised capital was £60,000. The line opened in 1886 but the docks were never built. In 1888 the line was extended to Mablethorpe, making a complete loop. ==The New Line== The seaside resorts of the Lincolnshire Coast proved increasingly popular, with holidaymakers and excursionists, especially from the industrial population centres of the East Midlands and Yorkshire. The route for most trains involved running via Boston and reversing there, a considerable diversion from a direct line. After a request by Skegness Town Council, the GNR built the New Line, forming a short cut between Kirkstead and Little Steeping, opened in 1913. ==Consolidation and decline== The Lincolnshire network of the Great Northern Railway can be categorised into the main lines, the seaside resorts, and rural branch lines. The main lines continued to thrive, with both passenger and goods traffic. There was only limited competition from the Midland Railway and the Great Central Railway (successor to the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway). Nevertheless the city of Lincoln and the port town of Boston never became major centres of industry, and the traffic they generated was limited. The seaside resorts, Skegness, Sutton and Mablethorpe did very well for passenger traffic, and were remarkably popular. They continued to be so even as British seaside holidays declined in the mid-1960s. The rural branches in general were not successful, largely due to the relatively sparse population in the area. As road transport began to be efficient from the late 1920s, and soon much more convenient, most of those lines were doomed. When rationalisation was the priority in the late 1960s, the main lines were seen to be duplicated by alternative lines, and were slated for closure. Mablethorpe and Sutton declined as resorts. In 1970 a widespread closure of the former GNR lines in Lincolnshire took place. Skegness continued to be served via Grantham, Sleaford and Boston, but the rest of the East Lincolnshire Line closed. By this time most of the rural branch lines had already closed. Most of the GN&GE; Joint Line continued in use, together with the Peterborough to Spalding feeder. Most of the rest of the former GNR network closed, or had already closed. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Rail transport in Lincolnshire Category:Great Northern Railway (Great Britain) ","title":"Lincolnshire lines of the Great Northern Railway"},{"id":"61534504","text":"is a Prefectural Natural Park in Akita Prefecture, Japan.

She was the chief librarian of the Auckland War Memorial Museum Library from 1946 to 1970. == Biography == === Early life === Evans was born in Gore, New Zealand, on 8 October 1914 to Robert Edward Evans and Annie Evans (née Shaw). Her father was a Presbyterian minister and in 1916 the family moved to Dunedin, as he had been transferred to North East Valley. Evans attended North East Valley School until 1926 when the family moved again, to Hāwera, Taranaki. She then attended Hawera Main School and Hawera High School. In 1932 Evans' father was appointed minister at Mount Albert Presbyterian Church in Auckland, and the family moved one more time. From 1933 to 1938, Evans studied English and French at Auckland University College, graduating with a bachelor of arts degree. === Career === In 1936, while still studying, Evans started working in the college library as an assistant to Alice Minchin. In 1942 she was promoted to a first assistant, and from 1945 to 1946 served as acting librarian following Minchin's retirement. During this time Evans also studied for a librarian's qualification with the Library Association of England. In 1946 Evans was appointed chief librarian at the Auckland War Memorial Museum Library, the first professional librarian to be employed there. During her tenure she was instrumental in acquiring a number of significant archival collections: in 1952 the library acquired the Edward Earl Vaile collection on Pacific exploration, and in 1969 acquired a donation of early New Zealand newspapers from publishers Wilson and Horton. In 1961 Evans accepted the New Zealand Women's Archive from Enid Roberts, who had begun the archive of notable New Zealand women's biographies in 1955. Chief librarians at other research libraries in the country had declined to accept the collection, however Evans not only accepted the archive, but actively developed it through regular workshops with local members of the National Council of Women. Evans worked to enable easier access to the library collection for researchers by manually indexing early colonial newspapers and letters and manuscripts of early missionaries and other settlers. She also made significant contributions to the training of new librarians, by teaching Library Certificate courses for the New Zealand Library Association Inc. and by writing a textbook on classifying and cataloging. Evans used her knowledge to write non-fiction articles on Auckland and New Zealand history and people, including in The New Zealand Herald and the Auckland Star newspapers, the Encyclopaedia of New Zealand and the Dictionary of New Zealand Biography. Evans retired from the library in 1970, aged 56 years old. She later worked as a reference librarian at the Auckland Public Library and was librarian for the Royal Australasian College of Physicians in New Zealand. In the 1989 New Year Honours, Evans was awarded the Queen's Service Medal for community service. Evans died in 2011, aged 96. ==References== Category:1914 births Category:2011 deaths Category:New Zealand librarians Category:Recipients of the Queen's Service Medal Category:New Zealand non-fiction writers Category:University of Auckland alumni Category:People from Gore, New Zealand Category:People educated at Hawera High School ","title":"Enid Evans"},{"id":"61534625","text":"Michael James Lewis Willard (born 24 March 1938) is an English former cricketer who played 41 first-class cricket matches for Cambridge University between 1959 and 1961.Michael Willard, CricInfo.

He was described as \\"one of the most influential figures in Welsh local government\\". ==Background== Squire was born on 22 May 1905 in Bridgend, Glamorgan. He started working for his family's haulage business as a teenager. He initially joined the Independent Labour Party, but transferred to the Labour Party in 1930. He married Doris May in 1931. He lived in Tondu. ==Politics and public service== Squire was elected to Ynysawdre Parish Council in 1934. He was subsequently elected as a county councillor to Glamorgan County Council in 1946. He became an alderman in the mid-1950s, serving for 19 years until the dissolution of the County Council in 1974. Squire also became chair of Penybont Rural Council and was an officer of the Bridgend branch of the National Farmers Union. On the dissolution of Glamorgan County Council and creation of the authorities of Mid, South and West Glamorgan in 1974, Squire became chairman and leader of Mid Glamorgan County Council. Mid Glamorgan was the largest of the three new counties with a population of more than 530,000 stretching from the rural South Wales coast to the old industrial coal mining areas of the South Wales Valleys. The new authority was dominated by the Labour Party and was sometimes described as a \\"Squirearchy\\". Squire continued to lead Mid Glamorgan Council for 15 years until retiring at the age of 83. Squire is credited with working hard to get the best deal for what was one of Britain's poorest counties.

He oversaw early clinical trials of the first oral contraceptive pill in Puerto Rican women and later became a professor of human reproduction at the University of Pennsylvania. ==Early life== Celso-Ramón García was born in 1922 to Spanish immigrants in New York City. He completed an undergraduate degree in chemistry at Queens College and then a medical degree at SUNY Downstate Medical Center, graduating in 1945. After an internship at Norwegian Hospital in Brooklyn, he served in the U.S. Army Medical Corps for two years, working at Valley Forge General Hospital in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, and at Ladd Air Force Base in Fairbanks, Alaska. In 1948 he returned to Brooklyn, where he completed his residency in obstetrics and gynecology at Cumberland Hospital. ==Career== In 1953, due to a lack of academic positions in the U.S., García moved to Puerto Rico to take up a position as assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Puerto Rico's newly established medical school. Soon afterwards he was introduced to Gregory Pincus, who with John Rock was preparing to commence clinical trials of the first oral contraceptive pill. Pincus recruited García to oversee the trials of the pill in Puerto Rico, while Rock arranged for García to commence a fellowship in infertility at the Free Hospital for Women in Brookline, Massachusetts. He soon moved to Boston to work at Harvard Medical School with Rock, commuting frequently to Puerto Rico to manage the contraceptive pill trials. Rock and García moved their practice briefly to Faulkner Hospital before returning to the Free Hospital for Women. García was hired by Pincus as a senior scientist at the Worcester Foundation for Biomedical Research in 1960 and became chief of the infertility clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital in 1962. Although the Puerto Rican oral contraceptive trials had finished by this time, García continued to visit Puerto Rico regularly to perform post-trial surveillance on women who had participated in the trial and through this process published important research on long-term side effects of the pill and how well it was accepted by patients. García left Boston for Pennsylvania in 1965, when he was appointed chair of the obstetrics and gynecology department at the University of Pennsylvania. In Pennsylvania, he pioneered what he called \\"conservational surgery\\" for fallopian tube defects, which in the pre-IVF era was the only fertility-preserving treatment for women with tubal disease. After a sabbatical in Germany with Kurt Semm, García established one of the first programs for minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery in the United States. He also used a novel approach to prevent intra-abdominal adhesions: intraperitoneal corticosteroids and antihistamines. He served on the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania for 39 years, ultimately in the position of William Shippen, Jr. Professor of Human Reproduction. ==Affiliations== García served as president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the American Association of Planned Parenthood Physicians, the National Medical Committees of Planned Parenthood of America, and the Society of Reproductive Surgeons. He was a fellow of the American College of Surgeons. ==Death== García died from cardiovascular disease on February 1, 2004, in Boston, four weeks after his wife, Shirley Stoddard, had died. The Celso-Ramón García Professorship of Obstetrics & Gynecology was established at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in 1994. ==References== Category:1922 births Category:2004 deaths Category:American people of Spanish descent Category:Queens College, City University of New York alumni Category:SUNY Downstate Medical Center alumni Category:Fellows of the American College of Surgeons Category:Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania faculty Category:University of Puerto Rico faculty Category:American gynecologists Category:American obstetricians ","title":"Celso-Ramón García"},{"id":"61536511","text":"is a Prefectural Natural Park in Akita Prefecture, Japan.

As a teenager he attended the Swiss college of Trotzen but was expelled for his lack of discipline. ==First World War == The outbreak of the First World War saw him serve as a lieutenant in the Royal Italian Army. Attracted by flying, he obtained his pilot's licence at the civilian flying club at the Torino-Mirafiori airfield. After further practice he was assigned the rank of lieutenant in the Corpo Aeronautico Militare on 1 December 1915, flying :it:SAML/Aviatik B.I aircraft from the Verona-Tombetta airfield, as part of the :it:4ª Squadriglia caccia which became, from 15 April 1916 the :it:73ª Squadriglia. During a night flight over Desenzano he was mistakenly attacked by an Italian seaplane-fighter, which he was only able to disengage from through a series of difficult manoeuvres. On landing he claimed that the damage to his plane had been caused by enemy aircraft, so as to cover up the mistake of his Italian fellow-aviator. In 1916 he was licensed to fly :it:Nieuport-Macchi Ni.10 and Nieuport Ni.11 fighters, built under licence by Macchi di Varese. In February 1917 he as assigned to the :it:80ª Squadriglia caccia. Here he challenged an Austro-Hungarian pilot to a weaponless single combat, in which the winner would be the pilot who succeeded in taking his opponent's tail. Keller won the challenge, after which his plane was accompanied back to the Italian lines by an escort of Austro-Hungarian aircraft. On 1 November that year he transferred to the :it:91ª Squadriglia aeroplani da caccia commanded by Francesco Baracca. When Baracca did not return from the action which saw him shot down over Montello, Keller undertook a reconnaissance mission flying over the enemy front line several times searching vainly for his commander. He was one of the pallbearers at Baracca's funeral. Shortly before the end of the war he undertook a strafing mission against enemy troops near Godega di Sant'Urbano. His plane was repeatedly hit by enemy fire and he received serious injuries to his leg. Forced to land, he was taken prisoner and sent first to the hospital at Godega, and later to the military hospital in Sacile. He was liberated by Italian troops following the battle of Vittorio Veneto. ==The seizure of Fiume== Guido Keller posing as Neptune On 12 September 1919 a column of around a thousand irregular troops commanded by Gabriele D’Annunzio marched into Fiume, whose annexation to Italy was opposed by US President Woodrow Wilson. This adventure was the beginning of the Regency of Carnaro, and D’Annunzio named Keller “Secretary for Action” and head of the “Ufficio Colpi di Mano”, commonly known as the “Uscocchi”. These units were named after medieval pirates of the Adriatic, the Uskoks, and their role was to secure the weapons and supplies needed by D’Annunzio's regime, resorting in many cases to outright piracy. Keller was responsible for acts of piracy and theft, such as the occasion when he stole a pig and loaded it onto his plane. The animal was so heavy that it broke through the bottom of his fuselage and he landed with its legs sticking out. Keller carried a tea set with biscuits on his plane, contributing to his reputation as a refined dandy. As a protest against the signing of the Treaty of Rapallo, he flew over Rome in an Ansaldo SVA biplane to drop bouquets of flowers on the Vatican and Quirinale hills, as a gesture of homage, as well as an enamelled chamber-pot with a bunch of carrots and turnips on Palazzo Montecitorio, seat of the Chamber of Deputies, as a gesture of contempt, with a message attached that read “To the parliament and government based on lies and fear, the allegorical embodiment of their value.” During the return flight bad weather forced him to land and when peasants came to his assistance he discovered that he had inadvertently landed in the Republic of San Marino. Welcomed by the authorities there he improvised a message from D’Annunzio to the Italian government before securing diplomatic credentials from the republic that allowed him to return freely to Fiume, bypassing the blockade imposed by the Italian army. Keller was the only one of D’Annunzio's companions permitted to address him using the familiar personal pronoun ‘tu’. While in Fiume he also became a friend of Filippo Tommaso Marinetti who introduced him to futurism, which interested him for a time before he became disillusioned. With his friend the writer Giovanni Comisso, Keller founded a yoga group in Fiume, which adopted the swastika as one of its symbols. The group had esoteric and naturist tendencies and Keller was often portrayed nude in photos of the time. He slept semi-nude at the top of a tree together with his pet eagle. A habitual user of cocaine, he was also a devotee of group sex, including with male partners. ==After Fiume== Disappointed and embittered, Keller left for Turkey, where he tried to create an airline, but his venture was not successful. Returning to Italy he joined the fascist movement, although the fascists never really trusted him because of his bitter criticisms. He took part in the March on Rome. In 1923 he returned to military flying, and was named aeronautical attaché to the Italian embassy in Berlin. He then asked to be returned to active service and was sent to Benghazi in Libya during the period when Italian forces were engaged in operations against rebel tribes. He returned to Italy before embarking on a long voyage of exploration to South America. He went up the Amazon River, visited Venezuela, and spent time in Peru as a gold prospector. In the last years of his life he lived in Ostia, in poverty, relying on support from his few remaining friends. He was a friend of Mario de Bernardi and other aviators of the time. He died in a traffic accident at the age of thirty seven, on 9 November 1929 near Magliano Sabina, alongside Vittorio Montiglio. Following D'Annunzio's wish he was buried on the Colle delle Arche on his estate, the Vittoriale degli italiani in Gardone Riviera, where D’Annunzio was later buried himself. == Honours == Keller was awarded the Silver Medal of Military Valor three times for his valour as a pilot during the First World War. * On 12 June 1919 he received his first award for bravery for aerial combat between 24 April and 26 May 1917 over the Carso. * On 1 September 1920 he received his second award for bravery in aerial combat in engagements over the Carso in September and October 1917, over Monte Franchini in November 1917 and over the Piave in May 1918. * On 2 June 1921 we was again decorated for his bravery over the Piave in July, August and October 1918, including the engagement in which he was forced to land and taken prisoner. == Filmography == * Mauro Vittorio Quattrina, director. \\"Rebel Wings: the story of Guido Keller in Sant'Anna d'Alfaedo 1916\\" shooting in progress. == References == == Further reading == * * * Igino Mencarelli, Guido Keller, Ufficio storico dell’Aeronautica, 1970 * Cristoforo Mercati (Krimer), Incontro con Guido Keller, Tivoli, 1938 * Sandro Pozzi, Guido Keller: nel pensiero, nelle gesta, Mediolanum, 1933 * Claudia Salaris, Alla festa della rivoluzione.

Jimmy's mind is preoccupied with the prospects of a horse that's running (race two at Ballarat) that day. He picks up his mate Steve (Arthur Angel), a fellow courier. He is late to pick up his pre-pubescent son Alex (Hill's real-life stepson Tyler Perham), who he's promised to baby-sit that day, and is harassed by his ex-wife Karen (Faye Smythe). He arrives at her house in his car, an immaculate 1968 Ford Fairlane, previously owned from new by his own father, who deserted his family when Jimmy was young. Alex reluctantly joins his father, for whom he has no respect, and flagrantly defies his every instruction. His father's chief leverage over him (and subject of much of the bickering) is use of his smartphone and promise of a new (soccer) football. Jimmy reports late for work at the depot, and because of the presence of Alex is obliged to use the Fairlane for deliveries rather than a company vehicle. Alex gets to experience the inside of a variety of Melbourne businesses. His deliveries completed, they stop for lunch at a suburban hotel with TAB facilities, and are joined by Steve. Jimmy is anxious to put some money on his tip, and borrows a substantial sum from Steve, who puts somewhat less on the same horse, which comes home and Jimmy has more than enough to pay off his debts. He rings Banos with the good news, but cannot however refrain from trying to build on his good fortune and loses the lot. Fearing Banos, he pleads with Steve to lend him the money, alienating his mate, who refuses point blank: he has debts too. Getting desperate, Jimmy offers the Fairlane to a used-car dealer; it's valued at $35,000 but they settle on $25,000 cash. But while the would-be purchaser is at the bank, Jimmy has a change of heart and he and Alex drive off. Steve approaches Mel (Kat Stewart), a friend from his younger days, who has prospered and now has a small bakery. She offers to lend him the sum if he will deliver some small zip-lock packages of white powder to various addresses. He tells Alex they contain vitamin C. While Jimmy is purchasing icecreams at a roadside van, Alex opens one of the bags and just as he is putting some in his mouth, Jimmy becomes aware of the situation, rushes back to the car and forces Alex to cough it up. He confesses the truth to Alex, they exchange confidences resulting in a reconciliation. Jimmy confronts Banos with the few hundreds of dollars he has left, and Banos signals to his men, then as they have beaten him to the ground and are kicking him, Banos calls them off in a seeming change of heart. Jimmy signs the car over to Banos and pedals a pushbike back to his ex-wife's residence, Alex on the handle-bars. Night is falling, and when asked by his mother how the day went, he replied \\"It was the best day ever\\". ==Filming== West of Sunshine was shot in wide- screen format, mostly in the suburbs and inner city of Melbourne; many scenes were shot in real business premises with the workers going about their usual business. The edited film runs for 78 minutes. Director was Jason Raftopoulos. ==Reception== The film was shown at the Venice Biennale, in the Orrizonti section. It received generally favorable reviews, some tracing its inspiration to Vittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves; most commenting that it sprang no surprises. Several noted that it was the offshoot of Raftopolous' 2011 short Father’s Day and Paul Ireland's short Pawno (also starring Hill). Thom Neal's cinematography was praised, as was the soundtrack by Lisa Gerrard and James Orr. == References == Category:Australian drama films Category:Father and son films Category:Films shot in Melbourne ","title":"West of Sunshine"},{"id":"61537359","text":"Cortes (center) in The Revenge of Tarzan (1920) Armand Cortes, sometimes credited as Armand Cortez, (August 16, 1880 – November 19, 1948) was an actor in theater and film in the United States.

They are not legal anywhere at this time. Organ futures would be used as an economic means to encourage organ donation by compensating transplant organ donors. Financial futures contracts are essentially agreements to pay a specified sum at a specified time. The four key academic papers describing proposals for organ futures were published between the mid-1980s and mid-1990s. == Proposals == The explanations below focus on donation of cadaveric organs and ignore living donation. === Proposal by Schwindt, Vining 1986 === Schwindt & Vining (1986) suggest that the organ donor is paid at the time they agree to enter the life-time futures contract. The agreement is mutually revocable. They propose a single government broker as the buyer. Organ recipients would pay the supply price plus a load factor to the broker. === Proposal by Hansmann 1989 === Hansmann (1989) also suggests payment at the time of contract. Instead of direct payment, he proposes reductions to health insurance premiums as indirect incentive. The hospital where the organ donor dies is expected to verify a seller registry and determine the buyer. Buyers may be health insurance providers or specialist traders. === Proposal by Cohen 1989 === Cohen (1989) introduces a significant change to previous proposals by making payment conditional on organ extraction. Thus, the donor is not directly compensated during their lifetime. However, the payment is allocated to their estate or a designee. Hospitals are expected to notify buyers and preserve cadavers. They can be made liable for consequences of negligence. Buyers may be public or private organizations. === Proposal by Crespi 1994 === Crespi (1994) aims to integrate what he deems the most useful aspects of previous models into his own. Payment would be either guaranteed upon death or dependent on organ extraction. The money would go to the seller's estate; rights would not be assignable, and creditors would not have any claim on it. Hospitals are expected to notify the buyer, preserve the body and be prepared to harvest the organs if required. Any legally competent person can be a buyer and assign their rights freely. == Current Status == Currently, organ futures are legally unfeasible because most countries follow international guidance that requires financial neutrality from the donor. == References == Category:Futures markets Category:Organ donation Category:Biomedicine ","title":"Organ futures"},{"id":"61537423","text":"Missen may refer to: == Surname == *Alan Missen (1925–1986), Australian politician *Edward Missen (1875–1927), English cricketer *François Missen (born 1933), French journalist == Places == *Missen-Wilhams, is a municipality in the district of Oberallgäu in Bavaria *Missen Ridge, is a long, ice-covered ridge situated south of Davis Ice Piedmont, on the north coast of Victoria Land, Antarctica ","title":"Missen"},{"id":"61537432","text":"Bollig is a surname.

It was produced by Rafael Marmor, Peggy Drexler, John Battsek, Avi Belkin, and Chris Leggett, under the banner of Drexler Films, Delirio Films and Rock Paper Scissors Entertainment. The film follows the life and career of American journalist Mike Wallace, using never-before-seen archival footage of the journalist preparing for and speaking about his work. The film premiered on 27 January 2019 at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival, where it was nominated for Grand Jury Prize – Documentary. After the premiere, the film was nominated for Best Documentary at Sheffield Doc/Fest, Docaviv, and Cleveland International Film Festival.

He interviews celebrities including Bill O'Reilly, Donald Trump, Ruhollah Khomeini, and Oprah Winfrey, shown through archive footage of the show. == Cast == * Mike Wallace as himself (archived footage) Other appearances: == Production == Director Avi Belkin told From the Grapevine: \\"I had this idea. I wanted to do a Mike Wallace interview with Mike Wallace. But Mike was obviously dead, so I had an idea of doing this through the archives\\". He approached CBS News, producer of 60 Minutes, which provided Belkin with more than 1,400 hours of archival footage, including \\"never-before-seen footage of Wallace prepping for interviews, chatting with colleagues and pontificating about his life's work\\". This was the first time CBS News had allowed someone to use their 60 Minutes archival footage. Belkin spent several months watching Wallace's interviews, writing down the ideas he had, and then spent about a year editing the film alongside Billy McMillin and his team. Belkin said he did not plan to explore Wallace's personal life. He explained: The film title refers to the legendary fear that Wallace's name evoked in his interview subjects. According to Belkin, these were \\"the four most-dreaded words in the English language back then\\". The title also hints to the ongoing legacy that Wallace leaves with the viewing of this archival footage. == Release == Mike Wallace Is Here premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival on 27 January 2019. It was nominated for Grand Jury Prize – Documentary. The film had a special screening on 16 July 2019 in the United States. === Box office === In its opening weekend, Mike Wallace Is Here was screened in three theatres, grossing $19,437 with an average of $6,479 per theatre.

Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, rated the film 73 out of 100 based on 22 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Richard Roeper of Chicago Sun-Times wrote: \\"This is a time capsule—an expertly crafted time capsule—of an astonishing career\\". Leah Pickett of Chicago Reader wrote: \\"Director Avi Belkin employs many creative strategies to reveal the inner workings of Mike Wallace, the formidable reporter best known for grilling celebrities and political dignitaries on 60 Minutes\\". Josh Modell of The A.V. Club wrote: 'To be blunt—which Wallace, who died in 2012, always was—Mike Wallace Is Here is fascinating but scattered, and never quite decides what its target should be\\". Amy Nicholson of Variety wrote: \\"As Belkin's brisk and compelling documentary fades to black, the director seems to hope that the Wallace quotation audiences cling to isn't one of his fanged questions, but his optimism for the profession to which he dedicated his life\\". Lisa Jensen of Good Times criticised the film, writing that \\"Belkin never really discovers the man behind the public persona. Nor does he find (in what must have been hundreds of hours of footage) any particular 'aha!' moment with an interview subject that would cap Wallace's legacy\\". Norman Wilner of Now wrote: \\"Maybe that's Belkin's point: that contemporary journalism has settled for easily digestible, context-light sound bites rather than discourse or dialogue that's intended to find the inarguable truth of a thing\\". Nora Lee Mandel of Film- Forward wrote: \\"Director Avi Belkin's debut English-language feature documentary opens with its most intriguing setup and then takes a while to reach that insight again\\". == Accolades == In 2019, the film won Video Source Award awarded by International Documentary Association. Mike Wallace Is Here received various nominations including, Grand Jury Prize – Documentary at Sundance Film Festival, and Sheffield International Documentary Festival. The film was also nominated for Best International Film at the Docaviv International Documentary Film Festival, Best Documentary at the Cleveland International Film Festival, Phoenix Award at Film Festival Cologne, Best Archival Documentary, and Best Biographical Documentary at the Critics' Choice Movie Award, and Outstanding Achievement in Editing at Cinema Eye Honors. { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" + !Year !Award !Category !Result !. -  rowspan=\\"8\\" 2019 ! scope=\\"row\\" Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Prize – Documentary   - ! scope=\\"row\\" Sheffield International Documentary Festival Grand Jury Award – Best Documentary   - ! scope=\\"row\\" Docaviv International Documentary Film Festival Best International Film   - ! scope=\\"row\\" Cleveland International Film Festival Best Documentary   - ! scope=\\"row\\" International Documentary Association Video Source Award   - ! scope=\\"row\\" Film Festival Cologne Phoenix Award   - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" scope=\\"row\\" Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Documentary Feature Best Archival Documentary   rowspan=\\"2\\"  - Best Biographical Documentary  - 2020 ! scope=\\"row\\" Cinema Eye Honors Outstanding Achievement in Editing   } == References == == External links == * * Category:American biographical films Category:American documentary films Category:Films produced by John Battsek Category:Documentary films about journalists Category:American films ","title":"Mike Wallace Is Here"},{"id":"61537467","text":"The Tucker Fire was a wildfire that burned near Clear Lake National Wildlife Refuge in Modoc County, California in the United States.

James Hall, D.D. (August 22, 1744 – July 25, 1826) was a Presbyterian minister, chaplain in the Rowan County Regiment during the American Revolution, educator, and missionary in the Natchez area of the Mississippi Territory. He helped to found the Fourth Creek Congregation as its second minister. He was the first minister of Concord Presbyterian Church and Bethany Presbyterian Church in Iredell County, North Carolina on April 8, 1778. ==Early life== James Hall, Jr. was born in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. His parents were James and Prudence Roddy Hall. His father was a Scotch-Irish immigrant. James Hall, Jr. had four brothers. In 1751, the Hall family migrated to North Carolina and settled in the area of Fourth Creek in what was then Rowan County, North Carolina. He received an early education locally and may have attended the Crowfield Academy of Centre Presbyterian Church. For a time he considered marriage but instead decided to devote his life solely to the ministry. Due to his father's ill health, his higher education was delayed. He attended the College of New Jersey at Princeton, where he studied theology under John Witherspoon. He was graduated in 1774. He was licensed to preach in late 1775 or early 1776 by the Orange Presbytery. ==Ministry== right On April 8, 1778, the Reverend James Hall was confirmed as the second minister and first full time minister of the Fourth Creek Congregation, as well as Concord Presbyterian Church and Bethany Presbyterian Church . ==American Revolution== Rev. Hall was Chaplain of the Salisbury District Brigade and probably also the Rowan County Regiment, which was subordinated to this Brigade. He often used his pulpit to assist in raising troops for these North Carolina militia units. He may have also been involved in the Cherokee Expedition in 1776. (Note: There was also another James Hall in the Salisbury District Regiment, who was a captain and major. This James Hall was killed at the Battle of Cowan's Ford). ==Teaching and missionary career== Cover of book by Rev James Hall In his missionary pursuits, he made over fourteen expeditions to the west and southwest.

He also wrote a book, A narrative of a most extraordinary work of religion in North Carolina. When he was a young minister, he founded Clio's Nursery/Academy about ten miles north of Statesville, North Carolina in about 1778 and the Ebenezer Academy near his home north of Statesville.

Educated at the Howell's School, Llandaff, where a policy was enacted to bar anyone from speaking Welsh, she began her career teaching the language in schools. In 1950 Rhys began a bookshop specialising in books in Welsh and university textbooks in Cardiff. The shop was successful academically, financially and socially and attracted many notable Welsh individuals. After retiring in 1968, she travelled the world, wrote two books on the subject and a biography on Evan Rees, the Archdruid of Wales. ==Biography== Beti Rhys was born on 2 April 1907 in Port Talbot, Glamorgan. She was the daughter of J.E. Rhys, a Presbyterian minister, and his wife. Rhys had one sister, Neilan. She was educated at the Howell's School, Llandaff, which she resented due to its policy of barring any person from speaking the Welsh language; Rhys was described by one member of staff as \\"dirty Welsh\\". The experience failed to dissuade her and she went on to read Welsh at University College, Cardiff (now Cardiff University). Rhys began her career teaching Welsh at multiple schools before settling at the Pentre Secondary School in the Rhondda. In 1950 Rhys borrowed money from friends of hers to begin a bookshop specialising in books published in the Welsh language and university textbooks at the Castle Arcade shopping building in Cardiff. During that era, books published in the Welsh language were scarce with a close following and the opening of her shop expanded their reach further south in Wales. According to Rhys' obituarist in The Times, the shop became \\"a focal point for the Welsh literati\\". Soon after its opening she obtained contracts to deliver textbooks to various Welsh educational institutions. Rhys had regular customers in Idris Foster, the professor of Celtic Studies at Jesus College, Oxford, the poets Waldo Williams and Dylan Thomas, Saunders Lewis, the co-founder of the political party Plaid Cymru, the historian John Davies, the politician Neil Kinnock and his wife Glenys Parry. The shop made an academic, financial and social success, and she soon opened a second shop in Park Place, Cardiff, which her sister managed. Rhys also advised students who struggled academically and a doctor from Kuwait held a positive review of her swift service that he persuaded his hospital in his home country to order all of its works from her store. She sold her shops in 1968, so that she could retire to Aberystwyth and travel. Rhys traveled to China via a cargo boat, the Trans-Siberan Railway to reach Russia, a bus to India, visited the Americas by the Greyhound Lines, and all of Africa. She wrote two books about her travels, Crwydro'r Byd (Travelling the World), and I'r India a thu hwnt (To India and Beyond) in 1995. Rhys wrote a biography about her great uncle, Evan Rees, the Archdruid of Wales from 1905 to 1923. She later returned to Cardiff, and went into a nursing home. She died on 5 April 2003. ==Personality== Rhys was described by her obituarist in The Times as a \\"Champion of Welsh\\" and an \\"indomitable Welsh woman\\". == Bibliography == * * * ==References== Category:1907 births Category:2003 deaths Category:People from Port Talbot Category:People educated at Howell's School Llandaff Category:Alumni of Cardiff University Category:20th-century Welsh women Category:21st-century Welsh women Category:Welsh women writers Category:Welsh- language writers Category:Welsh non-fiction writers Category:Welsh travel writers Category:Welsh booksellers ","title":"Beti Rhys"},{"id":"61537595","text":"Eugenie de Sade (original titles: Eugénie and Eugenie Sex Happening) is a softcore film adaptation and modern-day update of the Marquis de Sade's short story \\"Eugénie de Franval\\" (1800) directed by Spanish filmmaker Jesús Franco in 1970 and released in 1973.

He was unraced as a juvenile before winning on his debut as a three-year-old in April 2017. He was off the track with injury problems before winning a minor race in January 2018. He won the Grade I Carter Handicap on his next start, but never ran again and was retired at the end of the year having won his three races by an aggregate of twenty-two lengths. ==Background== Army Mule is a bay stallion with a white star bred in Pennsylvania by Hope Hill Farm. As a yearling in October 2015 he was put up for auction at the Fasig-Tipton Midlantic Sale and was bought for $35,000 by Bill Reightler. Army Mule returned to the same sales ring in May 2016 and was sold for $825,000 to Crupi's New Castle Farm. During his racing career he was owned by Vinnie Viola's St Elias Stable and trained by Todd Pletcher. He was from the second crop of foals sired by the Louisiana Derby winner Friesan Fire. Army Mule's dam Crafty Toast was not a top-class racehorse but showed consistently good form to win five times from thirty-one starts between May 1998 and November 2000. Her dam Give A Toast won the Beaugay Stakes and was descended from the broodmare Tedmelia (foaled 1935), making her a distant relative of Rodrigo de Triano, Shaadi, Regal Rose, Crusade and Seventh Heaven. ==Racing career== ===2017: three-year-old season=== Army Mule made his track debut in a maiden race over six and a half furlongs at Belmont Park on April 30, 2017 and started 1.55/1 joint-favourite in an eight-runner field. Ridden by John R. Velazquez he took the lead a quarter mile from the finish and drew away to win by eight and a half lengths from Zap Zap Zap in a time of 1:16.79. A knee injury kept the colt off the track for the rest of the year. ===2018: four-year-old season=== After an absence of nine months Army Mule returned to the track on January 31, 2018 when he was partnered by Javier Castellano in a six furlong allowance race at Gulfstream Park. Starting the 1/5 favourite he started slowly but went to the front a furlong out and won \\"impressively\\" by seven and a half lengths. On April 9 Army Mule was moved up sharply in class to contest the Grade I Carter Handicap over seven furlongs at Aqueduct Racetrack. Ridden by Joe Bravo, he was made the 2.1/1 second choice in the betting behind the five-year-old Awesome Slew (winner of the Commonwealth Stakes) in an eleven-runner field which also included Skyler's Scramjet (Tom Fool Handicap), Favorable Outcome (Swale Stakes) and Great Stuff (Toboggan Stakes). After racing in fourth place Army Mule moved up on the inside on the final turn and took the lead entering the straight. He quickly broke away from his opponents and came home six and a quarter lengths clear of Awesome Slew. Pletcher commented \\"The sky's the limit with him. He's a super-talented horse.

He obtained in 1773 the commission to illustrate the annual registers of the aldermen of Ghent, a job his recently deceased father had undertaken before. In 1774 he obtained the commission to paint grisailles for the Saint Bavo Cathedral of Ghent. For the Joyous Entry of Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor into Ghent of 1781, the city built a temporary podium on the Vrijdagmarkt in Ghent. Van Reysschoot was invited to provide the final decorations for the podium. he made a large painting that depicted the 'Loan Tribute of the States', of which two preliminary studies and three designs have survived.Geert Vandamme, Een geschiedenis van Gent Deel 12C Gent onder de Oostenrijkers (1780–1794) (1780–1790) Van Reysschoot participated in various competitions to gain commissions. When it moved to the Pakhuis in 1785, the Chamber of Commerce of Ghent organized a competition to decorate its new premises, which was won by van Reysschoot. One of the paintings he created for the Chamber is now in the Town Hall of Ghent. It represents an Allegory of the Ghent trade. Pieter Norbert van Reysschoot received commissions to decorate many private residences. This includes the painting in the dining room of the van Goethem residence. In the Van den Bogaerde residence in the Nederpolder he was responsible for the decoration of the dining room in which he was assisted by his sister Anna Maria. The artist remained single for a long time, probably completely absorbed by his busy work schedule. Only at the age of 52 he married Marie-Anne-Colette Janssens on 14 October 1790. Less than five years later he died on 12 February 1795. ==Work== Petrus Norbertus van Reysschoot was a prolific painter who painted landscapes, allegories, mythological and religious stories, genre scenes, seascapes, landscapes, portraits and trompe-l'oeil still lifes. He was mainly active as a decorative painter working on commissions for individuals and religious institutions. He also painted temporary decorations for theater performances, ceremonies and festivities. He further designed statues and architectural elements of buildings. Study of putti He applied himself especially to grisaille painting, a genre then very much in fashion for its imitation of white marble bas- reliefs. Van Reysschoot gave this genre a new importance in the field of religious subjects. His main work, which made him especially known, is the series of eleven grisailles which decorate the choir of the Saint-Bavo Cathedral in Ghent, above the stalls of the choir. Five of these panels represent scenes from the Old Testament, the other six, episodes borrowed from the Gospel. These paintings were placed in the church from 1789 to 1791. Van Reysschoot did not limit himself to monochrome painting alone as he was also a good colorist. He sometimes worked in both genres simultaneously. This is obvious in the decoration of the splendid residence of the Counts of Hane- Steenhuyse, where he created works in grisaille along colored walls and ceilings. ==References== ==External links== Category:1738 births Category:1795 deaths Category:Flemish landscape painters Category:Flemish genre painters Category:Flemish artists (before 1830) Category:People from Ghent ","title":"Petrus Norbertus van Reysschoot"},{"id":"61537867","text":"Neelum Sharma (1969 – 17 August 2019) was an Indian anchor who was most well known as one of the founding anchors of Doordarshan and was a recipient of the Nari Shakti Puraskar, the highest civilian award for woman in India. ==Life== Dr. left Through her show Tejaswini, Neelum focused on women achievers of India.

His family moved to Merefa in 1909, where he completed school and began working at a glass factory in 1923. Initially a member of the Komsomol, he became a member of the Communist Party in 1929. From that year until 1931 he was the secretary of the Komsomol committee of the factory, since he went on to join the party committee in 1931. The next year he graduated from a trade school in Kharkhiv before entering the Red Army in June. After graduating from the Oryol Armored School in 1934, he commanded a tank platoon in the 4th Heavy Tank Regiment, and in November 1935, he transferred to another unit. In April he took command of a training platoon before being made chief of staff of the 57th Tank Battalion. In that capacity, he participated in the Soviet invasion of Poland, including the annexation of Lviv. In March 1940, he became a battalion commander within 19th Tank Regiment. ==World War II== thumbright250pxMonument twice to the Hero of the Soviet Union Zakhar Slyusarenko. Zmiiv (Ukraine) At the time of the start of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Slyusarenko was a battalion commander in the 10th Tank Division. His baptism by fire occurred in 22 June 1941, in the battles for the border areas of Western Ukraine. In the ensuing fighting he became surrounded near Berdichev and Uman, but broke out of the encirclement both times. After the breakthrough he became commander of a battalion in the 133rd Tank Brigade in September 1941, and in May 1942 he was promoted to deputy commander of the 168th Armored Brigade. Several months later he was given command of the 49th Separate Guards Tank Regiment, where he gained breakthroughs on the Leningrad Front. In February 1944, he became the commander of the 56th Guards Tank Brigade, a position where he led in multiple major breakthroughs of enemy lines that resulted in his gold stars. During the Lvov-Sandomierz Offensive the unit went on to take control of enemy-held territory in Poland, including an important bridgehead on the left bank Vistula. Despite facing multiple counterattacks they managed to expand their control of the Sandomierz bridgehead. For his actions in that operation he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 23 September 1944. He then went on to fight in the Vistula-Oder, Silesia, Berlin, and Prague campaigns. His second gold star was awarded after the end of the war on 31 May 1945 for the crossing of the flooded Telt Canal on the southern outskirts of Berlin; during the battle his brigade advanced through heavily defended enemy territory, taking out 48 tanks, two trains, two warehouses, taking over 400 prisoners, and killing over 600 enemy combatants. He was wounded six times in the war, but only hospitalized twice. ==Postwar== After the war he remained in command of his brigade until August; due to reorganization of the military he was made commander of the 56th Guards Tank Regiment, which became downgraded to a battalion in December 1946. In 1947 he was promoted to deputy commander of the 180th Guards Mechanized Division, but left at the end of 1948 to attend officer training, which he graduated from in 1949. From 1950 to 1956, he commanded the 3rd Armored Division, during which was promoted to major-general in 1953, and in 1957 he graduated from the Military Academy of General Staff. In 1960, he became the deputy commander-in-chief for combat training of the Northern Group of Forces and was promoted to lieutenant-general in 1963, but retired in 1965.

Produced by Ranjeet Thakur and Hemant Ruprell, it stars Roshni Walia. == Plot == ‘Tara from Satara' revolves around the story of two sisters - Tara Mane and her elder sister Radhika Mane. The two sisters love to dance and are very fond of it, too, the only difference being- Radhika does classical Kathak dance whereas Tara likes to do Bollywood moves. Radhika learns Kathak from her father Sachin Mane, a well trained classical dancer, who at present dislikes Bollywood dance, but in his past, he was part of the Bollywood Showbiz. He went to fulfill his dream in Mumbai but was unable to do so. This regret in him made him dislike ‘Bollywood' and totally against people who dances on Bollywood numbers or listen to Bollywood music in his home or his neighbourhood. Tara, who is very fond of Bollywood music and fan of MK (a Bollywood artist), is not good in studies and is seen dancing to Bollywood music, which irks her father. Her failing grades makes Tara doubt herself and in this process tries to quit dancing for the sake of studies, but in vain. Tara is only supported by her Aaji, her paternal grandmother, who has full faith in her granddaughter and thinks that one day Tara will shine like a star and be the pride of her father, much unlike her present situation. Tara gets selected in a local audition in a Dance Reality show called \\"Dancer No.1\\". She gets selected for a large audition in Mumbai and awarded a pass (yellow card) but since it involves Bollywood and showbiz, her father is angered, so she hides the fact that she was the one selected. Her elder sister Radhika takes the blame and the yellow card. But as Radhika was a responsible child of her father, he consoles himself although he rejects the yellow card and throws it away (but Tara finds it and preserves it). One day, in a local competition, the footfall of Radhika and her team dips, while it aggressively increases for a team owned by Rægo, a dance trainer who practices Bollywood. This insult, along with the increasing poverty, the fear of getting his dance academy closed, makes Sachin Mane change his decision and send his daughter to Dancer No. 1, although he orders her daughter Radhika to strictly perform Kathak and other Indian classical dance forms and stay away from Bollywood and showbiz. Tara and her entire family except her parents accompany Radhika to Mumbai, where they meet Arjun, a dancer and part-time mechanic who is also a participant. Arjun is seen helping Tara and her family in various occasions. As the show progresses, luck tries to take Tara towards the stage yet she fails to capitalise. She is appointed as an intern in Dancer No. 1 and she takes care of the normal stuffs regarding the participants of the show. Many twists and turns take her close to her dreams of becoming a dancer and dancing on the big stage. In one episode Radhika insists to do a Bollywood dance after her Kathak dance gets less views than Gurpreet's Bollywood dance. On the day of her dance, Sachin, her father, brings anklets, expecting she will do a Kathak dance. When Radhika sees Sachin while dancing, she freezes on stage and therefore gets eliminated. Tara, Bedane, and Aiji stay as Tara auditions for the wild card entry. Tara wins the wild card entry while Radhika has a feud with her family and leaves for Mumbai for a heroine entry. The theme of the dance is decades. Tara spy on Rahul to get the news of Radhika. Rahul loses his temper and hurts Tara and Arjun slaps Rahul for being a jerk to Tara. Paddy sir comes and shows his true colors to Arjun and others. Bedane records it and Paddy sir is fired. Radhika fills in for Paddy sir and tries to get Tara out. Later on, Tara wins the Dancer No. 1 competition and reveals that the famous Manmane dance step was choreographed by her father Sachin and not Shatru. Then Srilekha also supports Tara's statement and thus Sachin regains his lost glory. Tara exposed Shatru and gave 50% of her prize money to Arjun since her only motive was to regain her father's pride and earlier Arjun had intentionally lost semi-finals so that Tara can win the competition. == Cast == === Main === * Roshni Walia as Tara Mane * Urvashi Pardeshi as Radhika Mane, Tara's elder sister * Upendra Limaye as Sachin Mane, Tara's father === Recurring === * Yuvraj Malhotra as R.T Sir, the head Producer-Director of Dancer No 1 * Sheezan Mohd as Arjun Priya, Dancer No 1 Contest * Ashwini Koul as Rahul Ahuja Dancer No 1 Contest * Eijaz Khan as Shartughan (Shatru) Mehra, one of the three main judges in Dancer No 1 * Sudha Chandran as Srilekha, one of the three main judges in Dancer No 1 * Anant Vijay Joshi as MK, one of the three main judges in Dancer No 1 * Arjun Singh Shekhawat as Ankit, head of backstage operation in the show * Shazil Khan as Amukh Bhedane, Tara's best friend * Sonu Pathak as Rival dance master of Sachin Mane in Satara * Eva Shirali as Sarita Mane, Tara's mother * Amita Khopkar as Ajji, Tara's grandmother, Sachin and Varun's mother * Ashish Gokhale as Varun Mane, Sachin's younger brother * Saii Ranade Sane as Chinu Mane, Varun's wife * Wahib Kapadia as Rohan Mane, Varun and Chinu's son * Bhavya Sachdeva as Abhay, Radhika's boyfriend in Satara * Agustya Chandra as Alen * Khushboo Purohit as Gurpreet * Aman Gandhi as Samar, Gurpreet's boyfriend ===Guest=== * Jeff Kinney as a judge in a competition == References == ==External links== * Category:2019 Indian television series debuts Category:Hindi-language television shows Category:Indian drama television series Category:Indian television soap operas Category:Sony Entertainment Television original programming Category:2020 Indian television series endings ","title":"Tara From Satara"},{"id":"61538204","text":"Aleksej Demjanov (born 9 December 1973) is a Croatian gymnast.

It was destroyed in 1939 by Nazi Germans and reconstructed in 1976 according to project by Marian Konieczny. ==History== The monument was designed by Polish sculptor Antoni Wiwulski and Franciszek Black and funded by renowned pianist and future Prime Minister of Poland, Ignacy Jan Paderewski. He wanted to celebrate the 500th anniversary of the victorious Battle of Grunwald fought between Poland and Lithuania against the Teutonic Knights on 15 July 1410. Initially, there was controversy where to locate the monument and various different locations were proposed including the Holy Spirit Square (Plac Św. Ducha) supported by Paderewski, the square in front of and the Matejko Square. Eventually, the latter option was chosen partly thanks to its close proximity to the Kraków's defensive walls, which reflected in their appearance the early Jagiellonian era. The foundation stone for the monument was laid in April 1910. The project was carried out in secrecy in the Austrian Partition of Poland and even Wiwulski himself did not know the final purpose of the project when he worked on the details of the monument. The granite obtained for the construction of the pedestal came from the Vanevick quarry in Sweden owned by French company Le Granite from Abainville. Antoni Wiwulski worked on the statue of King Jagiełło during his stay in Paris but the project was temporarily halted due to the sculptor's sudden illness. The figures displayed on the monument were cast in bronze by the French company Malleset. The sculptures were then transported by train from France through Switzerland to Kraków. The entire cost of the project is estimated at 500,000 Austro-Hungarian krones.Marek Żukow-Karczewski, Dawne pomniki Krakowa. Pomnik Władysława Jagiełły (Grunwaldzki), \\"Echo Krakowa\\", 16 I 1991, nr 11 (13323).Marek Żukow-Karczewski, Krakowskich pomników dzieje niełatwe, \\"KRAKÓW\\", nr 4(32)/1991, p. 30-31. The official and ceremonial opening of the monument took place on 15 July 1910. The unveiling of the Grunwald Monument was witnessed by 150,000 spectators and by many prominent dignitaries including Land Marshal of Galicia (and a de facto Prime Minister) Stanisław Badeni, Mayor of Kraków Juliusz Leo and the sponsor of the monument Ignacy Jan Paderewski. During the Second World War, the monument was systematically destroyed by Nazi Germans from November 1939 until April 1940. The pedestal of the monument was blown up using dynamite while the bronze statues were looted and transported to Germany. On 28 January 1945, a decision was made to reconstruct the monument. Granite blocks which were recovered from the original monument were placed on the site where the monument was located. In 1972, a special committee was established whose aim was to reconstruct the Grunwald Monument known as Komitet Odbudowy Pomnika Grunwaldzkiego. Based on a miniature model of the original monument kept by the Historical Museum of Kraków as well as pre-war photographs, artist Marian Konieczny carried out the reconstruction of the monument. The granite was obtained from the region of Szklarska Poręba and the figures were cast in bronze in Gliwice. On 16 October 1976, the Grunwald Monument was officially re-opened. In front of the monument, a Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was located featuring a symbolic marble plaque designed by Wiktor Zin. On 10 September 2010, a ceremonial reenactment of the events related to the opening of the monument took place in Kraków as well as celebrations of the 600th anniversary of the battle and the 100th anniversary of the construction of the monument. In 2016, the Grunwald Monument underwent an extensive renovation and cleaning. ==Description== The monument is 24 meters (78 ft) tall and at the top of it an equestrian statue of King Władysław Jagiełło is located. The king holds the bridle in his left hand and a sword in his right hand. On the front side of the monument there is a statue of Grand Duke of Lithuania Vytautas at the feet of whom lies the figure of fallen in battle Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights Ulrich von Jungingen. The eastern side features a Polish knight and his page collecting the abandoned Teutonic banners. The western side features a Lithuanian warrior blowing a horn and leading a captured Teutonic knight. The northern side features a peasant symbolically throwing off the shackles of enslavement. ==Gallery== File:The Grunwaldzki Monument in Cracow 2.jpgThe opening ceremony of the monument, 1910 File:WWII Krakow - 01.jpgThe destroyed remnants of the monument during WWII File:Railway Offices, 12 Matejko square, Krakow, Poland.jpgThe Grunwald Monument before renovation, 2006 File:Battle of Grunwald monument and Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Matejko Square, Kraków, Poland.jpgBattle of Grunwald Monument and Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Matejko Square, Kraków File:PomnikGrunwaldzki-PostaćKrólaWładysławaJagiełły- POL, Kraków.jpgWładysław Jagiełło statue File:PomnikGrunwaldzki- PostaćKsięciaWitolda-POL, Kraków.jpgVytautas statue File:PomnikGrunwaldzki- PostaćUlrichaVonJungingena-POL, Kraków.jpgUlrich von Jungingen statue File:PomnikGrunwaldzki-PraojcomNaChwałę-POL, Kraków.jpgEastern side File:PomnikGrunwaldzki-BraciomNaOtuchę-POL, Kraków.jpgWestern side File:PomnikGrunwaldzki-PostaćChłopaZrywającegoKajdny-POL, Kraków.jpgNorthern side ==See also== *Tadeusz Kościuszko Monument, Kraków ==References== Category:1910 sculptures Category:Equestrian statues in Poland Category:Outdoor sculptures in Poland Category:Buildings and structures in Kraków Category:Sculptures in Poland ","title":"Grunwald Monument"},{"id":"61538479","text":"Søjolm Keramik was a ceramics manufacturer in Rønne on the island of Bornholm, Denmark.

Much of the production was then unsigned. The pottery was operated by Hans Ancher Wolffsen and his brother in 1887-1908 They adopted the popular jugendstil with its often grotesque shapes. The Carl Møller managed the pottery for the Wolffsen family from 1908 and became its owner in 1912. The outbreak of World War I resulted in difficult times for the company and Møller in 1919 Nøller sold it to a byusinessman from Copenhagen but continued as a manager. The company was in 1929 sold to Bornholm Municipality and leased to a consortium consisting of Holst & Knudsen and Keramisk Forbund. Keramisk Forbund purchased the factory in 1933, following a period with fierce criticism of the purblic ownership among right-wing parties in the town council.

It is built in a hall church plan and partially carved into rock. The church is inscribed on the list of Georgia's Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance. There is another medieval Georgian church known as Bieti situated in Samtskhe- Javakheti in southern Georgia. The monastery lies on a wooded cliff in the upper Mejuda valley, a tributary of the Greater Liakhvi. Based on its architectural features and paleography of the church inscription, the building is dated to the 9th century. In historical literature it is first mentioned by Prince Vakhushti in his 1745 Description of the Kingdom of Georgia as a functioning monastery with an abbot residing there. The Bieti monastery is a hall church design, with a nonprojecting apse. It is built of limestone and cobblestone and faced with sandstone slabs. The northern part of the church is cut into the adjacent rock in two tiers. A long, narrow and now-damaged annex on the south is contemporaneous with the church, while a wide hall at the southern end is a late medieval construction. Nearby are monks' cells and a refectory. The eastern façade bore an inscription in the medieval Georgian asomtavruli script, commemorating Ioane, son of Bakur Qanchaeli, \\"the lord and patron of this holy church\\". Another inscription, engraved on a small stone adjacent to the carved cross, mention Vache and Beshken, probably members of the same Qanchaeli family. Both inscriptions were, in 1912, brought for safekeeping in Tbilisi, where they are preserved at the Georgian National Museum. == References == Category:Georgian Orthodox monasteries Category:Georgian Orthodox churches in Georgia (country) Category:Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance of Georgia Category:Christian monasteries established in the 9th century Category:Churches in South Ossetia ","title":"Bieti Monastery"},{"id":"61538639","text":"William Clayton Clayton (23 April 1839 – 25 December 1876) was an English first-class cricketer and British Army officer.

Much of the existing church dates to the 13th and 15th centuries. It has been Grade I listed since 1960. The church is dedicated to St. Germanus, a bishop of Auxerre in Late Antique Gaul who is supposed to have landed in the neighbourhood when he came to Britain to suppress the Pelagian heresy in about 429. ==History== It is believed that a church has existed on the site since Norman times, owing to the discovery of a carved tympanum of that period, now re-set into the west wall of the south aisle. The existing church was dedicated to St. Germanus on 15 October 1259 by the Bishop of Exeter, Walter Branscombe. The sections of the building dating to this period includes the broached spire and upper part of the tower, the north wall of the chancel and north transept. A south transept and tower arch was later added and the church rededicated in 1321. In the 15th century, the church was enlarged by replacing the south transept with a south aisle and south arcade of Perpendicular style. The church underwent restoration in 1848, and a chapel of ease, St Andrew's, was opened in 1878 to serve the village of Cawsand. ===1883–1885 restoration=== Another restoration of the church was carried out in 1883–1885 at the sole expense of Kenelm William Edward Edgcumbe, the 6th Earl of Mount Edgcumbe. The work was carried out to the designs and under the direction of Messrs. Hine and Odgers of Plymouth, and it was during this restoration that the Norman tympanum was discovered. Repairs were made to the external walls. Although much of the timber had become displaced, the wagon roof of the south aisle was preserved. Much of the church's other roof woodwork was rotten and had to be replaced. New stalls of oak and fir were added to the chancel and pews of the same material added to other parts of the church. Fragments of 15th century oak seating found under the church's square deal pews was put together to form five seats in the south aisle. A number of inscribed slabs were relaid in the passages and new tiles added to the chancel and sacrarium floors. A new traceried pulpit of oak was created by Mr. Harley of Plymouth and all of the church's windows, except for the east window in the chancel, was newly glazed by Messrs. Fouracre and Watson of Stonehouse. A holy table of oak and the churchyard lychgate was gifted by Rev. R. Ley. The church reopened on 22 April 1885 when a crowded service was held, which included a sermon read by the Bishop of Truro, George Wilkinson. ==Design== St Germanus' is built in rough slate rubble, with granite dressings. The slate roofs were added in the 19th century. The church is made up of a nave and chancel, west tower, south aisle and south chapel, north porch, north transept and north vestry. Some of the internal fittings include a 14th century octagonal font, pews of late 15th century origin, a late 19th century organ loft and a screen made by Herbert Read of Exeter in c. 1930. There are monuments to Mary Ashton (and other members of the family), dated 1664, John Batterby (1672), Roger Ashton (1677) and Stephen Edwards (1797). The church has no electricity, gas or water, and services are lit by candlelight. ==Churchyard== The interior of St Germanus' Church.

It is situated 9 km away from sub- district headquarter Gauribidanur and 45 km away from district headquarter Chikkaballapura. On Dec 8, 2015, Vyachakurahalli village in Karnataka was declared the India's first smokeless village by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Govt of India. Following the Mission Smokeless Village project, undertaken by Indian Oil Corporation with the objective of helping rural women regain their health and to make cooking easier, all 274 households in the village had shifted to LPG stoves. The country's first smokeless village Vyachakurahalli had entered into the Limca Book of Records-2017. ==Demographics== According to Census 2011 information the location code or village code of Vyachakurahalli village is 623261.. Vyachakurahalli has a total population of 1,033 peoples with 539 males and 494 females. There are about 274 houses in Vyachakurahalli village. Gauribidanur is nearest town to Vyachakurahalli which is approximately 9 km away. ==Mission Smokeless Village== On Dec 8, 2015 Vyachakurahalli village in Karnataka has become India's first smokeless village. The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas had declared the village smokeless as all 274 households had made a shift to LPG stoves. Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) led the 'Mission Smokeless Village' project with an idea to help women regain their health, and to make cooking easier. This project was started with the understanding that, In India, cooking has been a tough task in many villages. The firewood used as fuel makes women more prone to pneumonia and kitchens get filled with soot, which in turn leads to health problems. The LPG stoves and cylinders were been made available for the villagers. An awareness programme was conducted for the villagers to tell them the importance of going smokeless.

The Canadian Encyclopedia, January 20, 2010. who was known as an interpretive singer, particularly of songs by Stéphane Venne, Michel Conte, Georges Brassens and Léo Ferré. ==Early life== She was born Renée Bélanger in Montreal. She studied piano at the École de musique Vincent-d'Indy, took singing lessons from Alphonse Ledoux, and won a music competition on CKVL radio program Découvertes de Billy Munro in 1955. ==Musical career== In 1960 she made her first major television appearance on Clémence DesRochers's Télévision de Radio-Canada variety show Chez Clémence. Around the same era she began performing in Quebec City's boîtes à chanson, specializing in the songs of Ferré, Brassens and Jean-Pierre Ferland. She released her self-titled first album on Distribution Select in 1963, and followed up with three more albums on the label by 1966. In 1967 she made an appearance on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, and performed at Expo 67 in Montreal. In the same year she moved to Columbia Records and released her breakthrough album Shippagan; the album's title track was her first major hit single in Quebec, and she won the award for best singer at the Gala des artistes in 1968. However, Shippagan was her sole album for Columbia, as she moved to Barclay for her 1969 album C'est notre fête aujourd'hui. She released five further albums on Barclay between 1969 and 1973, and scored popular hits in this era with the songs \\"C'est notre fête aujourd'hui\\", \\"Le Tour de la terre\\", \\"La Rue de la Montagne\\", \\"Tu trouveras la paix\\", \\"Le Début d'un temps nouveau\\", \\"C'est toi, c'est moi, c'est lui, c'est nous autres\\", \\"Quand le temps tournera au beau\\", \\"T'oublier, t'oublier\\" and \\"Sais-tu que je t'aime depuis longtemps\\". She then moved to London Records, for whom she released two albums in 1975 and 1976, and then to Solset Records, releasing an album in 1979. In the 1980s, with pop tastes changing, Claude began creating shows and albums that paid tribute to specific artists who had inspired her, including DesRochers, Brassens and Ferré. She won the Grand Prix du Disque for French Song from the Académie Charles Cros in 1996 for her Ferré album On a marché sur l'amour. In the 1990s she began taking acting roles, appearing in stage productions of Nelligan, Tu faisais comme un appel and Marcel poursuivi par les chiens, in the television series Avec un grand A, Lance et compte and Triplex, and in the films It's Your Turn, Laura Cadieux (C't'à ton tour, Laura Cadieux) and Station Nord.

McKenna is also donating proceeds from the single to charity. Speaking about the song, he said, \\"'British Bombs' is a tune I wrote about the hypocrisy of the British arms trade and the weapons convention in London. I think too often it's implied that matters in the world are too complex to not end up with war, or to not possess and sell weapons, and I just think it is pure bullshit. Not only do we still engage in wars far away from our homes, which settle nothing and fuel extremism in the aftermath, we sell weapons to other countries full well knowing where they end up. I wanted to write a song that was outright against war, in any form. Violence breeds violence and I just don't think the world is too complex to set a peaceful precedent, but it seems the business of war is what keeps happening. To say it's a shame feels like a huge understatement.\\" ==Music video== A music video to accompany the release of \\"British Bombs\\" was first released onto YouTube on 19 August 2019.

The song was written by Declan McKenna and produced by James Ford. ==Background== The track premiered on 10 January 2017 as BBC Radio 1 DJ Annie Mac's Hottest Record in the World. In an interview with MistaJam, McKenna talked about the themes behind the new song, \\"It's generally about the frustrations of being a young person in the modern world, there's a lot of scary things going on that people are concerned about it's about finding hope and looking towards the future. The song came together when I was in Paris around the time of the attacks and the day after I kinda realised that I now felt the emotions that I was trying to put into this song, and it all became quite real for me. That kind of fear and frustration but also a longing for change.\\" Talking about the song, he said, \\"The Kids Don't Wanna Come Home is a song I wrote about being a young person in the modern world. It's about wanting to challenge fears and be part of a movement of change, and looking for hope despite a lot of dark and horrible things happening around the world.\\" ==Critical reception== Thomas Smith from NME said, \\"'The Kids Don't Wanna Come Home', Declan's genre hopping and pop masterpiece does nothing to dispute that claim. In fact, its the most emotionally charged song he's produced to date. Penned soon after of the Paris terror attacks – it's his response to the youth being excluded from political discussions, and at risk of those in power but with no voice.

It is widely used in modern wireless telecommunications, such as cellular networks, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS receivers, broadcasting, vehicular communication systems, and the radio transceivers in all modern mobile phones and wireless networking devices. RF CMOS technology was pioneered by Pakistani engineer Asad Ali Abidi at UCLA during the late 1980s to early 1990s, and helped bring about the wireless revolution with the introduction of digital signal processing in wireless communications. ==History== Asad Ali Abidi developed RF CMOS technology at UCLA during the late 1980s to early 1990s. Pakistani engineer Asad Ali Abidi, while working at Bell Labs and then UCLA during the 1980s1990s, pioneered radio research in metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) technology and made seminal contributions to radio architecture based on complementary MOS (CMOS) switched-capacitor (SC) technology. In the early 1980s, while working at Bell, he worked on the development of sub-micron MOSFET (MOS field-effect transistor) VLSI (very large-scale integration) technology, and demonstrated the potential of sub-micron NMOS integrated circuit (IC) technology in high-speed communication circuits. Abidi's work was initially met with skepticism from proponents of GaAs and bipolar junction transistors, the dominant technologies for high-speed communication circuits at the time. In 1985 he joined the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he pioneered RF CMOS technology during the late 1980s to early 1990s. His work changed the way in which RF circuits would be designed, away from discrete bipolar transistors and towards CMOS integrated circuits. Abidi was researching analog CMOS circuits for signal processing and communications at UCLA during the late 1980s to early 1990s. Abidi, along with UCLA colleagues J. Chang and Michael Gaitan, demonstrated the first RF CMOS amplifier in 1993. In 1995, Abidi used CMOS switched-capacitor technology to demonstrate the first direct-conversion transceivers for digital communications. In the late 1990s, RF CMOS technology was widely adopted in wireless networking, as mobile phones began entering widespread use. This changed the way in which RF circuits were designed, leading to the replacement of discrete bipolar transistors with CMOS integrated circuits in radio transceivers. There was a rapid growth of the telecommunications industry towards the end of the 20th century, primarily due to the introduction of digital signal processing in wireless communications, driven by the development of low-cost, very large-scale integration (VLSI) RF CMOS technology. It enabled sophisticated, low-cost and portable end-user terminals, and gave rise to small, low-cost, low-power and portable units for a wide range of wireless communication systems. This enabled \\"anytime, anywhere\\" communication and helped bring about the wireless revolution, leading to the rapid growth of the wireless industry. In the early 2000s, RF CMOS chips with deep sub-micron MOSFETs capable of over 100GHz frequency range were demonstrated. , the radio transceivers in all wireless networking devices and modern mobile phones are mass-produced as RF CMOS devices. ==Applications== The baseband processors and radio transceivers in all modern wireless networking devices and mobile phones are mass-produced using RF CMOS devices. RF CMOS circuits are widely used to transmit and receive wireless signals, in a variety of applications, such as satellite technology (including GPS and GPS receivers), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, near-field communication (NFC), mobile networks (such as 3G and 4G), terrestrial broadcast, and automotive radar applications, among other uses. Examples of commercial RF CMOS chips include Intel's DECT cordless phone, and 802.11 (Wi-Fi) chips created by Atheros and other companies. Commercial RF CMOS products are also used for Bluetooth and Wireless LAN (WLAN) networks. RF CMOS is also used in the radio transceivers for wireless standards such as GSM, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth, transceivers for mobile networks such as 3G, and remote units in wireless sensor networks (WSN). RF CMOS technology is crucial to modern wireless communications, including wireless networks and mobile communication devices. One of the companies that commercialized RF CMOS technology was Infineon. Its bulk CMOS RF switches sell over 1billion units annually, reaching a cumulative 5billion units, . Practical software-defined radio (SDR) for commercial use was enabled by RF CMOS, which is capable of implementing an entire software- defined radio system on a single MOS IC chip. RF CMOS began to be used for SDR implementations during the 2000s. ===Common applications=== RF CMOS is widely used in a number of common applications, which include the following. ==See also== ==References== Category:Digital electronics Category:Electronic design Category:Integrated circuits Category:MOSFETs Category:Pakistani inventions ","title":"RF CMOS"},{"id":"61539346","text":"Semyon Vasilyevich Khokhryakov (; – 17 April 1945) was a T-34 tank battalion commander during World War II who was twice awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union. ==Early life== Khokhryakov was born on to a Russian peasant family in the village of Kolega. He was orphaned at a young age after his father was killed in the Russian Civil War and his mother died soon afterward. He and his sisters were then raised by their grandfather, but after the man's death the children were sent to an orphanage. Upon completing his initial schooling in 1931, Khokhryakov attended trade school and trained as an electrician and mechanic until 1934. From then until being drafted into the military in 1937 he worked at a mine in Kopeysk. ==Military career== Once in the Red Army he was stationed in the Kiev Military District, and after graduating from tank school he became the deputy political officer of the 60th Separate Reconnaissance Battalion in 1938. In September that year he entered the Lenin Military-Political Academy, which he graduated from in 1939. As a junior political officer he was made a deputy squadron commander of political affairs of the 1st Army Group in May, and was soon sent to Mongolia to fight Japan in Khalkhin Gol. For his actions in the conflict he was awarded the Soviet Medal for Courage and the Mongolian Order of the Polar Star. That year he became a member of the Communist Party, and before the start of 1940 he was a regimental political department instructor. In May 1941 he graduated from the M. V. Frunze Military Academy and made deputy commander of a tank battalion within the 109th Tank Regiment. ===World War II=== The month after graduating from the academy he experienced his baptism by fire in the Second World War. Initially taking part in the defensive operations on the South- Western Front, he was transferred to the 21st Army of the Western Front in early July. There he was involved in counterattacks in the defense of Smolensk and Bobruisk. Transferred again, he became the deputy commander of the 117th Tank Battalion on the Western Front in August, and formally promoted to the rank of political officer in September. After success in the Battle of Moscow he was wounded near Velizh in May 1942, but was able to return to his battalion upon recovery. That year he was promoted to the rank major. Having requested to switch from political instruction to a direct combat post, he was assigned to a tank battalion and later company until August 1943. Shortly after graduating from command staff training at the Molotov Armored School in December he was given command of the 209th Tank Battalion of the 54th Guards Tank Brigade of the 7th Guards Tank Corps. During his tenure the battalion took part in successful offensives against the Axis in Ukraine and Poland; officially, the tank crews under his command took out four tanks, six mortars, five cars, four anti-tank rifles, took 26 prisoners, and killed over 100 enemy combatants during two weeks in March, starting on 4 March 1944. On 18 March 1944 he was wounded, but on 24 May 1944 he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union. After recovering he was able to participate in the Vistula-Oder offensive, during which he unit advanced for over 200 kilometers to Poland in January 1945, resulting in the expulsion of the Axis from the city of Częstochowa. In that battle, the Red Army was able to take out a large amount of German equipment with relatively few losses. He was nominated to receive the title Hero of the Soviet Union a second time for his actions in the city as well as in the crossings of the Nida, Pilica, and Warta. Officially declared a Hero of the Soviet Union on 10 April 1945, he was killed in action roughly 100 kilometers from Berlin near Cottbus before he received his award in person. On the morning of 17 April 1945, his advancing tank was ambushed. Wounded, Khokhryakov approached a nearby tank for assistance but was killed by an exploding shell. He was buried in Vasilkov, in Kiev oblast. == Awards == Khokhryakov received the following awards: * Twice Hero of the Soviet Union (24 May 1944 and 10 April 1945) * Order of Lenin (24 May 1944) * Medal \\"For Courage\\" (1939) * Order of the Polar Star (1939) ==See also== * Aleksandr Golovachev * David Dragunsky * Zakhar Slyusarenko ==References== ===Bibliography=== * Category:1915 births Category:1945 deaths Category:Heroes of the Soviet Union Category:Recipients of the Order of Lenin Category:Recipients of the Medal \\"For Courage\\" (Russia) Category:Frunze Military Academy alumni Category:People from Orenburg Governorate Category:Soviet military personnel of World War II Category:Soviet Army officers ","title":"Semyon Khokhryakov"},{"id":"61539363","text":"The Apostolic Prefecture of Jian'ou is an apostolic prefecture located in the city of Jian'ou that is immediately subject to the Holy See.

The bergamotenes are found in a variety of plants, particularly in their essential oils. There are two structural isomers, α-bergamotene and β-bergamotene, which differ only by the location of a double bond. Both of these isomers have stereoisomers, the most common of which are known as the cis and trans-isomers (or endo- and exo-isomers). α-Bergamotene is found in the oils of carrot, bergamot, lime, citron, cottonseed, and kumquat. ==Pheromones== The bergamotenes are pheromones for some insects. For example, β-trans-bergamotene is a pheromone for the wasp Melittobia digitata. Plants can defend themselves against attack by herbivorous insects by producing pheromones such as bergamotenes that attract predators of those herbivores. In a more complex relationship, the tobacco plant Nicotiana attenuata emits α-trans-bergamotene from its flowers at night to attract the tobacco hawk moth (Manduca sexta) as a pollinator; however, during the day the leaves produce α-trans-bergamotene to lure predatory insects to feed on any larvae and eggs that the pollinator may have produced. ==Biosynthesis== All the bergamotenes are biosynthesized from farnesyl pyrophosphate via a variety of enzymes including exo-alpha-bergamotene synthase, (+)-endo-beta-bergamotene synthase, (-)-endo-alpha-bergamotene synthase, and others. Bergamotenes, in turn, are intermediates in the biosynthesis of more complex chemical compounds.

The church was built in 1877–78 and has been Grade II listed since 1987. ==History== St Andrew's was built as a chapel of ease to the parish church of St Germanus. Owing to the approximate distance of a mile between the parish church and the village, it had long been felt that residents would be better served by a new church, particularly the sick and elderly. Initially a former brewery building was hired in the village during 1876 for use as a place of worship, however when part of it was transformed into a school, efforts were made towards the construction of a purpose-built church. Kenelm William Edward Edgcumbe, the 6th Earl of Mount Edgcumbe, was a major benefactor of the proposal and he donated a plot of land for the church, the local stone used for its construction and a sum of money. Further financial donations were received from local residents, including Rev. R. Ley and prominent landowner Mr. C. S. Vallack, and the War Office. The plans for the church were drawn up by Mr. Samuel Johns of Saltash and the foundation stone laid by the Earl of Mount Edgcumbe on 29 May 1877 in the presence of a large crowd. As part of the ceremony, a procession traveled from the temporary place of worship to the site of the new church, including members of the clergy, choirs of Maker and Rame churches and Sunday School children. The church was built by Mr. J. W. Hosking of Saltash, with Mr. Bryant of Devonport supplying the pitch pine work. St Andrew's was opened on 28 May 1878. The opening services commenced with Holy Communion at 8:30am, followed by morning prayer around 11:45am and an evening service. The morning prayer was attended by the Bishop of Truro, Edward White Benson, who formally opened the church and preached. At the time of its opening, the church cost just under £1,000. Owing to limited funds, a chancel and vestry was not included as part of the original construction work, although Mr. Johns made future provision in his plans for them. The porch doubled as a temporary vestry until a permanent one could be built. The intended chancel was added in 1883, built by Mr. W. B. Carne of Cawsand and opened on 30 November of that year. A vestry was added in the early 20th century. ==Architecture== St Andrew's is built of sandstone rubble with white brick dressings and a slate roof in the Early English style. It was designed to accommodate 300 persons and is made up of a nave, chancel, north porch and south vestry. The church has a number of lancet-shaped windows and a bell turret sits on the west gable. All of the church's windows are lattice glazed and the chancel has a three-light window on its east side. The church fittings include a wooden pulpit and octagonal stone font. ==References== Category:Church of England church buildings in Cornwall Category:Grade II listed churches in Cornwall ","title":"St Andrew's Church, Cawsand"},{"id":"61539745","text":"Ryan McCarthy is an American football coach.

The sailboat design was commenced in 1990 as an intended production commercial product that would also be used to development new composite materials and techniques. The boat's design goals were, \\"a lightweight, trailerable catamaran that was fast, fun to sail, had weekend accommodations for 2 or 3 and was priced below $35,000.\\" The design was intended to reach a break-even point at a production rate of two boats per week and would be profitable at three boats per week. The design challenge was to built a boat of this size that could be transported on a trailer behind a mid-sized car, a requirement that restricted the design to a towed weight of a maximum of . The design used a new manufacturing technique: single vacuum bagged epoxy resin laminate construction, conventional polyester gelcoat and reinforcing fibers fully wetted-out mechanically on a rolling machine. It used low-temperature cured epoxy resin with long cure times to achieve the desired finished physical properties. This process became the company's Pro-Set process, which has been commercially successful. In 1992 the company sold its wind turbine blade manufacturing business and terminated the catamaran production at the same time, having produced only 14 boats and never achieved full series production. ==Design== The Gougeon 32 is a recreational sailboat, built predominantly of fiberglass with balsa and foam cores, with aluminum spars. It has a fractional sloop rig with a fully battened mainsail, a jib and provisions for a light wind drifter sail. The two hulls have plumb stems, vertical transoms, transom- hung rudders controlled by a central tiller and a daggerboard in each hull. It displaces and carries of flooding water ballast, in each hull. The ballast is drained for road transport. The boat has a draft of with the daggerboards extended, allowing beaching or ground transportation on a trailer with the boards retracted. The boat is normally fitted with a small outboard motor for docking and maneuvering. The fuel tank holds . The design has sleeping accommodation for two adults and two children. The cabin floor is padded and can be used for additional sleeping space, as can the open cockpit. The interior seating is made from fiberglass. The galley includes a small sink and a single-burner propane stove for cooking. The head is a portable type. A bow trampoline provides space and also deflects spray when sailing. The mast is a rotating design, hinged for ground transport, folding forward over the towing vehicle. The mast is supported by a single set of shrouds and running backstays. The mainsail may be reefed by rolling around the rotating boom, while the jib has roller furling. There is a full-width mainsheet traveler and the mainsheet itself has a 8:1 mechanical advantage. ==Operational history== The 14 boats in service have won numerous races. In the 2017 Race to Alaska, Russell Brown skippered his Gougeon 32, Incognito, to first place in the solo class. In a review Richard Sherwood described the design, \\"the Gougeon 32 is a big, fast, stable catamaran that can be sailed by one or two and will sleep two adults and two children. In addition, you can camp out in the cockpit. Six hundred pounds of water ballast may be placed in each hull for stability, but may be drained for trailering. ==See also== *List of sailing boat types Similar sailboats *MacGregor 26 *Hunter 27 Edge ==References== Category:Catamarans Category:1990s sailboat type designs Category:Sailing yachts Category:Trailer sailers ","title":"Gougeon 32"},{"id":"61539911","text":"The Computer Research Center of Islamic Sciences (CRCIS, also known as Noor, مرکز تحقیقات کامپیوتری علوم اسلامی) was established in 2007 with the aim of digitizing Islamic science resources at the suggestion of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran.Chet Bowers: Digital Detachment: How Computer Culture Undermines Democracy, Routledge, 2016, p. 50.

It is performed by Judith Blegen, Frederica von Stade, the Women's Voices of the Mendelssohn Club of Philadelphia and the Philadelphia Orchestra under the direction of Eugene Ormandy. It was released in 1977. ==Background== The album omits Nos. 4, 10 and 12 from Mendelssohn's score, replacing the latter with a relocated No. 8, a reprise of part of the Nocturne and a brief violin solo. The vocal numbers use the German texts for which Mendelssohn composed his music, not the English verses from which they were translated.Mendelssohn, Felix: A Midsummer Night's Dream, cond. Eugene Ormandy, RCA Victor Red Seal CD, RD 82804, 1985 The album is the first of two recordings of the work in which Frederica von Stade took part. In the second, released on CD by Deutsche Grammophon in 1994, she performed a more nearly complete, English-language version of the score with Kathleen Battle, the Tanglewood Festival Chorus, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Seiji Ozawa and the actor Judi Dench, who contributed passages of narration between Mendelssohn's musical numbers.Mendelssohn, Felix: A Midsummer Night's Dream, cond. Seiji Ozawa, Deutsche Grammophon CD, 439 897-2, 1994 For details, see A Midsummer Night's Dream (Seiji Ozawa recording). ==Recording== The album was recorded using analogue technology on 20 April, 6 May and 12 May 1976 in the Scottish Rite Cathedral, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. ==Packaging== The cover of the album was designed under the art direction of J. J. Stelmach, and features a previously unpublished painting by Arthur Rackham held in the collection of Mr and Mrs Michael Loeb of New York City. ==Critical reception== A portrait of Mendelssohn painted by Wilhelm Hensel in 1847 Edward Greenfield reviewed the album on LP in Gramophone in October 1978, comparing it with earlier versions conducted by Otto Klemperer,Mendelssohn, Felix: A Midsummer Night's Dream, cond. Otto Klemperer, EMI Records LP, SXLP 30196 André PrevinMendelssohn, Felix: A Midsummer Night's Dream, cond. André Previn, EMI Records LP, ASD 3377 and Raymond Leppard.Mendelssohn, Felix: A Midsummer Night's Dream, cond. Raymond Leppard, Erato LP, STU 71090 The four recordings differed not just in matters of interpretation, but also in regard to how much of Mendelssohn's music they included. Previn and Leppard served up every note that Mendelssohn had written, even the briefest of his melodramas. Klemperer left several fragments out. Eugene Ormandy pursued a middle way, retaining some items that Klemperer rejected but omitting No. 4, No. 10 and No.12, replacing the latter with a relocated No. 8 augmented with \\"a fragment of the Nocturne plus a radiant violin descant\\". A more conspicuous feature of Ormandy's disc was that its soloists' and chorus's contributions were sung in German translations of William Shakespeare's verse rather than, as was customary, in the playwright's own, English words. This was historically correct: Mendelssohn had composed his music for a staging of A Midsummer Night's Dream in Berlin, and had set his music to a text translated into German by Schlegel and Tieck. Moreover, performing his score in English necessitated altering his notes, repeatedly changing a pair of quavers into a quaver followed by two semi-quavers. However, Greenfield felt that he \\"would certainly prefer English every time, if only because the sibilant German consonants make the fairies sound as though they are taken with little sneezes\\".A portrait of August Wilhelm Schlegel painted by Adolf HohneckAbout how well or badly Ormandy's fairies sang Greenfield had nothing to say, but he did praise the Philadelphia Orchestra's playing as beautiful and \\"finely disciplined\\". Ormandy's conducting, on the other hand, left him slightly disappointed. Klemperer was \\"more strikingly characterful\\", and Ormandy's reading of \\"Bunte Schlangen\\" (\\"You spotted snakes\\") sounded \\"relatively sluggish\\" after listening to Previn's or Leppard's. Previn and Leppard were in general lighter and more playful than Ormandy. The new album was exquisitely engineered, delivering \\"glorious sound recorded fully and richly with plenty of inner detail\\", but all in all, Previn's and Leppard's discs were marginally preferable.Greenfield, Edward: Gramophone, October 1978, p. 746 Greenfield revisited the album in Gramophone in January 1986, when it had been issued on CD. \\"Interpretatively, Ormandy scores consistently,\\" he wrote, \\"...whether in the mystery of the fairy music, ... the natural, unforced sweetness of the slow coda of the Overture or the lightness of pointing in the Scherzo. Also, the soloists of the Philadelphia Orchestra consistently outshine [those on a rival recording].\\"Greenfield, Edward: Gramophone, January 1986, p. 920 In an article about classical music's basic repertoire that he contributed to Stereo Review in November 1983, Richard Freed praised Eugene Ormandy's album as even better than a \\"much-admired, nearly complete recording conducted by Peter Maag\\".Mendelssohn, Felix: A Midsummer Night's Dream, cond. Peter Maag, London Records LP, STS 15084 Ormandy, he wrote, offered \\"an even fuller selection, richer sound and the superb Judith Blegen and Frederica von Stade in the vocal numbers\\".Freed, Richard: Stereo Review, November 1983, p. 67 ==CD track listing== The Chandos portrait of Shakespeare, from the National Portrait Gallery, London Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy (1809-1847) A Midsummer Night's Dream, with a text taken from A Midsummer Night's Dream by William Shakespeare (1564-1611), translated into German by August Wilhelm Schlegel (1767-1845) and Dorothea Tieck (1799-1841) Overture, Op. 21 (1826) * 1 (12:32) Overture, Allegro di molto Incidental music, Op. 61 (1843) * 2 (4:46) No. 1: Scherzo, Allegro vivace * 3 (0:33) No. 2: Melodrama, L'istesso tempo * 4 (1:25) Elfenmarsch (March of the fairies), Allegro vivace * 5 (4:57) No. 3: Lied mit Chor (Song with Chorus), \\"Bunte Schlangen\\" (\\"You spotted snakes\\"), Allegro ma non troppo * 6 (3:31) No. 5: Intermezzo, Allegro appassionato * 7 (2:34) No. 6: Melodrama, Allegro * 8 (6:33) No. 7: Nocturne, Con moto tranquillo * 9 (5:24) No. 9: Hochzeitsmarsch (Wedding march), Allegro vivace *10 (1:04) Marcia funebre (Funeral march), Allegro comodo *11 (1:45) No. 11: Ein Tanz von Rüpeln (A dance of clowns), Allegro di molto *12 (1:28) No. 8: Melodrama, Andante *13 (4:52) No. 14: Finale, Allegro di molto ==Personnel== Eugene Ormandy in 1973 ===Musical=== * Judith Blegen, soprano, First Fairy * Frederica von Stade, mezzo-soprano, Second Fairy * Murray Panitz, flute * Mason Jones, horn * Women's Voices of the Mendelssohn Club of Philadelphia * Eugene Ormandy, conductor ===Other=== * Jay David Saks, producer * Paul Goodman, engineer ==Release history== In 1977, RCA Victor Red Seal released the album on LP (catalogue numbers RL 12084 and ARL1-2084)Mendelssohn, Felix: A Midsummer Night's Dream, cond.

His fame escalated after releasing \\"Lo Que Siento\\" (2017), which attracted over 109 million streams on Spotify alone. Cuco self-released his first two EPs, Wannabewithu (2016) and Songs4u (2017) after graduating from Hawthorne High School. In 2019, he released his first studio album Para Mi with Interscope Records. His music has gained approximately 290.6 million streams according to Nielsen Music. ==Early life== Omar Banos was born an only child in Inglewood, California on June 26, 1998 to immigrant Mexican parents. His mother, Irma, came from the city of Puebla, while his father, Adolfo, came from Mexico City. He grew up in the city of Hawthorne, California, and began playing music at the age of eight. He had experimented with trumpet, guitar, keyboard, drums, bass guitar, mellophone and french horn before the age of 15. Banos attended junior school in Lennox and graduated from Hawthorne High School where he played in the school marching band as well as the jazz band. == Career == === 2015: Heavy Trip === After graduating, Banos uploaded a slide guitar cover of Sleep Walk by Santo & Johnny to YouTube, which gained thousands of views. He began producing and releasing songs from his parents' home and releasing them onto Bandcamp and SoundCloud. In January 2015, Banos released his first EP on Bandcamp, titled Heavy Trip. In the same year, Banos had released his first song, \\"Yeah\\" on SoundCloud under the moniker of Heavy Trip. He then switched to Cuco, which was a nickname given to him by his mother as a child. Cuco performing at Primavera Sound in May 2019 === 2016–2017: Wannabewithu and Songs4u === By the age of 18, Banos had self-produced his first mixtape Wannabewithu in 2016, after teaching himself how to use Ableton Live. Cuco released his second mixtape, Songs4u in 2017 when he started playing at clubs in Southern California, selling out his first two venues. Cuco released his first single \\"Lo Que Siento\\" in 2017, which has reached over 128 million streams on Spotify alone. Following the success of \\"Lo Que Siento,\\" Cuco dropped out after a year of attending Santa Monica City College to pursue a career in music. === 2019: Para Mi === Cuco collaborated with American singer Clairo for the single \\"Drown\\", which was released in August 2018. He then collaborated with Polyphia on a track called \\"So Strange\\" off their album New Levels New Devils, which was released in October 2018. Cuco played alongside saxophonist Kenny G at Coachella in April 2018, as well as at Lollapalooza in October 2018. In February 2019, he collaborated with his childhood Chicano rap idols MC Magic and Lil Rob on a track called \\"Search\\". After a bidding war that lasted two years, Banos signed under Interscope Records in March 2019. On April 2, 2019, Cuco released \\"Hydrocodone,\\" the lead single for Para Mi, before releasing \\"Bossa No Sé\\" with Jean Carter on May 22, 2019. Cuco later released his debut studio album, Para Mi, on July 26. The album touches on recent problems that Cuco has experienced first-hand, including a tour bus accident that sent him and his band to hospital. The album debuted at 94 on the US Charts. == Artistry == === Musical style and songwriting === Banos' musical style blends elements of bossa nova and indie pop. Suzy Exposito from Rolling Stone described his music as \\"psychedelia-soaked love ballads\\". Brett Calwood told LA Weekly that Banos's music has \\"smooth Latin influences with a nostalgic lean\\". Banos blends English and Spanish lyrics over what he describes as \\"alternative dream pop\\" melodies that have \\"a lot of synthesizers\\" and \\"a lot of 808's\\". === Influences === Banos grew up listening to Chicano rap from names such as Lil Rob, Baby Bash and MC Magic, as well as Spanish rock, boleros and other old ballads that his parents would play around the house. He listens to jazz, classical music and trap music, and has cited Kevin Parker of Tame Impala and Ariel Pink as some of his major musical influences. In an interview with Jesse Thorn from Bullseye, Banos described how the song, \\"Feels Like We Only Go Backwards\\" by Tame Impala helped him with visualizing his career in music and navigating his life in high school. == Discography == === Albums === { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + List of studio albums, with selected details and chart positions. ! rowspan=\\"2\\" scope=\\"col\\" Title ! rowspan=\\"2\\" scope=\\"col\\" Album details ! colspan=\\"2\\" scope=\\"col\\" Peak chart positions - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\\" US ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\\" US Alt. - ! scope=\\"row\\" Para Mi  * Released: July 26, 2019 * Label: Interscope PS * Formats: CD, digital download, streaming, vinyl 94 6 } === Extended plays === === Singles === As lead artist { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" Year ! scope=\\"col\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" Album/EP - 2017 ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Lo Que Siento\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" -  rowspan=\\"4\\"  2018 ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"Sunnyside\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"CR-V\\"  Chiquito - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Drown\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Lucy\\" -  rowspan=\\"2\\"  2019 ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Hydrocodone\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" Para Mi - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Bossa No Sé\\" } As featured artist { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" Year ! scope=\\"col\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" Album - 2018 ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"So Strange\\" New Levels New Devils -  rowspan=\\"5\\" 2019 ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Search\\"  rowspan=\\"3\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"DameLove\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Fix Me\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"777\\" Jesus Said Run It Back - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Take Me Before I Die\\" The South Got Something to Say -  2020 ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Off the Goop\\"  Baby Gravy 2 } === Bandcamp releases === === Music videos === { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + List of music videos, showing year released and directors ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:15em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:0.5em;\\" Year ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:27em;\\" Director(s) ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:0.5em;\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Sunnyside\\"  rowspan=\\"3\\"  2018  Ambar Navarro  - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Summertime Hightime\\"  Mu$ty Boyz  - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"CR-V\\"  David Gantz & Theo Cohn  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"Search\\"  rowspan=\\"5\\"  2019  Ali Zamani  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"Hydrocodone\\"  Jazmin Garcia  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"Bossa No Sé\\"  Pasqual Gutierrez  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"Feelings\\" Francisco Outón  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Keeping Tabs  Pasqual Gutierrez & RJ Sanchez  } == External links == * Official website == References == Category:21st-century American singers Category:American singer-songwriters Category:Living people Category:American musicians of Mexican descent Category:American Internet celebrities Category:American indie pop musicians Category:Musicians from Hawthorne, California Category:Musicians from Inglewood, California Category:Singers from California Category:1998 births Category:Interscope Records artists Category:Bedroom pop musicians ","title":"Cuco (musician)"},{"id":"61539951","text":" The Oškinis BRO-23KR Garnys is a glassfibre primary glider, built in the USSR in the early 1980s. Only two were completed. ==Design and development== The BRO-23KR was designed by Bronis Oškinis and constructed by Česlovas Kisonas and K. Rinkevičius (the KR of the name) at the Kaunas hang gliding club. Designed in 1981, it was intended to replace the BRO-11M (LAK-2) after production ended in 1979. It first flew in 1981. The BRO-23KR is a glassfibre aircraft with a strut and wire-braced high wing and a pod and boom fuselage with an open-sided cockpit and a T-tail. Its wing is rectangular in plan out to blunted and turned-down tips and both its single spar and ribs are formed from woven glassfibre. Three-ply glasscloth skin ahead of the spar forms a torsion resistant D-box.The narrow trailing edge of the wing was cast in epoxy with spanwise glassfibres and glasscloth covered. The whole wing was then covered with glued and thermally bonded, transparent polyethylene terephthalate film. It has narrow, full span, slotted ailerons, operating in co-ordination with rudder deflections and built in the same way as the wings. Single struts on each side brace the spar to the lower fuselage. The fuselage of the BRO-23KR is formed from two GRP halves and attached to the wing centre- section. It has a long, shallow open cockpit which stretches back under the wing with the pilot in a reclined position. The tail unit, constructed in a similar way to the wing, has a highly swept, near-rectangular fin with a high aspect ratio horizontal tail mounted on its top. Its rather angular rudder, on a backward-leaning hinge, is large. The BRO-23KR has very adaptable landing gear based on a landing skid sprung on five rubber blocks, which stretches nearly from the nose to just aft of the spar. The skid is wide enough to land on snow but can be fitted with a tyred wheel in summer. More unusual attachments include a set of introductory tricycle wheels and floats for landing on water. There is a long, self-sprung GRP landing skid under the tail. ==Operational history== Only two BRO-23KRs were constructed, the prototype and one built in 1984 by Panévežio Atsk. One took part in the 2nd World Championship, an Eastern European series gliding contest distinct from the FAI event, where it showed distinct improvements over earlier Soviet primary gliders. Both aircraft remained airworthy in 2015. In 1982 the prototype was motorized into the BROK-1M, with a largely uncowled, pusher configuration, engine. Its installation, designed by Kišonas, placed it well above the rear part of the wing on forward and aft transverse V-struts from the central wing mountings, laterally braced on each side by a long strut out to the wing. It used the tricycle landing gear. In 2009 one airframe remained in the Sport Aviation Museum in Kaunas but there was no information about its identity or condition or if it was on open display. ==Variants== ;BROK-1M: First prototype BRO-23KR motorized. ==Specifications== ==References== Category:1980s Soviet sailplanes Category:Aircraft manufactured in Lithuania ","title":"Oškinis BRO-23KR Garnys"},{"id":"61539960","text":"opened in Akita, Akita Prefecture, Japan in 1990.

It stands at the place of one of the three wooden crosses erected—according to historical tradition—at the behest of Saint Nino to mark adoption of Christianity by the people of Kartli. The extant structure is a hall church, a 9th–10th-century remodeling of an earlier cross-in-square building. The church is inscribed on the list of Georgia's Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance. == Location == The Aghaiani church tops Mount Tkhoti, 845 m high, on the left bank of the Mtkvari (Kura). According to the medieval Georgian historical tradition, it was on this mount that the sudden darkness engulfed Mirian, a pagan king of Kartli, and the light did not resume until the king invoked \\"the god of Nino\\", a female preacher of Christianity. After Mirian's conversion—traditionally dated to 337—Nino had three wooden crosses erected in Kartli, one of them at Tkhoti, two others at Ujarma and Mtskheta, respectively. Later, a church was built in this place. == Layout == Church of St. Nino on Mt. Tkhoti. The extant edifice, built of stone and brick, measures 8.48 × 4.18 m. It was originally a cross-in-square structure built in the 7th or 8th century. In the 9th or 10th century, the church was remodeled into a hall church: its cross-like appearance was retained as were a semi-circular apse and the western arm, but the dome was replaced with a barrel vault rested on five arches and the northern and southern arms were built up. The entrances are on the north and west. The interior is lit with two windows, one in the apse and the other in the southern wall. The central bay is covered with a gable, while the northern and southern projections have pent roofs. An arched buttress was annexed to the southern façade in the 16th century. The church was repaired in 2007. The sanctuary walls bear surviving fragments of frescoes and inscriptions. The paintings are stylistically dated to the end of the 10th or the beginning of the 11th century. On the eastern façade, a keystone of window arch bears three sculpted crosses. The southern façade boasts an inscription in the medieval Georgian asomtavruli script, arranged in three lines. == References == Category:Buildings and structures in Shida Kartli Category:Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance of Georgia Category:Georgian Orthodox churches in Georgia (country) Category:7th-century churches Category:8th- century churches ","title":"Aghaiani church of Saint Nino"},{"id":"61540071","text":"The molecular formula C12H15N3O2 (molar mass: 233.266 g/mol) may refer to: * Pardoprunox * Phenylpiracetam hydrazide Category:Molecular formulas ","title":"C12H15N3O2"},{"id":"61540100","text":"Ismael Casas Casado (born 7 March 2001) is a Spanish footballer who plays for Málaga CF as a right back. ==Club career== Born in Linares, Jaén, Andalusia, Casas joined Málaga CF's youth setup in July 2013, from CD Almidas Cástulo.

Soares, who was 79 when the album was released, recorded the album with the help of nearly three dozen producers, composers, songwriters and musicians including Victor Rice and figures from the vanguarda paulista scene.Album liner notes The album combines her usual style of samba with influences from jazz, afro-funk, noise rock and post-punk. The album received critical acclaim upon being released internationally and would go on to appear in many end-of- year lists. ==Composition== ===Style=== Describing the album's sound, Philip Sherburne notes \\"the hardscrabble guitar-and-drum interplay; the horns, betraying the faintest hint of two-tone ska; and above all, her impossibly malleable voice, like a scrap of sandpaper turning into a tsunami.\\" \\"The veteran samba singer’s voice is a polemical force in its own right,\\" writes Ludovic Hunter-Tilney, \\"a low growl muscling through songs with outcast pride.\\" The writer also notes a post-punk influence in the \\"abrasive\\" guitar- work and goes on to compare the track \\"Luz Vermelha\\" to a \\"tropical Fugazi.\\" Sherburne similarly describes the album's combination of \\"Afro-Brazilian styles with wiry, dissonant strands of punk and noise-rock, where the Ex mingles freely with Tom Zé.\\" Thom Jurek describes the track \\"Pra Fuder\\" as \\"electro-acoustic samba [...] framed by a clattering, bleating acid funk that recalls the Pop Group as it meets Fela's charging multi-horn grooves and swagger.\\" He describes the track \\"Benedita\\" as \\"a rhythm collision where samba, jazz, and the punky friction of Gang of Four rub against one another, break apart, and recombine.\\" The influence of jazz music is also mentioned by Michelle Mercer. ===Themes=== Soares had described to a producer that she wanted the album to be about \\"sex and blackness.\\" Sherburne writes: \\"The album is part autobiography, part reinvention, and all provocation, channeling both her life’s pain and her incredible resilience into an alloy that is by turns jagged and molten.\\" \\"The album doubles as a portrait of contemporary Brazil—\\" he continues, \\"a country beset by crises, including corruption scandals, the worst recession in over a century, a wave of police brutality, and a rising tide of anti-gay violence.\\" The song \\"Pra Fuder\\" (\\"To Fuck\\") is described by Mercer as follows: \\"It's like after decades of strolling along as an object, the girl from Ipanema finally marched over, grabbed the guitar and sang her own wild desires.\\" \\"Benedita\\" features a \\"multi-part narrative detail[ing] drug addiction, persecution of transgender and poor people by the police and celebrates the holiness of the oppressed.\\" \\"Maria da Vila Matilde\\" is \\"about domestic violence, about showing the police a bruised arm. You get the sense she knows the subject all too well.\\" The title track deals with themes such as \\"loss\\" and \\"endurance\\" whilst Sherburne also finds it to be \\"a heart-rending ode to samba, carnival, and the lifesaving qualities of music itself.\\" The opening track \\"Coração do Mar\\" adapts a poem by Oswald de Andrade described as \\"a melancholy, imagistic meditation upon loss and slavery that becomes, in [Soares'] weary recitation, something like an inverse national anthem.\\" ==Release== \\"Maira da Vila Matilde\\" was the only single released from the album. The album itself was released through Circus Records in Brazil and through Mais Um Discos in the UK. The booklet accompanying physical copies contain English translations of the lyrics. A track-for-track remix of the album - End of the World: Remixes - was released in 2017, featuring contributions from Laraaji, Gilles Peterson, Omulu, DJ Marfox and many others. It was also released through Mais Um Discos. ==Reception== The album received critical acclaim. Robert Christgau praised Soares' voice and wrote: \\"The collaboration makes complete sense. And there's nothing like [this album].\\" Sherburne called it \\"one of the year’s most original and exhilarating listens; that is equally true of its raucous, unorthodox fusions and its quietest, contemplative moments.\\" Robin Denselow gave the album a perfect score and called it \\"the Brazilian album of the year.\\" Jurek found the album \\"so nakedly emotional and powerful, it is ultimately an anthem.\\" === Accolades === Jon Pareles, Slate, Pitchfork, and Christgau would go on to include it among the best albums of the year, the first 2 ranking it in their respective top tens. === Awards === The album won a Latin Grammy Award for \\"Best MPB Album\\". At the Brazilian Music Awards, it won for \\"Pop/Rock/Reggae/Hiphop/Funk: Album\\". ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Elza Soares herself is uncredited in the liner notes. *Guilherme Kastrup - producer, additional engineer, drums, percussion, arrangements *Celso Sim - artistic director, music, lyrics, vocals *Romulo Fróes - artistic director, songwriter, vocals *Ernst von Bönninghausen - executive producer *Rodrigo \\"Funai\\" Costa - recording engineer *Marcelo Guerreiro - assistant engineer *Anderson Trindade Barros - additional engineer *Arthur Luna Beccaris - assistant engineer *Victor Rice - mixing *Felipe Tichauer - mastering *Oswald de Andrade - poetry *José Miguel Wisnik - music *Alice Coutinho - songwriter *Douglas Germano - songwriter *Clima - songwriter *Pepê Mata Machado - music *Joana Barossi - lyrics *Fernanda Diamant - lyrics *Cacá Machado - songwriter *Alberto Tassinari - songwriter *Kiko Dinucci - songwriter, guitar, repique, acoustic guitar, arrangements *Rodrigo Campos - songwriter, cavaco, guitar, featured, arrangements *Marcelo Cabral - songwriter, bass, bass synth, 7-string acoustic guitar, arrangements, string arrangements *Felipe Roseno - percussion, arrangements *Cuca Ferreira - flute, baritone saxophone *Aramís Rocha - violin *Robson Rocha - violin *Edmur Mello - viola *Deni Rocha - cello *Edy Trombone - trombone *Thiago França - baritone saxophone, tenor saxophone *Daniel Nogueira - tenor saxophone *Douglas Antunes - trombone *Daniel Gralha - trumpet *Bixiga 70 - arrangements *DJ Marco - pick-ups *Thomas Rohrer - rabeca *Sidmar Vieira - trumpet ===Additional credits=== Alexandre Eça - photography ==References== Category:2015 albums Category:Elza Soares albums Category:Latin Grammy Award for Best MPB Album ","title":"A mulher do fim do mundo"},{"id":"61540121","text":"Ramón Enríquez Rodríguez (born 19 April 2001), simply known as Ramón, is a Spanish footballer who plays for Málaga CF as an attacking midfielder. ==Club career== Ramón was born in Órgiva, Granada, Andalusia, and joined Málaga CF's youth setup in 2013, from CD Ciudad de Granada.

His brief was to transfer cutting edge aeronautical technology to the Soviet Union and to recruit American students as spies. Embedded into the United States as part of a 65 strong cohort of Soviet students who had come to America to attend prestigious universities, Stanislav arrived in New York in September 1931. His intelligence was used by the Soviet Union both during the Second World War and the Cold War. It is very possible that his intelligence was used to create the Tu-4, a Soviet clone of the B-29 Superfortress He reached such high esteem in the USA that he was invited to parties attended by Shirley Temple, and to the White House to meet then President Franklin D Roosevelt. He evaded detection his entire life because the FBI were preoccupied with Prohibition and the rise of Organised crime in the United States in the 1930s. Additionally, the FBI had not been involved in Counter Intelligence since the First World War because they did not expect there was enough espionage occurring in the USA. ==Discovery== Archives By- Fellow Svetlana Lokhova at Churchill College, Cambridge discovered the spy after reading documents and papers from the Mitrokhin Archive at Churchill College. In 2018 she published a book on Stanislav called 'The Spy Who Changed History'.

Anon. 18th c. MexicoLobo (fem. Loba), (Spanish for \\"wolf\\") is a racial category in the Spanish colonial racial label for a mixed- race casta, far down the racial hierarchy created by the Spanish colonial regime privileging European whites. ==Definitions== Lobo and coyote are derogatory names for persons of mixed race, referred to by animal names. It could include persons of African and Indian ancestry, and many related variations. Lobo does not have a fixed meaning, with possible parents being a Black and Indian woman; Cambujo (African/Amerindian) and Indian woman; Torna atrás and Indian woman; Mestizo and Indian woman; Salta atrás (of African/European ancestry) and Mulatto woman.García Saiz, Maria Conception. Las Castas Mexicanas: Un Género Pictórico Americano. Milan: Olivetti 1989, pp. 28-29. Lobo was a classification used in official colonial documentation, including the Inquisition trials, marriage registers, and censuses.Katzew, Ilona. Casta Painting. New Haven: Yale University Press 2004, p. 44. One example of a Loba is a mixed-race woman who came before the Mexican Inquisition; she had been given multiple racial labels. She was publicly known as a China, was known to be a parda (a brown-skinned person) who “looked like a loba”, suggesting she had visible African features.quoted in Vinson, Ben III. Before Mestizaje: The Frontiers of Race and Caste in Colonial Mexico. New York: Cambridge University Press 2018, pp. 64-65 Lobos were known to be enslaved persons in seventeenth-century Mexico, likely with the mother being a Negra. The status of a child as slave or free followed that of the mother; thus children born to enslaved mothers were born into slavery, regardless of their paternity.Vinson, Before Mestizaje, p. 70. In historian Ben Vinson III’s analysis of what he calls “extreme racial categories,” he includes lobos with castizos, moriscos, albinos (persons with mixed African ancestry who look European), coyotes, \\"mestindios\\", and chinos.Vinson, Before Mestizaje, p. 92. There were regional differences in colonial Mexico for racial labeling. For instance, in Xichú and Casas Viejas in the Bajío region near Querétaro and the Sierra Gorda mountains, where there were resident indigenous populations, as well as blacks and mulattos, locally the people used lobos as a \\"normative category\\".Vinson, Before Mestizaje, pp. 98-99. In his examination of marriage patterns from marital registers, Vinson found no records of lobos marrying each other; brides and grooms thus classified chose partners from other racial categories.Vinson, Before Mestizaje, p. 128 In eighteenth-century casta paintings, lobos are usually shown doing physical work and not lavishly dressed, indicating lower class status. In Joaquín Antonio de Basarás’s Origen, costumbres, y estado presente de mexicanos y philipinos (1763), the lobo father is a water carrier, while his Indian wife sells chickens.Katzew, Casta Painting, pp. 186-87, illustration 248. An early 18th-century set of casta paintings shows the Lobo as the offspring of a Black father and India mother; in the same set, a Lobo father and an India mother have a dark-skinned child labeled a Lobo Torna atrás, meaning the child more closely resembled the Black father.García Saiz, ‘’Las Castas Mexicanas’’, pp. 58, 59.

Paul was a native of Tella. By 615 he was a bishop. At some point before 613, he fled Syria for Egypt. Possibly he was one of several non-Chalcedonian bishops who fled in 599 amidst the persecution of Domitian of Melitene, nephew of the Emperor Maurice. He is not named by Michael the Syrian among the exiles, but the bishop of Tella is said to have returned to diocese when the persecution ceased. If this was Paul, then he fled a second time to Egypt during the Persian invasion of Syria in 609–611. In Egypt, Paul lived in the Enaton, a group of monasteries near Alexandria. There he joined with other Syriac scholars, including Tumo of Ḥarqel, to translate Greek texts into Syriac. Working between 613 and 617, Paul was primarily responsible for the Syro- Hexapla, a Syriac translation of Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Old Testament, based on the version found in Origen's Hexapla. He also translated a liturgy for baptism by Severus of Antioch. His translation work is characterised by close imitation of the Greek morphology, syntax and word order. Paul of Tella is sometimes proposed as the translator of the pericope about Jesus and the woman taken in adultery, which is found in neither the later standard Syriac Bible, the Peshitta, nor in Tumo of Ḥarqel's translation of the New Testament, the Ḥarqlean Version. It is attributed to a certain \\"Abbas Pawla\\" in the manuscripts, but this is probably Paul of Edessa. Besides his translations, Paul wrote at least one surviving sedro (a type of long prayer). There is some question over whether the bishop of Tella named Paul and the translator of the Septuagint of the same name are the same person. The translator is sometimes instead identified with Paul of Nisibis. ==Notes== ==Sources== * * Category:6th-century births Category:7th-century deaths Category:Syriac Orthodox Church bishops Category:Syriac Christians Category:Syriac writers Category:Greek–Syriac translators ","title":"Paul of Tella"},{"id":"61540339","text":"Phaeobalia lynebrgi is a species of dance flies, in the fly family Empididae. ==References== Category:Empididae Category:Insects described in 1973 Category:Diptera of Europe ","title":"Phaeobalia lynebrgi"},{"id":"61540349","text":"Daniel Fernández Fernández (born 30 April 1997) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for CD Badajoz as a right back. ==Club career== Fernández was born in Madrid, and joined Real Madrid's La Fábrica in 2012, from CD Leganés.

They lived in a large house near Holland Park; the marriage long but not close or confidential. Through the family's literary connections, and through her friendship with novelist and suffragist Violet Hunt, she had built a solid reputation as an influential literary hostess by the end of 1911. Biographers describe her as \\"an indefatigable sponsor of unknown talent\\". E. H. Mikhail (1977) W-B-Yeats: Interviews and Recollections, Volume 2, Macmillan, p363 Patmore's son Derek describes her as a beautiful, slightly melancholy young woman who craved attention and affection. Michael T. Davis, Cameron McWhirter, eds (2015) Ezra Pound and Globe Magazine: The Complete Correspondence, Bloomsbury Publishing, p306Novelist Violet Hunt wrote: \\"She was very beautiful with a queer, large, tortured mouth that said the wittiest things, eyes that tore your soul out of your body for pity and yet danced\\". Hunt introduced Patmore to such writers as Ezra Pound (1909), Ford Madox Ford, W.B. Yeats and H.G. Wells. In 1911, at 29, bored, distressed and dissatisfied with her husband's open philandering, she had a brief affair with the young poet Richard Aldington, 18. Patmore introduced her lover to Pound and between them the new Imagist poetry movement was born. Patmore, Pound and Aldington became inseparable, the heart of their bed-swapping London literary circle. She remained good friends with Pound until her death in 1965. Patmore went on to introduce Aldington to the new American émigré poet Hilda Doolittle (H.D) and the two became soon lovers, later marrying. The three remained close, writing \\"We three were bound together, but lightly, gaily. We liked being together. We laughed and read, walked about London, looked at pictures, had meals in tea- rooms.\\"Vivien Whelpton Richard Aldington: Poet, Soldier and Lover: 1911-1929 (2014) pp26-33 Following the breakup of Aldington and H.D's marriage, Patmore and he had a ten year relationship, living together and travelling across Europe.

The book is about plants and botany as seen through Native American traditions and Western scientific traditions. The book received largely positive reviews. Robin Kimmerer is known for her scholarship on traditional ecological knowledge, ethnobotany, and moss ecology. == Contents == Braiding Sweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge, and the Teachings of Plants is a 2013 nonfiction book written by Indigenous author Robin Wall Kimmerer and published by Milkweed. The book is about the world of botany as described and explored through Native American traditions. Kimmerer, who is a member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, also shares stories about her own experiences working with plants and learning to become reunited with her own people's cultural traditions. She also gives a background on history in relation to plants and also discusses botany through a scientific perspective. American Indian Quarterly writes that Braiding Sweetgrass is a book about traditional ecological knowledge and environmental humanities. Kimmerer combines her training in Western scientific methods and her Native American knowledge about sustainable land stewardship to describe a more joyful and ecological way of using our land in Braiding Sweetgrass. Kimmerer said about the book that \\"I wanted readers to understand that Indigenous knowledge and Western science are both powerful ways of knowing, and that by using them together we can imagine a more just and joyful relationship with the Earth.\\" Plants described in the book include squash, algae, goldenrod, pecans and the eponymous sweetgrass. ==Honors and awards== Kimmerer received the 2014 Sigurd F. Olson Nature Writing Award for her book Braiding Sweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge, and the Teachings of Plants.Hertzel, Laurie. \\"Braiding Sweetgrass\\" wins Sigurd Olson nature writing award, Star Tribune, May 7, 2014. == Reviews == Native Studies Review writes that Braiding Sweetgrass is a \\"book to savour and to read again and again.\\" Heather Sullivan writes in the \\"Journal of Germanic Studies\\" that \\"one occasionally encounters a text like an earthquake: it shakes one’s fundamental assumptions with a massive shift that, in comparison, renders mere epiphanies bloodless: Robin Wall Kimmerer’s Braiding Sweetgrass is one of these kinds of books.” Sue O'Brian in \\"Library Journal\\" wrote \\"Kimmerer writes of investigating the natural world with her students and her efforts to protect and restore plants, animals, and land. A trained scientist who never loses sight of her Native heritage, she speaks of approaching nature with gratitude and giving back in return for what we receive.

Moore in \\"The Bryologist\\" says that \\"\\"Braiding Sweetgrass\\" is far more than a memoir or a field guide. I would call it a wisdom book, because I believe that Robin has something world- changing to pass along, an ethos she has learned by listening closely to plants\\". The Tribal College Journal wrote \\"Each chapter is an adventurous journey into the world of plants.\\" Publishers Weekly call Kimmerer a \\"mesmerizing storyteller\\" in Braiding Sweetgrass. The Star Tribune writes that Kimmerer is able to give readers the ability to see the common world in a new way. == References == Category:Books about Native American history Category:Botany books Category:Ecology books Category:Ethnobotany Category:Indian philosophy Category:Native American culture Category:Native American novels Category:American non-fiction books Category:2013 non-fiction books ","title":"Braiding Sweetgrass"},{"id":"61540562","text":"Diana Hargreaves is an American biologist and assistant professor at The Salk Institute for Biological Studies and member of The Salk Cancer Center. Her laboratory focuses on epigenetic regulation by the BAF (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complexes in diverse physiological processes including development, immunity, and diseases such as cancer. == Early life and education == Hargreaves completed her Bachelor of Science in Chemistry at Haverford College, a leading liberal arts college in Haverford Pennsylvania. Hargreaves obtained her PhD in Immunology at Yale University where she studied in the lab of Ruslan Medzhitov, a leader in the field of innate immunity and pathogen recognition. Her thesis focused on the epigenetic signatures following pathogen recognition by innate immune cells such as macrophages. == Career and research == Following the completion of her Doctoral work, Hargreaves joined the lab of Dr. Gerald Crabtree where she and others uncovered that the genes encoding subunits of the BAF Chromatin remodelling subunits are mutated in ~20% of all human cancers and uncovered mechanisms of BAF complex tumor suppression. Hargreaves was appointed professorship at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in 2015 where she continues her focus on the chromatin remodelling complex BAF. Her lab has recently discovered a specific subunit of BAF that is responsible for maintaining cellular pluripotency, an unbiased differentiation state. Hargreaves' work holds potential in the realm of regenerative medicine for use in treating tissue damage and disease. Hargreaves also investigates epigenetic chromatin remodelling with a goal of identifying therapeutic targets that harness the immune system to defend against tumors. == Rewards and honors == * 2019 Pew-Stewart Scholar for Cancer Research * 2016-2018 V Foundation Scholar Award, V Foundation for Cancer Research * 2014-2018 K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award, National Cancer Institute/National Institutes of Health * 2013-2014 Ann Schreiber Research Training Program of Excellence Grantee, Ovarian Cancer Research Fund * 2010-2013 Postdoctoral Fellowship, Helen Hay Whitney Foundation * 2002-2005 Graduate Fellowship, National Science Foundation == Publications == * Foster SL, Hargreaves DC, Medzhitov R.

The province was broken due to the strong fiscal deficit, high taxes and no public works. During his period al Minister the Province recovered by law the so-called Fondo del Conurbano, in compensation of an historical discrimination in the federal tax co- participation regime (the share of Buenos Aires grew from 18% to 22% of federal tax revenues), the tax pressure and the most distortive taxes to production activity (ingresos brutos) were reduced, and the share of public works on provincial budget grew from 3,7% to more than 5% on average. At the same time, in spite of a sharp fall in activity level because of macroeconomic problems since 2018, the financial fiscal deficit was reduced from 1.1% to 0.6% of GDP, as well as the Province recovered the primary surplus since 2017 until now. ==Minister of Treasury of Argentina== On August 17, 2019, in a context of high economic and political uncertainty after the government had been defeated at primary elections, Lacunza assumed the position of Minister of Treasury of Argentina.

The present parish was formed after the two Tartu parishes, the German speaking and Estonian speaking congregations, united to form the parish of Tartu in 1833. Since the Parish Church of St John was too small to accommodate the large congregation, it was decided that a new church be built to serve the Estonian speaking members of the parish, while St John's would be used by the German speaking members. ==Church Building== A previous church dedicated to St Mary was demolished in 1704 and remained in ruins for another 100 years until it was fully demolished to make way for the main building of the University of Tartu. The new St Mary's was built between 1837 and 1841 in the classicist style on plans made by G. F. W. Geist. Works took longer than expected as the steeple collapsed and had to be rebuilt. The church was consecrated on January 11, 1842. In 1862, the church underwent major repairs and alterations. New clocks and a new pulpit were also installed. In 1889 a new altar painting was commissioned for the church by Julie Emilie Wilhelmine Hagen-Schwarz, a well-known Baltic German artist based in Tartu. The painting depicted Christ on the cross and under the cross Mary, John, and Mary Magdalene. Above the picture was an inscription from scripture which said Nida om Jumal ma ilma armastanu (For God so loved the world) (John 3:16). In 1890 a new organ was built by the famous organ company Sauer. Central heating was installed in the church in the 1930s. The church also had a museum which contained old church-related items, books and documents.Maarja kiriku ehitamine, Maarja kirik Tartu, retrieved 18 August 2019 ==WWII Destruction== During World War II, on July 12, 1941, Soviet forces bombed Tartu. Several hundred buildings were destroyed in the fire, including St Mary's Church. The church museum and other valuable archives were lost. Only the walls of the church and the big bell, which was moved to the Paistu church tower in 1948, survived the bombing. ==Soviet Occupation== After World War II, the occupying Soviets denied the congregation access to the church or permission to restore the building. In 1956, the Tartu city authorities gave the ruins of the church building to the Estonian Agricultural Academy and a gym was built instead, designed by I. Kalmet. The two remaining stone floors of the tower were demolished.St. Mary's Church in Tartu, Visit Estonia, retrieved 18 August 2019 In the tower zone, the walls were also demolished to the same height as the church walls, and the four massive feet of the tower were demolished to the foundation. According to modern recollections, students were used in the demolition work. A two-storey building adjacent to the main facade of the church building was constructed, with smaller exercise rooms, laundry rooms, classrooms and a boiler room. The sports complex was completed in 1961. Between 1941 and 1948, the congregation used St John's Church and the Tartu University Church, but then moved into St Peter's Church in 1948 where it remained till 1997. In December 1997, a church hall was erected in the former camp hall, which was consecrated at the beginning of Advent and was used as a worship room. The church hall was intended to be used as a temporary solution until its church was returned and restored. Due to the delay in the return of the church, the parish church hall remained the site of worship services for 13 years. ==Return== In December 2008, the church was returned to the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church, but the actual transfer of the premises to the congregation took place only after the university's new gym was completed on August 15, 2009. The congregation provided essential equipment and converted the former gym into a temporary church space. As such, the church could be used for services, church concerts and other appropriate purposes until the restoration project is completed and re-construction begins. ==References== ==Gallery== File:Tartu Maarja kirik, altar, ERM Fk 449 196.jpegView of the altar before 1941 File:Tartu Maarja kirik 1941, ESM F 49 7 B284.jpegin 1941 File:Tartu Maarja kirik.JPGPresent-day File:Maarja kirik, Tartu 2001.jpgDemolition of the adjacent extension (2011) Category:19th-century churches Category:Lutheran churches in Estonia Category:Buildings and structures in Tartu Category:Churches in Tartu ","title":"St Mary's Church, Tartu"},{"id":"61540779","text":"Alexander Campbell Cameron (30 December 1812 – 5 January 1869), known as Alexander Campbell until 1844, was a British Conservative politician.

By 1850, Gordon was in charge of Gordon's Gin and oversaw its exportation around the British Empire following the lifting of excise tax on exported gin by Parliament. He resumed playing first- class cricket in 1851, when he played for a Marylebone Cricket Club and Metropolitan Clubs team and Middlesex. Gordon played first-class cricket frequently until 1862, having made 27 appearances, sixteen of which came for the Marylebone Cricket Club. He scored a total of 493 runs in his 27 matches at an average of 12.02, with a high score of 33 not out. Although Gordon's Gin became an extremely successful brand, Gordon was prone to removing money from the company to invest in other ventures and inventions, which were always unsuccessful and led to the business, leaving his sons and daughters to find other means of income. Upon his death at Bedford in July 1897, the family association with the business ended.

He was a professor at the University of Copenhagen from 1867 and was a member of Folketinget from 1865. He emigrated to America after the collapse of his business conglomerate but returned to Denmark after a second bankruptcy. He was the brother of Erhard Frederiksen and Kirstine Frederiksen. ==Early life and education== Frederiksen was born on 23 March 1840 at Fuglsang Manor on Lolland, the son of Hohannes D. Friderichsen (1791-1861) and Maria Hansen (1811-1901). He graduated from Sorø Academy in1857 and then enrolled at the University of Copenhagen where he studied political sciences (statsvidenskab). He won the university's gold medal in 1859 for a thesis on the influence of grain prices on wage levels. He graduated in 1862. ==Academic career== Frederiksen competed for Julius Benzon-Buchwald's professorial chair in 1863. His competition piece, Er den frie Konkurrence under alle Omstændigheder i Almenvellets Interesse? (Is Free Competition Under All Circumstances in the Public Interest?\\"), a book of 156 pages, was written and printed in four weeks. He did not win the competition but was associated the university as docent when professor Carl Johan Henrik Kayser retired in 1865 and was two years later appointed as professor. His writings were influenced by Frédéric Bastiat. ==Politics== Frederiksen was interested in politics from an early age. He wrote about politics and national economy for Fædrelandet, especially about agricultural reforms. He was an enthusiastic proponent of Scandinavism. He was often in opposition to National Liberal views. In 1865, he was elected for Folketinget in the Maribo constituency in competition with a candidate from the Society of the Friends of Peasants. He ran with a programme of rather radical political reforms but most likely won due to the local popularity of his father. He was at later elections alternately endorsed by Højre and Venstre. Grederiksen and several Venstre-leaning National Liberals such as M. Gad and C. V. Nyholm joined a group of successful farmers, forming the so- called Ventre Party (Mellempartiet), which created an unstable majority by alternately voting with the two dominant parties. The Centre Party and especially Frederiksen contributed both to the fall of the Cabinet of Friis in 1870 and the fall of C. E. Fenger as Minister of Financial Affairs in 1872. After that the Centre Party gradually lost influence until it was dissolved in 1876. After a while Frederiksen then joined Venstre. ==Commercial activities== Kjøbenhavns Papkassefabrik Frederiksen was also active as a businessman. He also began to purchase land in Sweden until owning around 6,000 hectares. With great enthusiasm, he cultivated the land, purchased livestock, planted forest and established workshops and saw mills. In Copenhagen, he obtained citizenship as merchant (grocererborgerskab) to be able to sell his products and established a successful trading house. In 1874, Frederiksen established Kjøbenhavns Papkassefabrik. It was initially located in Farimagsgade but soon relocated to larger premises on H. C. Ørsteds Vej. He sold it in 1876. In 1871, Frederiksen was a co-founder of Landmandsbanken. He was a board member but left it when it failed to implement his ideas. He then turned to Industribanken where he after a while ended up with DKK 2 million in loans. The economic backlash in 1875 left him in a difficult situation. The Lolland Sugar Factory which had been founded by his brothers was also hit hard. Frederiksen tried to solve the situation by founding another bank, Centralbanken, but remained himself one of its few customers. Industribanken raised concerns and discontinued all loans, resulting in the bankruptcy both of Frederiksen and his brothers. ==Bankruptcy and later years== In 1877, Frederiksen left Rigsdagen, resigned as professor and went abroad and emigrated to America. He spent the first years in Chicago and Milwaukee where he established a Danish weekly magazine, Heimdal. He later established a new company which bought land in the West from railway companies and sold it off in lots to settlers. The business venture initially prospered, growing to a considerable size, but Frederiksen once again adopted a too risky strategy and he also failed to keep track of the many transactions. He was therefore hit by a second bankruptcy and many of his customers were hit by losses. In 1889 he returned to Europe, initially in London and Paris where he spent most of his time with literary work. He later returned to Copenhagen where he was both active as a businessman and writer. In 1901, he published Finland. Dets private og offentlige Økonomi'. He also wrote for a number of magazines. ==Personal life== Frederiksen married Ada Maria Monrad (19 April 1841 - 2 December 1915 (a daughter of later bishop and government minister D. G. M. (1811–87) and Emilie N. Lütthans (1815–71)), on 1 May 1865 in Kongens Lyngby. Only one of their seven children, Ditlev Gothard Monrad Frederiksen (1866-1938) survived to adulthood. == References == ==External links== * Niels Christian Frederiksen at geni.com Category:Danish economists Category:19th- century Danish businesspeople Category:University of Copenhagen alumni Category:University of Copenhagen faculty Category:People from Lolland Category:1840 births Category:1905 deaths ","title":"Niels Christian Frederiksen"},{"id":"61540922","text":"The Pon Daw Pagoda (Burmese: ပုံတော်စေတီ) is a small pagoda in Mingun, Myanmar.

It is located on the southward of canal Khlong Bangkok Noi, next to the Siriraj Piyamaharajkarun Hospital and Bangkok Noi railway station near the foot of Arun Ammarin bridge, considered as the temple that is nearest to Siriraj Hospital. It is an ancient temple dating back to the Ayutthaya period (around 1657–58), although it is not known who built it. Previously, it was called \\"Wat Bang Wa Noi\\" (วัดบางหว้าน้อย) in pair with Wat Bangwa Yai (วัดบางหว้าใหญ่) nearby, or Wat Rakhangkhositaram in present day. In the King Taksin's reign during Thonburi period, the temple has been promoted to be a royal monastery. In the early Rattanakosin period, the King Phutthayotfa Chulalok (Rama I) gave the name to the Wat Amarinthraram (Śakra temple) which remains today. Since then, it has undergone renovations and had various additions to the permanent structures during each reign. Presently, the temple is classified as the third rank of royal monastery. Wat Amarinthraram seen from Arun Ammarin bridge The attraction of the temple is the principal Buddha statue of Luang Pho Bot Noi (หลวงพ่อโบสถ์น้อย), which is as the name says, located in the chapel behind the main hall. It is a Sukhothai-style statue in Māravijaya attitude. Hence the name \\"Luang Pho Bot Noi\\" (chapel venerable father), and this name also became the unofficial name of the temple, Wat Luang Pho Bot Noi. The temple was heavily damaged by Allied bombings during World War II and the only building which was still standing was the chapel. Another interesting thing of this temple is the replica of Buddha's footprint that is inside the pavilion. In the year 2010, the Buddha's footprint pavilion is preserved by the Fine Arts Department and Crown Property Bureau. Wat Amarinthraram used to be the residence of Chuan Leekpai, two times prime minister of Thailand.

It took place while the Sassanian king Khosrow I was invading Lazica. It was part of a Byzantine offensive led by Belisarius into Persian land. When Belisarius arrived in the area he stationed his troops a significant distance away from the city. He hoped to drag the Sasanian garrison into a battle far from the city walls, and after defeating them, capture the undefended city, which was seemed impregnable otherwise. A Byzantine commander named Peter disagreed and moved his forces, together with those of John Troglita who was associated with him, closers to the city. Belisarius warned Peter that because the Byzantines didn’t normally eat until midday the garrison would sally out then so the Byzantines would have to fight while hungry. Peter ignored this and at midday his man dispersed to eat. When the Sassanians sallied out his disorganised unit was routed losing 50 men and Peter's standard. He immediately called on Belisarius for help. When the message reached Belisarius he had already seen the dust clouds produced by the Sassanian sally and was well on his way. Despite the garrison being overwhelmed by the Byzantine army they suffered only 150 casualties as they quickly retreated to the city, exactly what Belisarius had sought to avoid. == Aftermath == Recognising Nobades wouldn’t leave the city again out of fear for another such engagement Belisarius could now bypass the city as its garrison wouldn’t attack him in the rear. After an assault of Sisauranon failed he sent troops to raid rich normally safe Persian territory across the Tigris. After procuring much wealth from the area the Byzantine raiding forces split up and went home as some were afraid Belisarius would take their loot. Belisarius wanted to return home too as to avoid being surprised by the arrival of Persian forces under Khosrow. Procopius later claimed this because of Belisarius wanting to confront his wife Antonina, who’s lover his troops had imprisoned, as soon as possible about her affair. Claiming that Belisarius could have reached Ctesiphon as the path remained undefended. This argument is flawed however as the same information of the disposition of Persian troops had not been available to Belisarius at that time. ==References== Nisibis 541 Nisibis 541 Category:541 Category:540s conflicts Category:540s in the Byzantine Empire Nisibis 541 Category:6th century in Iran Category:Nusaybin ","title":"Battle of Nisibis (541)"},{"id":"61541132","text":"Chalk Flora Nature Reserve () (also: Cretaceous Flora) is a protected nature reserve of Ukraine that lies on open chalk slopes of the riverine hills along the Donets River.

Denounced as a \\"rightist\\" during the Anti-Rightist Campaign in 1957, he was banished from academia for twenty years. After the end of the Cultural Revolution, he became a research professor at the Institute of World Religions of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), and was elected an honorary academician of the CASS. == Early life and education == Yu was born in May 1930 in Hanyang, Hubei, Republic of China. In 1951, he entered the Department of Philosophy of Wuhan University. During the People's Republic of China's nationwide reorganization of higher education in 1952, his department was merged into the philosophy department of Peking University, from which he graduated in 1955. After teaching at a high school in Tianjin for a year, Yu returned to Peking University to pursue graduate studies in philosophy. == Banishment == During the Hundred Flowers Campaign of 1957, Yu wrote four letters that advocated rationalism, democracy and freedom, and socialist rule of law. As a result, he was denounced as a \\"rightist\\" during the ensuing Anti- Rightist Campaign and sent to Beijing's countryside to perform manual labour. After his rehabilitation in 1969, he was assigned to teach middle school in Zaoyang, Hubei for the next eight years. During his two-decade-long banishment from academia, Yu focused on self-study of Xuanxue, the philosophy of China's Six Dynasties period (third to sixth centuries), an era of division and turmoil. In his autobiography, he reminisced that he found solace in the ancient philosophers' reflections on fate, and their pursuit of freedom of thought and self-awareness in the face of adversity. == Academic career == After the end of the Cultural Revolution, Yu returned to academia in 1978 and became a researcher at the Institute of World Religions of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. In the 1980s, he carried out comprehensive studies on Xuanxue, and published a series of papers on such concepts as youwu (being and non-being) and benmo (root and branches), as well as the ideas of philosophers Wang Bi, He Yan, Ruan Ji and Ji Kang. His Xuanxue research culminated in the book History of Wei–Jin Xuanxue (), published by Peking University Press in 2004, which was followed by a second edition in 2016. At the Institute of World Religions, Yu's research interest gradually shifted to the I Ching and the history of its studies. He wrote papers on the I Ching studies of the Zhou, Han, Wei, and Jin dynasties, before publishing Modern Interpretation of I Ching Studies of the Northern Song in 1997. Yu held the view that Chinese civilization originated from ancient Chinese religions and is \\"genetically\\" different from Western civilization from the very beginning. A major focus of Chinese culture is family and clan relations. In the 20th century, many scholars judged Chinese culture from the Western perspective and criticized this as a negative characteristic, but Yu sought to focus on its positive aspects and considered it the source of Chinese culture's vitality. In 1992, Yu was awarded a special pension for distinguished scholars by the State Council of China. He was elected an honorary academician of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. From 1993 to 2002, he was a member of the 8th and 9th Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. On 14 July 2019, Yu died at his home in Beijing, aged 89. ==Selected works== *History of the Development of Chinese Philosophy 中国哲学发展史 (co-author), People's Publishing House (1988) *New Exploration on the Xuanxue of He Yan and Wang Bi 何晏王弼玄学新探, Qilu Shushe (1991) *Modern Interpretation of I Ching Studies of the Northern Song 内圣外王的贯通—北宋易学的现代诠释, Xuelin Publishing House (1997) *I Ching Studies and Management 易学与管理 (ed.), Shenyang Publishing House (1997) *Collection of Papers on Chinese Philosophy 中国哲学论集, Liaoning University Press (1998) *History of Wei–Jin Xuanxue 魏晋玄学史, Peking University Press (2004, Second Edition 2016) *Religion, Philosophy, Ethics 宗教·哲学·伦理, Science Press (2005) *The Past and Today in I Ching Studies 易学今昔, Guangxi Normal University Press (2005) *Interpretation of I Ching Studies of the Han and Song Dynasties 汉宋易学解读, Huaxia Publishing House (2006) *A Modern Interpretation of the Zhou Yi 周易现代解读, Huaxia Publishing House (2006) :Source: == References == Category:1930 births Category:2019 deaths Category:20th-century Chinese philosophers Category:21st- century Chinese philosophers Category:Writers from Wuhan Category:Wuhan University alumni Category:Peking University alumni Category:Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Category:20th-century Chinese historians Category:21st- century Chinese historians Category:Historians of philosophy Category:Philosophers from Hubei Category:Victims of the Anti-Rightist Campaign Category:Members of the 8th Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Category:Members of the 9th Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Category:I Ching Category:Xuanxue ","title":"Yu Dunkang"},{"id":"61541213","text":"Diaranké Fofana (born 14 July 1989) is a French professional footballer who plays as a defender for FC Chambly in the French Ligue 2. ==Professional career== Fofana began his early career with the reserves of Creteil, and had a brief stint in Romania before returning to amateur league in France.

He played college football at Texas Christian University (TCU) and was drafted by the Chiefs in the third round of the 2020 NFL Draft. ==Early years== Niang grew up in New Canaan, Connecticut, where he became a football star at New Canaan High School. He was born in New York and lived in Geneva, Switzerland from the ages of 4 to 6. His family moved to New Canaan, Connecticut when they returned to the US. Niang started to play football with the Pop Warner league in New Canaan in 3rd grade. Niang also played basketball and tennis growing up. Playing both offensive and defensive line in high school, he helped lead the Rams to state championships in 3 straight seasons from 2013-2015, before committing to play college football at TCU. At New Canaan, Niang was a two time All-FCIAC selection as a Junior and Senior, and during his Senior Season was an All-State First Team Selection, from both the Coaches Association and New Haven Register. ==College career== Niang was highly recruited coming out of high school. He had around 40 scholarship offers from schools including TCU, Penn State, Auburn, Miami, and Georgia, and decided to enroll at TCU. After enrolling at TCU in 2016, Niang played in 12 of the Horned Frogs' 13 games as a true freshman that fall. He became a starter midway through his sophomore season in 2017, helping lead the Frogs to the program's first-ever berth in the Big 12 Championship Game and a win in the 2017 Alamo Bowl over Stanford. Starting all 13 games at right tackle for TCU as a junior in 2018, Niang didn't allow a sack the entire season and earned 2nd Team All-Big 12 honors before helpling lead the Frogs to a win over California in the 2018 Cheez-It Bowl. Prior to his senior season, Niang was named 1st Team Preseason All-Big 12, and The Athletic named him as one of the top offensive linemen in college football. Hall of Fame NFL executive Gil Brandt has named Niang as one of the top offensive line prospects for the 2020 NFL Draft, and ESPN draft expert Todd McShay has projected Niang as a first-round selection and best offensive tackle in the 2020 NFL Draft. Niang was forced to end his senior season early after TCU pulled out an upset win against the University of Texas in late October 2019. He had been advised by his doctor the week before to get surgery to repair a torn hip labrum he had been playing through since the beginning of the season to avoid the risk of a more severe injury. Niang played as a true freshman in 12 games out of 13. He became a starter as a sophomore and in his 28 games and three-year span as a starter for TCU, he never allowed a single sack. Over that period, he only had two holding calls and no false starts. ==Professional career== Niang was drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in the third round with the 96th overall pick of the 2020 NFL Draft. On August 6, 2020, he announced he would opt out of the 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ==References== ==External links== *Kansas City Chiefs bio *TCU Horned Frogs bio Category:1998 births Category:Living people Category:American football offensive linemen Category:French players of American football Category:Kansas City Chiefs players Category:People from New Canaan, Connecticut Category:Players of American football from Connecticut Category:Sportspeople from Fairfield County, Connecticut Category:TCU Horned Frogs football players ","title":"Lucas Niang"},{"id":"61541299","text":"California Senate Bill 27 (SB 27) (officially named as the \\"Tax Transparency Bill\\"), is a California law that requires candidates running for either President of the United States or Governor of California to publicly release their tax return of the previous five years in order to be listed on the primary ballot. The bill, authored by State Senators Mike McGuire and Scott Wiener, was signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom on July 30, 2019. The law does not place the requirement to publicly release tax returns on candidates running as write-in candidates. A similar bill was vetoed in 2017 by Governor Jerry Brown. In vetoing the bill, Brown cited the slippery-slope argument as well as his concern that the law would be struck down by the courts as unconstitutional. ==Court challenges== Within a week of the bill being signed into law, it was challenged in court. The Trump re-election campaign, the California Republican Party, and Judicial Watch all filed lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the law. The suit by Judicial Watch is on behalf of four California voters. On September 19, 2019, U.S. District Judge Morrison England issued a temporary injunction against enforcement of the law with a promise for a final ruling by the end of the month.

McDonald, 1900 John B. McDonald was an Irish-born contractor who is best known for overseeing construction of the first New York City Subway line from 1900 to 1904. McDonald was born in Cork, Ireland in 1844. He died in New York City on March 17, 1911. McDonald won the job with a $35 million bid in 1900, but he did not have the capital necessary to post the surety bonds the city required, so he turned to the banker August Belmont Jr., for financial backing. After that, McDonald effectively worked for the company that Belmont formed, The Interborough Rapid Transit Company, but McDonald was credited with being an extremely able builder. The initial segment from City Hall to Grand Central, across 42nd Street to Times Square, and up Broadway to 145th Street -- was completed on schedule in October 1904. It was a remarkable achievement given the complexity and novelty of the project and periodic labor turmoil. In 1905, McDonald was hired away by a rival transit mogul, Thomas Fortune Ryan, who proposed to build a competing subway line. Ryan agreed to pay McDonald $250,000 in two installments up front plus $50,000 a year for five years not to be involved in construction for any company other than the Metropolitan Street Railway Company, Ryan's company. By the time McDonald testified to the arrangement in 1907, Ryan and Belmont had merged their companies. Before the subway, McDonald had made a name for himself on other rail projects, including a challenging project in the early 1890s tunneling underneath downtown Baltimore to bring the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad to the Baltimore Harbor. The so-called Howard Street Tunnel is still in use by freight trains. ==References== Category:1844 births Category:1911 deaths Category:Date of birth missing Category:People from Cork (city) Category:Irish emigrants to the United States (before 1923) Category:American construction businesspeople Category:History of the New York City Subway ","title":"John B.

It is located 50 kilometers from the city of Yazd. ==Background== Yazd was a major city and Zoroastrian religious center in Sassanid times and the castle was used as a safebox in the case of invasion, in which the residents could store valuables such as gold and jewels as well as other items such as food or grain. In the ancient world, invasion or raiding parties would look for valuable loot, while also pillaging for food for sustenance - therefore it was of importance to keep such commodities out of enemy reach. ==Construction== The fortress was constructed during the Sassanid era, sometime between the 3rd and 7th centuries AD and is made of adobe. Its defences are two concentric walls, the outer wall being six meters in height and the inner being nine meters tall. In addition to the walls a moat was also constructed. The structure contains 480 rooms. ==Modern Condition== The structure is in varying states of ruin. In modern times the castle has become a tourist attraction and is located near two caravansaries. Saryazd Castle was registered in national index by the Iranian Cultural Heritage Organization with number 1084 in 1975. ==Gallery== File:Saryaz castle.jpgThe interior of the fortress File:Wiki Loves Monuments 2018 IranYazd - Mehriz - Picture 01.jpgThe front gate File:Wiki Loves Monuments 2018 IranYazd - Mehriz - Picture 02.jpgThe moat File:Wiki Loves Monuments 2018 IranYazd - Mehriz - Picture 03.jpgThe tower ==References== Category:Castles in Iran Category:National Works of Iran Category:Sasanian castles ","title":"Sar Yazd Fortress"},{"id":"61541466","text":"Newtonia buchananii is a species of legume in the family Fabaceae. ==Description== N. buchananii is a tree from 10–40 meter high, forming a loose canopy with a flattish top.

The band's goal was to mimic the styles of Frank Zappa and the Beastie Boys. The band was short-lived because the band's drummer \\"got married at 18 to an extremely pro-life woman,\\" and Andre had made a song called \\"I Love Abortions\\". On December 25, 2014, Andre independently released a collaborative EP with Canadian record producer The First Seed, titled BLARF. On June 6, 2019, it was revealed that a new artist was signed to Stones Throw Records named Blarf and that his debut studio album Cease & Desist would be released on June 26. Blarf was soon rumored to be an alias of Andre, however Blarf denies it. Andre as himself even insists they are not the same person, writing on Twitter \\"People are confusing this guy BLARF on @stonesthrow for me!\\". For Blarf's very rare public appearances, he is usually seen wearing a Ronald McDonald costume. The lead single to the album, \\"Badass Bullshit Benjamin Buttons Butthole Assassin\\", was released on June 18 with an accompanying music video.

This military division controlled military operations between April 19, 1865 and June 27, 1865 in parts of Virginia and North Carolina under control of two main Union armies, the Army of the Potomac and the Army of the James.This article contains in part text from or based on the articles on Confederate States Army and Union Army. Due to the surrender of the main Confederate armies in these areas of Virginia and North Carolina on April 9, 1865 and April 18, 1865 and the collapse of Confederate civilian authority, the Military Division of the James and its constituent military departments and military districts were responsible for maintaining order and keeping the peace in the areas of States under its control until civilian government in those States as members of the Union could be restored.Historian Joseph Wheelan noted that the Army of the Potomac had to defend civilians from \\"lawless bands of former Confederate soldiers....\\" Wheelan, Joseph.

Long, E. B. The Civil War Day by Day: An Almanac, 1861-1865\\\\. Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1971. . pp. 680-681. == Background == The Confederate States Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America (Confederacy) during the American Civil War (1861–1865) which fought in support of the effort of eleven Southern States to secede from the Union and establish the Confederate States of America as a separate nation. The Confederate States Army fought the United States Army forces organized as the Union Army, which fought to preserve the Union of all the States.For more detail on causes and purposes of the war and the contending armies, see the article on Origins of the American Civil War. The Union Army comprised the small Regular Army (United States) and the much larger temporary force of volunteers. About two percent of the soldiers of the volunteer force actually were conscripts. Another six percent of the soldiers were substitutes paid for by draftees. The Union Army and Confederate States Army were divided into several independent armies and departments operating in various geographic areas throughout the Confederacy and the \\"Border States\\".The armies also engaged in combat in Pennsylvania, New Mexico, Arizona, Indian Territory (Oklahoma), Kansas and West Virginia (after its establishment in 1863; earlier in the war the armies fought in that part of western Virginia from which West Virginia was formed as a Union State) and fought during Confederate raids into Indiana, Ohio and Vermont, the St. Albans Raid (a bank robbery perpetrated by 21 Confederate soldiers operating out of Canada on October 19, 1864; one civilian was killed and two were wounded; one raider was wounded). The main Confederate army in Virginia as the war in that State ended, the Army of Northern Virginia under the command of General Robert E. Lee, surrendered to Union Army commander Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant, who had headquarters with Major General George G. Meade's Army of the Potomac, on April 9, 1865 (officially April 12, 1865). The main Confederate army in North Carolina as the war in that State ended, the remnants of the Army of Tennessee and various other units under the command of General Joseph E. Johnston, surrendered to the Union Army of the Tennessee under the command of Major General William T. Sherman on April 18, 1865 (officially April 26, 1865). Other Confederate military land forces still in the field in other parts of the Confederacy surrendered to Union Army forces, or simply disbanded, between April 16, 1865 and June 28, 1865.Confederate forces at Mobile, Alabama, and Columbus, Georgia, also had already surrendered on April 14, 1865, and April 16, 1865, respectively. In areas more distant from the main theaters of operations, Confederate forces in Alabama and Mississippi under Lieutenant General Richard Taylor, in Arkansas under Brigadier General M. Jeff Thompson, in Louisiana and Texas under General E. Kirby Smith and in Indian Territory under Brigadier General Stand Watie surrendered on May 4, 1865, May 12, 1865, May 26, 1865 (officially June 2, 1865), and June 28, 1865, respectively. A few smaller Confederate military units, such as Mosby's Raiders in Virginia on April 21, 1865, simply disbanded. == Organization == The Military Division of the James was organized under the command of Major General Henry W. Halleck on April 19, 1865, after the surrender of the main Confederate armies in Virginia and North Carolina.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 829. This military division included the Department of the Potomac (see Army of the Potomac), under the command of Major General John M. Schofield (since January 31, 1865),Eicher, 2001, p. 837 Department of Virginia under the command of Major General George G. Meade (since January 11, 1865),Eicher, 2001, p. 843 and that part of the Department of North Carolina (1865) not under the occupation of the troops under the command of Major General William T. Sherman. The part of the Department of North Carolina included in the Military Division of the James was under the command of Major General John M. Schofield (since January 31, 1865 until June 20, 1865) and then under the command of Major General Jacob Dolson Cox (until June 28, 1865). In addition to maintaining order in the territory of the military division, Union troops were deployed to assist the impoverished population of the area.McClure, 2012, p. 135. In a law approved March 3, 1865, Congress established the Freedmen's Bureau (Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands), in the United States Department of War for \\"the supervision and management of all abandoned lands, and the control of all subjects relating to refugees and freedmen from rebel states, or from any district of country within the territory embraced in the operations of the army, under such rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the head of the bureau and approved by the President.\\" The law also provided that \\"the Secretary of War may direct such issues of provisions, clothing, and fuel, as he may deem needful for the immediate and temporary shelter and supply of destitute and suffering refugees and freedmen and their wives and children, under such rules and regulations as he may direct.\\" The law further provided that \\"the commissioner, under the direction of the President, shall have authority to set apart, for the use of loyal refugees and freedmen, such tracts of land within the insurrectionary states as shall have been abandoned, or to which the United States shall have acquired title by confiscation or sale, or otherwise.... The law provided for no additional staff other than a commissioner, 10 possible clerks and 10 possible assistant commissioners for States, and no additional funding from the federal government specifically for the bureau (other than for the commissioner's salary). In the absence of additional separate personnel or funding, the U.S. Army operating in the military divisions and their constituent departments and districts had to provide personnel for the bureau, including those needed for operations of the bureau in Virginia and North Carolina, in 1865.McClure, 2012, p.139. == Discontinuance; Inclusion in Military Division of the Atlantic == The Military Division of the James was discontinued on June 27, 1865, the day before the official surrender date of the final large Confederate army in the Trans- Mississippi Department.Wert, Jeffry D. \\"Union Military Division of the James\\" in Historical Times Illustrated History of the Civil War, edited by Patricia L.

He currently holds the rank of admiral, and is commander in chief of the Baltic Fleet. Born in Sevastopol, Nosatov's initial service was with the Soviet Navy's Pacific Fleet during the last years of the Soviet Union. He remained in the navy after its formation as a Russian military force, rising through the ranks and serving in a number of posts in the Pacific Fleet. Following studies at the Naval Academy, he took command of his own ship in 2000. Various staff appointments followed, before Nosatov transferred to the Black Sea Fleet as its deputy commander, and then chief of staff, in the early 2010s. He briefly became head of the Naval Academy in 2016, shortly before a purge of the Baltic Fleet's higher echelons that year. Having served for only just over a month as head of the academy, Nosatov was appointed acting commander of the Baltic Fleet, and subsequently confirmed in the post later that year. He was promoted to admiral in 2018, and has received several awards and decorations over his career. ==Career== Nosatov was born on 27 March 1963 in Sevastopol, then part of the Ukrainian SSR, in the Soviet Union. He studied at the , graduating in 1985. His early officer service was spent with the Pacific Fleet, as a lieutenant engineer in the laboratory of the coastal base maintenance workshop. Between 1986 and 1989 he commanded an anti-aircraft missile battery aboard the Sovremenny-class destroyer . Nosatov then went on to serve as commander of missile and artillery combat aboard the destroyer and from 1991 was assistant to the flagship missile specialist of the 35th missile ship division. From 1993 Nosatov was commander of the Bezboyaznennys missile weapons. In 1994 he became the flagship specialist in missile weapons for the 36th division of missile ships, and from 1997 to 1998 was the senior officer to the commander of the Slava-class cruiser Varyag. Nosatov studied at the N. G. Kuznetsov Naval Academy, graduating in 2000, and then took over his own command, that of the Pacific Fleet destroyer . From 2002 to 2007 Nosatov was chief of staff and commander of the 36th division of surface ships. In 2006 he was promoted to rear-admiral by presidential decree. Nosatov undertook further studies, this time at the Military Academy of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia, which he left in 2009. In 2009 he was appointed commander of the naval base at Baltiysk, and on 27 January 2012 he was appointed deputy commander of the Black Sea Fleet. He held this post until 2013, when he became the fleet's chief of staff. On 5 May 2014 he was promoted to vice admiral, by decree of the Russian president. He was one of the individuals targeted by sanctions over the Ukrainian crisis. From 17 May 2016 he was briefly head of the Naval Academy.

Müller. Müller also wrote the screenplay for the film. The film starred Henki Kolstad and Inger Marie Andersen. ==Plot== It is summer and the composer Petter Gran is on vacation when he suddenly hears a scream from Miss Hermansen. The brakes on her bicycle fail, and she ends up in the water. He helps her out of the water, but the bicycle is broken and so they continue spending the summer together. They return to Oslo and soon afterwards get engaged. She is introduced to Petter's parents. His mother is not enthusiastic about her, but his father welcomes her into the family. The couple soon get married. They have difficulty finding their own place to live, and so they have to live with Petter's parents. His mother's dislike of Kari eventually becomes such a big problem that the couple is forced to move to Kari's former apartment. However, they have bought a site where they are building a house, and every Sunday they work frenetically to finish the building. Kari gets pregnant, and when the landlady learns about this she forces the couple to move. The house is not finished, so they have to rent rooms in Mrs. Rønne's house at an exorbitant price. Their house is almost finished when a building inspector pays a visit. He says they cannot move in because they do not have a building permit for the house. The couple have already canceled their lease for Mrs. Rønne's room, so they cannot stay there. Instead, they rent a dilapidated place to stay on a farm far out of town. Petter needs money and signs up for a song competition. Initially he fails to compose anything, but when he sees some swallows sitting on a telephone line it comes to him. The swallows look like notes on a staff, and suddenly he knows what the tune should be. Petter submits his contribution to the competition and at the same time he and his wife receive the building permit to complete the house. Many people visit on the day they move in, and when they turn on the radio they hear Petter's song \\"What Was Life without You?\\" which won the competition. ==Cast== * Henki Kolstad as Petter Gran * Inger Marie Andersen as Kari Hermansen * Nanna Stenersen as Babben * Lars Nordrum as Einar * Erna Schøyen as Mrs. Gran * Henny Skjønberg as Miss Tangen * Eugen Skjønberg as Mr. Gran * Sonja Mjøen as Mrs. Rønne * Edvard Drabløs as Hansen * Jack Fjeldstad as a song composer * Margit Brataas as Hansen's housekeeper * Haakon Arnold as an agent * Lauritz Falk * Ingebjørg Sem as the nurse (uncredited) ==Song== \\"Hva var vel livet uten deg?\\" (What Was Life without You?) was the film's signature song.

This model paved the way for research to split into two approaches. One approach focused on biological processes while the other focused on the application of neural networks to artificial intelligence. This work led to work on nerve networks and their link to finite automata. == Hebbian learning == In the late 1940s, D. O. Hebb created a learning hypothesis based on the mechanism of neural plasticity that became known as Hebbian learning. Hebbian learning is unsupervised learning. This evolved into models for long-term potentiation. Researchers started applying these ideas to computational models in 1948 with Turing's B-type machines. Farley and Clark (1954) first used computational machines, then called \\"calculators\\", to simulate a Hebbian network. Other neural network computational machines were created by Rochester, Holland, Habit and Duda (1956). Rosenblatt (1958) created the perceptron, an algorithm for pattern recognition. With mathematical notation, Rosenblatt described circuitry not in the basic perceptron, such as the exclusive-or circuit that could not be processed by neural networks at the time. In 1959, a biological model proposed by Nobel laureates Hubel and Wiesel was based on their discovery of two types of cells in the primary visual cortex: simple cells and complex cells. The first functional networks with many layers were published by Ivakhnenko and Lapa in 1965, as the Group Method of Data Handling. Research stagnated after machine learning research by Minsky and Papert (1969), who discovered two key issues with the computational machines that processed neural networks. The first was that basic perceptrons were incapable of processing the exclusive-or circuit. The second was that computers didn't have enough processing power to effectively handle the work required by large neural networks. Neural network research slowed until computers achieved far greater processing power. Much of artificial intelligence had focused on high-level (symbolic) models processed by with explicit algorithms, characterized for example by expert systems with knowledge embodied in if-then rules, until in the late 1980s research expanded to low-level (sub-symbolic) machine learning, characterized by knowledge embodied in the parameters of a cognitive model. == Backpropagation == A key trigger for renewed interest in neural networks and learning was Werbos's (1975) backpropagation algorithm that enabled practical training of multi- layer networks. Backpropagation distributed the error term back up through the layers, by modifying the weights at each node. In the mid-1980s, parallel distributed processing became popular under the name connectionism. Rumelhart and McClelland (1986) described the use of connectionism to simulate neural processes. Support vector machines and simpler methods such as linear classifiers gradually overtook neural networks. However, neural networks transformed domains such as the prediction of protein structures. In 1992, max-pooling was introduced to help with least shift invariance and tolerance to deformation to aid in 3D object recognition.J. Weng, N. Ahuja and T. S. Huang, \\"Cresceptron: a self-organizing neural network which grows adaptively,\\" Proc. International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, Baltimore, Maryland, vol I, pp. 576–581, June, 1992.J. Weng, N. Ahuja and T. S. Huang, \\"Learning recognition and segmentation of 3-D objects from 2-D images,\\" Proc. 4th International Conf. Computer Vision, Berlin, Germany, pp. 121–128, May, 1993.J. Weng, N. Ahuja and T. S. Huang, \\"Learning recognition and segmentation using the Cresceptron,\\" International Journal of Computer Vision, vol. 25, no. 2, pp. 105–139, Nov. 1997. In 2010, Backpropagation training through max- pooling was accelerated by GPUs and shown to perform better than other pooling variants.Dominik Scherer, Andreas C. Müller, and Sven Behnke: \\"Evaluation of Pooling Operations in Convolutional Architectures for Object Recognition,\\" In 20th International Conference Artificial Neural Networks (ICANN), pp. 92–101, 2010. . The vanishing gradient problem affects many-layered feedforward networks that used backpropagation and also recurrent neural networks (RNNs).S. Hochreiter., \\"Untersuchungen zu dynamischen neuronalen Netzen,\\" Diploma thesis. Institut f. Informatik, Technische Univ. Munich. Advisor: J. Schmidhuber, 1991. As errors propagate from layer to layer, they shrink exponentially with the number of layers, impeding the tuning of neuron weights that is based on those errors, particularly affecting deep networks. To overcome this problem, Schmidhuber adopted a multi-level hierarchy of networks (1992) pre-trained one level at a time by unsupervised learning and fine-tuned by backpropagation.J. Schmidhuber., \\"Learning complex, extended sequences using the principle of history compression,\\" Neural Computation, 4, pp. 234–242, 1992. Behnke (2003) relied only on the sign of the gradient (Rprop) on problems such as image reconstruction and face localization. Hinton et al. (2006) proposed learning a high-level representation using successive layers of binary or real-valued latent variables with a restricted Boltzmann machine to model each layer. Once sufficiently many layers have been learned, the deep architecture may be used as a generative model by reproducing the data when sampling down the model (an \\"ancestral pass\\") from the top level feature activations. In 2012, Ng and Dean created a network that learned to recognize higher-level concepts, such as cats, only from watching unlabeled images taken from YouTube videos. Earlier challenges in training deep neural networks were successfully addressed with methods such as unsupervised pre-training, while available computing power increased through the use of GPUs and distributed computing. Neural networks were deployed on a large scale, particularly in image and visual recognition problems. This became known as \\"deep learning\\". == Hardware-based designs == The development of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) very-large-scale integration (VLSI), in the form of complementary MOS (CMOS) technology, enabled the development of practical artificial neural networks in the 1980s. Computational devices were created in CMOS, for both biophysical simulation and neuromorphic computing. Nanodevices for very large scale principal components analyses and convolution may create a new class of neural computing because they are fundamentally analog rather than digital (even though the first implementations may use digital devices). Ciresan and colleagues (2010) in Schmidhuber's group showed that despite the vanishing gradient problem, GPUs make backpropagation feasible for many-layered feedforward neural networks. == Contests == Between 2009 and 2012, recurrent neural networks and deep feedforward neural networks developed in Schmidhuber's research group won eight international competitions in pattern recognition and machine learning.2012 Kurzweil AI Interview with Jürgen Schmidhuber on the eight competitions won by his Deep Learning team 2009–2012 For example, the bi-directional and multi-dimensional long short-term memory (LSTM)Graves, Alex; and Schmidhuber, Jürgen; Offline Handwriting Recognition with Multidimensional Recurrent Neural Networks, in Bengio, Yoshua; Schuurmans, Dale; Lafferty, John; Williams, Chris K.

Ciresan and colleagues won pattern recognition contests, including the IJCNN 2011 Traffic Sign Recognition Competition, the ISBI 2012 Segmentation of Neuronal Structures in Electron Microscopy Stacks challenge and others. Their neural networks were the first pattern recognizers to achieve human-competitive/superhuman performance on benchmarks such as traffic sign recognition (IJCNN 2012), or the MNIST handwritten digits problem. Researchers demonstrated (2010) that deep neural networks interfaced to a hidden Markov model with context-dependent states that define the neural network output layer can drastically reduce errors in large-vocabulary speech recognition tasks such as voice search. GPU-based implementations of this approach won many pattern recognition contests, including the IJCNN 2011 Traffic Sign Recognition Competition, the ISBI 2012 Segmentation of neuronal structures in EM stacks challenge, the ImageNet Competition and others. Deep, highly nonlinear neural architectures similar to the neocognitron and the \\"standard architecture of vision\\", inspired by simple and complex cells, were pre-trained with unsupervised methods by Hinton. A team from his lab won a 2012 contest sponsored by Merck to design software to help find molecules that might identify new drugs. == Convolutional neural networks == , the state of the art in deep learning feedforward networks alternated between convolutional layers and max-pooling layers, topped by several fully or sparsely connected layers followed by a final classification layer. Learning is usually done without unsupervised pre-training. The convolutional layer includes filters that are convolved with the input. Each filter is equivalent to a weights vector that has to be trained. Such supervised deep learning methods were the first to achieve human-competitive performance on certain practical applications. ANNs were able to guarantee shift invariance to deal with small and large natural objects in large cluttered scenes, only when invariance extended beyond shift, to all ANN- learned concepts, such as location, type (object class label), scale, lighting and others.

It began construction in 1913 and commenced operations in 1916 as a subsidiary of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), which had purchased the line before construction had finished. In 1931 it was consolidated with the Grand River Railway (GRNR) under a single CPR subsidiary, the Canadian Pacific Electric Lines (CPEL), which managed both interurban railways, though they continued to exist as legally separate entities. Passenger service was discontinued in 1955 but freight operations continued until 1961, when the LE&N; electric locomotives were replaced by diesel CPR locomotives and the line was eventually de- electrified. ==History== ===Background=== Railway construction and operation in the area preceded the LE&N; by over 50 years. The railway boom in Canada West (the administrative predecessor to the province of Ontario) from the 1850s onward resulted in a number of east–west lines owned by competing companies: the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) and Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) lines through Galt (which became a major regional rail hub), the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway through Brantford, and the New York Central Railroad and Michigan Central Railroad lines through Waterford. While these railways stimulated the local economy and created export opportunities both for farmers (mostly situated along the Grand River and its tributaries and floodplain) and small but rapidly industrializing cities like Galt and Brantford, the primary intent behind the construction of many of these rail lines was to connect larger centres like Toronto and Hamilton with the American border, or to create a shorter route for American freight to travel around Lake Erie, as opposed to the longer route through Ohio. This was the intent behind the Canada Air Line, an air-line railway which took the shortest practical route through the area. Merchants and exporters, primarily in Brantford, felt that they were poorly-served by these east–west lines, which allowed certain railways to monopolize access to different towns and cities and charge high freight fees. The east–west lines also did not connect the communities along the Grand River valley, which were naturally linked together by shared history and geography. In 1900, the first attempt at a north–south line was underway, with the construction of the Port Dover, Brantford, Berlin and Goderich Railway, an ambitious attempt to link these centres together. These ambitions were tempered by a lack of capital, however, and the company was sold off and renamed the Grand Valley Railway (GVR) in 1902, with a plan to initially connect Brantford and Galt. Galt's merchants and town boosters, meanwhile, focused mainly on constructing a link to Berlin (now known as Kitchener), an initiative which would eventually result in the Grand River Railway, which began operation in 1914. With a clear short-term goal, the Grand Valley Railway Company purchased the Brantford Street Railway in 1903, then extended it, ultimately creating a 21-mile electric interurban line linking Brantford, Paris, and Galt, which opened for traffic in November 1904. After opening, however, the GVR began to suffer from a number of chronic problems: the difficult terrain and poor quality of construction created operational problems, and the company was unable to secure enough lucrative freight contracts to maintain profitability. Service was suspended by 1912 due to poor track quality, and ultimately the line was sold to the City of Brantford in March 1914. The northern section from Paris to Galt was promptly sold in 1915 to the Lake Erie and Northern Railway, which promptly closed the line to eliminate competition; the southern section from Brantford to Paris was operated as a part of Brantford's municipal public transit system until it was shut down in 1929 and replaced by buses. This marked the end of the first attempt at a north–south link. ===Construction=== The second attempt at a north–south link took the form of the Lake Erie and Northern Railway (LE&N;), another Brantford-led initiative. More measured in its ambitions, the goal of the LE&N;'s backers was to create a reliable freight and passenger link which connected Galt, Brantford, and Port Dover, with the hope that this would give them access to freight traffic on Lake Erie and allow a possible connection to Ohio. Construction began in May 1913, with a plan oriented around construction of a traditional steam-based mainline railway. However, as construction continued, the plans were extensively modified to reflect the infrastructure requirements of an electric interurban. Constructed roughly in parallel with the existing GVR line, the LE&N; was constructed according to higher and more modern quality standards, and avoided many of the problems with tight turns and steep grades that the GVR suffered from. The result was a high track quality and significant number of grade separations along the route, made necessary by the amount of traffic on the main lines the LE&N; crossed. In Paris, it passed under the Grand Trunk Railway high-level bridge, which is still used by CN and Via Rail trains today. At Waterford, which was a junction point for the Canada Southern Railway (later Michigan Central) and Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway, the LE&N; followed a high trestle bridge over the tracks, creating a full grade separation. This allowed for the LE&N; to run the kind of high-frequency service which began to be expected of electric interurban railways in the early 20th century, without potential interruption by cross-traffic on the mainlines. In 1914, with the line still under construction, the LE&N; was purchased by the CPR, which finalized the line's status as an interurban. This followed contemporary trends, where medium- distance passenger traffic was being shifted onto electric lines and served by high-frequency short trains. In May 1915, the line was electrified with 1500 volts DC. ===Early operations=== A group of businessmen next to the special 1917 \\"Elmira to Erie train\\" operated by the Lake Erie and Northern, intended to promote the railway along with that economic corridor. Passenger service began on 7 February 1916 between Galt and Brantford, along the northern section of the line; the parallel Grand Valley Railway service was discontinued shortly after. The southern terminus was at a station north of the Great Western Railway tracks, which was only used through 1916–17. Service was extended to Simcoe on 2 June and to Port Dover on 22 July, initially terminating at Main Street in the north end of Port Dover. Almost a year later and after signing a joint operations agreement, the LE&N; shifted its terminal station to the existing Grand Trunk Railway station in Port Dover near the waterfront. This would only last until 1923, when the LE&N; built its own station in downtown Port Dover, permanently abandoning its hopes of easy connections via Lake Erie. In Brantford from 1917 onward, the LE&N; shared a unique bi-level station with the Brantford and Hamilton Electric Railway, allowing for smooth passenger transfer and cementing Brantford's position as a local intercity passenger hub which allowed for both north–south and east–west travel along electric interurban lines. Its connection to the GRNR in Galt allowed passengers to travel even further north to destinations such as Preston, Hespeler, Berlin (now Kitchener), and Waterloo. The railway's early rolling stock consisted of four passenger coaches, constructed of wood and steel, which were numbered 225, 235, 245, and 255; two control trailers numbered 265 and 275; two electric freight locomotives numbered 50 and 60; and two combination express/passenger cars numbered 209 and 219. Despite this limited stock, trains were running every two hours. ===Canadian Pacific Electric Lines=== The system reached the peak of its success in 1921, with an annual passenger ridership of 600,000. By this time it had become popular with summer excursion tourists from the industrial cities of Kitchener, Preston, Galt, and Brantford, who wanted to visit Port Dover to access Lake Erie's recreation opportunities. In an early sign of integration with the Grand River Railway, LE&N;'s rolling stock was renumbered to complement the GRNR's, with the wood-and-steel passenger cars being renumbered as 933, 935, 937 and 939, the trailer cars as 953 and 955, the freight locomotives to 335 and 333, and the combination cars to 797 and 795. Around this time, two new all-steel passenger cars, manufactured by the Preston Car Company, were sold to the LE&N; and numbered as 973 and 975. A third freight locomotive, also manufactured by the Preston Car Company, was purchased and numbered as 337. With the growing system integration between the GRNR and LE&N;, freight options were slowly merged, with the two systems operating as a single freight line serving around 450 different industries along the corridor, and GRNR and LE&N; locomotives often seen operating as a multi-unit train. The slow integration process concluded with an amalgamation in 1931 of the two lines under the name Canadian Pacific Electric Lines (CPEL), though the railways remained legally separate entities, and trains maintained their original liveries. ===Decline=== While freight traffic remained fairly steady, passenger ridership would never equal the peak in 1921. The advent of the Great Depression decreased the economic benefits and ridership created by tourism, and automobile travel allowed recreational travellers to access summer cottages and resorts along both Lake Huron and Lake Erie more easily, decreasing Port Dover's importance as a tourist hub. As well, the LE&N; system lost a major interconnection point when the Brantford and Hamilton Electric Railway was acquired in 1930 by the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario (the predecessor of Ontario Hydro and Hydro One), and closed halfway through 1931. This cut off the easy passenger connection to Hamilton, further decreasing the viability of the southern half of the line. Still, in 1938 the CPR funded a new \\"union\\" station at Galt's Main Street in contemporary art deco-style, a sign of the gradual shift of the centre of the combined lines toward Preston and Galt, rather than Brantford. In 1944, with the Second World War nearing its close, the unified CPEL system had a brief renaissance, with a total annual system ridership of 1,680,000, almost double that of any other best year. This was typical of the wartime period, when many interurban systems were heavily utilized, as war production stimulated employment and therefore commuter traffic, and electric systems were seen as a way to conserve fuel. This would prove to be fatal to many systems, as the same wartime materials rationing which stimulated traffic on electric systems also robbed them of vital service manpower and materials (especially steel), as these were diverted to war production and to the armed forces. By the end of the war, the age of interurbans were largely seen to have passed, and many Canadian and American interurban lines had already been shut down and scrapped. Large railway companies increasingly saw passenger service, which had rarely turned a significant profit, as a liability, and were unwilling to maintain and upgrade their existing fleets of decades-old rolling stock. The geopolitical realities of the postwar period resulted in decreased petroleum prices, eliminating one of the main financial advantages of interurbans over buses. The benefits of interurbans often translated into economic benefits for the towns and cities they served, as many cities during the interurban period had begun to construct suburbs whose populations commuted into downtown cores to work and shop. This often failed to translate to into profits for railway companies. As a result, many interurban lines were bought by municipalities and combined with their electric streetcar lines. Others, however, were simply shut down. After the war, the CPR undertook several investments in the LE&N; and the entire CPEL system, which would prove to be the last. In 1946, all of the 1921-purchased cars were sent to the CPR Angus Shops in Montreal for extensive upgrading, including mechanical improvements and refurbished interiors. In the same year and with many interurbans shutting down during this period, used rolling stock was highly available, so the CPR purchased three electric freight locomotives from the defunct Salt Lake and Utah Railroad, as well as extensively refurbishing the existing three locomotives at the GRNR shops in Preston. In a move which would prove to be historic, the CPR purchased for the line the final interurban rail car built in Canada: a steel combine ordered from National Steel Car in 1947. In 1950, the CPR made an application with the Canadian Transportation Commission, Canada's federal transportation regulator, to abandon passenger service along the line. Municipalities along the line objected strongly to the application, and indefinite continuation of service was ruled to be in the public good. However, the CTC left the CPEL with a loophole: that unprofitable passenger runs could be cut as long as overall service was not jeopardized. The CPEL had already cut a number of passenger runs before the ruling, and afterward cut more, ending the period of \\"streetcar type\\" service along the line. Grand River Railway trains began to terminate at the CPR's mainline station in Galt, breaking the CPEL system in half, as passengers transferring to the LE&N; would have to walk three-quarters of a mile south to the Main Street station to transfer. Confusingly, LE&N; trains also ran north past Main Street to the CPR station to deliver express packages, but no attempt was made to unify passenger services at the station. As well as changes in schedules and destinations, the CPR undertook a number of other changes to the system in an attempt to force the total switch from passenger to freight. The combine cars had their passenger capacities reduced and freight increased, with tonnage figures increasing gradually. As well, with rising automobile traffic in the urban areas the railway passed through, trains began to suffer from collisions, such as one in June 1951 with a police truck in Port Dover. In response, the CPR had the cars totally repainted to its signature maroon colour (further erasing the LE&N; image and replacing it with the CPEL brand) with black and yellow warning markings for motorists and pedestrians. By 1954, the CPR's deliberate campaign to sabotage passenger service by decreasing the frequency of trains, scheduling trains at unusual hours, and providing misleading and confusing information to passengers, along with prevailing social factors, had taken their toll, and passenger ridership was down to 160,000 for the entire CPEL system. The CPR transferred its lucrative express shipping operations to truck operations, further undercutting the profitability of passenger operations, and justifying further cuts to service. The company submitted a second application to abandon passenger services, which was accepted in March 1955. The LE&N; line, with its ample scenery and connection to Port Dover, had been popular with railway excursion groups well before the announcement of closure, and ridership increased significantly near the end of revenue service. Veteran employees, local officials, and members of the communities served by the line rode it in large groups, and even larger crowds turned out to watch. Even after the official end of revenue service on 23 April 1955, groups such as the National Railway Historical Society scheduled a number of popular excursion runs which featured multiple rail cars coupled together into single large convoys. The final passenger trip was taken on 1 May by the Buffalo chapter of the National Railway Historical Society, and further attempts to organize excursions were rebuffed by the CPR, \\"supposedly based in the fear that their appearance might provoke a clamour for reinstatement of service,\\" and it quickly began to scrap the railway's older rolling stock. Attempts by the CPR to sell off the newer steel cars to other railways were unsuccessful, and a number were purchased by railway enthusiasts and preserved in museums. The remainder of the passenger cars were scrapped in 1957, with only freight and maintenance vehicles remaining as the CPR converted the system fully to freight operations. ===Line closure=== After the end of passenger service, the CPR continued to use LE&N; and GRNR freight locomotives to serve freight customers along the line, and passenger bus service was provided by Canada Coach Lines out of Galt, with four trips a day. This service would continue until 1962, when the Galt operations ended. In the same year, the CPR abandoned the section of track from Simcoe to Port Dover, and converted the remainder of the line from electric to diesel, scrapping its power lines. Freight customers along the line were thereafter served by CPR diesel locomotives. In 1989, CP Rail applied with the Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA) for permission to abandon the remainder of the line. Objections to the application were filed by some remaining freight customers on the line, such as Mitten Vinyl and Paris Technical Ceramics, as well as the Ontario Ministry of Transportation, the mayor of Paris, and the Ontario Locomotive and Car Company (OLC), the latter of which presented a plan to operate tourist trains along the portion of the LE&N; line immediately north of Paris. Ultimately the CTA ruled in favour of abandonment, and the line was abandoned with the OLC plan unrealized. ==Heritage== ===Stations=== The former LE&N; stations in Galt, Paris, Waterford, Brantford, and a number of other destinations have been demolished, but several stations still stand. An old stone house used as a station in Glen Morris stands in its original location alongside an information kiosk on the railway. At Port Dover, both stations used by the LE&N; survive in some form: the original union station with the GTR has been moved to the beach and serves as a gift shop, while the 1923 LE&N; station serves as a municipal storage facility at the east end of Chapman Street. The Mount Pleasant station, which was moved to Mount Pleasant Road and now sits on private property, is still standing but is in poor condition. In 2019, a local railway heritage group, the Brant Railway Heritage Society, embarked on an ambitious plan to relocate the station, which was built in 1916, to the Mount Pleasant Community Park, restore the building, and open it as a railway museum. The building has been noted as being regionally unique due to its layout, as well as its status as the only surviving original LE&N; station. ===Rolling stock=== While much of the LE&N; rolling stock was scrapped after the end of service, a few pieces of its fleet remain and are stored at the Halton County Railway Museum: * LE&N; #797, one of the combination cars, originally kept at the Seashore Trolley Museum in Kennebunkport, Maine * LE&N; M-4, a self-propelled electric welding car, which is believed to be the only surviving example of an ERICO Bonder * LE&N; M-6, a 1934 Ford-built delivery truck modified to serve as a line truck, which saw service until 1962 * LE&N; #50/335, an electric freight locomotive, sold to the Cornwall Street Railway after dieselization of freight service in 1962, remained in operation until the early 1970s ===Trails=== A number of rail trails were created along the former right of way after abandonment of the line. This includes the Cambridge to Paris Rail Trail, the SC Johnson Trail between Paris and Brantford, the Norfolk Sunrise Trail through Simcoe, and part of the Waterford Heritage Trail. ==Status== As of 2019, many destinations and former rail hubs along the line, such as Waterford, Simcoe and Port Dover, have no rail connection whatsoever, and many locations along the line are no longer served by public transit in any form. There is no direct transit connection from Galt to Brantford, and trips between these locations would require passing through Kitchener, Mississauga, and Hamilton on local buses and GO Transit. Waterloo Region's Ion rapid transit system, which began service in 2019, is planned to be extended from Kitchener's Fairway station to the Ainslie St. Transit Terminal in Galt, a route which is evocative of the Grand River Railway and the interurban era, though it uses modern Bombardier Flexity Freedom light rail vehicles. Currently there are no plans for any extension of this service south of Galt. Brantford still receives intercity passenger rail service from Via Rail Corridor trains along CN's Dundas Subdivision, while Galt, once a major railway hub, has no passenger rail service whatsoever, though it still sees freight traffic on the intact CP Galt Subdivision. ==See also== * Grand River Railway * Brantford and Hamilton Electric Railway ==References== ==Further reading== * * * ==External links== *Lake Erie & Northern Railway (trainweb.org) Category:Defunct Ontario railways Category:Rail transport in Brantford Category:Rail transport in Cambridge, Ontario Category:Transport in Norfolk County, Ontario Category:Rail transport in the Regional Municipality of Waterloo Category:Interurban railways in Ontario Category:Canadian Pacific Railway subsidiaries ","title":"Lake Erie and Northern Railway"},{"id":"61542047","text":"Marvin Wilmer Colen (March 8, 1915 – May 14, 1989) was an American professional basketball player.

It went on the air in 1933 as one of the first radio stations in Arizona and ceased operations on January 1, 1982, though activity around the license continued for years after. ==History== ===KSUN=== The Copper Electric Company received the construction permit for a new radio station in Bisbee at 1200 kHz on June 30, 1933.FCC History Cards for KBZB That October, after changing its call letters from the original assignment of KIGY, KSUN hit the air. It was the first radio station in Bisbee and Cochise County, and by 1935, one of just eight in the whole state. The station went to unlimited time in 1935, and a power increase to 250 watts followed the next year. In 1941, NARBA moved KSUN and other stations at 1200 to the new dial position of 1230 kHz. In 1936, an application was filed to transfer control of the Copper Electric Company from James S. Maffeo and Lawrence R. Jackson to Carleton W. Morris, who would go on to be a pioneer in Arizona broadcasting. It was not granted immediately, but in 1941, another application was. It would be the first of several radio stations for Morris. By this time, KSUN was a CBS Radio affiliate, linked to the Arizona Network, whose key station was KOY in Phoenix. It was just one of three pre-war stations in the network, which also featured KTUC in Tucson. Originally, KSUN was nominally licensed to Lowell, Arizona. However, in 1948, the station built new facilities in Bisbee at a cost of $50,000. Morris's influence was expanding, both in and out of radio. On December 15, 1946, KAWT went on the air in Douglas, offering NBC programming; Morris built a third station, Sierra Vista's KHFH, in 1957. Morris, meanwhile, became an Arizona state representative from Bisbee, in addition to the radio stations and an electrical repair business; the 1950s also saw Morris build one of the country's first cable television systems, with 2,000 subscribers by the end of 1955, to serve a town without direct over-the-air reception of stations in Tucson or Phoenix. In 1962, Morris had bought the facilities of the shuttered Gila Broadcasting chain for $100,000 and had asked for licenses to restart the six stations whose original licenses had been revoked by the Federal Communications Commission. However, none of that came to fruition, since Morris died of a heart attack while scuba diving in Guaymas on December 3, 1962. Morris's estate owned KSUN for several more years and sold the station in late 1965 to Bisbee Broadcasters; the application was approved in January 1966. After the death of John L. Hogg and a buyout of Jack Williams, Arlo Woolery became the sole stockholder of the company. He sold out to Howard Waterhouse in 1968. The constant ownership turnover killed off an attempt by the company to build an FM radio station, KSUN-FM, which was deleted on November 25, 1968. Waterhouse, who moved from Fort Wayne, Indiana to run the station, was approved to increase KSUN's power to 1,000 watts in 1971, though implementation had to be delayed until the Federal Communications Commission authorized KSUN and three other stations to carry out power increases in the absence of a response from Mexican authorities. KSUN was sold again in 1976 to Sun Broadcasting, Inc. The president of Sun, James McCollum, held leadership positions at radio stations in Ashdown, Arkansas and Warrensburg, Missouri. ===KBZB=== Sun Broadcasting sold the station again to Sun Country Communications Corporation in 1980, a deal that would ultimately plunge the station into silence. Dogged by financial troubles, KSUN went off the air without warning on January 1, 1982, mired in a series of lawsuits over the Sun Country acquisition; later in the month, the company was placed into receivership. Desperate for money, the KSUN call letters were sold to a Phoenix radio station, which changed from KXIV to become the new KSUN in June 1982. The Bisbee station then became KBZB. The station's general manager in 1980 and part-owner, 36-year-old Tedd Coppin, died of a heart attack in December of that year. Activity continued into the 1980s on the KBZB license, though it never broadcast. In early 1984, the station applied for the call letters KESE, during which time a sale to Copper Valley Broadcasters was being negotiated but fell through. In 1988, Sun Country—still in bankruptcy—was finally able to sell the station license to the Rex Company, owned by Marvin and Tommy King, which acquired KBZB for $2,000; the purchase price, however, didn't reflect the reality of what they were buying, as Marvin King told Radio & Records that the facilities were in such disrepair that a $150,000 investment would be required in a construction permit and new equipment. The station never did return to air; it was listed as silent in 1991 and had its 1990 license renewal application dismissed in 1993 because of the station's silence. ==References== ==External links== *FCC History Cards for KSUN SUN Category:Bisbee, Arizona Category:Radio stations established in 1933 Category:Radio stations disestablished in 1982 Category:Defunct radio stations in the United States Category:1933 establishments in Arizona Category:1982 disestablishments in Arizona SUN Category:Arizona radio station stubs ","title":"KSUN (Bisbee, Arizona)"},{"id":"61542077","text":"A statue of Mickey Mantle is installed outside Oklahoma City's Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark, in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. ==See also== * Statue of Mickey Mantle (Commerce, Oklahoma) ==External links== * * Mickey Mantle Statue #2 at Roadside America * Mickey Mantle Statue #2 - Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark - Oklahoma City, OK at Waymarking Category:Baseball culture Category:Bricktown, Oklahoma City Category:Monuments and memorials in Oklahoma Category:Outdoor sculptures in Oklahoma City Category:Sculptures of men in Oklahoma Category:Statues in Oklahoma Category:Statues of sportspeople Category:Cultural depictions of baseball players Category:Cultural depictions of American men ","title":"Statue of Mickey Mantle (Oklahoma City)"},{"id":"61542080","text":"A statue of Mickey Mantle is installed Commerce, Oklahoma, United States. ==See also== * Statue of Mickey Mantle (Oklahoma City) ==References== Category:Monuments and memorials in Oklahoma Category:Outdoor sculptures in Oklahoma Category:Sculptures of men in Oklahoma Category:Statues in Oklahoma Category:Statues of sportspeople Category:Cultural depictions of baseball players Category:Cultural depictions of American men ","title":"Statue of Mickey Mantle (Commerce, Oklahoma)"},{"id":"61542081","text":"Statue of Mickey Mantle may refer to: * Statue of Mickey Mantle (Commerce, Oklahoma) * Statue of Mickey Mantle (Oklahoma City) ","title":"Statue of Mickey Mantle"},{"id":"61542091","text":"Basra Specialized Spherical School (BSSS) was opened on the recommendation of Bassam Raouf, Director of the Department of Football Specialized Schools at the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports in 2012. ==Location and Management== The Spherical School is located in the area Kut al-Hijjaj in the center of Basra, and headed by coach Hassan Mawla since its inception.

Versions for the PlayStation, Dreamcast, Game Boy Color and WonderSwan Color were also released. Controlling Susumu Hori, the titular \\"Mr. Driller\\", the player must dig their way to the bottom of the screen by destroying colored blocks that litter the playfield. Blocks will be cleared if four or more are touching each other, which can be used to cause chain reactions. Susumu has an constantly- depleting oxygen meter that can be refilled by collecting air capsules found throughout stages. It ran on the Namco System 12 arcade board. Mr. Driller was designed by Yasuhito Nagaoka and produced by Hideo Yoshizawa, best known for his work on Klonoa: Door to Phantomile and the Ninja Gaiden series. It was intended as the third entry in Namco's Dig Dug series, tentatively titled Dig Dug 3. Originally meant to be exclusive to home consoles, it was instead made an arcade game to help increase sales. The game was completed before it was ever pitched, leading to a lengthy process that ended with the game being presented to company president Masaya Nakamura. Upon release, Mr. Driller was met with mostly positive reviews from critics — reviewers praised its \\"refreshing\\" gameplay premise, colorful visuals and soundtrack, although criticized its low replay value and lack of extra content. It was met with a long series of sequels and spin-offs for multiple platforms, beginning with Mr. Driller 2 in 2000. The PlayStation version of the game was released for the PlayStation Store under the PSOne Classics series in 2014, and was also included as one of the 20 games in the PlayStation Classic mini console. ==Gameplay== Arcade version screenshot. Mr. Driller is a puzzle video game, commonly described as a mix between Dig Dug and Columns. The player controls Susumu Hori, the titular \\"Mr. Driller\\", who must destroy all of the piling-up blocks before they take over the city of Downtown. The objective is to make it to the bottom of the stage by destroying, or \\"drilling\\", colored blocks that litter the playfield. Susumu can move left and right to drill surrounding blocks, and can also jump up a block next to him by moving against it. Blocks can also be cleared if four or more touch each other, which can be used to cause chain reactions. Blocks will also fall if there is nothing underneath to support them, which can crush Susumu if he is under them. Susumu has an oxygen meter at the right-hand side of the screen, which constantly depletes as the game progresses — Susumu can replenish part of his oxygen meter by collecting air capsules found throughout the game. Susumu will lose a portion of his oxygen if he drills brown \\"X-Blocks\\", which take five hits to destroy, and will lose a life if his meter reaches 0%. A skull-and-crossbones symbol will appear over Susumu's head if his oxygen dips under 30% as a warning sign. The home console versions of the game add two new game modes, a \\"Time Attack\\" mode where Susumu must constantly collect clocks to reduce his elapsed time, and a \\"Survival Mode\\" where the player must drill as much as they can before dying. ==Development== Concept art of the player character Mr. Driller was designed by Yasuhito Nagaoka and produced by Hideo Yoshizawa, the latter being known for his work on the Ninja Gaiden series for Tecmo. Nagaoka based the concept of Mr. Driller on a Japanese children's game, where at a beach players had to stand a piece of wood in the middle of the sand and carve away the sand without knocking down the wood. The idea of a person being in the sand pile instead of the wood intrigued Nagaoka, who believed it made for an interesting game idea. He also based Mr. Driller on Dig Dug, a classic Namco arcade game from 1982. The prototype was named Dig Dug 3 and starred Dig Jr., a tall and lanky character intended as the son of Dig Dug protagonist Taizo Hori. Nagaoka was designing Dig Dug 3 as a title for home consoles, as arcades at the time were dominated by fighting games. When Nagaoka showed the prototype game to Yoshizawa, he became immediately interested and joined the project as its producer. Yoshizawa convinced Nagaoka to make Dig Dug 3 an arcade game, believing it would become lost in a crowded home console market. Several changes were made when Yoshizawa joined the project, which included a faster pace, a new player character, and the game being renamed to Mr. Driller. The characters and graphical style were designed by Namco artist Kaori Shinozaki, who had previously assisted in production of Klonoa: Door to Phantomile and LiberoGrande. Shinozaki wanted the characters and look of Mr. Driller to appeal to a wide audience. She used bright, pastel colors like pink and blue to create a bright, colorful world, and designed Susumu to be cute and marketable. The development staff for Mr. Driller designed the game before they ever pitched it to Namco executives, and planned out a location test without any idea how well the game would perform. The game's development cycle, which Yoshizawa described as \\"the opposite of the typical game development and sales pitch\\", lead to a lengthy process that ended with the game being pitched directly to Masaya Nakamura, the president and executive chairman of Namco. His approval of the game lead to him being mentioned in the end credits. Minoru Sashida, a graphic designer for games such as Techno Drive and Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere, designed the graphical interface and the overall look of the game. The soundtrack for Mr. Driller was composed by Go Shiina, a then-new hire for Namco. As the company's other composers were more interested in working on larger franchises, Shiina was assigned to be the composer for Mr. Driller as nobody else signed on. Shiina is known for his strange and unusual-sounding soundtracks, which Yoshizawa felt was a perfect fit for the game's style. He originally made the music sound like \\"pretty normal puzzle game music\\", which Yoshizawa rejected and encouraged him to do whatever he pleased for the music. When the finished product was presented to the sales department of Namco, executives estimated that 3,000 units had to be sold in order for the game to turn a profit. ==Release== Namco demonstrated Mr. Driller at the 1999 Amusement Machine Show (AMO) in Tokyo, alongside Crisis Zone and Sweet Land 4. The game attracted attention for its colorful graphics and original concept; Game Machine in particular believed that its simplicity would make it a sure-fire hit in arcades. The game was released in Japan October 1999, running on the Namco System 12 arcade system board and sold only as a conversion kit for other arcade units. Namco released the game in North America the same month, and in Europe later that year. A PlayStation conversion of the game was released on May 10, 2000, followed by a Dreamcast version on June 23, 2000 and a Game Boy Color version later that year. A version for the WonderSwan Color was released exclusively in Japan on April 5, 2001. A mobile phone port was distributed in 2005. The PlayStation port was digitally re-released onto the PlayStation Store on February 18, 2014 under the \\"PSOne Classic\\" brand, which was delisted from the North American storefront on April 4, 2019. The PlayStation version is also one of the 20 built-in games in the PlayStation Classic dedicated console. ==Reception== Mr. Driller was met with a mostly positive response from critics, being praised for its visuals, addictiveness and soundtrack. The arcade version had exceeded Namco's expectations, selling over 3,000 arcade units shortly after its release. Aggregator site GameRankings scored the PlayStation version a 75%, with the Dreamcast version having an 82% and the Game Boy Color version a 65%. Reviewing the PlayStation version, IGN stated that it is \\"quirky, different, and speedy arcade fun\\", praising its simplistic gameplay and \\"quirky\\" graphical style. IGN also praised its soundtrack, comparing it favorably to music composed by Capcom and Konami. Next Generation commended the game's layer of strategy and controls, writing: \\"Tired of Puzzle Fighter? Mr. Driller is just what you need. With its deep strategy, simple controls, and disturbingly cute exterior, we guarantee you'll be hooked!\\" GameSpot applauded the PlayStation port for its \\"refreshing\\" gameplay, colorful graphics and catchy music, while Allgame praised its pick-up-and-play gameplay and \\"clean\\" character graphics. GameSpot liked the mobile phone version's portability and addictiveness, calling it \\"a stellar mobile port of a great game\\", and praised the Game Boy Color port's faithfulness to the original. IGN highly praised the Dreamcast version for its fresh gameplay idea, addictive gameplay and cute visuals. Criticism was drawn towards the game's lack of replay value and low amount of content. IGN noted that the game was not a \\"long-term kinda game\\", saying that it was only best played in short bursts. GameSpot echoed a similar response, criticizing the PlayStation and Game Boy Color versions for lacking any sort of replay value and being a \\"short-lived\\" experience, while Allgame disliked the poor amount of content and presentation, unfavorably comparing it to Puzzle Bobble. GameSpot also criticized the PlayStation version for not having a multiplayer mode, although noted that the $20 price point made this somewhat forgivable. ==Sequels and legacy== Mr. Driller was met with a long series of sequels and spin-offs for several platforms. The first of these, aptly titled Mr. Driller 2, was released for arcades in 2000 and followed by a Game Boy Advance port a year later, adding multiplayer and new gameplay mechanics. Mr. Driller G was released for both arcades and the PlayStation in 2001 for Japan only, adding a story mode and new characters, including Dig Dug series protagonist Taizo Hori. A Game Boy Advance game, Mr. Driller A, was released in Japan in 2002, featuring support for the GameCube - Game Boy Advance link cable peripheral, which could be used for Mr. Driller: Drill Land for the GameCube, also released in 2002. Mr. Driller Drill Spirits was released as a launch title for the Nintendo DS in Japan and North America in 2004, and in Europe in 2005. Mr. Driller Aqua, an aquatic-themed spin-off, was released for Japanese mobile phones in 2006 — an Xbox 360 sequel, Mr. Driller Online, was released in 2008. Two digital-only sequels, Mr. Driller W and Mr. Driller: Drill Till You Drop, were released in 2009. Protagonist Susumu Hori would make multiple cameos in later Namco video games. He appears as a playable character in the arcade game Star Trigon, and as a supporting character in Dig Dug: Digging Strike, where he would assist the player in sinking parts of the island.

The fatal stabbing sparked riots the next day. Angry young locals chanted anti-foreigner slogans, smashed Prince Kebab's window, and threw rocks, bottles, and at least one firecracker at the restaurant. Police responded using pepper spray and arrested 28 people. ==Background== In 2017, the town of Ełk had some 61,500 residents of which six were originally from Muslim countries who were owners or employees of four kebab bars in town. An anti-immigrant demonstration took place in Ełk, followed by a protest against a refugee center in the near town of Olecko, and a racist assault against the Cleopatra Kebab immigrant workers in Ełk. On 31 December 2016, a man named Daniel Rudnicki, entered the Prince Kebab shop, took two Coke bottles, and behaving ostentatiously left without paying while his colleague launched a firecracker into the shop. Two immigrant restaurant workers, a cook, and an owner chased the thief, one of them holding a kitchen knife. In the ensuing fight, unarmed Rudnicki received lethal stubbing wounds and died soon after. The significant impact on the media popularity of the events in Ełk was a December 19, 2016 terrorist attack in Berlin, for which the Islamic State took responsibility. Polish truck driver Łukasz Urban died in the attack. In the circumstances of the global threat of Muslim terrorism, local events in Ełk, although they had nothing to do with it, became extraordinarily current and momentous for the media. ==Riots== Center of Ełk, 1 January 2017 Following the altercation, 300 people surrounded the Kebab Bar. Initial media reports stated that Rudnicki was a random victim and not a thief chased by shop workers.Rejman-Karolewska, Małgorzata. \\"ATTITUDE TO IMMIGRANTS AND ACTIONS OF AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL IN POLAND.\\" СБОРНИК (2018): page 220 Dozens of angry locals outraged by the slaying, chanted anti-foreigner slogans, smashed Prince Kebab's window and at least one firecracker, rocks, bottles and paving stones were thrown at the restaurant. The police used pepper spray and arrested 28 people. The day following the riots, activists from the far-right National Radical Camp (ONR) came to Ełk, employing the slogan \\"Ełk free from jihad\\". Smaller incidents also took place in several other municipalities. ==Analysis== According to Anna Zawadzka, the Polish media often avoided describing the event as racist or Islamophobic and stressed the Polish identity of Rudnicki, while describing the shop workers as Algerian, Tunisian, or Arab. Sociologists Michał Łyszczarz and Stefan M. Marcinkiewicz note that other fatal incidents involving foreigners, the killing of a Pole by two Canadians in Brożec near Strzelin on New Year's Eve or a drunk Ukrainian driver killing two teenagers in Jelenia Góra, did not elicit a similar response. Łyszczarz and Marcinkiewicz state that Ukrainians and Canadians were not the subject of attention as people from Muslim countries were and did undergo a long-term process of spreading prejudices in public. Łyszczarz and Marcinkiewicz compare the death of Rudnicki to a spark in a powder keg which led to an outburst of stored emotions. In social media, which rapidly mobilized supporters, Rudnicki's death was referred to as a \\"jihad\\" and some local politicians utilized the events for self-promotion. ==Aftermath== The Polish interior minister Mariusz Błaszczak responded to events saying \\"Poland is not affected by social problems such as those in Western Europe, where big enclaves of Muslim immigrants who do not integrate with the rest of society occur\\". Błaszczak further stated that the riot was an expression of \\"utterly understandable fears\\" of Islamic terrorism in Europe. Perception of Rudnicki varies among locals; While some see him as a man with a criminal record who died prior to the kebab violence, right-wing nationalists see him as the victim of \\"Arab\\" violence, part of a campaign of \\"Islamization of Europe\\".Died by the kebab knife, NRC Handelsblad, 29 December 2017, Roeland Termote & Pieter van Os In Ełk, employees of a municipal kindergarten invited the anti- racist \\"Never Again\\" Association to hold tolerance lessons.Kontrola w przedszkolu po lekcji tolerancji, Gazeta Wyborcza, Martyna Siudak, 9 March 2017 The man who stabbed Rudnicki, pleaded not guilty to the charge of murder, saying he did not want to kill anyone and that he is sorry for Rudnicki's family.The trial begins for the murder at Prince Kebab, Gazeta Wyborcza (Bialystok), 12 March 2018 According to TVN24, he was convicted of murder in 2019 and sentenced to 12 years in jail and a 70,000 Polish złoty fine.

His contributions to the scores of 400 films culminated in the canon of widescreen Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals of the late 1950s, for which his arrangements, such as the extended \\"Carousel Waltz\\" (with Gus Levene), continue to be revived in concerts and proms (e.g. John Wilson Orchestra), as well as live-to-classic pictures (Carl Davis Chaplin tour). Powell was occasionally credited as Ed or without the middle initial, but his friends invariably called him Eddie. A shrewd contemporary, the fellow composer and renaissance man Oscar Levant, wrote of him as being a noted film-music specialist on a par with the likes of Max Steiner, Franz Waxman and Hugo Friedhofer.Oscar Levant, A Smattering of Ignorance, Garden City Publishing, 1942, p.108 after Rosar 2002 editorial. Musicologist Ian Sapiro firmly places him in the ranks of the “geniuses” who were largely responsible for the recognizable studio system orchestral sound of the Golden Age.Ian Sapiro, Scoring the Score: The Role of the Orchestrator in Contemporary Film Industry, Routledge, 2016. One of film composer John Williams’ early professional engagements was playing piano on, and assisting Powell with the sweeping arrangements recorded for the roadshow 6-track magnetic soundtrack of Carousel.John Mangum, Heaven Effect and Waltz from “Carousel” (Richard Rodgers annotation) https://www.laphil.com/musicdb/pieces/1926/heaven-effect-and-waltz-from- carousel ==Broadway years== As a self-taught high school dance band arranger, he first came to the attention of jazzman Fletcher Henderson. Starting professionally in the early thirties as part of the stable of Harms-Chappell orchestrators on Broadway, Powell quickly came into contact with lifelong colleagues, most of whom were eventually lured to Hollywood.Stephen Suskin, The Sound of Broadway Music: A Book of Orchestrators and Orchestrations, 2011, p.24. He garnered strong credits in popular reviews and musicals staged by Earl Carroll, and separately B.G. DeSylva and Henderson and Brown, as well as a Ballet Russe choreographed by Leonide Massine.Edward Powell entry IBDB.com Like George Gershwin, Conrad Salinger and Herbert W. Spencer, Powell was an avid student of the influential composer-theorist Joseph Schillinger. In 1933 Powell orchestrated the Gershwin brothers’ Broadway show Let 'Em Eat Cake, using the Schillinger contrapuntal system, and was invited by the composer to handle the same chores for the premiere of Porgy and Bess; however, had to decline when he moved out to Hollywood a year later.Letter to the Editor, The Musical Quarterly, Oxford Academic https://academic.oup.com/mq/article- abstract/80/1/182/1306164 ==Hollywood career== Joining as an uncredited orchestrator at United Artists where Newman already was house composer, an early project was Eddie Cantor’s Kid Millions, where he shared song arranging duties with the young Roger Edens (in his days before joining MGM’s Freed unit). He also ventured out with other composers and musical directors including Max Steiner (The Garden of Allah, 1936), got to work with Fred Astaire in Irving Berlin’s Top Hat and received his first screen credit for Eleanor Powell’s (no relation) Broadway Melody of 1936. More highbrow, he was sole orchestrator for the experimental ballet film Spring Night choreographed and danced by David Lichine as Pan and conducted by Constantin Bakaleinikoff. In 1936 he recommended ex-Chappell colleague David Raksin join Newman’s unit and together they shared duties as the arrangers of Charlie Chaplin’s beloved music in his first fully soundtracked (if not very talkie) film Modern Times.David Raksin & C.M. Berg, Music Composed by Charles Chaplin: Auteur or Collaborateur? Journal of the University Film Association, 1979. After the Gershwins tried their luck in motion pictures, Powell became a good friend of the composer and was often a guest at their home. While working on The Goldwyn Follies of 1938, he got to introduce settings for the last songs composed by Gershwin - “Love is Here to Stay” and “Love Walked In” - plus George Balanchine’s groundbreaking Technicolor ballets featuring Vera Zorina.Edward Jablonski, Gershwin: a biography, Doubleday, NY, 1987, p.315 At the close of the decade, he also collaborated with Robert Russell Bennett and Conrad Salinger as the powerhouse trio of (unbilled) orchestrators for Newman’s original music to George Stevens' Gunga Din. Throughout the 1940s Powell lobbied on behalf of fellow orchestrators for royalties and advised on ways to modernize copyright law, serving a short stint as President of American Society of Music Arrangers from 1946 to 47.Edward Powell entry, Discogs bio, Discography & Songs https://www.discogs.com/artist/2188370-Edward-Powell ==Musical arrangement technique== Powell was also a leading member of a close group of Hollywood orchestrators whom Levant identified as “the boys”—principally Friedhofer, Salinger, Spencer and Raksin—that met in each other's homes or lot bungalows to listen to latest overseas symphonic records, break down instrumentations chosen and analyze the effects various combinations produced on the texture and transformation of a theme, phrase or leitmotif (the works of Hindemith, Ravel and Sibelius being particular favorites).Levant p.122 after Rosar editorial p.3 n.19. Powell continued his musical analyses as a student of Arnold Schoenberg, who lived across the road from Gershwin when they both resided in West Los Angeles. Powell even kept a standing order with an L.A. record importer to supply him with “everything interesting” from which they could pick up the latest trends in contemporary music.Powell unpublished interview with Rosar, 29 January 1977, cited in Rosar p.4, n.19. One of many highly regarded close collaborations with Newman was for the Oscar-winning score heard in The Song of Bernadette (1943), particularly the vision scenes and sacred music. Based on interviews and analysis, Roland Jackson believes Powell's special credit for orchestral arrangements was due to his contributions going ‘beyond orchestration and involving reworking of the key themes, adding counterpoints or variants, and occasionally bringing in new material of his own.’Roland Jackson, The Vision Scenes in Bernadette: Newman’s and Powell’s Contributions, Journal of Film Music 3.2 (2011) p.111. David Newman told Maurizio Caschetto that Powell helped his father, initially a conductor, learn how to confidently write music.Maurizio Caschetto, audio file interview with David Newman, April–May 2019, Legacy Conversations, available: www.thelegacyofjohnwilliams.com ==Major R&H; film musicals== After the studio won filming rights to the Rodgers and Hammerstein oeuvre which was coming out of embargo after first staged productions, it fell to Newman, Powell and their growing team of orchestrators to expand the musical palette from its origins for smaller pit-bands. Although Powell was known for his full-blooded and colorful use of prominent brass and drums (Overture to The King and I; “Bali Ha'i”; Flower Drum Song’s “Dream Ballet”)Roger L. Hall, In Love and War, Film Music Review, 2007, available https://hugofriedhofer.dudaone.com/in-love-and-war he could also arrange charts for more intimate songs such as “If I Loved You” or “Younger Than Springtime”.Mark Valencia, Review of Rodgers & Hammerstein at the Movies – The John Wilson Orchestra with Joyce DiDonato, Maria Ewing and Julian Ovenden [EMI], 2013, available https://classicalsource.com/db_control/db_cd_review.php?id=10694 Powell described their approach to Fred Steiner in 1975: > “[I]n a very intimate scene, Al[fred Newman] would really write to the > dialogue very carefully so the music breathed with it. [T]here was no > movement in the orchestra under certain words – like you were accompanying > at the piano in a small nightclub or something. He would try to play…that > the background of the music was also part of the set…the costumes…and the > whole atmosphere of the scene. [I]t became a part of the whole aural and > visual scene.”Powell interview by Fred Steiner, transcript, pp.5-6 quoted in > William H. Rosar, Editorial Essay, Journal of Film Music, Vol.2, Nos.2-4, > Winter 2009, p.115. ==Final credits== Later in his career he worked more frequently with other composers and music supervisors, including Alex North or Lionel and Emil, Newman's equally talented brothers. In some of Powell's more bizarre assignments, he received screen credit along with Lyn Murray and Arthur Morton for Snow White and the Three Stooges. And he and screenwriter Clifford Odets memorably lent their considerable talents to the Elvis Presley vehicle Wild in the Country. Eddie's final recorded orchestration credit was in 1968 for the Dominic Frontiere score to the Clint Eastwood’s Malpaso Productions’ first film Hang 'Em High. ==External links== Edward B.

He devoted his life to the cause of Sino-Indian cultural friendship. ==Early life== Tan Yun- Shan was born in Chaling County, Hunan province, China on 10 October 1898. He was the youngest child of a Confucian scholar and teacher. He had his early education at home. He lost both his parents early in life. He first went to the county level school and then to the district school. He studied the Confucian classics, ancient and modern Chinese philosophy and literature, the Four Dynastic Histories and select ancient and modern books of poetry and novels. He graduated from Hunan Teachers College at Changsha and then went for post-graduate and advanced studies in both Chinese and western systems. He also had an introduction to Buddhist studies. During this period, he started writing and publishing in newspapers and magazines. He participated in some of the political activities of Mao Zedong. China was then in deep political turmoil, and as Tan was not a politically oriented person, he decided to leave China and go to Malaya. He taught in various institutions in Singapore, pioneered Chinese literature and wrote in local newspapers. He spent some months in Johore. In 1927, he met Rabindranath Tagore in Singapore, who invited him to join the teaching staff at Santiniketan. ==Santiniketan== ===Setting up Cheena Bhavana=== Cheena Bhavana Tan arrived at Santiniketan in 1928 and joined Visva Bharati as Professor of Chinese Studies. He started Chinese classes with just five students. He himself started learning Sanskrit. He also held discussions with the intellectual fraternity at Santiniketan. He soon realised that his work required a separate hall/ building but Visva Bharati, then a private institution, was short of funds. Tan decided to move around to collect money for the purpose and he took on odd jobs to support himself. He went to Singapore and Rangoon. He accompanied the special envoy of China in his mission to Tibet. The envoy died on the way and so Tan carried his papers and handed them over to the 13th Dalai Lama in Lhasa. He was given a message for Mahatma Gandhi, which he delivered at Sabarmati Ashram, Ahmedabad. He visited the Buddhist pilgrimage centres and after a short stay at Santiniketan, went to China. Back to China in 1931, he was successful in garnering support for his ideas. The China chapter of the Sino-Indian Cultural Society was established at Nanjing, the capital, and returned to India to establish the India chapter of the society. He went back to China and returned to Santiniketan in 1936 with adequate funds (Rs. 50,000) for his cherished China Hall and 100,000 books (collected with the support of the Sino-Indian Cultural Society). Tagore was thrilled and allotted land in the heart of Santiniketan for construction of Cheena Bhavana. The hall was designed in collaboration with Surendranath Kar and Tan supervised its construction. The building was completed in record time. Nandalal Bose, Benode Behari Mukherjee and others from Kala Bhavana adorned the hall with frescoes and reliefs. Tan planted trees all around the building. On 14 April 1937, Cheena Bhavana, the first institute of its kind in India, was formally inaugurated by Indira Gandhi. Tan was appointed its first director. However, in view of Visva Bharati's grim financial situation Tan refused to take a salary, but the Chinese government provided him an honorarium. Mahatma Gandhi, in his message to Tagore said: “May the Chinese Hall be a symbol of living contact between China and India”. Jugal Kishore Birla donated Rs. 5,000 to start research activities. Fund collection continued. ===Dedicated life=== With the onset of the Second Sino-Japanese War Tan focussed on the suffering of the Chinese people. Xu Beihong, a leading artist, came to Santiniketan and spent an year as visiting professor of Chinese fine arts. In 1939, at the initiative of Tan, the Sino-Indian Cultural Society organised Jawaharlal Nehru’s visit to China. Tan kept on organising visits of various delegations, important personalities, scholars and students from China to visit Santiniketan, particularly Cheena Bhavana. The Chinese government also responded to Tan's request for a donation. In 1944, Tan collected more donations to add a storey to the Cheena Bhavana. Financial support from the Chinese government continued in various forms. In 1950, the Sino-Indian Cultural Society of China sent a special donation of Rs. 500,000 to Visva Bharati for the construction of a new central library. In 1942, Chiang Kai-shek and Madame Chiang, visited Cheena Bhavana. They were pleased with the progress of the institution that had already received financial support from China and announced a further donation of Rs. 50,000. With Visva Bharati becoming a central university in 1951, there was overall development but the ideals of Tagore were not getting due attention. Teaching of Chinese language continued but research in Buddhist texts were neglected, which disturbed Tan. The Chinese government had stopped Tan's honorarium and Tan was persuaded to accept a salary. On the brighter side Cheena Bhavana continued to attract many new scholars. Dr. Luther Carrington Goodrich from Columbia University came as visiting professor of Sinology in 1953–54. In 1956, Zhou Enlai, the Chinese premier, invited Tan to visit China. Mao Zedong received his friend in the presence of other Chinese leaders. In 1957, during a trip to India, Zhou visited Santiniketan. He came to Cheena Bhavana and donated Rs. 60,000 for a memorial to Tagore. In 1962, when Nehru mentioned the Sino-Indian War in his convocation address at Santiniketan, Tan wept openly. Tan continued his teaching and research work till he retired in 1971. ==Bodh Gaya== Tan started working on his new project for the establishment of the World Buddhist Academy at Bodh Gaya. In spite of his advanced age he was once again on the road, collecting money in Hong Kong and Singapore. Funds poured in and the project burgeoned – it was larger than Cheena Bhavana. In 1983, Tan Yun-Shan breathed his last at the age of 85. In her condolence message, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi said, “Gurudeva and my father had affection and regards for him. He identified himself with Santiniketan and contributed immensely to a better understanding between the civilizations of India and China”. ==Awards== Visva Bharati conferred its highest award, Desikottama, on him in 1979. The Visva Bharati website writes, “With his remarkably civilised disposition this modest, meticulous and dedicated scholar was universally respected for the tireless and silent contribution in giving shape to Rabindranath's ideal of Visva-Bharati. Tan Yun-Shan will be remembered by the world for his pioneering efforts in re- building the ancient cultural relationship between the civilisations of China and India in modem times.” ==Family== Tan met Chen’ Nai-Wei at Johore, where she was principal of a school and they were married in 1926.

He remained in China till he, with his family, came to Santiniketan in 1976. He taught Chinese at Cheena Bhavana from 1979 to 1987, before emigrating to the USA. *Tan Lee, their third son, was born at Shanghai, China, on 30 November 1934. *Tan Wen, their eldest daughter, was born at Changsha, on 4 July 1936.

At least 92 people were killed in the attack and over 140 injured. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant claimed responsibility for the bombing, stating that the attack targeted the Shi'ites. More than 1,000 people were gathered for the wedding when the attack took place. The attack occurred a day before the 100th Afghan Independence Day, causing the government to postpone the planned celebrations taking place at the Darul Aman Palace. It was the deadliest attack in Kabul since January 2018. == Attack == The suicide bombing occurred at approximately 10:40 p.m. Afghanistan Time (UTC+04:30) in western Kabul, in an area heavily populated by the Shia Hazara minority, inside the \\"Dubai City\\" wedding hall. The suicide bomber detonated the explosives in the men's section of the wedding hall, near the stage where musicians were playing, at a time when hundreds were inside the building for a wedding ceremony. The bomber detonated a suicide vest packed with ball bearings. The explosion occurred shortly before the wedding ceremony was supposed to start. According to the wedding hall's owner, more than 1,200 people had been invited to the event, with a mixed group of Shi'ites and Sunnis attending. Most of the attendees were ethnic Hazaras. Both the bride and the groom were Shi'ite, and both from modest working class families, with the groom working as a tailor. Their families had discussed how to schedule the timing of the wedding to try to minimize the risk of an attack. At least 63 people were initially killed and 182 injured. While the bride and groom survived, both lost several family members. Many children were also among those killed. 17 more people succumbed to their injuries in the days after the attack, bringing the death toll to 80. The final death toll was put at 92. == Responsibility == The day after the attack, a local affiliate of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS, the Islamic State, or Daesh) claimed responsibility for the attack. The statement of responsibility claimed that after the suicide bombing inside the wedding hall, a car bomb was also detonated outside as emergency vehicles were arriving. The follow-up car bombing has not been confirmed by the authorities.

It is a domed triconch design, with the pastophoria on both sides of the sanctuary. The interior contains now heavily damaged murals, including one of the earliest Georgian depictions of the Mandylion. The church is inscribed on the list of Georgia's Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance. == Layout == The church of the Holy Cross (Jvarpatiosani) is located in the Mtskheta Municipality, about 3 km east of the village of Ksovrisi, on the territory of the now-extinct settlement of Telovani. The building, measuring 9.7 × 10.5 m, is set in a triconch plan, with the transverse arms much narrower and lower than the sanctuary and the western arm. This makes the edifice somewhat elongated on the east-west axis. The church is built mostly of cobblestone; dressed limestone and travertine blocks are used in important structural elements and decoration. The building can be accessed through three doorways, all in the rectangular western arm. The projecting apse of the sanctuary is flanked by two apsed pastophoria. The transition from the rectangular bay to the dome circle is effected through squinches. The drum of the dome is octagonal, pierced with four windows and adorned with decorative arches. Both outer and inner walls were plastered. The church was substantially repaired and a belfry was annexed to the west wall in the 18th century. Systematic restoration took place between 1952 and 1954 and again in 2007. The interior of the church bears fragments of the 9th–10th- century frescoes. They are heavily damaged, including an image of the Mandylion, labelled as \\"the Holy Face of God\\" and surrounded by the Apostles, above the apse window. The image may have been influenced by the Abgar Legend and have influenced Georgian depictions of the Mandylion in the following centuries. == References == Category:Buildings and structures in Mtskheta- Mtianeti Category:Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance of Georgia Category:Georgian Orthodox churches in Georgia (country) Category:8th- century churches Category:9th-century churches ","title":"Telovani church of the Holy Cross"},{"id":"61542759","text":"Michael Kok (born 19 September 1991) is a Dutch retired basketball player.

It has a short, blunt snout with a small mouth in which the jaws are nearly equal in length and are equipped with conspicuous teeth but there are no palatine teeth present. It has a low dorsal fin which has 10-12 soft rays while the anal fin has 11 to 13 soft rays and originates just before, or below the first or second dorsal fin rays. The pectoral fins are 1.3 to 1.4 the standard length and contain 17 to 19 soft rays, of which the first 2 rays are unbranched. The pelvic fins are 2.8 to 3.4 of the standard length and are situated closer to the rear margin of gill cover than they are to base of the tail. Their bodies are body dark, iridescent blue dorsally and pale, silvery ventrally. The dorsal and caudal fins are greyish, the anal fin is transparent, the pectoral fins are black with a thin, pale outer margin; pelvic fins normally have a black spot. The barbless juveniles are less than standard length and are marked with a few dark vertical bands on the body while the dorsal, pectoral, and pelvic fins are mottled with dark spots and bands. ==Distribution== Hirundichthys rondeletii is widely distributed in the tropical and subtropical waters of all of the worlds oceans. In the eastern Atlantic it is a rare vagrant north to Spain and the English Channel but its main range extends from Portugal as far south as Namibia and some times South Africa. It is also found in the western Mediterranean where it migrates south east in the winter. In the western Atlantic it is found as far north as Massachusetts and Bermuda south to the coast southern Brazil, although it has been recorded from Canada. In the eastern Pacific the distribution of this species extends from California south to Chile. Exocet (Exocaelus rondeletii), Poisson volant ==Habitat and biology== Hirundichthys rondeletii is a pelagic, oceanodromous species which inhabits the surface waters. It is able to leap out of the water and glide for considerable distances over the surface. Its diet consist of zooplankton. The eggs have a bunch of filaments at one pole with a single filament at the opposite pole. This species is considered to be on no importance in fisheries. ==Taxonomy and naming== Hirundichthys rondeletii is the type species of the genus Hirundichthys, although there is some uncertainty about the exact identity of Exocoetus rubescens, the species Charles Marcus Breder Jr. designated as the type species of the genus in 1928. This species was originally described as Exocoetus rondeletii in 1847 by the French ichthyologist Achille Valenciennes in the book he cowrote with George Cuvier entitled Histoire naturelle des poissons, the type locality was given as Naples. The specific name honours the French physician and naturalist Guillaume Rondelet (1507-1566) who appears to have illustrated this species in his work Libri de piscibus marinis published in 1554-55. ==References== rondeletiid Category:Fish described in 1847 ","title":"Hirundichthys rondeletii"},{"id":"61542788","text":"Gustavo Hungria Neves (born May 26 1991), better known by the stage name Hungria Hip Hop, is a Brazilian rapper, singer, songwriter and music producer.

It was designed in the Ruskinian Gothic style by the British architect William Henry Lynn, after whom it is now named. It was completed in 1868. A part of Queen's University Belfast, it was originally built as the institution's library, but today houses the graduate school. ==History== Queen's College, Belfast was chartered in 1845 as one of three constituent colleges of the Queen's University of Ireland. Initially having just 23 professors and 195 students, the college could be housed entirely within the main Lanyon Building. Initially the examinations hall (now known as the Great Hall) inside the Lanyon Building served additionally as the library. However expansion of the institution meant that by the 1860s a discrete building was needed to house the college's growing library. The architect William Henry Lynn was duly commissioned to design the structure. The college was awarded a government grant of £4,600 (approximately £511,000 in 2018 equivalent sterling) to construct the library, which was completed in 1868. The continued growth of Queen's University of Belfast (as it had become in 1908 as a result of the Irish Universities Act) saw the need to expand the library further. Anonymously entering the competition to design the expansion, WH Lynn won the tender to augment his initial building. With construction undertaken between 1912 and 1914 it was one of his last projects (Lynn died in 1915). Alterations were carried out in the 1950s, at which time the poet Philip Larkin – who worked as a sub-librarian for the university between 1950-1955 – described the building as a ’perfect little paradise of a library’. Further alterations were made in the 1980s. The Lynn Building was closed in 2009, following the opening of the McClay Library. It was restored in 2015, at which point it was also adapted for use as the graduate school. ==Architecture== Rose windows within polychromatic brickwork on side-gables, interspersed between aquiline gargoyles above buttresses Unlike the university's Tudor Revival Lanyon Building, the Lynn Building is in the High Victorian Gothic style which was prominent during the mid-nineteenth century. It features numerous examples of the form of Neo-Gothic championed by the critic John Ruskin, including polychrome (the roof tiling and brickwork), varying materials (window tracery, bases and columns of different stone types set into polychromatic brickwork), and detailing (gargoyles). Anatomically, the structure is noted for its large number of rose windows, engaged buttresses (both setback and diagonal), and side-gables. ==See also== Architecture of Belfast Buildings and structures in Belfast ==References== Category:Gothic Revival architecture Category:Buildings and structures in Belfast Category:Northern Ireland Category:Architecture in the United Kingdom by city ","title":"Lynn Building"},{"id":"61543222","text":"William Edward Thomas Bolitho (2 July 1862 – 21 February 1919) was an English first-class cricketer, banker and British Army officer. The son of William Bolitho and his wife, Mary Hichens Yonge, he was born at Madron near Penzance in July 1862. He was educated at Harrow School, before going up to Trinity College, Oxford. While studying at Oxford, he made his debut in first-class cricket for Oxford University against Lancashire at Oxford in 1883. He played first-class cricket for Oxford until 1885, making a total of eight appearances. In addition to playing for Oxford, he also appeared for the Gentlemen of England in 1885 against Oxford, during which he made his highest first-class score of 45 not out. For Oxford, he scored 242 runs at an average of 18.61 and a high score of 32. Bolitho later toured North America in September1885 with a team formed by the Devon amateur E. J. Sanders, making two first-class appearances on the tour against the Gentlemen of Philadelphia at Germantown. Graduating from Oxford in 1885, he enlisted in the Royal Devon Yeomanry in May 1889 as a second lieutenant. Between May 1889 and March 1895, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant, before he was promoted to the rank of captain in March 1895. Bolitho served during the Second Boer War. He was made a temporary major during war, with the rank converted to an honorary rank in the third year of the war. During the course of the war he was wounded in action, mentioned in dispatches and awarded the Distinguished Service Order. Following the war, he resigned his commission in November 1904. Bolitho later served as the director of Barclays and was a justice of the peace for Cornwall. During the 1890s he played cricket for Cornwall prior to their participation in minor counties cricket. Bolitho died at Bath in February 1919. He had married Ethel Grace Macleod in June 1888, with the couple having three children.

A nutcracker is a type of alcoholic drink consisting of a mixture of hard liquor and sugary beverages such as fruit juice. Nutcrackers are made and sold illicitly mainly in black and Hispanic communities of New York City. The drinks are made and sold by private individuals, often to supplement their income from other jobs. They consist of such liquors as vodka, rum, tequila and cognac, mixed with fruit juice, Kool- Aid or candy. They are sold, mainly in summer, on the streets and on the beaches in cups or small plastic bottles. ==History== Nutcrackers are thought to have been first made in 1993 or 1994 in the Dominican areas of Washington Heights, specifically as a cocktail at the Flor de Mayo restaurant, which styles the drink as the \\"Nut Cracker\\", and claims to be the original version. The \\"Nut Cracker\\" cocktail was invented by José Chu, a restaurant manager, and \\"Juice\\", a drug dealer, who requested a new cocktail, and was named for The Nutcracker ballet, due to a New York City Ballet ad on TV at the time. It consisted of Bacardi 151, Southern Comfort, Amaretto, pineapple juice, grenadine, and Rose's Sour Lime, and is described as strong, syrupy, sweet, and tart. From 1999, the cocktail was then bottled and sold for $10 each by \\"Fatyuil\\", a Dominican-American hairdresser, out of her apartment on St. Nicholas Avenue, and became wildly popular. From 2000, it was further popularized by Freddy Imperial, who sold drinks out of a barbershop on Audubon Avenue, and featured the drink in a program on a Manhattan Neighborhood Network (public access television) program, Dominican USA. It then became popular in Harlem and across the city. == Legality == The sale of nutcrackers without a license violates New York law, and the police have on occasion attempted to sanction it. In 2010, black community leaders including Al Sharpton spoke out against the sale of nutcrackers because of the unregulated drinks' potential dangers to health and to children. In 2011, the \\"nutcracker bill\\" (A06324) sponsored by State Senator Adriano Espaillat (D – Manhattan/Bronx) and Assemblyman Nelson Castro (D – Bronx) and signed by Governor Andrew Cuomo stripped barbershops of their license if they were convicted of selling alcohol to minors. Some nutcracker vendors have attempted to professionalize and legalize their business in order to assuage such concerns. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting closure of dine-in bars and restaurants, and the newly-legal sale of alcohol to-go resulted in increased competition with traditional nutcracker sales; some to-go cocktails were sold in the same traditional juice bottle format as nutcrackers. == Popular culture == Nutcrackers have been mentioned in popular culture since as early as Loaded Lux, \\"Nut Cracker\\" (2006), and popularized in N.O.R.E., \\"Nutcracker\\" (2010). ==References== Category:Cuisine of New York City Category:American alcoholic drinks ","title":"Nutcracker (drink)"},{"id":"61543324","text":"Reading Crown Court is a judicial facility in Reading, Berkshire.

Educated in France, Alantas worked as a journalist of the Lithuanian news agency ELTA and chief editor of the official daily Lietuvos aidas. Alantas was one of the leaders of Young Tautininkai, an organization of radical young members of the Lithuanian Nationalist Union in the late 1930s – this movement is also known as Vairininkai after the political magazine Vairas. A sympathizer with national socialism, Alantas is considered to be one of the chief ideologues of totalitarian nationalism in interwar Lithuania. During the Nazi occupation of Lithuania, he participated in the Lithuanian Activist Front (LAF) and later emigrated to the United States where he dedicated his life to literary work. He was a prolific writer and published seven collections of short stories, six novels, fifteen plays, four non-fiction books, and one poetry collection. His writings primarily deal with patriotic themes and topics. == Biography == === Early life and career === Alantas was the eldest of four children of a family of Lithuanian farmers in Sidabravas. Alantas' father briefly worked in the United States and managed to purchase of land from a former manor in near Radviliškis. His brother became a theater director. Alantas was taught by a daraktorius, a travelling Lithuanian teacher educating pupils in secret during the Lithuanian press ban. In 1912–1923, Alantas studied at the Šiauliai Gymnasium, with a half-year break in 1919 when he volunteered for the Lithuanian Army to fight the West Russian Volunteer Army in the Lithuanian Wars of Independence, despite being only 17 years old. From sixth grade onward, Alantas became immersed in literature, writing poetry and participating in the activities of the Ateitis Catholic Youth organization. Like many Lithuanian writers, he published his literature under a pseudonym, choosing Alantas, a tributary of the river Minija. In 1923, he enrolled to study literature in the University of Lithuania, but quit a year later due to lack of funds, and worked as a teacher at a gymnasium in Plungė until 1926. He continued his studies at the University of Montpellier in France and graduated in 1929. Because of his knowledge of French, he worked as the chief of the French section of ELTA from 1930 to 1934. In 1934–1939, he worked as the chief editor of the state newspaper Lietuvos aidas, and officially changed his last name to Alantas in 1937. He was awarded the Order of Vytautas the Great (1936) and the Order of the Three Stars (1939). === Vairininkai ideologue === In the late 1930s, Vairininkai took control of the media and the party apparatus in Antanas Smetona's dictatorship – party newspapers such as Vairas, Akademikas and Lietuvos aidas were chaired by the radical youth, while the general secretary of the Nationalist Union and the chairman supported their ideas. They were unaligned with earlier extremist Lithuanian movements such as Voldemarininkai and presented themselves as an \\"opposition of goodwill\\". The Vairininkai were anti-semitic, anti-democratic, anti-communist, totalitarian and sympathized with National Socialism. They believed all political parties to be a hurdle towards creating a monolithic state with an unquestioned absolute leader at the top (cf. Führerprinzip) and saw democracy, in Alantas's words, as a \\"psychosis\\" which the young generation should rid itself of. Alantas openly expressed extremist views arguing for aggressive nationalism without compromises. For example, he published an article in Vairas arguing in favor of an ethnic cleansing in the Vilnius Region after it was returned to Lithuania according to the terms of the Soviet–Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty – he cited Nazi Germany as an example writing that \\"the Germans turned the city of Gdynia into the most German city in their country through a fully mechanical process – people were moved out and other people were moved in\\". Alantas published selected articles and texts in his book (The Marching Nation), published in 1940. It was an apologetic work that defended the authoritarian regime of Smetona. He denounced international cooperation in favor of isolationist policies, and believed that national egoism, based on national solidarity, was the key to nations' survival. He believed that one's nation was superior and above others, and that citizens should sacrifice for their country (and not that a country should sacrifice for its citizens). === World War II and postwar life === A monument to Alantas in his native Sidabravas After the Soviet occupation of Lithuania in June 1940, Alantas fled to Germany. His wife and son remained in Lithuania and were deported to Siberia during the June deportation in 1941. In Germany, he was invited to head the Commission of Culture of the Lithuanian Activist Front, a movement of Lithuanian exiles who sought to liberate Lithuania with Nazi German support. Alantas belonged to the radical right wing of the LAF and supported establishment of the . Despite being offered by to head the Commission of Culture in the Ministry of Education in the Provisional Government of Lithuania, his appointment was blocked by the Party of Lithuanian Nationalists and he was appointed as the head of Vilnius Drama Theatre instead.Zenonas Blynas. Karo metų dienoraštis 1941-1944 m. Lietuvos istorijos instituto leidykla, 2007. During three years of work, Alantas wrote three plays, two of which were staged. In 1944, Alantas fled to Germany from the approaching Soviet army and became a displaced person in the aftermath of World War II. In 1949, Alantas moved to Detroit, United States, where he worked as a low-wage labourer in a Ford Motors automobile factory until retirement in 1968. He knew French and German, but struggled with English. He dedicated the rest of his life to literary work and published several novels, short stories, and a poetry collection. He was chairman of the in 1967–1971, and was offered jobs editing Lithuanian periodicals but he refused. In exile, Alantas's views grew increasingly esoteric and are exemplified in his first novel Pragaro pošvaistės (Patches of Hell). Searching for a psychological refuge, he began glorifying Baltic paganism and pre-Christian Lithuanian culture and denounced Christianity as a foreign, imposed influence. He equated Lithuanian national ideology with a return towards pagan humanism, and championed a worldview in which Lithuanians would recognize only Praamžius, the chief god of Baltic paganism, in the metaphysical, humane solidarity between fellow Lithuanians in the moral, and the principle \\"kill your enemy if you're able, perish yourself if you're not\\" in the political prism. In emigration, Alantas published two non-fiction books. In 1976, he wrote a study on Romas Kalanta who self-immolated in Kaunas protesting the Soviet regime in 1972. He wrote Tauta istorijos vingiais (The Nation Along the Twists of History) in 1987 and published it in 1990. It contains thoughts on the survival of the small nation, national character and identity of Lithuanians, meaning and value of the anti-Soviet resistance by the Lithuanian partisans. The work was republished in independent Lithuania in 1992. That year, the Ministry of Culture and Education proposed to include the book in the history curriculum for the 12th grade, but the proposal was quickly dropped. == Literary works == He was a prolific writer and published seven collections of short stories, fifteen plays, six novels, four non-fiction books, and one poetry collection. He authored more than a hundred short stories and feuilletons that varied in themes and topics. He did not join any literary movement or circles. His works have features of realism and romanticism with schematic writing style that resembles journalist's work. They often include melodramatic love stories and declarations of patriotism. His first short story was published in the Ateitis magazine in 1923. His first two collections of short stories, Artisto širdis (The Heart of an Artist) and Tarp penkių ir septynių (Between Five and Seven), were published in 1931 and 1934. The stories showed influence of Oscar Wilde and mostly dealt with city residents and their shortcomings – a move away from the traditional Lithuanian literature that primarily dealt with the lives of the Lithuanian village. Two other collections, Ant siūbuojančios žemės (On the Swaying Earth) and Svetimos pagairės (Foreign Skies), were published in the post-war years (1946 and 1954) and deal with the lives of Lithuanian refugees and emigrants, anti-Soviet resistance in Lithuania, etc. He published another collection Nemunas teka per Atlantą (Neman Flows Through the Atlantic) in 1970 that included stories concerning the history of Lithuania. The best short stories were published in Atspindžiai ūkanose (Reflections in the Mist) in 1976. In 1984, he published Gelmių balsai (Voices of the Deep), a collection of six short stories that won Lithuanian literary contests. Alantas' first play Užtvanka (The Dam) was staged in 1932 and received critical acclaim. It dealt with a love story in the background of electrification. The second play, Gaisras Lietuvoje (Fire in Lithuania), was staged in 1933. It invited to burn down the shacks and their heritage of Russian oppression to make way for the new Lithuania. Due to its political undertones, the play was discontinued after two performances. As a director of the Vilnius Drama Theatre, he staged two comedies Gyvenimas iš naujo (Life Anew) and Buhalterijos klaida (A Bookkeeping Error). As a displaced person in post-war Germany, Alantas wrote a more serious drama Aukštadvaris which dealt with love and duty and which premiered in Australia in 1955. He wrote more plays while living in Detroit; those were mainly comedies that were staged by two amateur Lithuanian theaters. A collection of nine plays was published in Chicago in 1963. It included Aukštadvaris, three dramas about the desperate struggles of the anti-Soviet Lithuanian partisans, and five comedies that dealt with larger moral issues (e.g. choosing money over love or patriotic duty). Alantas started his first novel Pragaro pošvaistės (In the Glow of Hell) in Lithuania, finished it in Detroit, and published it in West Germany in 1951. The work sparked lengthy discussions in Lithuanian literary circles – some 80 reviews and commentaries were collected and published in 1971 as a separate book. The novel deals with four patriots who fight the Nazi occupation in Vilnius, but the controversy was caused by the main character and his position that Lithuanians should return to the Lithuanian mythology and denounce Christianity. As a literary work, the novel was criticized for its schematic and lifeless characters. His second novel Tarp dviejų gyvenimų (Between Two Lives) was published in 1960 and was the first lengthy work to deal with the anti-Soviet Lithuanian partisans, highlighting their sacrifices and heroism. Alantas' third novel Amžinasis lietuvis (The Eternal Lithuanian; 1972) has autobiographical features (the main character is a writer who works at an automobile factory) and deals with the Lithuanian diaspora and their struggles to preserve their language and culture. The main character draws strength from the heroic history of Lithuania and pre-Christian Lithuanian paganism. This time, the work was criticized not for anti-Christian themes but due to heavy sexual content. Alantas' largest work is the two-volume novel Šventaragis published in 1972 and 1974. It is a historical work that deals with the reign of King Mindaugas in the 13th-century Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The main character is the legendary Šventaragis (cf. Šventaragis Valley), a wise and determined defender of the pagan faith. The novel was republished in independent Lithuania in 1998. Alantas wrote his fifth novel Liepkalnio sodyba (Liepkalnis Homestead) in response to a contest held by the Union of Lithuanian Agronomists. Published in 1978, it depicts a raising family of Lithuanian farmers in the interwar period. His last novel Aušra Paliūnuose (Dawn in Paliūnai) was published in 1986 and depicts the publication of the first Lithuanian periodicals Aušra and Varpas during the Lithuanian National Revival. Alantas started writing poetry in high school but published only one collection in 1982. The poems primarily deal with episodes from the history of Lithuania and express patriotic feelings: nine poems were dedicated to the Grand Dukes of Lithuania, three to Romas Kalanta, others to Vilnius, Trakai Island Castle, , his native Sidabravas. == References == Category:1902 births Category:1990 deaths Category:Lithuanian male writers Category:Lithuanian dramatists and playwrights Category:Lithuanian journalists Category:Lithuanian newspaper editors Category:Lithuanian nationalists Category:University of Montpellier alumni Category:Lithuanian emigrants to the United States Category:Recipients of the Order of Vytautas the Great Category:Recipients of the Order of the Three Stars Category:20th-century journalists ","title":"Vytautas Alantas"},{"id":"61543372","text":"Reckard is a surname.

The Karlsbader Programm demanded complete equality between the Sudeten Germans and the Czech people, self-government and the legal recognition of the Sudeten Germans.Michael Behnen and Gerhard Taddey (ed.): Encyclopedia of German History. Events, institutions, persons. From the beginning to the capitulation 1945. 3., revised edition. Kröner, Stuttgart 1998, , p. 652. Following pressure from Nazi Germany, Britain and France during the Sudeten crisis of 1938, the President of Czechoslovakia, Edvard Beneš, gave in to the demands of the Sudeten Germans.Zayas, Alfred Maurice de: Die Nemesis von Potsdam. Die Anglo-Amerikaner und die Vertreibung der Deutschen, überarb. u. erweit. Neuauflage, Herbig-Verlag, München, 2005. == Background == The native German-speaking regions in 1930, within the borders of the current Czech Republic, which in the interwar period were referred to as the Sudetenland Following the end of the First World War and the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Czechoslovak Republic emerged on the territory of the modern-day Czech Republic, Slovakia and Ukraine. The territory of the newly formed state included the predominantly German-speaking Sudetenland, however, they represented a minority within the state as a whole.Helmut Altrichter, Walter L. Bernecker, 2004: The History of Europe in the 20th Century. Kohlhammer, Stuttgart. The Sudeten Germans did not want to belong to a Czechoslovak state after the First World War, because they were used to being part of the Habsburg Monarchy and they did not suddenly want to be a minority in a state of Czechs and Slovaks. The new constitution was worked out without them and they were not consulted about whether they wished to be citizens of Czechoslovakia. Although the constitution of Czechoslovakia guaranteed equality for all citizens, there was a tendency among political leaders to transform the country \\"into an instrument of Czech and Slovak nationalism\\" and the Sudeten Germans believed they were not granted enough rights as a minority group.Douglas, R. M. (2012), Orderly and Humane, New Haven: Yale University Press Some progress was made to integrate the Germans and other minorities, but they continued to be under-represented in the government and the army. During the Great Depression the highly industrialized and export-oriented regions populated by the German minority, together with other peripheral regions of Czechoslovakia, were hurt by the economic depression more than the interior of the country which was mainly inhabited by Czech and Slovak populations.Kárník, Zdeněk. České země v éře první republiky (1918–1938). Díl 2. Praha 2002. By 1936, 60 percent of the unemployed people in Czechoslovakia were Germans.Douglas, pp. 7-12 The Sudeten Germans were represented by parties from across the political spectrum. German nationalist sentiment was strong in the Sudetenland from the early years of the republic and there was strong calls for autonomy and even union with Germany and Austria. The high unemployment, as well as the imposition of Czech in schools and all public spaces, made people more open to populist and extremist movements such as fascism, communism, and German irredentism. In these years, the parties of German nationalists and later the Sudeten German Party (SdP) with its radical demands gained immense popularity among Germans in Czechoslovakia. The Sudeten German Party (SdP) was formed in 1933 by Konrad Henlein with the merger of the German National Socialist Workers' Party (Czechoslovakia) and the German National Party after these parties were outlawed. The party represented many of the German nationalist positions, which approximated to those of Nazi Germany. Historians differ as to whether the SdP was from its beginning a Nazi front organization, or evolved into one.Eleanor L. Turk. The History of Germany. Westport, Connecticut, USA: Greenwood Press, 1999. . Pp. 123. The Sudeten German Party was \\"militant, populist, and openly hostile\\" to the Czechoslovakian government and soon captured two-thirds of the vote in districts with a heavy German population. By 1935, the SdP was the second largest political party in Czechoslovakia as German votes concentrated on this party while Czech and Slovak votes were spread among several parties. == Declaration of demands == Immediately after the Anschluß of Austria into the Third Reich in March 1938, Adolf Hitler made himself the advocate of ethnic Germans living in Czechoslovakia, triggering the Sudeten Crisis. Henlein met with Hitler in Berlin on 28 March 1938, where he was instructed to raise demands unacceptable to the Czechoslovak government led by president Edvard Beneš and the following month the SdP began agitating for autonomy. On 24 April 1938, at an SdP party congress, Henlein declared the Karlsbader Programm and adopted the eight-point plan.Noakes, J.; Pridham, G. (2010) [2001]. Nazism 1919–1945: Foreign Policy War, and Racial Extermination. 2 (2nd ed.). Devon: University of Exeter Press. The Karlsbader programm demanded autonomy and self-government for Germans living in Czechoslovakia. == List of demands == The following demands of the Karlsbader Programm was declared and adopted at an Sudeten German Party (SdP) party congress on 24 April 1938 in the city of Karlsbad (Modern-day Karlovy Vary) by the leader of the SdP party Konrad Henlein: # The recognition of full equality and equality with the Czech people. # Recognition of the ethnic group as a legal entity to safeguard its equal status in the state. # Establishment and recognition of the German settlement area. # Establishment of a German self-government in the German settlement area in all areas of public life, concerning the interests and affairs of the German ethnic group. # Creation of legal protection for those nationals living outside the closed settlement area of their nationality. # Elimination of the injustice inflicted upon the Sudeten Germans since 1918 and reparations for the damages they have suffered. # Recognition and implementation of the principle that the public employees within the German territory are German. # Full freedom of the right to declare a German nationality and to the German way of life, view and ideology. == Aftermath == Adolf Hitler greets British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain on the steps of the Berghof, 15 September 1938 The Czechoslovak government responded by rejecting the demands but stated that it was willing to provide more minority rights to the German minority but was initially reluctant to grant them autonomy. As the previous appeasement of Hitler had shown, the governments of both France and Britain were intent on avoiding war. The French government did not wish to face Germany alone and took its lead from Britain's Conservative government of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. Chamberlain considered the Sudeten German grievances justified and believed Hitler's intentions were limited. Both Britain and France, therefore, advised Czechoslovakia to accede to Germany's demands. Beneš resisted and on 19 May initiated a partial mobilization in response to possible German invasion. On 20 May, Hitler presented his generals with a draft plan of attack on Czechoslovakia codenamed Operation Green. Ten days later, Hitler signed a secret directive for war against Czechoslovakia, to begin not later than the 1 October. In the meantime, the British government demanded that Beneš request a mediator. Not wishing to sever his government's ties with Western Europe, Beneš reluctantly accepted. The British appointed Lord Runciman and instructed him to persuade Beneš to agree to a plan acceptable to the Sudeten Germans.Bell, P. M. H. (1986). The Second World War in Europe. Harlow, Essex: Longman. During August, the German press was full of stories alleging Czechoslovak atrocities against the Sudeten Germans, with the intention of forcing the Western Powers into putting pressure on the Czechoslovaks to make concessions. Hitler hoped the Czechoslovaks would refuse and that the Western Powers would then feel morally justified in leaving the Czechoslovaks to their fate. In August, Germany sent 750,000 soldiers along the border of Czechoslovakia officially as part of army maneuvers. On 4 or 5 September Beneš submitted the Fourth Plan, granting nearly all the demands of the Munich Agreement. The Sudeten Germans were not intent on conciliation and were under instructions from Hitler to avoid a compromise, and after the SdP held demonstrations that provoked police action in Ostrava on 7 September in which two of their parliamentary deputies were arrested, the Sudeten Germans used this incident and false allegations of other atrocities as an excuse to break off further negotiations. On 12 September Hitler made a speech at a Nazi Party rally in Nuremberg on the Sudeten crisis in which he condemned the actions of the government of Czechoslovakia. Hitler denounced Czechoslovakia as being a fraudulent state that was in violation of international law's emphasis of national self- determination and accused President Beneš of seeking to gradually exterminate the Sudeten Germans.Adolf Hitler, Max Domarus. The Essential Hitler: Speeches and Commentary. Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers, 2007. . Hitler stated that he would support the right of the self-determination of fellow Germans in the Sudetenland. On 13 September, after internal violence and disruption in Czechoslovakia ensued, Chamberlain asked Hitler for a personal meeting to find a solution to avert a war. The two met at Hitler's residence in Berchtesgaden on 15 September and agreed to the cession of the Sudetenland; three days later, French Prime Minister Édouard Daladier did the same. No Czechoslovak representative was invited to these discussions.Santi Corvaja, Robert L. Miller. Hitler & Mussolini: The Secret Meetings. New York, New York, USA: Enigma Books, 2008. . On the same day, Hitler met with Chamberlain and demanded the swift takeover of the Sudetenland by the Third Reich under threat of war. The Czechs, Hitler claimed, were slaughtering the Sudeten Germans. Chamberlain referred the demand to the British and French governments; both accepted. The Czechoslovak government resisted, arguing that Hitler's proposal would ruin the nation's economy and ultimately lead to German control of all of Czechoslovakia. The United Kingdom and France issued an ultimatum and on 21 September, Czechoslovakia capitulated.Third Axis Fourth Ally by Mark Axworthy With no end in sight to the dispute, Chamberlain appealed to Hitler for a conference. On 28 September, Hitler met with the chiefs of governments of France, Italy and Britain in Munich. The Czechoslovak government was neither invited nor consulted. On 29 September, the Munich Agreement was signed by Germany, Italy, France, and Britain. The Czechoslovak government capitulated on 30 September and agreed to abide by the agreement. The Munich Agreement stipulated that Czechoslovakia must cede Sudeten territory to Germany. German occupation of the Sudetenland would be completed by 10 October.Gilbert, Martin; Gott, Richard (1967). The Appeasers.

Often portraying elderly characters, she appeared in productions on Broadway and Off-Broadway, and in regional theatre productions across the United States during her career. ==Biography== === Early life === Irma St. Paule was born on March 23, 1926 in Odessa in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Her mother was from Russia and her father came from Turkey. At an early age, St. Paule and her family moved to New York City. She later moved to Chicago after she was married. There, St Paule enrolled at the Goodman School of Drama (now the Theatre School at DePaul University) to study as a ballerina. After she and her husband were granted a divorce, she returned to New York City and later said of her relocation to an interviewer, \\"By then, my family was mostly gone so I was able to do as I wished. And I did!\\". === Career to death === Later in life, St. Paule began a career in acting, appearing in several films and television shows from 1985, often playing grandmothers of Italian descent. Films in which she was credited in during the 1980s were The Oracle (1985), Walls of Glass (1985), Psychos in Love (1987) and Rain (1989). St. Paule made her debut in a television film by being cast in The Bride in Black in 1990, and portrayed Ya Ya Andros on the NBC soap opera Guiding Light from 1992 to 1994. In the meantime, she was cast in three films in 1993: St. Paule played Teresa in The Cemetery Club, Household Saints, and The Saint of Fort Washington. She later was seen in Who Do I Gotta Kill? (1994), Party Girl, Mother Theresa in Jeffrey, and 12 Monkeys (the final three films were released in 1995). In 1995, St. Paule made her sole appearance on Broadway, portraying The Strega in a revival of The Rose Tattoo. The following year, she was cast in the films Caught, Love is All There Is, Trees Lounge, The Big Bajoor, and Thinner. For the remainder of the 1990s, St. Paule was in Better Than Ever (1997), Kiss Me, Guido (1997), Grandma Matilda in Desecration (1999), Coming Soon (1999), and Fever (1999). Throughout 2000 she appeared in the films Wirey Spindell, Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her, Where the Money Is, Fast Food Fast Women, Fear of Fiction, and A Piece of Eden. St. Paule continued her acting career in 2001 to 2004, when she was cast in Cat Lady (2001), Queenie in Love (2001), Errors, Freaks and Oddities (2002), Found Money (2003), Jersey Girl (2004), Second Best (2004), and The Amazing Floydini (2004). Later career roles in films featuring St. Paule included Homecoming (2005), Duane Hopwood (2005), Bittersweet Place (2005), Life on the Edge (2005), Mrs. Leeds in Satan's Playground (2005), 9A (2006), The Last Request (2006), In The Blood (2006), and Made in Brooklyn (2006). Her final show on stage was in an Off-Broadway revival of All the Way Home in late 2006, in which had a non-speaking role as an elderly secluded woman residing at a rustic, rural home.

The Princess Margaret was the second daughter of King George VI and Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, while Antony Armstrong-Jones was a noted society photographer. ==Engagement== Princess Margaret met photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones in 1958 at a dinner party at the Chelsea home of Lady Elizabeth Cavendish. Though Armstrong-Jones was the photographer at the wedding of Margaret's friends, Lady Anne Coke and The Hon. Colin Tennant, in April 1956. In October 1959, Armstrong-Jones was invited to stay at Balmoral Castle. It was assumed by the public he was there to photograph the royal family. They became engaged shortly after and on 26 February 1960, Clarence House announced the engagement. Armstrong-Jones presented the Princess with a ruby surrounded by a marguerite of diamonds ring. He had designed the ring himself to resemble a rose in honor of Margaret's middle name. Two days before the wedding, on 4 May, there was a white-tie ball at Buckingham Palace attended by the Prime Minister and the Archbishop of Canterbury. ==Wedding== A ticket for the wedding procession ===Ceremony=== Margaret made her way with the Duke of Edinburgh from Clarence House in the Glass Coach, arriving at the church at 11:30. The wedding took place at Westminster Abbey and was conducted by The Most Rev. Dr. Geoffery Fisher, Archbishop of Canterbury and The Very Rev. Eric Abbott, Dean of Westminster. It was the first royal wedding to be broadcast on television with an estimated 300 million viewers. ===Attendants=== Armstrong-Jones's best man was Dr. Roger Gilliatt, son of the Queen's gynecologist. The Countess of Rosse, the groom's mother, had hoped he would choose his half-brother, Lord Oxmantown, as his best man. However, resentment of their mother's favoritism led him to reject this suggestion. On 19 March, it was announced he had chosen Jeremy Fry for the role, but Fry was convicted of \\"importuning for immoral purposes\\" after allegedly approaching a man for sex, so was replaced. Princess Margaret was attended by eight young bridesmaids: * The Princess Anne, daughter of The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh * Miss Angela Nevill, daughter of Lord and Lady Rupert Nevill * Lady Rose Nevill, daughter of The Marquess and Marchioness of Abergavenny * The Hon.

The bride walked down the aisle to the hymn \\"Christ is made the sure foundation\\" to the tune Westminster Abbey by Purcell. Throughout the service, anthems by Franz Schubert, William Byrd and Gustav Holst were sung. The recessional music, at the special request of the bride, was \\"Trumpet Tune and Airs\\" by Purcell. ===Attire=== The Princess wore a silk organza gown designed by Norman Hartnell. She accessorized with the Poltimore tiara, which she had purchased at auction a year earlier, and a diamond riviére of 34 old-cut diamonds given to the bride by her grandmother, Queen Mary. She carried a bouquet of white orchids. Hartnell also designed the outfits of the Queen and the Queen Mother. Armstrong-Jones and all male members of the royal family, except for Lord Mountbatten, wore morning dress. ==Guests== Notable guests in attendance included: ===Relatives of the bride=== House of Windsor * The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh, the bride's sister and brother-in-law ** The Prince of Wales, the bride's nephew ** The Princess Anne, the bride's niece (bridesmaid) * Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, the bride's mother *The Princess Royal, the bride's paternal aunt ** The Earl and Countess of Harewood, the bride's first cousin and his wife ** The Hon.

On 26 May, while away on honeymoon, Camilla Fry, wife of Jeremy Fry, gave birth to Armstrong-Jones's illegitimate daughter, Polly. Allegations of this were first raised in 2004 and confirmed when Armstrong-Jones agreed to take a paternity test. On 6 October 1961, Armstrong-Jones was raised to the peerage as Earl of Snowdon and Viscount Linley, of Nymans in the County of Sussex, by Queen Elizabeth II. He became \\"The Right Honourable The Earl of Snowdon\\" and Princess Margaret became \\"Her Royal Highness The Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon.\\" The couple had two children, David (b. 1961), now the 2nd Earl of Snowdon, and Sarah (b. 1964). The Snowdons separated in 1976, subsequently divorcing on 11 July 1978. It was the first divorce by a senior member of the royal family since that of Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse in 1901. On 15 December of that year, Snowdon remarried Lucy Lindsay-Hogg, separating in 2000. They had a daughter, Frances (b. 1979). On 30 April 1998, Snowdon fathered another illegitimate child, Jasper William Oliver Cable-Alexander.

The document was issued in the run up to the UK 2010 General Election. As well as explaining social teaching about the Common Good, it also focused upon the need to rebuild trust following the Financial crisis of 2007–2008 and political expense scandals.Choosing the Common Good p9 The document is a follow up to bishops' 1996 document: The Common Good and the Catholic Church’s Social teaching, which was issued prior to the 1997 United Kingdom general election. This document provides updates, taking into account recent Papal encyclicals such as Pope Benedict XVI's Caritas in veritate. ==Purpose of the document== Archbishop Vincent Nichols identified the purpose of the document as a contribution to the issues of the moment. \\"... It proposes that without a wider debate about a shared vision for our society, the electioneering may well be confined to bitter arguments over issues of particular policy. We need a more wide-ranging debate about the values and vision which can underpin all our joint effort today. ==What is the Common Good== The Common Good refers to that which belongs to everyone in virtue of their common humanity “the sum total of social conditions which allow people, either as groups or as individuals to reach their fulfilment more fully and more easily” Choosing the Common Good, p8 (quoted from Catechism of the Catholic Church, paragraph 1906) The common good is explained as not a generalised best possible for a society, where the average can be pulled up by some individuals doing particularly well. Instead, it is a matter of human flourishing, such that “if anyone has been left out and deprived of what is essential, then the common good has been betrayed.”Choosing the Common Good p8 ==Integral human development== Integral human development is explained as the fulfilment of human flourishing, which the common good advocates. It requires lifting people from “every form of poverty, from hunger to illiteracy; it requires the opportunities for education, creating a vision of true partnership and solidarity between peoples; it calls for active participation in economic and political processes and it recognises that every human person is a spiritual being” Choosing the Common Good p9 ==Rebuilding trust== The bishops' call for a rebuilding of trust follows a series of national and international financial scandals. One of the major factors leading to the scandals is identified as a problem of selfishness and self-interest.Choosing the Common Good p10 The document makes the case that focusing upon the Common good contributes to remedying the problems which afflicted banking and politicians; and retaining that focus helps to avoid future problems arising again. ==The call to virtue== Rebuilding trust and working to achieve the Common good cannot be just a matter of rule following.Choosing the Common Good p11 It is instead a matter of changing hearts and minds so that people develop the characters of virtue which will help them to make the right choices, consistently and comprehensively; regardless of whether people are looking at them.Choosing the Common Good p11 By focusing upon the traditional cardinal virtues of Prudence, Justice, Temperance and Fortitude people are transformed and society is renewed in a way that mere compliance and regulation can never achieve.Choosing the Common Good p12 The bishops state: “Our society will rediscover its capacity to trust by the recovery of the practice of virtue, and through an ethically founded reform of many of our social and economic institutions. This will itself begin to restore the economy to a path that is both sustainable and just”Choosing the Common Good p13 ==Key principles== *Solidarity: ‘acknowledges that all are responsible for all, not only as individuals but collectively at every level (p8) *Common good: as the purpose and meaning of human society (p8) *Integral Human Development: as a vision of what it means for individuals to flourish (p9) *Pursuit of virtue as a more effective way of building society than mere regulation (p12) *Value of Life from conception to natural death(p14), *Reducing poverty and inequality (p14) *Migration and Community relations (p15) *The Global Community and Ecology (p16) *Family and marriage (p17) *The role of faith communities (p18) ==Conclusion== Focusing upon the principles of social teaching does not eradicate the need for discussion, nor the fact of inevitable disagreement. There will always be legitimate discussion about how to apply the principles,Choosing the Common Good p13 but a first step towards building a better society is to ensure that we are at least clear about what the principles are, upon which that society will be built. Contributing to establishing that clarification is the purpose of Choosing the Common Good ==Reception== National Media in England picked up on specific themes from the document. The BBC focused on the bishops’ diagnosis of a core problem of ‘'lack of trust. Other commentators thought that the bishops were suggesting that “over-regulation” was undermining community spirit Some commentators viewed the bishops' document as a covert support for the Conservative Party’s support of marriage, although The Guardian dismissed it as a “cliché ridden damp squib” The head of the Catholic Church in England, Archbishop Vincent Nichols expressed surprise when the Prime Minister, David Cameron seemed to echo the call to focus on the Common good. ==References== ==External links== *The Common Good and the Catholic Church's Social Teaching (1996) *Bishop's General Election Advice 2015 Category:Social justice Category:Catholic social teaching Category:Documents of the Catholic Social Teaching tradition Category:Catholic Church in England and Wales ","title":"Choosing the Common Good"},{"id":"61543619","text":"The Tsirkoli church of the Mother of God () is an 8th–9th-century Georgian Orthodox church near the village of Tsirkoli in the Ksani river valley. It combines the features of domeless and domed church designs and is classified as belonging to the \\"transitional period\\" of medieval Georgian architecture. The area, part of the Akhalgori Municipality, came under the control of Russian and South Ossetian forces in the August 2008 Russo-Georgian War. As a result the Georgian clergy and parish lost access to the church, which is inscribed on Georgia's Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance.. == Location == The Tsirkoli church of the Mother of God stands northwest of the village of Tsirkoli, on the right bank of the Ksani River. The village, also known as Tsirkvali in historical records, is first mentioned in the medieval Georgian chronicles when relating the events in 975. It is home to another, late medieval church of St. George and a ruined fortress, located nearby. == Layout == The church of the Mother of God is built of porous tuff. It has the centrally located dome, which is without a drum, rests on squinches, and is vaulted with a gable roof, imparting an outward appearance of a single-nave building. At the east end of the interior there is a sanctuary, with a semicircular apse and side chambers. The west part of the interior is two-storeyed, each floor connected to the central square bay through a pair of arched openings. The east façade has a pediment, crowned by a simple cornice. Between the pediment and a double-arched window below it there is a large rectangular recess, probably made to accommodate an inscription—a project that did not materialize. In the centre of the south façade there are three interconnected arched niches surmounted by a double window, which is adorned with exquisite stone carvings. The central niche serves as a doorway into the building. A stone inscription from the church, made in the medieval Georgian asomtavruli script and mentioning King Leon III of Abkhazia, is dated to the period of 957–967 and is preserved at the Georgian National Museum in Tbilisi. The layout of the dome and east façade are unusual in the medieval Georgian church architecture. The interior bears fragments of the 10th–11th-century frescoes. Better preserved are the depictions of the saints Febronia and Marianus, with identifying Georgian inscriptions, in the central bay.

It is their debut album and was recorded in Radio-Canada's Studio 12 at Maison Radio-Canada in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, seven years after the ensemble was formed in 1989. It was released by Canadian record label, Ambiances Magnétiques. The fourteen-track album comprises three pieces by external composers and arranged by the quartet, a piece composed by each of the four members of the quartet, and seven short pieces improvised by the group. Lussier's piece includes music he composed for La Manière des Blancs, a film by Bernard Hémond. Frith's track \\"Freedom Is Your Friends II\\" is taken from Freedom in Fragments, an album composed by Frith and performed by the Rova Saxophone Quartet. Didkovsky's piece \\"She Closes Her Sister With Heavy Bones\\" comes from Their Eyes Bulged With Sparkling Pockets, a larger work he composed for chamber orchestra. ==Reception== In a review at AllMusic, François Couture said Ayaya Moses \\"showcases four gifted avant-garde guitarists\\" negotiating \\"demanding compositions\\". He called Lussier's title track, \\"Ayaya Moses\\" \\"the strongest piece\\", and described the album as a whole as \\"[m]ore serious and industrious\\" than the quartet's next album, Upbeat. Reviewing the album in The Wire, Mike Barnes described it as \\"a dazzling display of… well, virtually everything that electric guitars can produce in the right hands.\\" He said the music swings from \\"clean strumming and delicate melody ... to blocks of atonal noise and all points in between\\". Barnes remarked that while the electric guitar in this chamber ensemble is far removed from its traditionally role in rock music, the \\"spirit of rock 'n' roll\\" still surfaces from time to time. James Hale wrote in the Ottawa Citizen that the album's diverse range of musical styles gives the quartet an opportunity to display their skills. He said Frith's \\"Freedom Is Your Friends II\\" has \\"shimmering harmonic overtones\\", and Stewart's \\"Trummings\\" is \\"thrashing [and] heavily electronic\\". Hale remarked that Didkovsky and Lussier's contributions are \\"atypical\\" of their usual rock and blues repertoire: Didkovsky's \\"She Closes Her Sister with Heavy Bones\\" is \\"suffused with melancholy beauty\\", and Lussier's \\"Ayaya Moses\\" \\"shifts from brooding to brutal\\" with none of his usual \\"loopy humour\\". But Hale called the quartet's performance of Vivier's \\"Pulau Dewata\\" the highlight of the album, adding that it \\"allows the four guitarists to range from chime- like percussion to a majestic electric chorus.\\" Michael Rosenstein also felt that \\"Pulau Dewata\\" is Ayaya Moses high point. Reviewing the album in Cadence magazine, he said the quartet performs Vivier's complex work \\"with poised energy, stepping quietly through hushed sections ... then attack[ing] [the] percussive punctuations with chiming vigor.\\" Rosenstein opined that \\"through intriguing compositions [and] thoughtful improvisations\\", the quartet is opening up new possibilities for the electric guitar. ==Track listing== All music by the Fred Frith Guitar Quartet, except where noted.

It is categorized as Public Company Limited. In food service industry, it is one of the largest restaurant chains in Asia Pacific region. The company was established by William E. Heinecke in 1980. Headquarter is located in Bangkok Metropolis, Thailand. Its address is at Berli Jucker House, 15/F 99 Sukhumvit 42 Rd, Klong Toei Road. Its products includes Casual Dining Restaurant, Quick Service Restaurant (QSR), Food, Food Service and Food Delivery. As it comprises a number of third parties’ franchises, there have been many restaurant brands operated by the group like The Pizza Company, Swensen’s, Sizzler, Dairy Queen, Burger King, The Coffee Club, Riverside Grilled Fish, Basil, ThaiXpress, Benihana. Nevertheless, it has equity-owned, the Pizza Company, which later became the most visited pizzeria brand in Thailand according to the survey in 2015. Not only those, it also acquires manufacturing plants for dairy and coffee ingredients. ==Brief Introduction== At that time, there were only few American fast-food brands in Thailand’s food market. So a pizza franchise as Pizza Hut (at the time) under Minor Food Brand had been introduced. After the pizza franchises have expanded, it brought Sundae ice-cream franchises to Thailand which later became Top-visited ice-cream brand domestically. There gradually has been an increase in importing fast-food franchises to Thailand, while developing own restaurant brand. To reaching more customer and respond to globalization, Minor Food utilizes call center and 1112Delivery application for food delivery purpose. ==History of Minor Food's growth in Thailand == === The First Pizza Franchise === Seeing the more influence of Western dining styles in Thai people and few fast-food competitors in the market, Bill Heinecke decided to found Minor Food in 1980. To enter Thailand’s food market, the group selected pizza as its first product. === In 1986, Franchised Swensen's === Minor Food brought San Francisco’s well-known ice-cream franchises like Swensen’s to Thailand. It has remained high competitive position until today with the classic sundae delights and affordable prices, becoming the most outstanding ice-cream brand in Thai’s market. A few action plans which boost the sales are redesigning the product presentation (chose ‘Sundae menu’) by focusing on new generation target groups, and innovate the menu to fit family target customer. === In 1989, Developed Delivery Services === Minor Food was the first company to provide home and office delivery. Beginning with pizza delivery service to homes and office, the brand can reach customers without the obstacles of rush- hour crunch and the desire to eat at home. === In 1992, Manufacturing === Minor Cheese Limited (MCL) and Minor Dairy Limited (MDL) were founded under the consideration of food quality, availability, reliability, and cost control. The major ingredients produced had been delivered to internal franchises and external restaurants. In the same year, it introduced Sizzler, combination meals and salad assortment restaurant outlets, to Thailand. This kind of restaurants allows customers to experience early self-service dining style at the time. === In 1996, Introduced Dairy Queen === the Dairy Queen, soft serve ice-cream brand was founded after the success of Swensen’s in Thailand during years. Originated from Illinois, Dairy Queen’s outstanding marketing is ‘Blizzard’ products. === In 2000, Introduced Burger King === Minor food founded Burger King restaurants in Thailand. It was the first burger franchises with signature menu of The Whopper. To satisfy different groups of customers, it offered International variations by putting exotic ingredients according to the locations. In Thailand, the franchises offer Thai Spiced Chicken with Sticky Rice and other seasonal menu. === In 2001, Built Its Own Brand === After the contract with Pizza Hut expired, Minor Food decided to have its own pizza brand named ‘The Pizza Company’. Though it was originated in Thailand. It also has the franchises in Kuwait, United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia, China, Philippines, Cambodia. === In 2005, Enter Bakery Industry === It also cooperated to establish intercompany brand as BreadTalk to run bakery business in Thailand with the Breadtalk Group, the Singaporean listed company. === In 2007, Develop Food Delivery Service === Minor Food was lately developed the first web ordering platform in food delivery businesses, competing with its peers like FoodPanda, Lineman and GrabFood. At the beginning, 1112Delivery application will only serve available in the Bangkok metropolitan area. But the company is processing to expand it to other major cities like Chiang Mai and Phuket by mid-year. The call center project was implemented to be the main hotline for other brands under Minor Food Group in early 2019. ==International investment== === Australia === It invested in the Australia’s all-hours cafébar and restaurant chain by acquiring half stake in 2008. There are 10+ branches in Thailand in 2016. === China === Its primary investment in China is buying shares of Beijing Riverside & Courtyard, the local casual dining restaurant chain with expertise of Sichuan cooking dishes.

Meagher, who by 1970, had become Master of the National Maternity Hospital in Dublin, one of the largest maternity hospitals in Europe, sought to reduce perinatal mortality by implementing a new approach to the management of childbirth. He did so by giving a greater role to midwives, providing additional support for mothers and reducing prolonged labour. \\"The Dublin Experience\\" helped usher in the modern era of Irish obstetrics and led to the development of a clinical package of care now internationally known as \\"active management of labour\\". ==Charity== After his career at the National Maternity Hospital, Meagher took over as Director- General of the Holy Family Hospital in Bethlehem, in the West Bank. There, with the Order of Malta and the European Union, he helped build Palestine's first maternity ward, introduced maternity training programs for local doctors and midwives, and set up rural maternity care clinics for Palestinian women. Meagher also represented Ireland on the council of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in London, which he used to share maternity care practices and build ties between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. ==Publication== Meagher co-authored with Kieran O'Driscoll, The Active Management of Labour, which is used in medical school curricula in Europe, Australia, Canada, Great Britain, and the United States. == References == Category:1921 births Category:2019 deaths Category:People from County Offaly Category:Irish obstetricians ","title":"Declan Meagher"},{"id":"61544916","text":"Leo Skurnik (28 March 1907 – 4 December 1976) was a Finnish physician, a medical officer in the Finnish Army and one of the three Finnish Jews who were proposed to be awarded the Iron Cross by Nazi Germany during World War II but refused to accept it. == Early life == Leo Skurnik was born in Helsinki, Grand Duchy of Finland, to parents, businessman Ben-Zian Skurnik and Sarah Skurnik. He was a descendant of one of the oldest cantonist Jewish families. Skurnik completed student matriculation in 1927 and became a Licentiate of Medicine in 1937. He married Lempi Irene Laukka in 1939 and started working as the municipal doctor of Ii. He had moved to Ii after he faced antisemitism while pursuing a scientific career at the University of Helsinki. == Military service and the Iron Cross == When the Pioneer Battalion 5 (later Pioneer Battalion 15) was being formed during the Interim Peace in the Ii garrison, Skurnik, then with the rank of medical captain, was assigned as the battalion's doctor. Skurnik's unit was participating in the combined Finnish–German offensive from Kiestinki to Loukhi, which was one of the costliest actions in the early phase of the Continuation War. The strength of the Finnish Infantry Regiment 54 had been reduced from 2,800 to 800 during the heavy fighting in August 1941, and it has been estimated that the field hospital with seven doctors where Skurnik was stationed received a hundred wounded men each day. In September 1941, Skurnik organized the evacuation of a field hospital in heavy Soviet artillery shelling near Kiestinki, saving the lives of 600 wounded men, including Waffen-SS members. Skurnik split the evacuees into small formations and timed their departures between the artillery barrages. The German liaison headquarters, headed by General Waldemar Erfurth, proposed awarding the Iron Cross to Skurnik for the effort deemed heroic, a proposal which was accepted in Berlin. However, Skurnik refused to accept the award and reportedly stated to Lieutenant General Hjalmar Siilasvuo, who informed him of the decision, \\"My good friend, do you think I can take that kind of decoration? Tell your German colleagues that I wipe my arse with it!\\" Skurnik's rebuff caused the Germans to respond with open annoyance. The two other Finnish Jews awarded with the Iron Cross, Captain Salomon Klass and nurse Dina Poljakoff, also refused the award. Discontent with having to work with the German troops later contributed to Skurnik requesting a transfer to the Uhtua front in the summer of 1942. Later in the war, he was promoted to major and fought in the Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive and the Lapland War. Finnish military history author, Colonel Wolf H. Halsti, lauded Skurnik's loyalty as surpassing a military doctor's usual duties, as Skurnik went to rescue wounded soldiers from no man's land when nobody else had the courage to do so. == Later life == After the war, Skurnik continued working as a doctor in Ii until 1947. He divorced and married another woman, Helmi Annikki Kaisto, in 1949. Afterwards, he worked as a factory doctor for Rauma-Raahe Oy, municipal doctor for Paavola and Revonlahti between 1953 and 1961 and as a doctor for the City of Oulu from 1961 until his retirement. He died in Oulu in 1976 and was buried near the waters he used to fish on Kirkkosaari island, Ii. == References == === Bibliography === * === Journals === * Category:1907 births Category:1976 deaths Category:People from Helsinki Category:Finnish Jews Category:Finnish military personnel of World War II Category:Finnish physicians Category:20th-century physicians ","title":"Leo Skurnik"},{"id":"61544948","text":"Eutingen (Baden) station () is a railway station in the municipality of Eutingen an der Enz, located in the Enzkreis district in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. ==References== ==External links== Category:Railway stations in Baden- Württemberg Category:Buildings and structures in Enzkreis ","title":"Eutingen (Baden) station"},{"id":"61545014","text":"Deunte Darrell (born 20 September 1992) is a Bermudian cricketer.

As a juvenile in 2017 he won three of his four races including the With Anticipation Stakes and the Remsen Stakes. In the following year he was one of the best colts of his generation in America, winning the Pennine Ridge Stakes and Belmont Derby on turf before switching to dirt to take the Travers Stakes. As a four-year-old in 2019 he won the Dixie Stakes. ==Background== Catholic Boy is a bay horse with a white star bred in Kentucky by Fred W. Hertrich III & John D. Fielding. As a yearling in January 2016 he was put up for auction at Keeneland but failed to reach his reserve price of $170,000. He subsequently entered the ownership of a partnership headed by Robert LaPenta which also included Madaket Stables, Siena Farm and Twin Creeks Racing Stables. He was sent into training with Jonathan Thomas. He was sired by More Than Ready, a top-class American sprinter who won the King's Bishop Stakes in 2000. His other progeny have included Roy H and Verrazano. Catholic Boy's dam Song of Bernadette showed negligible ability on the track, failing to win in five starts. She was a female-line descendant of the Argentinian mare La Sevillana, making her a relative of La Lorgnette and Hawk Wing. ==Racing career== ===2017: two-year- old season=== Catholic Boy made his track debut in a maiden race over seven and a half furlongs on turf at Gulfstream Park on July 20, 2017. Ridden by Carlos Monsalvo he started at odds of 4.1/1 and won by two lengths from Discovered. The colt was then stepped up in class and distance for the Grade III With Anticipation Stakes on turf at Saratoga Race Course on August 30. After being repeatedly hampered he accelerated through a gap in the closing stages and won by a length at odds of 11.2/1. His rider Manny Franco commented \\"I had a lot of horse under me and I was trying to find my way out. I had to wait a little longer than I wanted, but the hole opened, and I had a lot of horse left and we won\\". In the Grade I Breeders' Cup Juvenile Turf at Del Mar Racetrack on November 3 Catholic Boy finished fourth behind Mendelssohn, Untamed Domain and Voting Control with Masar and Sands of Mali among those running unplaced. The colt was then switched to the dirt for the Grade II Remsen Stakes over nine furlongs at Aqueduct Racetrack on December 2. With Franco in the saddle he tracked the leaders before moving up to take the lead on the final turn and drawing away to win by four and three quarter lengths from the favourite Avery Island. After the race Jonathan Thomas said \\"We came over quietly confident he would show us a little something, but we never expected that\\". ===2018: three-year-old season=== On his three-year-old debut Catholic Boy started odds-on favourite for the Grade III Sam F. Davis Stakes on dirt at Tampa Bay Downs in February but was beaten half a length by the Mark Casse-trained Flameaway. Irad Ortiz took over the ride from Franco when the colt contested the Grade I Florida Derby at Gulfstream on March 31 and came home fourth of the nine runners, twelve lengths behind the winner Audible. The colt returned to the turf at Belmont on June 2 for the Grade III Pennine Ridge Stakes and started second favourite behind the Transylvania Stakes winner Analyze It. Ridden by Javier Castellano he led soon after the start and after being headed by the favourite in the stretch he rallied to regain the advantage and won by a neck. Thomas commented \\"He's been nothing but reliable. We have asked him a lot of questions. I'm proud of his effort and his tenacity\\". On 9 July Catholic Boy again faced Analyze It in the Grade I Belmont Derby and started at odds of 5.1/1 in a nine-runner field which also included Hunting Horn (Hampton Court Stakes) from Ireland, Kingstar from France, My Boy Jack (Southwest Stakes) and Hawkish (Penn Mile Stakes). In a near replica of the Pennine Ridge Stakes he led for most of the way and after being overtaken by Analyze It he regained the lead in the final strides to win by a head. After the race Thomas, who was winning his first Grade I race said \\"It was a hell of a horse race. He really has a lot of heart. I didn't expect him to fight back this time. I thought we were going to finish a real good second... somehow he got it done.\\" At Saratoga Race Course on August 25, with Castellano again in the saddle, Catholic Boy was one of ten three-year-olds to contest the 149th edition of the Grade I Travers Stakes over ten furlongs on dirt. He started the 7.1/1 third choice in the betting behind Good Magic and Gronkowski while the other contenders included Vino Rosso (Wood Memorial), Mendelssohn, Bravazo (second in the Preakness Stakes), Tenfold (Jim Dandy Stakes) and the Canadian filly Wonder Gadot. After tracking the front-running Mendelssohn Catholic Boy went to the front inside the last quarter mile and drew away in the final furlong to win \\"readily\\" by four lengths. Robert LaPenta commented \\"They should make a movie about this... I've been coming to Saratoga since I was 18. This race has always been my dream. Even more than the Kentucky Derby.\\" For his final run of 2018, Catholic Boy was matched against older horses in the Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs on November 2. He was made the 6/1 third choice in the betting but never looked likely to win and came home thirteenth of the fourteen runners behind Accelerate. In the 2018 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Catholic Boy was rated the third best three-year-old colt in the world behind Roaring Lion and Justify and the twentieth best horse of any age or sex. ===2019: four-year-old season=== Catholic Boy began his third campaign in the Dixie Stakes over eight and a half furlongs on turf at Pimlico Race Course on May 18 and went off 1.4/1 favourite against nine opponents. He settled in second place behind Real Story before taking the lead a furlong out and held off the late challenge of Admission Office to win by half a length. Castellano commented \\"He's a super horse. You can do whatever you want. He can be on pace, he can come from behind. I like the way he did it\\". On 6 July the colt started favourite for the Suburban Handicap over ten furlongs on dirt and finished second to the six-year-old Preservationist, to whom he was conceding six pounds in weight. ==Pedigree== *Catholic Boy is inbred 4 × 4 to Mr. Prospector, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree. ==References== Category:2015 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Kentucky Category:Racehorses trained in the United States Category:Thoroughbred family 9-g ","title":"Catholic Boy (horse)"},{"id":"61545095","text":"Filipo Nakosi (born 8 April 1992) is a Fijian rugby player for Castres Olympique in France's Top 14, the highest level of French rugby.

During the 1840s he invented a method by which the mass production of etched designs on steel blades could be facilitated by means of paper transfers. The British and American patents brought him a good income, but he devoted his life to developing the method. After he was widowed he was killed by arsenic poisoning at the hands of his housekeeper Kate Dover. ==Background== 24 Glover Place, Skinner's last residence Thomas Skinner's father was etcher and cutler Thomas Skinner senior, who worked for Joseph Rodgers & Sons of Sheffield. Thomas junior was born in Sheffield on 16 June 1819. By 1841 at the age of 22 he was an ornamenter, living in Carver Street, Sheffield, with his widowed mother Mary who kept a lodging house. He had three sisters: Ann, Matilda (born ca. 1820) and Eliza (born ca. 1830).

Hudson. who was born and died in Ecclesall, Sheffield. Deaths Dec 1876 Skinner Mellond 56 Sheffield 9c 232 They married on 1 October 1839 in the same town. He moved around a lot: in 1851 he was at West Street, and in 1857 he was at Regent Terrace, where he and his wife suffered a burglary. Charles Rushby was remanded and committed to Sessions, with breaking and entering, ransacking drawers and boxes, and stealing \\"a silver-plated salver, jug, mug, beaker, three egg cups, a spoon, together with a pair of boots\\". At that point, Skinner was described as a silver plater. By 1861 he was describing himself as an engraver on copper and living at 29 Charlotte Street, St George's, Sheffield, with Melinda and their son Clifford (Ecclesall 1855 – Poplar, London 1924). Deaths Mar 1924 Skinner Clifford 67 Poplar 1c 537 Mellond was buried on 28 November 1876 at All Saints Church, Ecclesall. At some point around the 1870s, Skinner lived at Upper Gell Street Sheffield. Something of Skinner's character may be glimpsed from the court case of December 1856, in which the German silversmith Frederick Allen was charged with giving Skinner \\"a severe black eye\\". However there had previously been \\"unpleasantness\\" between Skinner and Allen, who was under notice to quit. On the day of the alleged assault, Allen refused to follow orders, and took it upon himself to pick out teapot handles for use at work without asking permission. Skinner called him a \\"scoundrel\\" and pushed him, and \\"a scuffle and fight ensued.\\" The magistrates \\"took the view that Skinner had commenced the assault ... and dismissed the case\\". Later, as a widower, Skinner was very familiar with his servants; for example he chaffed Emma Bolsover \\"about not being so good-looking as her sister\\". Some witnesses said he was also a drunkard later in life, although his sister Ann Holmes said that he was not. Skinner was nevertheless described by a friend as: > \\"A man of superior intellectual ability; had a very fine nervous > organisation; and was extremely sensitive to all kinds of impressions. He > was a kind, genial, sympathetic man, with a very strong love nature – much > too strong in fact; a man of strong temper and great excitability. He > possessed enormously developed perceptive faculties which gave him his > artistic and mechanical skill, his love for music, and fitted him for doing > almost any kind of refined and delicate work. A man of good easy > conversational powers, he easily gathered knowledge from other sources than > books, and turned it readily to use; but he had not much thinking power, and > was consequently liable to be led away by his strong feelings, and to do > things which were not wise. He had very strong self-esteem, was very > opinionated, and extremely sensitive to adverse criticism. This, with his > fine organisation, made him very gentlemanly and refined in his manners – > and he exhibited to the world the bearings of a gentleman. His business > faculties were not so strongly developed, and that will probably explain why > he, along with many other inventors, did not reap the full benefit of his > discoveries. Those who know the deceased best will most readily concur the > accuracy of this description of him ... Skinner kept regular correspondence > with artists John Manasseh and James Poole, and \\"he could quote with extreme > accuracy from almost any poet of note.\\" ==Business and employment== Skinner worked with his father as a cutler for Joseph Rodgers & Sons, 6 Norfolk Street, Sheffield. His father was brought to public notice for his painting of the flag of the Birmingham Political Union of 1832, but died before 1841. In 1845, at the age of 24 years, Skinner was still working for Rodgers. His work caught the attention of his employers, who submitted an example of his engraving to the Sheffield Independent. The newspaper described it as: > \\"A beautiful example of etching on steel, the production of a Sheffield > mechanic. It is a copy of Stothard's Vintage, and the execution holds out > great promise from its producer, Mr Thomas Skinner ... The piece possesses > some claim to novelty, as well as merit, from being much larger in size than > the generality of specimens of etching in steel, and is framed, for the > purpose of hanging in a room.\\" Before his trip to America in the 1860s, Skinner attempted to profit from his invention by leaving paid employment and going into partnership. Coulson and Branson paid him £600 for right to his invention, and they went into partnership as Skinner, Coulson and Branson, working out of Sycamore Street. \\"His habits, however, were so unbusinesslike that the partnership only lasted a few years. In 1853 he was in partnership with Samuel Coulson and Joseph Heap, as Skinner & Co. However, although a large factory company might make good profit from his mass production idea, a small partnership business was more likely to have disproportionate overheads. This is illustrated by the 1853 court case Kilner vs. Skinner and Others. Skinner would not pay the full invoice of the engraver Kilner who had been hired to engrave designs on copper, from which the paper transfers would be taken. This was because Kilner had to engrave four times more deeply than normally required, so that enough acid could be put in the grooves for the transfer. However this took \\"a great number of times\\" more work and hours needed for normal engraving, hence the greater price. Kilner was awarded most of his claim by the Court. Thus on 25 April 1857 Skinner presented himself before the Court for a certificate of bankruptcy. Skinner was working for George Westenholm and Son of Washington Works, and \\"while engaged there, an event transpired which induced him to leave suddenly for America.\\" This event may have been the bankruptcy. Skinner was probably recruited in America in 1866 by Binns & Mason, the Rochester, Pennsylvania pocketknife company which was to become the Beaver Falls Cutlery Company. It was while working there for Samuel Mason that Skinner obtained the 1867 US patent for his invention. He stayed for six years then sold the patent for the equivalent of £500 to BFCC. He returned to Sheffield by 1874 when he hired Jane Jones as a nurse for his sick wife. Thereafter, until his death in 1881, he continued to support himself from home independently by use of his etching process. ==Skinner's invention== 1910 knife blade engraved after Skinner's method Beaver Falls Cutlery works, Pennsylvania, 1867 Skinner invented a method of etching designs into steel blades and bone handles of knives, which offered a potential for mass production, because it was faster and cheaper than traditional etching techniques. By 1849 he had perfected the invention so that it could be adopted by the industry, \\"to the productions of which it [was] unquestionably a boon of magnitude. The leading features [were] its simplicity, clearness, and especially cheapness.\\" Prices quoted for decorating one item ranged from one old penny to threepence. This meant that now most steel blades could be etched upon; not just the expensive ones. The 1851 patent idea was inspired by the traditional method used for the transference of patterns to pottery, and by a system used by Woodcocks of Howard Street, Sheffield, for transferring etchings of landscapes onto ivory since 1836. However in the case of the ivory transfers, the original design on copper was created as ridges, whereas in the case of Skinner's invention, the design on the copper original was created as grooves. In 1842 makers of steel blades had also used copper originals with ridges. In that case, the inked design was transferred as a blocker to the blade, then the whole blade was immersed in acid which ate away the metal between the design-lines, leaving the blocked design-ridges proud. Therefore the method used by Skinner was different from previous usages. Skinner's UK patent of August 1851 was announced in Newton's List of patents. The guidebook to the 1851 Great Exhibition said: \\"Our readers will notice the beautiful designs on some of the steel articles, razors &c;, sent from Sheffield. The method of executing this etching and gilding on steel, is the invention of Mr. Thomas Skinner, of Sheffield\\". The article he contributed was: > \\" a waiter, of Britannia metal, electro-plated with silver. The bottom is > ornamented with a variety of scroll work which might be supposed to have > been produced by the ordinary process of engraving or etching, but has been > effected by a process which Mr Skinner describes as printing on metal ... > There is, however, a marked difference in the fine lines, from those of > ordinary engravings, the sharpness of outline being wanting. The > recommendation of the process is its cheapness. Skinner registered a patent no.72553 in Pittsburgh on 24 December 1867. This American patent is described thus: > 72,553. Thomas Skinner, Pittsburgh, Pa. Method of Forming Designs upon > Metals, Ivory, etcetera. December 24, 1867.

After removal of the acid by water the > varnish is removed by benzine. Claim. The herein-described method of > preparing the design upon the article to be operated on preparatory to the > etching process by the means of transfers, substantially as set forth. Engraved razor blade, 1880 In 1874, his UK patent for the invention of \\"improvements in the mode or process of etching on steel or iron, or other metal or substance\\" was Gazetted. A description of the process was given by Mr Branson who met Skinner around 1856. > \\"Having engraved the desired design on a small sheet of copper, he applied > the chemical ink, and secured the impression by rubbing a strip of paper > with his finger. The print was placed in position on the blade of the knife, > and rubbed with the finger. The design being now transferred, a little oil > was brushed on, and the acid applied. In a few minutes the etching was > complete. So simple and easy was the method, that he probably would do half > a gross in the hour. Having witnessed his etching, he took me to his rooms > in Eldon street, and showed me his jewelled plate. Though a stranger, he > invited me to become his partner.\\" An improved patent was announced by Skinner and Branson around 1856. It was described by The Sheffield Independent as follows: > \\"Take first a copper plate, and take first from it an impression with an ink > made by boiling linseed oil to the consistency of common treacle; the paper > used is thin, similar to that in use by the potters in transferring prints > to earthenware. When the impression is taken, it is transferred to the > article to be decorated, the ink used being of a stick(y) or glutinous > nature. A sponge and warm water are then used to crumble off the paper, when > the impression of ink will be found on the metal surface; fine resin > (powdered) is then applied to the surface through a sieve of fine gauze; the > fine particles of resin fix themselves closely to the sticky impression; in > fact, sink into it. In this state, the work is left for a few hours; by this > time the impression becomes completely saturated with the resin. A soft > brush then dusts off the powdered resin (which is very important) by a soft > rag. By this time, you have the resin sunk into and on the design, while the > surface is perfectly clean from it. In this state, hot water is poured on > the work, which melts the resin and amalgamates it with the printing ink, > which becomes a varnish sufficiently powerful to resist strong acid. The > work is then bitten in in the same method by which engravers bite in their > work. The surface being cleansed, the article is then ready for plating ... > The acids used are, of course, the secrets of the trade.\\" After Skinner's return from America, Branson met Skinner again: \\"From the founder of the Beaver Falls Cutlery Works (also a Sheffield man) I learned something of his luck in America. Being employed at these works, he induced the proprietor to purchase the invention for etching at a goodly price. It was, however, soon found out that the patent (of 1867) could not be enforced, the process being now common in the trade. Mr Skinner showed me a painting of these works, a large red brick building, unpicturesque in its angular and staring newness.\\" ==Amateur art== Thomas Skinner was an etcher, an artist and a landscape painter in oils, showing \\"considerable merit as an amateur\\". Ref 4637/118 p.36 Deaths Dec 1881 SKINNER Thomas 65 Ecclesall B 9c 213 Skinner exhibited works in Division Street and the Society of Artists' Exhibition in Sheffield. The Sheffield Daily Telegraph said, \\"Altogether his style of colour is vivid and showy; lacking the suggestiveness of mystery.\\" At 11.00 a.m. on 9 February 1882, after Skinner's death and on the day when his killer was sentenced, a sale of his effects was held at his former home in Glover Road. The crowd began to gather \\"long before\\" the start of the sale, and increased to \\"between three and four hundred\\". Female attendees made it clear that \\"The Heeley Queen had few friends amongst them,\\" and amongst them were Skinner's two sisters and Jane Jones, his former housekeeper. When Kate Dover's sentence was reported, it was \\"hailed with apparent satisfaction,\\" and \\"the greatest merriment prevailed throughout.\\" There were customers who \\"only wanted something that had been his,\\" and it so happened that just before the auction a \\"large dray\\" full of furniture from \\"outside sources\\" was added by the auctioneer. Bidders were permitted to believe that a tin pudding dish was the one used for the poisoned onion stuffing, and it realised 1s 2d and an announcement from the winning bidder that it would hang on the wall, although the real dish for poisoning was in the hands of the police. Nearly forty of Skinner's oil paintings were in the sale. The Sheffield Independent thought them \\"crudely executed\\". The paintings were: The Beaver Cutlery works, North America, A lane near Matlock Bath, Beechwood Glen, A companion picture, Mademoiselle Beatrice, The Women of the People, Landscape, Meeting in the lane, Spanish scene, Cattle in the meadow, A country lane, Windmill and cattle after Birket Foster, Scene on an American farm, Alpine loch and cattle, A log cabin, An American lake scene, A prison scene during the French Revolution, Lake scenery in America, A wood in America, A Derbyshire Toll-Bar, The flute- player, The Queen of Hearts, A Spanish beauty, A bridge at Windermere, Sheep waiting for admission at the gate, The meeting place, Beech trees and cattle, Cottage near a wood, The old farm, Scene in a Derbyshire lane, Going to market, Erin go bragh, Cottages near Southport, The drunkard's home, A country walk, Cattle at water, and Cattle and sheep. ===Oil paintings executed in America=== In 1868 Skinner painted the new works at Beaver Falls, and on 14 November of that year the Fishkill Standard reported: > \\"At Van Wagner's photogram gallery ... a fine painting of the Beaver Falls > Cutlery works ... including the adjacent landscape. It was executed by Mr > Thos. Skinner of Sheffield, England, who was commissioned by the company to > paint it. It was executed with great care and fidelity to details, and we > have no doubt is an admirable reproduction of the actual scene, having been > painted not only from careful study on the spot, but also by the assistance > of photographs. It was mainly executed in Matteawan, the past summer, the > artist being on a visit to his relatives there, Messrs John and William > Rothery. The painting, which has been photographed by Mr Van Wagner, is > valued at $500. It has already been shipped to the company, at Beaver > Falls.\\" Skinner's former business partner Branson said that he saw Skinner's landscapes in oils. His figure paintings, Charlotte Corday and The Drunkard's Return, were both highly detailed and \\"finished to the fingernail\\". He commented that \\"The Drunkard's Return has a melancholy interest in connection with Mr Skinner's later habits of life. The scene was evidently conceived in America. In the foreground around an American stove, are grouped the ragged wife and family of the sot, who, in a loathsome state of inebriation and rags, gropes his way down the steps into the miserable cellar which now forms his dwelling. ==Death== After he had courted his housekeeper Felicia Dorothea Kate Dover, known as Kate Dover, for some months, she killed him on 6 December 1881 by the use of arsenic poisoning in onion stuffing, served as part of a roast dinner. At her trial in 1882 she was sentenced to life imprisonment for manslaughter. Skinner died at 8.40 p.m. on 6 December 1881, at his home in 24 Glover Place, Sheffield. ===Burial=== Ecclesall Skinner was buried on Monday 12 December 1881 in a vault at \\"the centre of the upper portion of the churchyard\\" at All Saints Church, Ecclesall. The plot has a \\"handsome monolithic column\\" which bears the inscription, \\"In affectionate remembrance of Mellond, the beloved wife of Thomas Skinner who departed this life Nov 24th 1876 aged 56 years. Also the above Thomas Skinner who departed this life Dec 6th 1881 aged 62 years.\\" Burial records are in Sheffield Archives. On the day of the funeral a \\"large crowd\\" assembled outside Skinner's house, to see the polished oak coffin with \\"Thomas Skinner, aged 65\\" (sic) engraved on it. Two coaches containing relatives of Skinner, and Jane Jones, followed the coffin to the church, and after them walked \\"fifty or sixty persons, mostly of the fairer sex\\". The service was taken by Reverend Sandford. Most of the mourners \\"wept bitterly\\" as they proceeded from the funeral service to the burial place. \\"The clergyman uttered the closing words of the burial service in a downpour of hail and rain.\\" ===Administration of the will=== Ann Holmes, sister of Skinner and wife of asphalter Thomas Holmes, lived in \\"humble circumstances\\" in Pearl Street, Sheffield, and thought that Skinner was aged 65 instead of 62 when he died, which begs the question as to whether he and she were estranged. In December 1881, Ann was promised the house and valuables in due course by the police, and given an advance of £5 for mourning clothes and funeral arrangements. On 11 February 1882, administration of Skinner's estate of £726 10s 11d was granted to Ann. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Western Pennsylvania Numismatic Society: The Beaver Falls Cutlery Company Merchant Token Category:Culture in South Yorkshire Category:History of Yorkshire Category:1819 births Category:1881 deaths Category:People from Sheffield Category:Deaths by poisoning Category:English etchers Category:English manslaughter victims ","title":"Thomas Skinner (etcher)"},{"id":"61545303","text":"The trial of Kate Dover of February 1882, before Justice Lewis Cave, was a major event at the criminal court in Leeds Town Hall, Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. It was attended by many people, and attracted much newspaper publicity. It followed the death of Kate Dover's 61-year-old employer and lover Thomas Skinner from arsenic poisoning. Known as the Queen of Heeley for her fashionable taste in clothes, Dover was 27 years old at the time, and Skinner's housekeeper. She was convicted of manslaughter, and sentenced to penal servitude for life, which she served at Woking Female Prison. By 1901 she was out of jail and lived her remaining years with her sisters in Rotherham. ==Kate Dover, perpetrator== alt=street with buildings and trees Kate Dover (Sheffield, 1855 – Rotherham, 26 March 1925) was the daughter of a woodcarver. She lived with her family at 4 Thirwell Terrace, Heeley, Sheffield, in the West Riding of Yorkshire. According to The Scotsman and The Sheffield Independent, Dover was known as the Queen of Heeley due to her use of make-up and fashionable clothes. She became a housekeeper to Thomas Skinner of 24 Glover Place, Sheffield, who was also her \\"sweetheart\\". ==Thomas Skinner, victim== Thomas Skinner (Sheffield, 16 June 1819 – Sheffield, 6 December 1881) was an etcher, inventor and amateur oil-painter. When he met the 26-year-old Kate Dover in 1880 he was a widower aged 60 years, a drunkard, and fairly well-to-do as a result of the income from his invention which related to etching on steel blades. ==Events== ===Background=== A previous employee of the victim played a major part in the events surrounding the crime. She was Mrs Jane Jones, who before her marriage was briefly a shop assistant at Cole Brothers, Fargate, then entered service as Skinner's wife Mellond's nurse in 1874, becoming his housekeeper in 1876 when Mellond died. Jane married William Jones in February 1878 and he moved into Glover Place with her and Skinner. That situation continued until 1880. Skinner had taught Jane his trade, and she \\"assisted him considerably\\" in his work. \\"So proficient had this woman become that there was a kind of partnership between Mr and Mrs Jones and (Skinner) with regard to the household expenses; they shared the profits.\\" In total, by spring 1880 Jane Jones had been Skinner's housekeeper \\"for nearly three years.\\" In 1880, Dover \\"kept a confectioner's shop\\", also described as a spice shop, in London Road, Sheffield, and Skinner was still living at 24 Glover Place. Dover and Skinner met at the sweet shop in April 1880, she asked to see his paintings, and they began to visit each other. In response, Jane Jones and her husband left Skinner's house in September of the same year because they \\"objected to the conduct\\" of Dover. \\"From what was observed by Mr Jones, and Mr Jones also, Mr Jones did not think it advisable his wife should stay longer in the deceased's house.\\" Later, Ada Wheatley gave an example of this behaviour, which she observed on the day when the onions were delivered: \\"Kate Dover was sitting on Mr Skinner's knee, and he said to (Dover), Lay down, love, and let us have a nap.\\" Roasan Biggins, a niece of Skinner, took over as housekeeper for six weeks, then Dover took over her position. By that point, Skinner was already courting Dover \\"with a view to marrying her.\\" The neighbour Elizabeth Guest at number 25 said that Skinner gave Dover ten shillings per week as household expenses, but expected a daily quart of beer and quart of milk out of this money, so that the limited funds forced Dover to pawn Skinner's belongings, such as \\"his tea service and suit of black clothes.\\" Unlike Jones, Dover did not live with Skinner, but returned \\"home to Heeley at night.\\" The 1881 Census shows Skinner living alone. Ref 4637/118 p.36 Although the relationship between Skinner and Dover was initially \\"amicable\\", by June 1881 it had deteriorated into \\"quarrels\\", \\"bickerings\\" and \\"many complaints\\" from Skinner that Dover had \\"been in the habit of taking his property out of the house and pawning it. The best tea service, he said, had gone, his best suit of clothes had been pawned, and the quarrels continued up to that time with aggravation.\\" Once, Skinner \\"resorted with actual violence\\" towards Dover. This state of affairs continued through November and early December 1881. The last two major quarrels were witnessed by the neighbour Elizabeth Guest, who said that Skinner was angry about the pawning of his property, and used \\"very bad language\\" to Dover, \\"who, after being reviled, threw her arms round his neck and pleaded for forgiveness.\\" Nevertheless, Dover said later that they had spoken of marriage. Elizabeth Guest said that Dover had spoken of marriage with Skinner, and Kate Dover's mother Catharine Dover later confirmed that the couple were engaged. Skinner would say sometimes that he had made a will in favour of Jane Jones, but suggested that he would change it in favour of Kate Dover. In early November, Dover was looking for a house of her own, and complaining about Skinner's behaviour regarding money. On 18 November 1881 Dover accidentally dropped a cheque which had been tampered with. The cheque was picked up by a bystander and later handed to the police. ===Purchase of poison=== On 2 December 1881 Jane Jones received a gift of produce including onions and potatoes, \\"from her husband's brother in Bedfordshire\\". On the same day she and her husband ate some of the produce, and forwarded the remainder, including \\"fifteen potatoes, four large onions and some apples\\" to Thomas Skinner. Ada Wheatley delivered the vegetables. On receipt, Skinner said, \\"These are extra to what we get here\\", but Dover said \\"Humph\\", and \\"pitched the onions down the cellar steps\\". On the same day, Dover asked the chemist J.J. Redding for prussic acid on sugar to kill a cat, but he refused because cats do not eat sugar. On 5 December, Skinner was in good health, working, \\"eating heartily\\" and \\"calling for his beer\\". At the same time, Dover was declaring him \\"very ill indeed; and she intimated a suspicion that he might die\\". At 7 pm Skinner visited the Mason's Arms at Norton Woodseats, known then and now as the Big Tree Inn, leaving Dover at his house. However at 7:30 pm Dover went to Mr Hewitt the chemist on Abbeydale Road, Sheffield, asking for an ounce of arsenic. She brought with her as a witness the butcher William Wood of London Road, Heeley, telling him two untruths: that their acquaintance Mr Marshall or Maxwell had previously acted at her witness (Marshall or Maxwell denied that subsequently), and that she was purchasing arsenic for colouring wax flowers (it was confirmed at the trial that arsenic on its own is not a colourant and that there were no wax flowers in the house). John William Arding the assistant sold her one-ounce avoirdupois of arsenic in powder form, in a \\"peculiar shaped packet, labelled poison in black letters upon a red ground, so that it could not easily be mistaken\\". As Dover left the chemist's shop, she declared, \\"Now I have got it I will take the lot\\". She then joined Skinner at the Big Tree Inn, where she and Skinner were \\"quite friendly\\" enough to be regarded as lovers, he offered to buy her a pony, and the couple left together at a quarter to nine. The inn was \\"a favourite resort of 'courters' ...the pair were \\"freely known as the 'Heeley Queen and her old sweetheart'\\". A different story was told by Kate Dover's mother Catharine at the inquest. She said that her daughter had \\"bought the poison at Mr Skinner's request, and that he told her to say it was for artificial flowers or anything, that her daughter gave it to Mr Skinner that evening...that Mr Skinner put it in his waistcoat pocket, and...she had never clapped eyes on it again\\". Catharine's supposition was that Skinner had accidentally mixed the arsenic with his etching chemicals, and these chemicals had accidentally mixed with the food in the kitchen. This story did not make it to the Leeds Assizes in 1882. On 6 December, Dover told another witness, Mr Taylor, that \\"Mr Skinner was very ill and she feared he would die\\". However, when the servant Emma Bolsover brought back a fowl which Dover had sent her to collect at 10 am, she heard Skinner call out three times for his dinner, showing no sign of illness. File:Streets of Sheffield (9).JPGalt=Two-storey building with shops on lower storeyThe former pharmacy where Kate Dover bought the arsenic File:The Big Tree - Chesterfield Road 02-06-05.jpgalt=Two-storey brick buildingThe Big Tree pub where Kate Dover and Thomas Skinner had a friendly drink, the night before his death ===Poisoning=== Thomas Skinner was killed on 6 December 1881. On that morning, Dover told Taylor that Skinner \\"was very ill, and always dozing and sleepy, and said she believed he would die\\", when in truth he \\"appeared to have been in his usual state of health\\". Dover \\"was the one that made the dinner and attended to it in all respects\\". Although Dover had prepared a roast chicken, she made goose stuffing with herbs, bread and onions, not chicken stuffing of forcemeat or sausage meat as was usual in the Victorian era. Moreover, she split the stuffing into two portions, cooking one portion inside the chicken, and one in a separate tin. Dinner consisting of stuffed chicken and Yorkshire pudding was served around midday, but the servant Emma Bolsover ate a lamb chop separately in the kitchen and did not join Dover and Skinner for the meal. Skinner called out for his meal, saying that \\"he did not know when he felt so hungry as he did then\\", however he had to wait another half-hour for his meal. Skinner's plate was piled with stuffing but Dover's was much less so. Five minutes after beginning the meal, Dover declared herself ill. Skinner immediately said, \\"I feel bad too...My God, she has done for us both this time,\\" referring to Jane Jones who had sent the onions. He then \\"vomited, very considerably\\", and \\"seemed to be suffering very much\\". Dover \\"seemed to have got frightened, (possibly) at the results of administering the poison, and was trying to remedy what she had done\\". Emma was sent to purchase tincture of lobelia, which can be used somewhat unsafely as an emetic at high doses. Dover could not wait until Bolsover's return, panicked, and followed her by tram. After they returned, Dover sent Bolsover to fetch Catharine Dover, who arrived surprised to find Skinner so ill. Meanwhile, Dover said she felt sick, and appeared to heave, but did not vomit at all until the doctor administered an emetic later. Dover \\"seemed to have been alarmed, and did what she could to render assistance\\". When the surgeon and forensic scientist James Wallin Harrison arrived at 2.30 pm, Skinner was \\"vomiting very seriously and heavily\\" and Dover said, \\"We have both been poisoned; it is that woman who has done us both.\\" Harrison saw that Skinner was dying of arsenic poisoning, gave what care he could, and searched for the source of the poison. The vomit from Skinner which was in the scullery sink, vomit from Dover as a result of the emetic, besides the remains of the chicken, the stuffing, some excreta and some wine, were therefore respectively bottled for tests and analysis. Harrison left at 4:00 pm and returned in the evening, when \\"he found Skinner's skin cold and clammy, his countenance pinched, his hands and feet benumbed, and symptoms of collapse\\", while Dover showed no poisoning symptoms. Harrison stayed with Skinner until he died at 8:40 pm. Dover said that just before Skinner died he requested that some papers be burned, although the doctor and inspector had witnessed that he did not. While the doctor and inspector were in the scullery with the dying Skinner, Dover was seen by Skinner's neighbour Elizabeth \\"Sissie\\" Guest fetching papers from upstairs, including a large blue or white paper, and burning them in the kitchen fire. She was also seen handing a paper containing powder to her mother, telling Catharine to hide it under her skirt in case Kate were searched by police. Before burning the papers, \\"(Dover's) conduct had been very excited, but it then changed completely. It was quite calm.\\" Dover afterwards told Inspector Bradbury of the police that she had not burned any. She also denied that there had been arsenic in her possession or in the house, and thereafter she maintained that story. She even asked to be searched before leaving the house, but Bradbury refused. Inspectors Bradbury and Womack found no Will for Skinner, although Dover told Skinner that there was a Will, that she did not know its whereabouts, and that Skinner had planned to alter it. Womack found no arsenic in the house, and arsenic was not used in Skinner's etching process. Only Dover had prepared dinner that day. According to Jane Jones, she and her husband had eaten the same batch of vegetables with no ill effect, Jane bore no ill will towards Dover, and had not threatened to \\"do for them both\\". By tea time, both of Dover's parents were in the house. Everyone left the house together at 11 pm, Dover taking Skinner's cat and bird with her. After the death, household linen and American bonds went missing, although Skinner's cash book remained, and Inspector Womack had found fourteen sovereigns and a diamond ring in Skinner's bedroom on the day of his death. Other items found in the house were love letters between Dover and an unknown elderly man named \\"Emerson\\" hidden in a picture frame, and \\"applications for loans made by Mrs Dover to various persons\\". ===Post mortem and inquest=== At the post mortem by the surgeon Harrison on 8 December 1881, examination of the body brought a conclusion of \\"metallic irritant poisoning\\". Alfred H. Allen, Sheffield's public analyst, examined Skinner's entrails and the jars of samples held by the police on 10 December. The chicken and its inner stuffing were clear of arsenic, but the stuffing cooked separately in a tin was \\"loaded with arsenic\\", sufficiently to kill. He calculated that there were eight grains of arsenic \\"in the whole stomach\\", and a \\"considerable quantity of arsenic\\" in one sample of stuffing. He found little or no arsenic in the rest of the food and in one sample of vomit. Allen later said that \\"two grains of arsenic would be a fatal dose. There were 437.5 grains in an ounce\\". At the inquest of 18 December it was confirmed that Skinner's body was \\"without disease\\". The lining of the stomach was congested, and there were \\"large ulcerations, indicative of poisoning\\". Skinner's death was \\"consistent with poisoning by arsenic\\". Kate Dover was arrested on 18 December at Highfield Police Station, then held at the central police offices at Sheffield. The inquest into the death of Skinner was opened at the Royal Hotel (later called the Victoria Inn) at the convergence of London Road and Abbeydale Road, Sheffield, on 9 December 1881, and reopened at 1.00 pm on 18 December 1881. Kate's mother Catharine gave evidence \\"full of contradictions to other witnesses\\" in place of her daughter who was ill. She spoke of the affection between Kate Dover and Skinner, Kate's need to use make-up to hide her pallid complexion, and the innocent purposes for which Kate obtained various poisons. The coroner published more than thirty love notes between Dover and an old man of 85 years. These had been found hidden in a picture frame at Skinner's house. The letters make clear that Skinner knew about and did not object to meetings between Dover and the old man \\"Emerson\\" or \\"E.M.\\", who regularly gave her money for clothes. The jury decided twelve to three that Dover had administered the poison to Skinner. The coroner recorded that Dover \\"wilfully and of malice aforethought did kill and murder the said Thomas Skinner\\". ===Remand of Kate Dover=== Between 6 and 16 December 1881, Dover was kept at home, in a state of \\"extreme exhaustion\\", in Thirlwell Terrace under police supervision, ill, unable to go out, denying the crime, nursed by Emma Bolsover and under the care of the surgeon Harrison. On Friday 23 December 1881, Dover was formally charged with wilful murder by the Stipendiary at Sheffield police court in Sheffield Old Town Hall and committed to Leeds Assizes. When charged, \\"she replied, in a faint, husky voice, I am not guilty.\\" In that Stipendiary session was W.E. Clegg, of W.F. Clegg & Sons, for the prosecution; it was Clegg whom Dover had named as the drawer-up of Skinner's missing Will, although the Court did not raise that point. Dover \\"appeared extremely weak, and it was with some difficulty that she was brought from her cell\\". She was defended by A.M. Wilson, of Binney, Sons & Wilson. It was accepted that the motive for the crime was unknown, however a promissory note for £8 10s from Dover's father to Skinner was found among Skinner's effects. It was later found that it was Skinner who had insisted on paying a printer's bill for Charles Dover's book of poetry, so that Charles Dover had responded with the promissory note; and Kate Dover was not involved in the transaction. Following the committal she was removed to Wakefield prison, where she spent time writing letters and drawing flowers to send home. She was allowed to wear her own clothes instead of \\"prison garb\\", and was said to be \\"sanguine that her innocence would be established\\". Her prisoner number was 3288. On 30 January she was removed to Armley Gaol to await her trial.

They showed a skilled use of language, and contained poems, quotations, exhortations for confidence in her innocence and hope for her imminent freedom. On 7 January 1882, the Sheffield Daily Telegraph published a letter of 31 December 1881 from Dover at Wakefield Prison to her family, showing optimism, encouragement for her family and again an unexpected linguistic facility. For example: \\"There is one thing I am certain, and that is if I am to be blessed with freedom God will let the tiny flowers that nestle in the grass kiss these Wakefield feet as though they had never been there.\\" The letter mentions a good relationship with both parents and other relatives, and asks them to feed her pets: \\"my squirrel, my tortoise, my Jack, my pussies and my birds.\\" This was preceded on 3 January by another published letter, referring to her membership of the Good Templar lodge of which she was a member. They had prayed for her at midnight on New Year's Eve, and she wrote that at the same moment \\"there seemed to be a ray of light, like the rising of the sun that got brighter and brighter, till the gas, which is always burning in my cell at night, was lost in that other light.\\" ===Trial=== Lewis William Cave JP On 31 January, Dover was removed from Wakefield Prison to Leeds, ready for her trial at the Leeds Assizes. Her mother Catharine Dover was permitted to accompany her and give her food, and on the next morning Dover had an interview with her solicitor A. Muir Wilson. She \\"presented him with half a sheet of notepaper upon which she had with no unskilful hand drawn in pencil a bunch of exotic flowers.\\" The trial took place on Monday 6 and Tuesday 7 February 1882 at Leeds Assizes, in the Criminal Court room of Leeds Town Hall. On the Monday, Dover was indicted before Justice Lewis Cave for wilful murder, and pleaded not guilty. The judge was \\"burly in person and bluff in manner, and looked, as he was, the very incarnation of sound commonsense.\\" The Liverpool Daily Post described the scene: > The case had created the greatest possible public interest, and the court > was densely crowded, admission being obtained by ticket. Indeed, never since > the trial of Charles Peace has the public excitement been so intense, > hundreds of people being unable to obtain admission. Ladies mustered in > unusually strong force. The prisoner, upon being placed in the dock, walked > very slowly, and appeared to feel acutely her terrible position. She sobbed > violently, and pleaded not guilty in a feeble voice. Dover was \\"deeply agitated and sad\\", and \\"closely veiled\\". Mr Waddy QC and Mr Barker spoke on behalf of the prosecution, and Mr Lockwood and Mr Stuart Wortley for the defence. On the Monday, Barker declared to the jury that the evidence showed that Dover did indeed knowingly poison Skinner, but there was no evidence as to her motive. The Sheffield Daily Telegraph described the scene at Leeds as follows: > This morning the court is as crowded as ever, the ladies' gallery being > again filled by females of all ages, the majority of them as unlovely as > ever, and all armed with sandwich baskets and satchels, prepared to wait > till his Lordship rises. Again there are several hundreds of disappointed > ones, who try to beguile the policemen into opening the door that they may > go in. The officers, however, are hard of heart. They set their faces as > flint against the fair suitors, promising that as soon as anybody comes out > somebody will be permitted to enter ... Down below in the court there is a > crowd of barristers, twirling their thumbs, reading the newspapers, writing > letters, and generally industrious in other ways, particularly in making > sketches, which the prisoner in the dock could have excelled with a few > quick touches of her pencil. They occupy most valuable seats, which would be > gladly filled by the Press, who, perched away in the ladies' gallery like > the bird who sits up aloft, strain their ears to hear what counsel asks and > what witnesses answer ... Kate Dover ... still appears feeble and ill. She > is attired in black with sealskin jacket and black hat ... but soon after > the proceedings are resumed she raises her veil, and everybody is able to > see her features, which certainly do not form a heavy, unintellectual > countenance, but the very opposite.\\" Leeds Town Hall 27 July 2019 (17).JPGOne of the cells where Dover slept during the trial Leeds Town Hall 27 July 2019 (16).JPGSteps from the cells to the courtroom Leeds Town Hall 27 July 2019 (9).JPGSteps up to dock rail Leeds Town Hall 27 July 2019 (6).JPGIntimidating view of judge's chair from dock Lockwood, counsel for the defence, began his speech at 11:10 am by saying that \\"if she has taken the life of her master ... for that she must surely die.\\" Now, just before Lockwood began his speech, her solicitor spoke to Dover, she averted her face and covered it with a handkerchief. She turned to face the jury, and there was a \\"great hush in court\\". Thereafter she appeared \\"greatly agitated\\". The Sheffield Daily Telegraph continues: \\"As Mr Lockwood gravely impresses on the jury that his client is there with her life trembling in the balance, her emotion is intense. From the gallery we can hear her sobbing, we can see her frame quivering, and her whole body rocking to and fro till she seems as if she would roll from her chair ... Several times her hand falls from her face, and it is evidently only by a supreme effort she prevents herself from fainting.\\" Lockwood spoke of the lovers' quarrels, reconciliations, words of love and talk of marriage. He said that \\"his hypothesis was that the prisoner had no intention of taking the artist's life. If she perpetrated the act at all, it was a mischievous act perpetrated not for the purpose of killing him, but for the reason only to suggest to his mind that Mrs Jones was unfriendly to him, and the reason for the act might have been suggested when the apples and onions came from Mrs Jones.\\" He said that Dover's behaviour and manner of poisoning showed no \\"skilful hand\\" or calculation. He said, moreover, that Dover's panic for the lobelia emetic and the doctor's assistance showed innocence of intent to kill. Lockwood's speech was \\"not only eloquent, but so pathetic that many of the spectators found themselves, in a half-surreptitious, shame-faced way, wiping the tears from their eyes. Again the Sheffield newspaper describes Dover's reaction: \\"The prisoner's agitation increases at every sentence Mr Lockwood utters. She sobs bitterly, sways herself to and fro, and seems utterly lost in agony. Does the line of defence overwhelm her? It certainly offers her no hope or comfort, and seems to deepen the despair which has sat upon her all this morning.\\" When the arsenic is mentioned, \\"the prisoner is again terribly affected – leaning forward, holding her head in her hands, swaying her body to and fro, and sobbing violently.\\" Lockwood had spoken for nearly two hours. Justice Cave's summing up took one hour. He gave the jury the following choice: > If they adopted the theory of the prosecution that she put the arsenic into > the stuffing, and that she did it with the intention to kill him, then > undoubtedly she would be guilty of murder. If they adopted the suggestion of > the counsel for the defence that she put arsenic into the stuffing and did > it only to cause some unpleasant symptoms and not with the intention of > taking his life, and that the loss of his life was beyond her intention, > that would not be murder, but manslaughter, and it would be their duty to > find the verdict of manslaughter. If they did not think either of these > theories were proper ones, or if the arsenic got there accidentally ... they > must acquit her.\\" The Sheffield Daily Telegraph said that, \\"his closing words ... evidently caused the prisoner great agony, as she was again sobbing violently, and rocking her body to and fro as in serious pain.\\" \\"The prisoner, who lifted her veil as she went, with tottering steps, from the dock, was exceedingly pale, and there were many traces of tears on her ashen face. After two hours of deliberation by the jury, Dover returned to the dock \\"with painful step and slow. Her veil is raised, and though she walks with downcast head, we see she is very pale, and looks the image of despair. Who shall tell the agony which has been crowded into nearly two hours of waiting for the verdict? Now, as she stands with drooping head and twitching hands in the centre of the dock, she appears as if she had prematurely aged during the brief period she has been down below ... the prisoner appears as if she would totter from her feet.\\" \\"She clasped the rail in front, and with bowed head waited for the words that might rudely cut short her life, or give her liberty.\\" To the surprise of the court which expected either a hanging or an acquittal, Dover was found guilty of manslaughter. Justice Cave said: > Kate Dover, the jury adopted a view which was presented to them by your > learned counsel, and they found you guilty of manslaughter; but the > circumstances of your offence are so grave and so atrocious that they are > separated but by a very thin line from the offence of murder. In such > circumstances I must pass upon you the heaviest sentence in my power, and > that is that you be kept in penal servitude for the term of your natural > life.\\" \\"Not a sound escapes the prisoner's lips. Her head falls on her shoulders ... Without once raising her head to meet the hundreds of hungry eyes which are watching her every pang, Kate Dover turns from the railings and with melancholy gait and pitiful face passes down the steps and into the cells ... The crowd of females rustled out of Court, which is slow and noisy work. They have seen their unfortunate fellow-creature drain her bitter cup to the dregs, and they hurry home now to boast, no doubt, that they were present at the memorable trial of Kate Dover for murdering her master.\\" Catharine Dover was permitted to speak with her daughter after the verdict. She reported Dover \\"in good spirits\\" but said that she blamed those who testified against her, rather than the process of law. Kate would bear her sentence with fortitude, looking forward to seeing her friends and relatives \\"when she came out ... Conscious of her innocence, she felt entirely unmoved by her conviction ... While in Wakefield she had made all love her ... and such she felt confident would be her case when she was in the new prison to which she might be sent.\\" Kate Dover was sentenced on Wednesday 8 February, entering the dock \\"with slow step\\" and staggering to the rail to support herself by it with both hands, seeming hardly conscious of the proceedings. She did not reply to the sentence. Cave called her offence \\"atrocious\\" and sentenced her to penal servitude for life. Dover promptly fell \\"all of a heap\\" and was carried away to the cells.

On 21 February 1882 she was still at Wakefield, and expecting to be sent to Pentonville. However, by 1891, at age 36, Dover was a convict at Woking Female Prison at Knaphill, Woking, Surrey, listing her former profession as domestic housekeeper. Woking was the \\"first purpose-built female prison\\", opened in 1869 and closed in 1895 when the inmates were transferred to Aylesbury female prison which had been converted for women in the same year. At Woking, women could work in prison kitchens or the laundry. Some were paid to do tailoring, sewing or knitting. Woking had a mosaics department where the women broke up marble for mosaic flooring for installation at St Paul's Cathedral, the South Kensington museums and elsewhere. In 1895 a petition to the Home Secretary – permitted after 15 years' servitude – was raised by the 1882 trial's counsels for her defence and the prosecution, for Dover's release from prison. However the Home Secretary declined the request. By 1901 Dover was out of prison, so she had probably served between thirteen and nineteen years. ==Aftermath== Mrs Jane Jones (1853– Ecclesall 1883), Skinner's former housekeeper, died at Ecclesall Workhouse infirmary on 20 May 1883, Deaths Jun 1883 Jones Jane 30 Ecclesall B. 9c 225 citing injuries caused when her estranged husband William kicked and struck her on 12 May – although he denied it. Jane had married William Jones in February 1878, and, before the association of Skinner and Dover, had been living with Jones at Skinner's house. At the inquest at Sheffield on 21 May 1883, it was decided that because Jane Jones had separated from her husband since Skinner's death, had subsequently led a \\"most abandoned life\\", and had then died suddenly from a \\"congestion of the lungs\\", there was no necessity for a post mortem, and a verdict of \\"death from natural causes\\" would be returned. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * True Crime Library: True Crime August 1995.

The mother moved the family to Store Købmagergade in 1858. He left the company in 1862 and started to take lessons in Latin and Herman with the ambition of later studying law. At the outbreak of the Second Schleswig War in 1974, he immediately enrolled as a volunteer and was severely wounded in the Battle of Lundby on 3 July. After the war he returned to his uncle's company where he worked as a traveling salesman in the provinces. In 1866 he pursued an old dream by moving to England but had difficulties finding work in both Hull. Manchester and London. He did eventually manage to get work as a salesman for a spinning mill and a rubber factory but returned to Copenhagen in January 1867. ==Career== In September 1868, Petersen was granted licensed as a merchant in Copenhagen and established a trading house under his own name in Nygade. It traded in a wide range of products with the textile in industry. The company moved to new premises on Købmagergade in 1868 and relocated to the old vajsenhus Building on the same street (No. 44) in 1875. His company purchased the entire complex in 1888. It was subsequently adapted and expanded several times, most notably in 1889-90 and 1906-07. Holger Petersen's Textile Factory on Tagensvej In 1878, Petersen and his brother John established a textile factory in Store Kongensgade. The factory relocated to larger premises on Tagensvej in 1883. The Tagensvej factory was later expanded several times. The activities comprised woolen textiles, ribbons and buttons. The factory was established as a separate company but was after Holger Petersen's death, om 1917, acquired by his trading house. The company established a subsidiary in Stockholm in 1889 and opened a factory in Malmö in 1893. The Maæmó factory was in 1994 turned into a separate company under the name Fabriksaktiebolaget Skandinavien. ==Other activities== ===Politics and organisations=== Petersen represented Højre in Landstinget from 1909 and was a member of the Defence Commission of 1902. He was a co-founder of Foreningen af danske manufaktur-grossister and was for many years president of the organisation. He was in 1904-17 a member of Grosserer-Societetet's committee. ===Danish interests in North Schleswig=== Petersen was from 1889 strongly involved for promotion of Danish culture in Sønderjylland, collaborating with H.P. Hanssen and members of Rradikale Studentersamfundsmænd such as H.V. Clausen and Niels Hjort. He contributed actively to realizing Clausen's Association of 5 Octoberm a secret credit institution which contributed to keeping North Schlesvig land on Danish hands against the explicit policy of the Prussian government. ===Danish West Indies=== Petersen was also involved in the efforts to revive the economy of the Danish West Indies but with little success. He was a co-founder of Dansk vestindisk plantageselskab in 1900. In July 1900, the company bought the plantations Castle Cockley, Pearl and Cassavagarden on Saint Croix. In 1902, he became a board member of the plantation company Dansk Vestindien. In 1903, he was part of a delegation which traveled to the Danish West Indies and purchased a number of new plantations on the three islands. He visited the islands again in 1905 and again in 1910-11 to inspect the results of the new initiatives. In 1909, Holger Petersen provided most of the necessary capital when A/S Vestindisk sukkerfabrik acquired Jacob Lachmann's sugar refinery on Saint Croix and was himself appointed as chairman of the board. Petersen began to sell his activities in the Danish West Indies when the discussion about a possible sale of the islands to the US was revived and it became obvious that a sale was unavoidable ===Jutland=== Petersen was a co-founder of Plantningsselskabet Staushede in 1880. In 1891, he planted the more than 500 ha large Baldersbæk plantation. In 1895, Petersen purchased Hølund in a partnership with Christian Dalgas. On a journey to the area in 1892, he also convinced other wealthy businessmen to invest in plantations. He became a board member of Hedeselskabet in 1907 and was its vice chairman from 1910. ==Philanthropy== Holger Petersen was deeply involved in work for improving the education of merchants in Denmark. He was active in the Association for the Education of Toung Merchants (Foreningen til unge handelsmænds uddannelse). In 1895, he was a co-founder of Dansk Exportforening. He was also a board member of Danish East Asiatic Company from its foundation in 1897 and served as chairman from 1910. ==Personal life and legacy== Holger Petersen married Augusta van Aller (13 May 1847 - 29 October 1878), a daughter of Dutch consul in Helsingør Peter Rist van Aller (1800–85) and Elisabeth Birgitte Johanne Hoppe (1806–85)m on 25.4. 1872. Their only child, a son, died in 1895. After that Petersen made his two cousins, Andreas (1850-1937) and Peter Johan Ditlev (1857-1923), partners in the company. He established Holger Petersen's Foundation with in initial capital of DKK 7 million by testament of 2 December 1919. Petersen died on 26 May 1917 and was buried in Assistens Cemetery in Copenhagen. ==See also== * Holger Laage-Petersen == References == ==External links== * Spurce Category:19th-century Danish businesspeople Category:20th- century Danish businesspeople Category:Danish textile industry businesspeople Category:Businesspeople from Copenhagen Category:People from Vejle Municipality Category:Burials at Assistens Cemetery (Copenhagen) Category:1843 births Category:1917 deaths ","title":"Holger Petersen (1843–1917)"},{"id":"61545427","text":"Bjørn Thomas Åhrén (born February 4, 1966 in Strömsund, Sweden) is a Sámi- Norwegian politician.

Mikva and her two sisters were raised in the neighborhood of Hyde Park on the South Side of Chicago, and attended public schools. She earned her Bachelor of Arts in theater at Beloit College in 1974, working after graduation as a paralegal at the law firm Jenner & Block. She then attended Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law, graduating cum laude and Order of the Coif in 1980. Following graduation, she served as law clerk to Judge Prentice Marshall of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, and then to Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., of the United States Supreme Court. After her clerkships, Mikva practiced law in Chicago as a partner at Abrahamson Vorachek & Mikva and Seliger & Mikva, specializing in civil rights and employment law, and in criminal defense with Patrick A. Tuite & Associates. In November 2004, Mikva was elected judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County, where she served until her appointment to the appellate court in 2016. On the trial bench, she served in the Chancery Division where she assisted in judicial education. In 2016, Mikva was appointed by the Illinois Supreme Court to the Illinois Appellate Court to fill the vacancy created by the death of Justice Laura Liu. Notable decisions In December 2018, Mikva authored an opinion of the First District Court of Appeals upholding the trial court's refusal to require the Chicago Board of Education to produce records concerning complaints relating to security or police in possession of the Chicago Public Schools. The task would be too time consuming, the court reasoned. In June 2014, Mikva ruled in the case of Clark v. ISBE (14 CH 7356) that proposals for Illinois legislators’ term limits and political redistricting were both unconstitutional. In September 2011, in ACLU v Illinois State Police (10 CH 40840), a lawsuit over disclosure of documents under the Freedom of Information Act, Mikva decided the Illinois State Police must turn over a memorandum of understanding with the United States National Guard, but that other requested documents could properly remain confidential. == Personal life == Mikva is married to Steven H. Cohen, an attorney, and they have two daughters. They met while undergraduates at Beloit College. Her sister, Laurie I.

The design and structural engineering for the tower was completed by the Institute for Computational Design and Construction (ICD) and the Institute of Building Structures and Structural Design (ITKE), at the University of Stuttgart in collaboration with the Wood Materials Science Group at ETH Zurich and the construction company Blumer-Lehmann AG in Gossau. The tower is open to the public and is directly accessible by foot or bike. The tower is constructed from 12 curved cross-laminated timber building components produced using an experimental self-shaping manufacturing process. This process was invented in 2018 by researchers at the University of Stuttgart and Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology. The self-shaping or self- bending of the wood is enabled by the smart assembly of flat, bi-layered plates where one layer is designed to intentionally shrink or swell with changing moisture but is restricted by the other layer while paralele fiber orientation. This results in extensive \\"self\\" shaping analogous to the Bimetallic strip. The shaping can be controlled based on the composition of the bilayer. The high curvature of the tower is unique for wood construction. It is used to enhance structural performance and to create a unique interior space with convex curvature despite the concave and sharp edges of the exterior. The structure has the appearance of a double curved geometry but is actually made from an arrangement of single curved cylindrical parts. The building is protected by a larch wood facade coated with a titanium oxide surface treatment that protects the wood from ultraviolet light. Rather than darkening, this will cause the surface to turn a lighter whitish color over time. == References == Category:Buildings and structures in Baden-Württemberg ","title":"Urbach Tower"},{"id":"61545615","text":"Jamie Hamilton (born 1 March 2002) is a Scottish professional footballer who plays for Hamilton Academical, as a defender. ==Club career== In November 2019 he signed a new contract with Hamilton, until summer 2022. ==International career== He has represented Scotland at under-16, under-17 and under-18 youth levels.

It was built in 1880–81 and closed in 1992, with the building now under private ownership. ==History== Independent worship in Upwey began around the beginning of the 19th century, when Rev. B. Cracknell, a minister at Weymouth, was granted a license to use his own residence in Upwey to hold services. This was followed in c. 1807 by another resident of the village, Mr. George Wood, who transformed a room in one of his cottages for Thursday evening services, which were conducted by ministers of Weymouth. The success of these services and the need for larger accommodation led Mr. Wood to erect Upwey's first independent chapel on his own land and at his own expense. It was built in 1809–10 and opened on 13 December 1810 by Rev. R. Keynes of Blandford Forum. Ministers from surrounding neighbourhoods preached at Upwey, with Mr. Wood taking responsibility for reading sermons on occasions when no minister was available. The first pastor of Upwey, Rev. James Le Couteur, was ordained on 2 May 1838. The chapel was enlarged during the pastorate of Rev. Joseph Price (1870-74). In 1875, Rev. John Shadrack Butcher became pastor of Upwey. Owing to the need for greater accommodation than the existing chapel could afford, Shadrack began efforts to have a replacement constructed. A plot of land was purchased for £145 and plans drawn up by Mr. Robert C. Bennett of Weymouth. The building contract was awarded to Mr. John Patten of Portland and construction work began before the ceremony was held for the laying of a memorial stone on 16 June 1880 by Mr. J. J. Norton, Sheriff of Poole. The church cost £1,490 and was opened for its first service on 18 May 1881, with Rev. Dr. J. G. Rogers of Clapham preaching. The original chapel was sold to Sir Richard Howard for £190. A manse was built on land adjoining the new church in 1892. The cost of the land was £120 and the manse £515. With a drop in congregation numbers, the church was faced with the threat of closure in the 1950s, however this was avoided when it formed a partnership with the congregational church at Radipole in the mid-1950s and when Rev. W. Charles Stacey took the Upwey pastorship in 1958. The church was later renamed Upwey United Reformed Church in 1972 and the manse sold the same year. The church suffered storm damage in February 1990 but was subsequently repaired through voluntary effort by June of that year. In July 1992, the last service was held and the church was then sold to a private owner. ==Architecture== The church is built in the Decorated style and designed to accommodate 300 persons. It was built to contain a nave, two transepts, apse, porch and two vestries. An intended schoolroom was not built as part of the original work due to funding limitations, but constructed in the early 20th century. Many of the church's fittings and decorations were made from varnished pitch pine. Mrs. Samson, the daughter of Mr. Wood, gifted the chapel with a stained glass window in memory of her parents. ==References== Category:Churches in Dorset Category:1881 establishments in England Category:Redundant churches Category:Former churches in Dorset Category:United Reformed churches in England ","title":"United Reformed Church, Upwey"},{"id":"61545844","text":"The 2019 Cincinnati Bearcats men's soccer team represented the University of Cincinnati during the 2019 NCAA Division I men's soccer season and the 2019 American Athletic Conference men's soccer season.

Between 1891 and 1912 he animated 7 local and short-lived Valencian periodicals. In the mid-1890s he was briefly catapulted to celebrity status when he was trialed for asserting that the regent Maria Christina was leading the Spanish freemasonry. Politically Corbató initially sided with Carlism and was its vehement propagandist. In the 20th century he developed his own political doctrine: Traditionalism formulated in highly providentialist and millenarian terms. In historiography his political trajectory is considered typical for some disintegration patterns within Carlism; Corbató himself is viewed as representative of a heterodox breed of españolismo. ==Family and youth== Benlloc, present view Corbató's ancestors were probably farmers; at some point one of their representatives managed to access lower professional strata.Javier Esteve Martí, La política antiliberal en España bajo el signo del nacionalismo: el padre Corbató y Polo y Peyrolón [PhD thesis Universitat de València], Valencia 2017, p. 20 His father, José Corbató Cardá, was related to the Levantine town of Benlloc, where in the mid-19th century he worked as a teacher in local primary school.Esteve Martí 2017, p. 21 At unspecified time he married Vicenta Chillida Planell; none of the sources consulted provides any information either on her or her family, except that they were entitled to a petty rural rent.Esteve Martí 2017, pp. 20–21 The couple had 5 children, José born third in succession and the first male descendant. The family was very pious; already at the age of 4 José knew how to pray a rosary, some of his cousins became priests, and 3 of the Corbató Chillida siblings became religious themselves.Esteve Martí 2017, pp. 20–21. Corbató’s cousin José María Corbato was also member of the Dominican order; for a few years he taught natural sciences in Universidad de Manila, El Restaurador 09.03.10, available here; his sister became an abess of the Dominican convent in Alcañiz Following the 1868 revolution Corbató Cardá fervently opposed the new order; he declared himself supporter of the legitimist claimant Carlos VII and refused to take oath to the constitution of 1869.María Bayarri Roselló, Las biografías de Girolamo Savonarola en España en el siglo XX, [in:] Donald Weinstein, Júlia Benavent i Benavent, J.

Upon Corbató Cardá's release in 1871 he was reinstated to the official job but posted some 60 km away to Zorita, in the Castellón Maestrazgo already bordering Aragón; the entire family settled in the town as well. Upon outbreak of the Third Carlist War José 4 times escaped from home to enlist to legitimist troops, always rejected due to his age. In 1874 and posing as a 15-year-old he was eventually admitted, assigned to the garrison of Cantavieja. Shortly afterwards he was transferred to units commanded by Pascual Cucala and become POW during the battle of Miravet. For a few months he was shuttled between various prisons.the adolescent Corbató passed through the prisons of Tarragona, Vic, Mora d’Ebre, Falset, Montjuïc and another Barcelona prison, Manlleu, Esteve Martí 2017, p. 22 Thanks to exchange of prisoners the boy returned to Carlist ranks, initially commanded by Francisco Savalls and then again by Cucala. He served in various unitsfirst in the 6th company of Batallón de Vizcarro. Narrowly escaping encirclement by Liberal troops he survived the rout at Igualada and was later incorporated into Batallón de Miret. Most details on his military career are provided by Corbató himself and perhaps should be approached with caution, see e.g. Luz Católica 09.10.02 until Carlist troops in Catalonia surrendered in 1875.data based on his own account in La Monarquía Federal, 27,06.98, and booklet Carlismo, Españolismo.

Referred after Esteve Martí 2017, p. 23 Exact role of the boy is not clear and it is not certain whether José took part in combat or performed some auxiliary roles.information on his wartime fate is based almost exclusively on his own account In 1876 Corbató entered the Tortosa seminary. Following a brief spell in Dominican seminary in Belchite he then moved to the one in Corias, where he commenced novitiate and assumed the name of José Domingo.Esteve Martí 2017, p. 113 In 1880 he took simple vows and formally entered the Dominican Order,Esteve Martí 2017, pp. 113–114 assigned to the Nuestra Señora de las Caldas monastery.Esteve Martí 2017, p. 114 His conventual years were marked by conflicts with superiors, including altercation with the future Dominican provincial superior, Cayetano García Cienfuego. In 1887 Corbató was moved to San Pablo convent in Palencia,Esteve Martí 2017, p. 114-115 where he was charged with fraud and temporarily suspended.Bayarri Rosello 2004, p. 227 Shuttled between Valdeprado del Río,in the convent of Real Santuario de Montesclaros Palencia and Corias, he was also accused of indecent correspondence.his superiors claimed to have found indecent letters exchanged with his distant female relative; Corbató claimed the papers were falsified, Esteve Martí 2017, p. 115 In 1889 Vatican was asked for his interminable suspension.due to \\"permanent incapacity to adhere to conventual rules\\" Eventually Corbató retained his ministerial licenses and was allowed to live extraconventual life.\\"licencia para permanecer fuera del claustro durante la enfermedad alegada\\", Esteve Martí 2017, p. 116 In 1890 he moved to Villareal to settle with his parents.his father has already retired and bought a house in Villareal. Corbató got his ministerial licenses confirmed and was saying mass in the local convent, Esteve Martí 2017, p. 116 ==Carlist propagandist== León XIII, los carlistas y la monarquía liberal Having gained experience as periodista during his conventual years,in 1889–1890 El Siglo Futuro advertised his El Hijo de las Lágrimas, \\"ensayo poético sobre la conversión de san Agustín, compuesto en treinta y tres cantos y muy variadas combinaciones métricas\\"; it is not clear whether the poem has ever been published. In 1889 he commenced co-operation with a Dominican review Santísimo Rosario, Esteve Martí 2017, p. 114-115 in the early 1890s Corbató was the moving spirit – in some cases also formally a directorthis was the case of El Valenciano and El Criterio Valenciano; in case of La Voz de Maestrazgo the director was Nemesio Traver, José Navarro Cabanes, Apuntes bibliográficos de la prensa carlista, Valencia 1917, p. 184 – of a few periodicals: a Castellón weekly La Voz de Maestrazgo (1891–1893), a Valencian daily El Valenciano (1893–1894), its continuation1894 El Valenciano merged with its local Catholic rival El Criterio El Criterio Valenciano (1894–1895) and a Valencian weekly La Monarquía Federal (1895–1896). All operated at the verge of profitability, sustained mostly by donations; their circulation was at best nearing 3,000.Esteve Martí 2017, p. 140 All assumed extremely combative Carlist stand,some authors claim that virulent aggressive language was by no means excveption in the Levantine and Catalan press of the era, Solange Hibbs-Lisourges, La prensa católica catalana de 1868 a 1900 (II), [in:] Anales de Literatura Española 9 (1993), p. 100. Corbató published under his own name but he used a variety of pen-names, e.g. \\"Fulano de Tal\\" directed not only against Liberal and Conservative groupings, but also against other Levantine Catholic periodicals;his venom was directed especially against El Criterio of Valencia, Esteve Martí 2017, p. 137 Corbató claimed exclusive license for orthodox Catholicism.Corbató claimed that almost all other peridicals were not sufficiently Catholic, and denounced their reported fidelity to Roma as false, Esteve Martí 2017, pp. 140–142 None was officially authorized by local Carlist structures,La Voz was not an official provincial party mouthpiece; in 1893 this role was assumed by El Tradicionalista. Corbató tried to intervene with the natiowide party leader de Cerralbo, but to na avail. Following brief fratricidal competition La Voz ceased to publish, Esteve Martí 2017, p. 138 though some posed to represent Traditionalist organizations.La Monarquia Federal posed as organ of Juventud Tradicionalista While attracting second-rate contributors and in few cases Levantine Carlist pundits,La Monarquía Federal ensured sporadic co-operation of local Carlist personalities like Manuel Polo y Peyrolón and Joaquín Lloréns. Other contributors listed were José Navarro Cabanes, Vicente Calatayud y Bonmatí, Juan Luis Martín Mengod, Bernardo Pellejero Pérez, Santiago Jorcano and Francisco López Solano, Esteve Martí 2017, p. 143 all periodicals remained Corbató's one-man show and for long periods he used to populate their pages almost single-handedly.among a spate of pen-names Corbató signed his contributions often as \\"Víctor\\" or \\"P. de Castagélida\\" Moreover, in the mid-1890s Corbató turned into a genuine icon of young Valencian Carlists;Esteve Martí 2017, p. 227. In 1896 some popular Carlist propaganda items contained his portraits along these of key nationwide party leaders like Bartolomé Feliú or José de Liñan, El Baluarte 28.02.96, available here at home he ran an informal circulo, built his own followingEsteve Martí 2017, p. 229 and started to appear as an alternative leader, differing from old-style tycoons like Llorens, Polo and Simo Marín.Esteve Martí 2017, pp. 225–250 Relatively unknown beyond the Traditionalist Levantine circles, in 1894–95 Corbató was elevated to nationwide celebrity.Esteve Martí 2017, pp. 285–288, compare also a selection of press notes at Hemeroteca.bne service, available here It was because of his 1894 booklet León XIII, los carlistas y la monarquía liberal.Corbató published the book under the pen-name of Máximo Filibero, but his identity became almost immediately known Resembling an earlier pamphlet of Félix Sardà y Salvany, it was a most intransigent interpretation of papal teachings and contained onslaught on liberal and conservative politics; the booklet presented Carlism as the sole depositary of CatholicismCorbató’s exaltation of the Carlist king at times assumed millenarian and biblical tones, e.g. he claimed that \\"no hay salvación fuera de los principios católicos tan dignamente representados por el Señor D. Carlos VII de Borbón\\", referred after Esteve Martí 2017, p. 274 and lambasted various breeds of traitors.Corbató directed his pen not only against the Conservatives and the Carlist offhoots known as Pidalistas, but also against the Integrists of Ramón Nocedal, Esteve Martí 2017, p. 270 León triggered legal action as Corbató alleged that the regent, Maria Christina, was heading the Spanish freemasonry. The cause turned into a scandal and was attentively followed by national press; even the prime minister Sagasta admitted to having read the pamphlet.Sagasta noted that charging a commoner with leading freemasonry by no means could have been considered an insult, but in case of a regent it certainly was, Esteve Martí 2017, p. 279 Corbató was expulsed from the Dominican order, the first such case ever recorded in Spain.Esteve Martí 2017, pp. 282–283, see also La Unión Católica 05.01.95, available here In 1896 he was sentenced to 11 years in prison and huge financial penalty.Esteve Martí 2017, p. 286 Carlist standard Evading incarceration, in early 1896 Corbató fled Spain. He was briefly hosted by the claimant in Venice,El Correo Espanol 25.01.96, available here yet he settled permanently in Paris; he tried to make a livingperhaps was aided by French legitimists (maybe on recommendation of Carlos VII), considered migrating to America, especially Buenos Aires and Mexico, Esteve Martí 2017, p. 292 by teaching Latin, translations,in 1899 Corbató translated from French: El hombre tal como debe ser by Abate V. Marchal and El consuelo de los enfermos, ó el dia santificado por la enfermedad by Henri Perreyve, Mallorca 05.01.99, available here. His translation of La Religieuse by Diderot was peculiar, as Corbató \\"corrected\\" paragraphs he considered incorrect, Esteve Martí 2017, p. 292 editing antologiesLecturas clásicas en prosa y verso, Paris 1899 and providing religious service.he was rumored to provide religious service in the entourage of Francisco de Asís de Borbón, who might have also supported Corbató financially; as Francisco was related to the Alfonsine branch, it prompted some to suspect that Corbató deviated from the Carlist orthodoxy Unable to manage Monarquía remotely he decided to close it. In 1896 he published Dios, patria y rey o el catecismo del carlista;again the booklet was signed with a pen-name of Máximo Filibero the booklet presented Carlos VII as a model Christian king, determined to fight liberal tyranny, and was sold via Carlist channels in 1896–1898.La Tradición 10.04.97, available here During the Spanish-American war he zealously engaged in various patriotic initiatives and visited the Spanish embassy offering his own design of a torpedo.Esteve Martí 2017, p. 291. Already in 1891 Corbató tried his hand at mechanics and allegedly devised a \\"bomba hidraulica\\" of unknown usage, El Criterio 01.12.91, available here, and El Criterio 17.09.92, available here Intransigent as always, he denounced the Paris 1900 Universal Exposition as triumph of socialism, Judaism and freemasonry;Esteve Martí 2017, p. 291 even the Spanish hierarchy was not spared his venom as timid and not sufficiently committed.José Domingo Corbató, Memorias, impresiones y pronósticos de un español proscripto, València 1905, pp. 253–255, referred after Esteve Martí 2017, p. 289 In 1899 Corbató published Los Consejos del Cardenal Sancha;full title Los Consejos del Cardenal Sancha o Apología Católica del carlismo; the pamphlet, though utterly respectful towards the Church as such, confronted the conciliatory stand that the primate adopted versus the liberal Madrid government the booklet was aimed against the primate and affirmed that only Carlism represented the genuine Catholic stand.Esteve Martí 2017, p. 304 ==In search of new identity== Luz Católica Though royal amnesty was declared in 1897 and 1898 Corbató was not eligible; he had to wait until 1899, when the usual Fiesta de los Reyes pardon covered also his offences.Esteve Martí 2017, p. 394 He returned to Valencia, visited relatives, tried to arrange for a Catholic college, fearing incarceration briefly travelled to Paris and definitely returned in mid-1900;Esteve Martí 2017, pp. 394–395 following some confusion his ministerial license was confirmed by the Valencia archbishop.Esteve Martí 2017, p. 395 At that time his relations with official Carlism were already strained. Since the mid-1890s he was viewed by local Levantine party leaders as uncontrollable and potentially rebellious.the first conflict was related to competition between La Voz de Maestrazgo and El Tradicionalista, Esteve Martí 2017, p. 367 Apart from his political intransigence there were also issues related to personal squabblesanother one emerged over the person of Segismundo Peix Ordeix, whom Corbató accused (rightly, as it turned out later) of false Traditionalism. Issues related to Corbató’s stand as leader of the young generation pitted against the old one followed, Esteve Martí 2017, p. 167 and generational divisions involved, and especially Manuel Polo y Peyrolón turned into his vehement critic. Already in Paris Corbató engaged in fervent Carlist insurrectionist propaganda;Esteve Martí 2017, pp. 383–387 as in October 1900 the conspiracy boiled down to few isolated attempts he was profoundly disappointed by ambiguous stand of Carlos VII, and his mistrust towards the Levantine party leaders was extended also to the claimant and the national executive. Back in Spain Corbató – by scholars considered possessed by \\"obsesiva dedicación al campo de la prensa\\"Esteve Martí 2017, p. 185 – resumed labors to launch a new periodical. He obtained some donations from friends and relatives, was prepared to mortgage his Villareal house and contributed his own meager savings to launch Luz Católica, a weekly which was first published in late 1900.Corbató possibly ensured a subsidy from the religious convent headed by his older sister; some financial contribution came from his cousin. He also intended to mortgage his house in Villareal, Esteve Martí 2017, p. 175 This time the periodical did not assume a clear party identity, sub-titled \\"Semanario critico de religión, ciencias y españolismo\\".Esteve Martí 2017, p. 167 Initially the weekly might have seemed flavored with Carlism, e.g. when it questioned Traditionalist credentials of Polo y Peyrolón,Esteve Martí 2017, p. 374 but soon it turned decisively against the party. Posing as a genuine Traditionalist voice, Luz Católica started to castigate cesarism and hypocrisy of Carlos VII and his men, including the party leader Barrio y Miér; they allegedly opted for rapprochement with the Restoration system. In 1903 Luz Católica was revamped as La Señal de Victoria, but its editorial line remained the same. Carlos VII Corbató's anti-Carlist campaign climaxed with the 1904 publication of Los carlo-traidores. Memoria póstuma del general D. Salvador Soliva. The pamphlet, written jointly with Joan Bardina but published anonymously,the authors featured were \\"C. M. Apsmav y Dr. Leal\\", but the identity of Bardina and Corbató was almost immediately established. The booklet was formatted as defense of Salvador Soliva, one of the Octubrada leaders, Esteve Martí 2017, p. 392 was an open and virulent onslaught on the claimant. Dwelling mostly upon the failed 1900 insurrection which allegedly left ardent and dedicated partisans of the cause abandoned by their leaders, the authors presented Carlos VII as traitor to the cause and to the men who trusted him, a delator, fraudster sold out to liberalism and perhaps a man financed with the Alfonsist money.Esteve Martí 2017, p. 392 The book triggered a spate of furious attacks on part of the Carlist press; the affair sealed Corbató's break with Carlism.Esteve Martí 2017, p. 402 He embraced Traditionalism deprived of the dynastic thread, which he now ridiculed as \\"Carlos, Carlos y Carlos o César, César y César\\".Esteve Martí 2017, p. 406 At that time Corbató was already promoting a general alliance of all anti-Liberal political groupings. He began to relativize his earlier vehemence, e.g. against the Integrists, and opted for a broad, patriotic and Catholic formula.watering down his earlier anti- nocedalismo, now he posed as supporter of a union of all anti-liberals, Esteve Martí 2017, p. 402 ==Españolista== Apología del gran monarca In the early 1900s Corbató developed his own political theory. Auto-identified as españolismo, it was laid out in some 20 bookletsthe key ones were Carlismo y españolismo (1901); El españolismo de Aparisi Guijarro (1901); Apología del Gran Monarca (1903); Exposición a Don Carlos de Borbón y Austria-Este sobre carlismo y españolismo (1904); Meditaciones religioso-políticas de un español proscripto (1904); Memorias, impresiones y pronósticos de un español proscripto (1905); Integrismo y españolismo: síntesis de la política tradicionalista fundamental (1905); for a longer list see e.g. Luz Catolica 01.11.00, available here published in Valencia between 1900 and 1905;booklets were published as so-called Biblioteca Españolista. The series was marketed first by Luz Católica and then by La Señal de Victoria, Esteve Martí 2017, p. 395 the best known work is Apología del Gran Monarca.exact publication date is not clear. Esteve Martí 2017, p. 175 dates it in 1903, but the booklet was advertised already in 1900, Luz Catolica 01.11.00, available here Corbató's españolismo was a highly providentialist, millenarian doctrine which combined exalted patriotism and religious zeal. Based on assumption that the global liberal order would undoubtedly collapsemarked by a revanchist spirit, Apología del Gran Monarca predicted the fall Britain, conversion of Russia to Roman Catholicism, disintegration of the USA and reunion of Latin American states with Spain. It advanced also clear Iberism and envisioned a union of Spain and Portugal, Esteve Martí 2017, p. 411 it envisioned ultimate advent of a universalist monarchy.a present-day scholar locates Corbato's writings in line with earlier works anticipating a universalist monarchy by Adrién Peladán, San Francisco de Paula, Juan de Vatiguerro, Joaquín de Fiore, Marie Lataste, San Vicente Ferrer, Bug de Milhas, San Alonso Rodríguez, Nicolás Factor and Michel de Nôtre-Dame In a regenerationist tone Corbató hinted that the impulse might come from Spain, which would regain imperial status as a Hispanic commonwealth.Esteve Martí 2017, p. 411 He remained ambiguous as to the future monarch.among candidates to the throne Corbato considered both Don Jaime and Alfonso XIII, though he might have thought also about himself. In his booklets the thread was not explicit, but a contemporary scholar suggests that it vaguely emerged in Corbató’s private correspondence. It is supposed that Corbató interpreted his almost permanent series of misfortunes and failures as providential; within this mental framework, he was to resign all private and serve some grand universal goals, Esteve Martí 2017, p. 414 Scholars reconstruct his españolismo as \\"a form of anti-liberal Spanish nationalism,initially Corbató saw no incompatibility between españolismo and catalanismo, claiming that both support each other. Later he maintained that there was no such thing as \\"Catalan nation\\", but remained conciliatory towards Unió Catalanista and Lliga Regionalista. Still later he was already firmy opposed to \\"semi-separatismo\\" of Catalans and Basques. His longtime friendship with Bardina ended in 1903; the latter was accused of fomenting anti-patriotic Catalanism, Esteve Martí 2017, p. 487 founded on ultramontane Catholicism and Traditionalism, with the objective of building a moderate, regionalist monarchy and corporative society\\".Corbató envisioned a highly interventionist and protective state; in truly Traditionalist fashion he opposed division of powers, though he acknowledged that a king might delegates his juridical powers to Tribunal Supremo and could be assisted by Real Consejo, Esteve Martí 2017, p. 460 One historian sees Corbató's españolismo as an attempt to modernize Traditionalism;his biographer claims that \\"through a combination of imperialism, protectionism and a measure of state interventionism in social affairs, [he] sought to adapt Traditionalism to the needs of a mass society\\", Javier Esteve Martí, El tradicionalisme en l’ascens del nacionalisme de masses: el pare Corbató, [in:] Recerques. Història, Economia, Cultura 65 (2012), p. 109 another presents it rather in terms of mysticism and esoterism.William A. Christian Jr., Moving Crucifixes in Modern Spain, Princeton 2014, , p. 110 Apart from his booklets, the principal platform of advancing Corbató's ideas were La Luz Católica and La Señal de Victoria. However, he tried also to set up own political organisation. Since 1902 he headed a Valencia-based Junta Central Católico-Españolista; it presided over few small local círculos.e.g. in Girona; there were circles also beyond Levante, like in the Andalusian town of Velez-Rubio He tried to operate \\"Academia Españolista\\" in Barcelona, though with some 40 members it remained almost defunct. His most successful structure was Milicia de la Cruz, founded in 1901.Esteve Martí 2017, p. 420 It adhered to a hybrid formula in-between a secular religious order, paramilitary organisationthe group practiced some military drills in Desierto de la Palmas near Valencia; few leaflets embraced violence and even killings, but the group has never embarked on any violent action and traditional círculo; its membership is unclear, though it should probably be estimated in tens rather than hundreds. As its leader Corbató assumed a new name, Francisco María Cruz; the militia operated thanks to minor donations and sought support of the local religious hierarchy.formally the Militia was ruled by Regla Galeata de los hermanos de la Milicia de la Cruz o forma de vida religiosa y política de la nueva Orden de Crucíferos, a booklet published by Corbató in 1903. The Valencia archbishop explictly stated that Militia does not enjoy support of the hierarchy, La Lectura Dominical 16.02.07, available here cardenal Guisasola In 1905 Corbató left Valencia for the Basque Mendívil. Invited by the local entrepreneur Alfredo Ortiz de Villacián he was supposed to serve the community of local miners. In fact, both were consumed by a theory of immaculate conception of Saint Joseph.Corbató advanced his Josephine theories already in La Señal de Victoria When in 1907 he published El Inmaculado San JoséVatican intervened almost immediately and the book was listed on index. Still in 1907 Corbató published a follow-up booklet titled Vindicación Josefina; moderated in tone and posing as in line with papal teachings, it nevertheless tried to upheld the theory, Esteve Martí 2017, pp. 430–434 and tried to launch the cult of Sagrado Corazón de San José, the Vítoria bishop prohibited him from saying mass; he was also admonished by Rome.

The team compiled a 2–5 record. The coaching staff was led by former Notre Dame star Harry \\"The Horse\\" Wright in his first year as head coach. Wright was assisted by two other Notre Dame alumni—Neil Green as line coach and Floyd Simmons as backfield coach. Key players included quarterback Danny Christianson, left halback John Freeman, right halfback Larry Wissbaum, and end Joe Marshello. In February 1950, Rev. T. J.

Mehling cited the \\"extraordinary expenses\\" associated with maintaining a first-rate football program. Portland's decision to cease competition in intercollegiate football was part of a trend among west coast Catholic universities in terminating their football programs: Gonzaga (1942); Saint Mary's (1950); Loyola (1951); San Francisco (1951); and Santa Clara (1952). ==Schedule== ==References== Portland Category:Portland Pilots football seasons Portland Pilots football Portland Pilots football ","title":"1949 Portland Pilots football team"},{"id":"61545873","text":"Benjamin James Challacombe (born 1973) is a British consultant urological surgeon at Guy's & St Thomas' Hospitals, London, who specialises in the treatment of kidney and prostatic disease using robotic surgery. In 2005, he was part of the team that published the results of a randomised controlled trial of human versus telerobotics in the field of urology and renal transplant, one of the first of its kind. After qualifying in medicine from Guy's and St Thomas' and completing junior surgical posts, he completed a da Vinci robotic Fellowship at the Royal Melbourne Hospital in 2009. In 2010, he was appointed consultant and pursued a surgical career in the procedure of removing part of a kidney using robotics and proceeded to regularly perform these, robotic radical prostatectomies and Holmium laser prostatectomies. In 2016, he performed the UK's first live broadcast of the robotic removal of part of a kidney. In 2019, he told his surgical story alongside that of Stephen Fry. In the same year he was awarded the British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) Karl Storz Harold Hopkins Golden Telescope award. He has written or co-written over 230 peer-reviewed articles and 30 book chapters, and has been an active fundraiser for The Urology Foundation and Prostate Cancer UK. ==Early life== Dulwich College, College Road, Dulwich Ben Challacombe was born in 1973 in Greenwich, London,Ben Challacombe, Curriculum Vitae, The Prostate Centre, Wimpole Street, London. (2017) to professor of oral medicine Stephen Challacombe and general practitioner Tina Challacombe. “What giving means to me: Tina Challacombe”. In Recognition 2010-11 p. 15. Between 1986 and 1991, he attended Dulwich College before opening a year as a 2nd Lieutenant in 29 Commando Regiment, Royal Artillery and then studying medicine at United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals from 1992. He qualified in 1998. ==Career== St Thomas' Hospital Between August 1998 and January 1999, he completed general medicine house posts at Worthing Hospital in the specialties of cardiology, gastroenterology, and elderly care. Subsequently, he worked for six months in the specialty of urology at Guy's Hospital, followed by six months in accident and emergency at St Thomas' Hospital and then became anatomy demonstrator to professor Harold Ellis. From June 2000 to October 2002, he held a number of surgical posts at Guy's and St Thomas' including the specialties of breast surgery, endocrinology, colorectal surgery, orthopaedics and urology, before spending eighteen months as a research fellow in urology for Prokar Dasgupta and R. Tiptaft. In 2002, Challacombe began his masters in surgery at the University of London, gaining the degree in 2007 with a thesis titled “Telemedicine, Telerobotics and their Implications for Urology and Renal Transplantation”, a randomised controlled trial of human versus telerobotics, one of the first of its kind. In 2004, he gained a place on the surgical South Thames Training Scheme, which placed him at the William Harvey Hospital, the Kent and Sussex Hospital, and then at the Darent Valley Hospital. He gained his FRCS (Urology) in 2008. ===Fellowship=== Laproscopic Surgery Robot As a surgical trainee in 2009, he was awarded the Rowan Nicks UK and Ireland Scholarship from the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons. He focussed on the da Vinci robotics with professor Anthony J. Costello at the Royal Melbourne Hospital in Australia. Later in 2009, he returned to The Royal Marsden Hospital under professor Christopher Woodhouse. In 2010, he was appointed to Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, shortly before being also appointed as surgeon at the Prostate Centre, London, and pursued a surgical career in the procedure of removing part of a kidney using robotics and proceeded to regularly perform these. He has since also regularly performed robotic radical prostatectomies and Holmium laser (HoLEP) prostatectomies. Other robotic surgery he has been involved in include nephroureterectomy, pyeloplasty and adrenalectomy. He teaches robotics and HoLEP and runs the robotic fellowship programme at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and teaches at the British and European Annual Urology meetings. In this respect, he has encouraged his students to spend some time playing wii. ===World robotic surgery education=== In 2016, as part of \\"world robotic surgery education\\", he performed the first live broadcast of a robotic partial nephrectomy in the UK, while listening to music. This helped him manage his time and track his surgical procedure by giving crucial auditory cues, reporting that \\"you basically have a maximum 30-minute window to remove a cancerous tumour from a kidney. The traditional way is for someone to call out the time, but that's distracting and quite stressful. With the music, I know where I am without that\\". In this live webcast, he used a playlist comprising Coldplay's \\"Viva la Vida\\" and \\"Princess of China\\", followed by \\"So Far Away\\" by Dire Straits and then \\"Burn\\" by Ellie Goulding and \\"Just Give Me a Reason\\" by Pink. The sixth and last song on the playlist was \\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\\" by Oasis, the onset of which would have indicated that time was over: \\"I don't ever want hear the Oasis song\\", he reported.Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust (2015) ===Prostate surgery=== Since 2018, he has increasingly taken over the work of prostate surgeon Roger Kirby. In 2019, Challacombe told his surgical story of treating prostate cancer alongside the same story told by his patient, actor and author Stephen Fry. It was published in Nature Reviews Urology in an article titled \\"Both sides of the scalpel: the patient and the surgeon view\\". In 2020, he was interviewed by his cousin Rupert Cox, on testicular cancer and the treatment of England and British Lions rugby player Alex Corbisiero. During the COVID-19 pandemic in London, he described his robot as having been furloughed, eventually returning to work when the one tonne machine was transferred from Guy's to an adjacent private facility where surgery could recommence. ==Awards== In 2009, Challacombe was awarded the Rowan Nicks UK and Ireland Scholarship from the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, offered annually to a young surgeon with potential leadership skills. In 2019, he was awarded the British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) Karl Storz Harold Hopkins Golden Telescope award, an annual prize awarded to a young consultant member of the BAUS for their achievements. ==Charity work== Challacombe is on the board of trustees for The Urology Foundation charity and lectures for the charity Prostate Cancer UK. In 2008, he swam the English Channel in a relay to raise funds for Prostate Cancer UK. He is a trustee of Penguins Against Cancer, the charity arm of Guy's, Kings and St Thomas' Rugby Football Club. ==Selected publications== ===Articles=== * * * ===Books=== *The Big Prostate.

Ileana Simziana or Ileana Sînziana (also translated to English as The Princess Who Would be a Prince or Iliane of the Golden Tresses and Helena Goldengarland) is a Romanian fairy tale collected and written down by Petre Ispirescu between 1872 and 1886. It tells the story of an unnamed youngest daughter of an emperor, who dresses up as a man, goes to serve another emperor and rescues the titular princess Ileana. During a quest of obtaining the Holy Water she is hit by a curse of a monk that causes her to transform into a man - Făt-Frumos (Prince Charming figure), who marries Ileana in the happy ending. == Synopsis == The tale introduces an emperor with three daughters, who is sad that he didn't have a son. The oldest daughter goes to the emperor and asks him what problem he is having and tells him that she will go to serve another emperor as a soldier only to make him happy. Then the emperor makes a copper bridge and turns into a wolf. The oldest daughter gets scared and goes back to the palace. The same happens with the middle daughter, who also gets scared of the wolf. The youngest daughter goes on a journey with her father's old horse, and defeats him on three bridges, first as a wold, then as a lion, then as a twelve-headed dragon. The girl arrives at the court of a \\"great and strong emperor\\" and he tells her to rescue Ileana Simziana, his daughter, who had been kidnapped by the giant. The girl rescues her, and the emperor asks her to retrieve his herd enchanted mares, the girl succeeds in this spree. Then Ileana Simziana asks the emperor's daughter to bring the Holy Water kept in a small church above the Jordan and guarded by nuns who neither slept in the day nor in the night. The girl succeeds but the monk who takes care of the church prays to God and asks him if the thief is a man to make him a woman and vice versa, so that the princess becomes a prince - Făt-Frumos. He marries Ileana Simziana and they live happily ever after. == Variants == A variant of this story, entitled The Girl Who Pretended to be a Boy, was published in 1901 in Andrew Lang’s The Violet Fairy Book, and was an English translation of a tale from the 1894 Romanian Sept Contes Roumains (Seven Romanian Stories), edited by Jules Brun and Leo Bachelin.\\"Jouvencelle-Jouvenceau\\".

Purves-Hume-Campbell was first elected Tory MP for Berwickshire at a by-election in 1834—caused by the death of Charles Albany Marjoribanks—and held the seat until 1847, when he did not seek re-election. He succeeded to the Baronetcy of Purves Hall in 1833 upon the death of his father. Upon his own death in 1894, the title was inherited by John Home-Purves-Hume-Campbell. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Tory MPs (pre-1834) Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom Category:UK MPs 1832–1835 Category:UK MPs 1835–1837 Category:UK MPs 1837–1841 Category:UK MPs 1841–1847 Category:1812 births Category:1894 deaths ","title":"Sir Hugh Purves-Hume-Campbell, 7th Baronet"},{"id":"61546344","text":"Clive Syddall is a British film maker and television journalist noted for several campaigning documentaries. ==Life and career== In 1969 after a year as a graduate trainee with Southern Television, he joined the BBC as a producer and director on 24 Hours, Midweek and later Panorama where he produced films from the front line in Northern Ireland, the Middle East and Southern Africa.

They are derivatives of carbazole and nitrogen analogues of polychlorinated dibenzofurans. Polychlorinated carbazoles usually occur as a mixture of various isomers. This mixture can have a certain frequency pattern (congener pattern) from which conclusions can be drawn about the causes of formation. PCCZs are not manufactured purposefully. They are formed under certain conditions as by- products of thermal processes. In environmental samples, mixed halogenated carbazoles are also found.M. Pena-Abaurrea, K. J. Jobst, R. Ruffolo, L.

Commuters arrived early to get one of the shady parking spots provided by its branches. Photos of Oklahoma City taken in the 1920s show the tree to be about 100 years old (in the year 2000). Heavily damaged by the bomb, the tree survived after nearly being chopped down during the initial investigation, when workers wanted to recover evidence hanging in its branches and embedded in its bark. The force of the blast ripped most of the branches from the Survivor Tree. Glass and debris were embedded in its trunk and fire from the cars parked beneath it blackened what was left. Most thought the tree could not survive. Almost a year after the bombing, family members, survivors, and rescue workers gathered for a memorial ceremony by the tree, noticed it was beginning to bloom again. The Survivor Tree now thrives, and the Outdoor Memorial design includes a mandate to feature and protect the tree. For example, one of the roots that would have been cut by the wall surrounding the tree was placed inside a large pipe so it could reach the soil beyond the wall without being damaged. The decking around the tree was raised several feet to make an underground crawlspace; workers enter through a secure hatchway and monitor the health of the tree and maintain its very deep roots. The inscription around the inside of the deck wall around the Survivor Tree reads: The spirit of this city and this nation will not be defeated; our deeply rooted faith sustains us. Hundreds of seeds from the Survivor Tree are planted annually and the resulting saplings are distributed each year on the anniversary of the bombing.

It was released by Sony Music, The Orchard, and Perpetual Novice on October 18, 2019. Pang is Polachek's first solo effort released under her own name. ==Background and recording== In 2017, Polachek began working frequently with PC Music producers Danny L Harle and A. G. Cook after the dissolution of her band Chairlift. She appeared on Harle's single \\"Ashes of Love\\" back in 2016, and she also began collaborating with him and Cook in contributions with other artists, such as Superfruit and Charli XCX. In an interview with Dazed, Polachek revealed what it was like to work with a range of different people, noting that \\"Working with different artists is always a learning experience, a new skill for the tool belt, even when it's more about realising what doesn't work.\\" She elaborated, saying that she feels more in control of the things she writes and produces, and that she's \\"...Ultimately the one in control, the one who is filtering and controlling the palette in real time. I don't leave it up to someone else. It's actually more and more liberating to just get in and start making stuff.\\" Throughout the duration of 2018, Polachek shared a number of images of her in the studio to record material and hinted at the possibility of working on an album in their captions. ==Release== Pang was released on October 18, 2019, by Sony Music, specifically on Perpetual Novice (named to reference lyrics from the album's lead single, \\"Door\\"), Polachek's imprint under The Orchard. ===Singles=== In 2019, Polachek released the album's lead single \\"Door\\", which was the first to be released under her own name (she previously released music under the names 'Ramona Lisa' and 'CEP'). It was also accompanied by a music video, directed by Polachek herself alongside London-based artist Matt Copson. The song was revealed by a press release as \\"the first taste of a forthcoming, larger solo project from Caroline to be released later this year.\\" rumouring further that the album could possibly have more than over 18 tracks. In an interview with Vogue, Polachek expressed her surprise that her label was happy to lead with \\"Door\\" as the first single, explaining \\"it's such a long and winding song. There are songs on the record that are a bit more twisty and moody. And this one feels like, no pun intended, an open door. It feels like an invitation.\\" Pitchfork listed the song at number 47 for the 100 best songs of 2019. The following month, she announced that she was to release two more cuts from the album \\"Ocean of Tears\\" and \\"Parachute\\". With their release sparked the announcement of the album, under the title Pang and its scheduled release period of sometime in fall of 2019. Polachek made both records with Danny L Harle, the sometime collaborator with Charli XCX and Carly Rae Jepsen. A. G. Cook also contributed production to \\"Ocean of Tears\\", alongside Valley Girl. Of the song \\"Parachute\\", Polachek said in a press release, \\"It was an incredible moment, realizing that this melody we'd written was unintentionally re-telling a dream I'd been shaken by. I went home, re-drafted the words to fit, and came back to the studio at 1 am to record the vocal the same day. And that's the take we kept. From that moment on, Dan and I knew we had a lot more work to do together.\\" In September 2019, she released the album's fourth single \\"So Hot You're Hurting My Feelings\\", which was co-written with Daniel Nigro and Teddy Geiger. Consequence of Sound reviewed the track with the statement, \\"While previous tracks \\"Parachute\\" and \\"Ocean of Tears\\" served up ethereal tones, \\"So Hot You're Hurting My Feelings\\" has a little more pep in its step. With a hint of an '80s pop vibe, Polachek's vocals ping-pong off the synths as she sings the refrain\\". Around the same time, Polachek announced the album's release date of October 18, 2019. \\"Look at Me Now\\" was released as the final pre-release single on October 14, 2019. The acoustic ballad is described as the \\"diary entry\\" of the album that Polachek wrote \\"while processing a mix of guilt, self-destructiveness, and hope.\\" The song was inspired by Lilith Fair artists like Jewel and Sarah McLachlan. On October 19, 2020 to celebrate the album's one year anniversary, Polachek released a ten minute long extended mix of \\"The Gate\\" as a single, featuring a visualizer by Ezra Miller. She called the new mix \\"a sort of parallel universe or alternate ending, where those words not only arrive, but ring true.\\" ==Critical reception== Pang was met with acclaim from music critics upon its release. At Metacritic, the album received a score of 82 out of 100 based on 14 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". In the review for AllMusic, Matt Collar suggested that, \\"[Caroline] Polachek further distills her approach with a collection of deeply emotive songs that showcase her delicate vocals and intricate pop sensibilities. Helping her achieve this deft balance of art and emotion is British producer Danny L. Harle. Together, they craft arrangements that straddle the line between moody electronica and adult contemporary pop.\\" { class=\\"sortable \\" +Year-end lists - ! Publication ! Accolade !

Nukari (; ) is a village located in the northeast part of Nurmijärvi municipality of Finland, near the border of Tuusula municipality. The nearest neightboring village is Jokela, about 4 kilometers. Next to Nukari is the national road 45, which runs between Helsinki, Tuusula and Hyvinkää. The population of village is about 350 inhabitants. The River Vantaa, which flows through Nukari, has probably brought settlement to Nukari already during the Stone Age. Indeed, three artifacts from the Stone Age have been found on Nukari; flat chisel, hammer ax and polished stone. During the Bronze Age the settlement disappeared, whereas in the Iron Age the whole Uusimaa was mainly hunting ground for Estonians and later for Tavastians. With the Crusades in Sweden, Nukari was once again populated. Nukarinkoski, a local rapids. The bridge over the rapids called Nukarinkoski (or Pengerkoski) in River Vantaa and the road from Helsinki to Hyvinkää (current MT 45), required constant caretakers in the 1650s. Burgess Erkki Nukari declared himself a keen bridge guard if he could get space in the nearby forest area. In 1662, Governor Ernst Johan Creutz granted Erkki Nukar the rights to the wilderness of East Vantaa, the area of the present Nukari village. Nukari founded a permanent tavern and can be considered the first real farmer in Vantaa. Nukarinkoski has also played an important role in the industrialization of Nukari village. As early as the end of the 16th century, a watermill was built on the rapids and by the 1660s there were already two mills. In addition, sawmills were built along the rapids, and in the 20th century, a lumber factory operated alongside another mill. The Nurmijärvi Municipal Power Plant planned to build a power plant in Nukarinkoski at the turn of the 1920s, but it had to be abandoned due to high costs. Nukarinkoski was used for log driving in the 1920s and 1950s. The first volksschule in Nurmijärvi (now the Nukari School Museum) started its operations in 1873. The school was founded by Matilda Adlercreutz, the lady of Raala Manor. The lady found it important that the manor's workers, laborers, and crofters, and above all their children, received instruction and education. In the first fall, 41 students enrolled in the school. In 1900 the school was donated to the municipality. Nukari has also a primary school and a kindergarten, and in the 1980s there were 2 village shops, a bank, a post office and a hairdressing salon. Nukari no longer has any grocery stores or kiosks, only one filling station. The nearest shops can be found in the neighboring village, Jokela. ==Distances from other cities== *Helsinki 45 km *Järvenpää 15 km *Tuusula 15 km *Hyvinkää 14 km *Nurmijärvi 11 km == Sources == * * Lastuja Vantaanjoen historiasta - Louis Belanger Vantaan- ja Tuusulanjoella vuonna 1798 (in Finnish) === References === == External links == * Nukari - Official Web Site Category:Villages in Finland Category:Nurmijärvi ","title":"Nukari"},{"id":"61546860","text":"Josiah Marvel Jr. (November 26, 1904, Wilmington, Delaware - December 29, 1955, Wilmington, Delaware) was an American diplomat who served as chief of the United States' diplomatic mission in Denmark from 1946 to 1949, originally at the rank of Envoy Extraordinary and later as Ambassador Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary.

Crystal structure of TNCN, M= Fe, Co, Ni Adolph Frank and Nikodem Caro were the first to synthesize calcium cyanamide (CaNCN) and to develop a route for its production at the industrial level in 1898. But, the very first beginning of the metal carbodiimides/cyanamides goes back to the 1870s. One can find detailed reports by E. Drechsel on the preparation of Ag2NCN, CaNCN, BaNCN, K2NCN and Li2NCN between 1875 and 1898 (before even XRD invention). The preparation of Cd, Zn, Tl, Cu, Pb and Hg carboimides has been described during the 1950s. CaNCN is by the far the most known since it has been produced since 1898 and used as a fertilizer. Starting from 2000s, rare earth metal carbodiimides Ln2(NCN)3 (Ln = La, Ce, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm and Tm) and transition metal carbodiimides TNCN (T= Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) and Cr2(NCN)3have been reported. Non-metallic carbodiimides are also known such as Si(NCN)2. Tx(NCN)y binaries adopt generally structures with cationic layers made of octahedrally coordinated T2+/T3+ cations alternating with anionic layers of NCN2– in various structures such as rock-salt, NiAs- and NaN3-like structures. A side of binary carbodiimides, ternary (SrZn(NCN)2) and quaternary ones (Li2Sm2Sr(NCN)5 ) have also been prepared via solid-state metathesis. Dimorphism is observed in inorganic carbodiimide. HgNCN for example can adopt two structures with two different NCN configurations, this means that HgNCN can have either carbodiimide or cyanamide structures.

The album was given its first CD release (as a double set with Romeo Void's It's a Condition) by Wounded Bird Records in 2007. ==Background== Following the split of Romeo Void, Iyall embarked on a solo career. She recalled to Punk Globe in 2011: \\"The record company didn't really like [the album]. I wrote it with the help of a couple of different people and we recorded it and it sunk.\\" In 1987, Iyall began a new job as receptionist for a fashion business while also forming new groups in the San Francisco area. Throughout the 1990s, Iyall turned away from music and returned to her first love, art, and she began working as both an artist and art instructor. Strange Language features Iyall's former Romeo Void bandmates Benjamin Bossi on saxophone and Aaron Smith on drums. The title track was released as the album's only single and reached No. 27 on the Billboard Hot Dance/Disco Club Play chart. ==Reception== Upon release, Billboard commented: \\"Former Romeo Void vocalist weaves a tapestry of moody, introspective music. Fans of the band looking for a repeat of that group's panache should look elsewhere.\\" Brian Chin of Billboard noted the title track's \\"polished, pop- dance beat\\" and \\"Ono-esque message and vocal treatment\\". People wrote: \\"[Iyall's] singing has a harsh, unpleasant edge, so while it's important to listen to the words to get their impact, the listening can be a chore — not to mention the fact that a lot of the tunes seem to be more for dancing than listening.\\" Cheryl Wenner of The Morning Call wrote: \\"Iyall's strange language is unfamiliar and likely to be a little disturbing to Romeo Void fans. As she tries to rock above and beyond the late, great San Francisco band, she experiments with conformity and only disappoints. The lyrics are below par, most of the vocals are drowned out, and gone is that old rhythmic drive.\\" Ted Drozdowski of The Boston Globe wrote: \\"This sales-hungry debut is so overburdened with generic dance tracks and recycled melodies that it robs Iyall's lyrics of their depth and leaves her voice unchallenged. With a few exceptions, it's a characterless record adrift in a commercial void.\\" Chris Willman of the Los Angeles Times commented: \\"Iyall's romantic observations seem maudlin, perhaps because they're placed in musical settings that are plenty moody but without any of the old rhythmic drive. Worse yet, producer Pat Irwin has placed her voice in high-tech, hollowed-out, low-key settings that, to work at all, would require her to be a technically accomplished singer.\\" In a retrospective review, Stewart Mason of AllMusic commented: \\"The songs lack the Joy Division-inspired urgency of Romeo Void's best songs, and their comparative mellowness blunts the impact of Iyall's lyrics. That said, at least half of these songs are quite good.\\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * Debora Iyall - lead vocals, backing vocals * Diana Lavallee Korematsu, Donna Franklin, Jenny Muldaur, Kitty Beethoven - backing vocals * Pat Irwin - guitar, synthesizer, saxophone, clarinet * Benjamin Bossi - saxophone * Richard Sohl - piano, synthesizer * Bongo Bob Smith - synthesizer * Paul Keister - bass * Aaron Smith - drums Production * Pat Irwin - producer * Bill Thompson - engineer * Howie Weinberg - mastering ==References== Category:1986 debut albums Category:Columbia Records albums ","title":"Strange Language"},{"id":"61547101","text":"Paul Hugues Christofle, copper, 1846, in the collection of the National Gallery of Art Juliette Dubufe (née Zimmerman) (1819 - August 6, 1855) was a French sculptor.

The female has a buffy abdomen and thorax, males are darker and mature males can be dark blue to black on the abdomen and thorax. Males have bands on the outer wings from the node to just short of the pterostigma, this is paler in teneral individuals but darkens as the dragonfly matures. Where they overlap with B. leucosticta the males can be distinguished by the colour of the veins and the genital lobe, as well as by the ventral structure of segment 8. The females cannot yet be told apart. The length of this dragonfly is from and the span of the hindwings is . ==Distribution== Brachythemis impartita is found from central Africa as far south as the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Tanzania north through Africa and to the Mediterraean Sea. Its range also extends into the Middle East where it has been recorded from the Arabian Peninsula, the Levant, Cyprus and southern Anatolia. It has colonised southern Europe and was first recorded there in Portugal in 1957 but it is now also found in Spain, Sardinia, Corsica, Sicily and by 2015 in mainland Italy. ==Habitat and biology== Brachythemis impartita is generally a lower level species of slow moving rivers, lakes and still waters in rather open landscapes. It prefers waters with softer substrates such as sand and, possibly mud. Both this species and B. leucosticta are well known in Africa for their habit of following and flying around larger animals, including people, to catch insects disturbed by their passage. Where they occur these dragonflies can be the most common species of Odonata. ==Taxonomy== Ngaoundaba Ranch Ngaoundaba Landscape Brachythemis impartita was formerly considered a synonym of B. leucosticta but workers noted that the adult males came in two morphs and that the ranges of the morphs overlapped in central Africa. Although the females could not be told apart the differences in the males were consistent, especially the colour of the genitalia and the permanent bands on the outer wings. The name Brachythemis impartita was given to specimens collected in at Ngaoundaba Ranch in Cameroon and described as Zonothrasys impartitus by Ferdinand Karsch in 1890. Cameroon lies within the range of B. impartita and so these were designated as neotypes. It may be that where the two species overlap, B. leucosticta breeds on muddy substrates while B. impartita prefers sandier areas. ==References== Category:Dragonflies of Europe Category:Libellulidae Category:Insects described in 1890 ","title":"Brachythemis impartita"},{"id":"61547159","text":"Dan Godsil (born August 19, 1996) is an American football long snapper who is a free agent.

Ramsay was elected Tory MP for Stirlingshire at the 1831 general election, when invited to do so by Thomas Stirling, and campaigned on a platform of a determination to \\"uphold unimpaired the institutions of the country\\". He said, however, he was \\"free and unfettered from any pledges whatever\\" but claimed to be \\"friendly to a fair, liberal safe and equitably reform\\" but \\"decidedly opposed\\" to \\"altogether too sweeping and irrevocable reforms\\".

He was also a Zionist and volunteered for service in Palestine before the war. == Early life == Salomon Klass was born to a family of eight children in Helsinki, Finland, in 1907. His father was Jerechmiel Klass, a store owner, and his mother was Bassja Braine Klass. The family had moved from Latvia to Finland between 1899 and 1901. Klass joined the voluntary right-wing White Guard militia and received his military training there. He rose to the rank of company commander, but was forced to transfer to a different unit after rising antisemitism in 1933. He served in that unit until leaving for Palestine in 1935. He lived four years in Palestine, fighting for the underground Etzel resistance movement against British rule. Author John B. Simon calls Klass \\"both a Finnish patriot and an ardent Zionist\\". ==Service in the Finnish Army== After the 1939 Finnish mobilization, Klass returned to Finland to fight in the Winter War against the Soviet Union. He commanded a company that defended Maksima Island in Lake Ladoga. Initially, the unit successfully repelled a Soviet assault on the island that was using tanks as snowplows on the frozen lake, after Finnish artillery shattered the ice and some of the tanks fell through. However, by February 1940, the Finnish troops on the island had suffered high casualties and the Soviets put more pressure on the defenders. On 24 February, a Soviet machine-gunner's bullet entered his skull, permanently disabling one of his eyes. He rested in a military hospital until the end of the Winter War. Despite his status as a war invalid, he returned to service in the military to train conscripts in the autumn of 1940. After the outbreak of the Continuation War, which pitted Germany and Finland against the Soviet Union during World War II, Klass was assigned to be the company commander of the Infantry Regiment 11 First Company in the Kiestinki sector near Uhtua. The infantry regiment was subordinate to the German Army of Norway, and Klass had daily exchanges with German and Austrian soldiers. Once, a commander of a German division, Colonel Pilgrim, paid a surprise visit to Klass's command position to compliment him on his work and asked if he was from the Baltic region, due to his accent when speaking German. Klass answered that his native language was Yiddish and that he was Jewish, to which Pilgrim responded by standing up and saying, \\"I have nothing personal against you as a Jew\\", doing the Hitler salute and leaving the tent. === Iron Cross nomination === North of the Kiestinki region, the Soviets had fortified a hill which German troops were planning to assault. In preparation for this, Finnish artillery shelled the hill, and in the barrage intervals, Klass's company prevented seven counter-attacks by the Soviets. German troops conquered the hill with ease and Salomon Klass was on a list of Finnish personnel to be awarded the German Iron Cross. Klass asked his superior to remove his name from the list, and was instead awarded the Finnish Order of the Cross of Liberty, 3rd Class. Klass did this to avoid damaging good working relations with the Germans. The other two Finnish Jews awarded the Iron Cross, Major Leo Skurnik and nurse Dina Poljakoff, also refused the award. == Post-war == After his discharge from the army at the end of World War II, Klass emigrated to Sweden, where he was involved in the fur trade. He wrote his memoirs under the title Minnen från Vinterkriget och Fortsättningskriget 1939–1945 (Memories from the Winter War and the Continuation War, 1939–1945). == References == === Bibliography === * === Journals === * == External links == * The war memoirs of Salomon Klass at the Fenno-Judaica website Category:Finnish Jews Category:Finnish military personnel of World War II Category:Finnish officers Category:Irgun members Category:1907 births Category:1985 deaths Category:People from Helsinki Category:People of Latvian-Jewish descent Category:Finnish emigrants to Sweden Category:Finnish expatriates in Mandatory Palestine Category:Finnish people of Latvian descent ","title":"Salomon Klass"},{"id":"61547558","text":"\\"Louie Louie\\" is by some accounts the world's most recorded rock song with published estimates ranging from over 1,600 to more than 2,000.

His estates were at Bagworth and Baltinglass. Harington was in command of troops in 1599 under the Earl of Essex in his military expedition of 1599–1600 to Ireland during the Nine Year's War. He was defeated at the Battle of Deputy's Pass near Arklow on 29 May 1599 by the forces of Felim McFiach O'Byrne, with the loss of 250 soldiers. There was a court-martial, and two captains were sentenced to death, and the troops of Captain Loftus were decimated by lot. Harington never had a significant military command again. Later in the same year his cousin Sir John Harington of Kelston wrote to Anthony Standen from Athlone with news of another incident. Henry Harington had met the Irish leader \\"Rorie Ogie\\" or Rory Og for a parley or negotiation, but was abducted by him for ransom. Harington's friends would not send a ransom but surrounded his house with 100 soldiers. Rory Og wounded Harington 14 times and then escaped through the cordon. The English soldiers were frightened of Rory Og and thought he had compelled them not to touch him by magic.Clare Carroll, Circe's Cup: Cultural Transformations in Early Modern Writing about Ireland (Cork, 2001), pp. 73-4: Ian Grimble, The Harington Family (New York, 1957), p. 130: Thomas Park, Nugae Antique by Sir John Harington, vol. 1 (London, 1804), pp. 267-8: Orlando Furioso in English heroical verse, by Sr Iohn Harington of Bathe Knight (London, 1607), book 12 note. In 1608 he began to build a castle at Carnew. In his will, Harington initially nominated Jonas Quarles, brother of the author Francis Quarles, as his executor, but changed his mind.

Constructed in 1877, the site operated as a poorhouse and farm until 1947, and as an old age home until 1971. In the 1980s, the building was repurposed to house the Wellington County Museum and Archives. The Wellington County House of Industry and Refuge was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1995 based on its illustration of 19th century attitudes towards poverty and the origins of Canada's social safety net. ==History== During the middle to late 19th century, Ontario's transition from a predominantly agricultural to an industrialized economy left many residents, particularly the elderly, in precarious financial positions. Following pressure from a citizen's committee, the House of Industry Act was passed by the provincial legislature in 1837, officially establishing institutions that would provide assistance for the poor and ill who were unable to support themselves, as well as able-bodied indigents — provided that they were \\"diligently employed in labour\\". The Municipal Institutions Act of 1866 required all counties with populations above 20,000 to construct such institutions, but this decision was strongly opposed and an 1867 amendment negated this requirement. Only nine poorhouses were established under this legislation: the Wellington County House of Industry was the fourth and the oldest still standing, as well as the only surviving poorhouse constructed prior to 1903. Three inmates of the House of Industry, circa 1900 The land for the House was purchased by the Wellington County Council in 1876. Of the 50 acre (20 ha) plot situated between the towns of Fergus and Elora, Ontario, were dedicated to agricultural activities, where residents (then called inmates) would work to earn their keep. In 1886 and 1937, additional land was purchased, expanding the lot to its current size of . The House of Industry was initially designed to accommodate 65 residents, offering admission to the \\"virtuous and respectable poor\\". Over a thousand people were admitted to the institution during its first 30 years of operation, predominantly older, working-class men who had previously been unskilled labourers. At the urging of the House's physician, Dr. Abraham Groves, a hospital wing was added in 1893 to accommodate increasing numbers of elderly and infirm inmates. Accommodations at the poorhouse were spartan. Residents' rooms were furnished only with beds, nightstands and straight-back chairs. In 1877, the House was reported to spend less than 76 cents per week on the care of each inmate. Inmates were also bound to strict rules: they were forbidden from leaving the property without permission from the keeper of the house, and visitations were restricted to half a day, once per week. Married couples were not permitted to cohabit and were housed in separate wings of the building. The rural location of the House (common for Ontario houses of industry) served to further isolate inmates from their friends and family. The House's goal of financing itself through agricultural production proved unsuccessful, as the inmates were largely elderly or in ill health; able- bodied young men were deemed unworthy of assistance. It became necessary to hire outside workers to maintain the house and farm. In 1889, the House's inspector remarked on the revenue produced by inmates' labour that \\"No estimate has been made and it would be very hard to furnish any that is reliable. Many do nothing and others do so little.\\" It is estimated that in 1911, only 14% of the operational costs of the Ontario Houses of Refuge were covered by agricultural work. The House of Industry operated as a poorhouse for seventy years from its 1877 opening until 1947, when it was renamed and repurposed as the Wellington County Home for the Aged. In 1955, a large addition was made to the rear of the building, providing additional accommodations for the home's residents. The Home for the Aged closed in 1971, and between 1987 and 1988 the main building was extensively renovated to convert it to the Wellington Museum and Archives. The museum now hosts exhibits pertaining to the House of Industry and local history. In 1995, the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada recognized the Wellington County House of Industry and Refuge as a National Historic Site. This designation was based on the House's demonstration of 19th century attitudes towards the poor, its role in the genesis of Canada's social welfare system, and the preservation of the site's original buildings and landscape. ==Architecture== ===Exterior=== Exterior of the House of Industry, circa 1890 The main feature of the site is the residential building, a two-storey stone masonry building designed in an Italianate style by Guelph architect Victor Stewart in 1876. Stewart unexpectedly left town during the building's construction, leaving the completion of the project to local architect C. J. Soule. The building, completed in 1877, sits on a raised basement on a hilltop overlooking the Grand River. Its overall structure consists of five symmetrical pavilions with the entry and end pavilions projecting outwards, a design popular in contemporary public buildings of the British Empire. A belfry adorns the central pavilion, and the building's exterior is ornamented with an extensively bracketed cornice and segmental arches over the windows. The entry and end pavilions are emphasized with quoining, and stone sill courses separate the two stories. The roof is shallow with deep eaves, a design more decorative than practical for the Canadian climate. Aside from the addition of a porch to the main entrance in 1907, the front and sides of the building remain as they were in 1877. A hospital wing, similar in design to the original building, was added to the east rear in 1893, and a further rear addition was built in 1955 to better accommodate residents during the site's use as an old age home. The back of the building, including the 1950s addition, has been largely obscured by a two-storey addition constructed during the 1980s conversion of the building to the Wellington Museum and Archives. This addition is identifiably modern in its design, with a concrete exterior. A variety of agricultural buildings are located west of the house. Except for a hog pen and tool shed that was demolished in the 1970s, these 19th century buildings have been preserved. A timber-frame barn, constructed in 1877 by John Taylor from Elora, served as the centre of the poorhouse's agricultural activities, the lower level housing dairy cows while the upper level was used to store hay. The structure is supported by king-post trusses and lined with vertical sheathing board. A root cellar is located on the south end of the barn, and a silo was added to the barn's east end in 1914. A storage shed and driveshed dating to 1888 are located nearby. A cemetery was established in 1888 on the east end of the poorhouse grounds. It remained in use until 1946, and 271 residents of the House were buried there, their graves marked with simple wooden crosses. A stone monument was erected on the cemetery grounds in 1951 and evergreen trees were planted. In 2013, the cemetery was restored by museum staff and officially opened to the public. ===Interior=== During the site's use as a poorhouse, the centre pavilion housed a well appointed, two-storey keeper's residence while separate wings for male and female inmates, laid out in dormitory style with sparse furnishings, were located on each side of the building. The building's basement housed kitchen and laundry services. The interior structure was preserved until the museum conversion, which involved the construction of a two-storey addition linking the main building to the hospital wing. This conversion required relocation of the main stairs in the central pavilion, removal of two stairwells in the side wings that did not conform to building codes, and removal of the doors separating the keeper's residence from the side wings. ==References== ==External links== * Additional photos related to the Wellington County House of Industry and Refuge * Wellington County Museum and Archives website Category:Museums in Wellington County, Ontario Category:Buildings and structures on the National Historic Sites of Canada register Category:National Historic Sites in Ontario ","title":"Wellington County House of Industry and Refuge"},{"id":"61547656","text":"The Sasse Museum of Art, formerly known as the Inland Empire Museum of Art (IEMA), was founded 2015 in as a nonprofit art museum located in Upland, California.

He fought in both World Wars and acted as Chief of Staff during several campaigns in World War II. == Early life == Henning von Thadden was born in Brzeg (German: Brieg), Lower Silesia (now in Poland) to regimental commander Wilhelm von Thadden. From 1903 he attended schools in Świdnica (Schweidnitz), Frankfurt (Oder) and Magdeburg. He graduated from the Knights' Academy in Legnica (Liegnitz) and shortly afterwards joined the imperial German army as an ensign in the 2nd West Prussian Grenadier Regiment. He was promoted to Leutnant in this unit and was deployed to fight in France in 1915. == Military career == Von Thadden was wounded in World War I, but remained in the army after the war serving in various regiments. In 1930, he was posted to the staff of the 4th Division and in 1934 he served in the staff of Military District VIII in Wroclaw. During the invasion of Poland, von Thadden was staff officer of the XVII Army Corps in 1939 and later joined the Battle of France in 1940 in this same capacity. As Chief of Staff of the XVII Army Corps, he participated in the Soviet campaign in 1941. He was Chief of Staff of the 7th Army from March 1943 to July 1943. === 20 July 1944 attempt on Hitler === From 10 July 1944 to 31 December 1944, von Thadden was Chief of Staff of Defence District Command I in Königsberg.

ANNs adopt the basic model of neuron analogues connected to each other in a variety of ways. == Structure == === Neuron === A neuron with label j receiving an input p_j(t) from predecessor neurons consists of the following components: * an activation a_j(t), the neuron's state, depending on a discrete time parameter, * an optional threshold \\\\theta_j, which stays fixed unless changed by learning, * an activation function f that computes the new activation at a given time t+1 from a_j(t), \\\\theta_j and the net input p_j(t) giving rise to the relation :: a_j(t+1) = f(a_j(t), p_j(t), \\\\theta_j), * and an output function f_\\\\text{out} computing the output from the activation :: o_j(t) = f_\\\\text{out}(a_j(t)). Often the output function is simply the identity function. An input neuron has no predecessor but serves as input interface for the whole network. Similarly an output neuron has no successor and thus serves as output interface of the whole network. === Propagation function === The propagation function computes the input p_j(t) to the neuron j from the outputs o_i(t)and typically has the form : p_j(t) = \\\\sum_i o_i(t) w_{ij}. === Bias === A bias term can be added, changing the form to the following: : p_j(t) = \\\\sum_i o_i(t) w_{ij}+ w_{0j}, where w_{0j} is a bias. == Neural networks as functions == Neural network models can be viewed as defining a function that takes an input (observation) and produces an output (decision). \\\\textstyle f : X \\\\rightarrow Y or a distribution over \\\\textstyle X or both \\\\textstyle X and \\\\textstyle Y. Sometimes models are intimately associated with a particular learning rule. A common use of the phrase \\"ANN model\\" is really the definition of a class of such functions (where members of the class are obtained by varying parameters, connection weights, or specifics of the architecture such as the number of neurons, number of layers or their connectivity). Mathematically, a neuron's network function \\\\textstyle f(x) is defined as a composition of other functions \\\\textstyle g_i(x), that can further be decomposed into other functions. This can be conveniently represented as a network structure, with arrows depicting the dependencies between functions. A widely used type of composition is the nonlinear weighted sum, where \\\\textstyle f (x) = K \\\\left(\\\\sum_i w_i g_i(x)\\\\right) , where \\\\textstyle K (commonly referred to as the activation function) is some predefined function, such as the hyperbolic tangent, sigmoid function, softmax function, or rectifier function. The important characteristic of the activation function is that it provides a smooth transition as input values change, i.e. a small change in input produces a small change in output. The following refers to a collection of functions \\\\textstyle g_i as a vector \\\\textstyle g = (g_1, g_2, \\\\ldots, g_n). ANN dependency graph This figure depicts such a decomposition of \\\\textstyle f, with dependencies between variables indicated by arrows. These can be interpreted in two ways. The first view is the functional view: the input \\\\textstyle x is transformed into a 3-dimensional vector \\\\textstyle h, which is then transformed into a 2-dimensional vector \\\\textstyle g, which is finally transformed into \\\\textstyle f. This view is most commonly encountered in the context of optimization. The second view is the probabilistic view: the random variable \\\\textstyle F = f(G) depends upon the random variable \\\\textstyle G = g(H), which depends upon \\\\textstyle H=h(X), which depends upon the random variable \\\\textstyle X. This view is most commonly encountered in the context of graphical models. The two views are largely equivalent. In either case, for this particular architecture, the components of individual layers are independent of each other (e.g., the components of \\\\textstyle g are independent of each other given their input \\\\textstyle h). This naturally enables a degree of parallelism in the implementation. Two separate depictions of the recurrent ANN dependency graph Networks such as the previous one are commonly called feedforward, because their graph is a directed acyclic graph. Networks with cycles are commonly called recurrent. Such networks are commonly depicted in the manner shown at the top of the figure, where \\\\textstyle f is shown as dependent upon itself. However, an implied temporal dependence is not shown. == Backpropagation == Backpropagation training algorithms fall into three categories: * steepest descent (with variable learning rate and momentum, resilient backpropagation); * quasi-Newton (Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno, one step secant); * Levenberg–Marquardt and conjugate gradient (Fletcher–Reeves update, Polak–Ribiére update, Powell–Beale restart, scaled conjugate gradient). === Algorithm === Let N be a network with e connections, m inputs and n outputs. Below, x_1,x_2,\\\\dots denotes vectors in \\\\mathbb{R}^m, y_1,y_2,\\\\dots vectors in \\\\mathbb{R}^n, and w_0, w_1, w_2, \\\\ldots vectors in \\\\mathbb{R}^e. These are called inputs, outputs and weights, respectively. The network corresponds to a function y = f_N(w, x) which, given a weight w, maps an input x to an output y. In supervised learning, a sequence of training examples (x_1,y_1), \\\\dots, (x_p, y_p) produces a sequence of weights w_0, w_1, \\\\dots, w_p starting from some initial weight w_0, usually chosen at random. These weights are computed in turn: first compute w_i using only (x_i, y_i, w_{i-1}) for i = 1, \\\\dots, p. The output of the algorithm is then w_p, giving a new function x \\\\mapsto f_N(w_p, x). The computation is the same in each step, hence only the case i = 1 is described. w_1 is calculated from (x_1, y_1, w_0) by considering a variable weight w and applying gradient descent to the function w\\\\mapsto E(f_N(w, x_1), y_1) to find a local minimum, starting at w = w_0. This makes w_1 the minimizing weight found by gradient descent. == Learning pseudocode == To implement the algorithm above, explicit formulas are required for the gradient of the function w \\\\mapsto E(f_N(w, x), y) where the function is E(y,y')= y-y'^2. The learning algorithm can be divided into two phases: propagation and weight update. === Propagation === Propagation involves the following steps: * Propagation forward through the network to generate the output value(s) * Calculation of the cost (error term) * Propagation of the output activations back through the network using the training pattern target to generate the deltas (the difference between the targeted and actual output values) of all output and hidden neurons. === Weight update === For each weight: * Multiply the weight's output delta and input activation to find the gradient of the weight. * Subtract the ratio (percentage) of the weight's gradient from the weight. The learning rate is the ratio (percentage) that influences the speed and quality of learning. The greater the ratio, the faster the neuron trains, but the lower the ratio, the more accurate the training. The sign of the gradient of a weight indicates whether the error varies directly with or inversely to the weight. Therefore, the weight must be updated in the opposite direction, \\"descending\\" the gradient. Learning is repeated (on new batches) until the network performs adequately. === Pseudocode === Pseudocode for a stochastic gradient descent algorithm for training a three-layer network (one hidden layer): initialize network weights (often small random values) do for each training example named ex do prediction = _neural-net-output_ (network, ex) // forward pass actual = _teacher-output_ (ex) compute error (prediction - actual) at the output units // backward pass // backward pass continued update network weights // input layer not modified by error estimate until error rate becomes acceptably low return the network The lines labeled \\"backward pass\\" can be implemented using the backpropagation algorithm, which calculates the gradient of the error of the network regarding the network's modifiable weights.Werbos, Paul J.

A facemask (also referred to as a protraction facemask, orthopedic facemask, or reverse-pull headgear) is a type of an orthodontic headgear used to treat underbite and other malocclusions where the upper jaw is too far backwards. A metal bar sits in front of the patients face with support from the forehead and chin. Elastics are connected to the metal bar and the teeth - directly through the lips / mouth of the patient.
