His father, Abram Solomonovich Loktev, and his grandfather were steam engine specialists in Kiev, and Abram Loktev created his own bicycle workshop in Kiev in 1912. Abram Loktev was killed when he participated in the First World War from a gas attack in 1918, when Lev Loktev was nine. Lev Loktev graduated from secondary school in 1924 and entered a factory-school, the Mikhail Ratmansky school- plant with Yiddish teaching, while at the same time working as a machinist. After graduation Loktev entered the Kiev Polytechnic Institute where he studied for only a year before being sent to the military mechanical department of the Leningrad Machine-building Institute (LMI, now the Baltic State Technical University) by the Komsolmol, as part of a group of students, when the Soviet Union needed artillery designers. ==Career== Lev Loktev graduated from the Institute in 1933, defended his thesis and was sent to work at Plant No.8 of the People's Commissariat of Armament of the USSR (the NKV) in Podlipki, where he designed his first successful piece of artillery. Many who had studied at the LMI became chief specialists and designers in the defense industry, among them Dmitry Ustinov (who would become the Minister of Defence in 1976), his deputy Vasily Ryabikov, Mark Olevsky and Naum Nosovsky. Ever since his first appearance at the plant Loktev had worked in an active role in designing artillery pieces. Loktev worked successively as a designer, designer-engineer, Deputy Head of Department, Head of Office, Senior Design- Engineer and Deputy Chief Designer. The 61-K air defense gun, one of the many works of Lev Loktev. Loktev succeeded Mikhail Loginov as the latter died of tuberculosis in 1940 as the Chief Designer of Plant No.8, after which he directed design work on the 37 mm 61-K anti-aircraft gun and the 25 mm 72-K anti-aircraft gun as well as a number of 37/45mm deck-mounted anti-aircraft guns and paired or turreted 37mm automatic anti-aircraft guns adopted by the Soviet Army and the Navy. The 72-K anti-aircraft gun, one of the many works of Lev Loktev. As Plant No.8 was evacuated to Sverdlovsk, Perm and Botkinsk in 1941, Loktev took over the post of Deputy Chief Designer in Perm, and developed what would later serve as the basis for the AZP S-60 anti-aircraft gun. He returned to Kaliningrad (now Korolyov, Moscow Oblast) in December, 1942 as Chief Designer of the Plant before becoming Deputy Director and Chief Designer at NII-58. However, with NII-58 focusing on rocketry (in which Loktev was not interested), Loktev refused to take the post. The S-60 anti-aircraft gun, one of the many works of Lev Loktev. Loktev was transferred as a designer of the NKV to the Central Artillery Design Bureau (the TsAKB) as its Head of Department in July, 1943. The TsKAB was the successor to the NII-58, where its director was Vasily Grabin, after having re-based from Gorky Plant No.92 to Kaliningrad. The ZSU-57-2. This self-propelled anti-aircraft gun (SPAAG) is still in service in a number of countries. Following the AZP S-60 57mm autocannon, NII-58 (with Loktev) designed what would become the then-most powerful serial-production self-propelled anti-aircraft gun, the ZSU-57-2 (mounting dual 57mm S-68 cannons in one turret) in 1950. The ZSU-57-2 would also become a frequent sight at Red Square military parades. The enterprise of RKK Energia, where Loktev worked. Following a decree by Nikita Khrushchev in 1959, work on developing artillery weapons throughout the USSR were cut so abruptly that design and technical documents were destroyed. In light of this and seeing no future, Loktev with his team moved from NII-58 to OKB-10 of NII-88, led by gunsmith Yevgeny Charnko (now RKK Energia and TsNIIMash, respectively), where he took active part in work initiated by Sergei Korolyov, and appealed to Charnko with a request to take over development work of underwater rocket launches via the use of R-11F liquid-propellant rockets. The first stage of testing is a launch test from a surfaced submarine, which was completed under the joint leadership of Korolyov and A. P. Abramov. Though the Chief Designer of OKB-10 doubted the technical feasibility of an underwater rocket launch, American progress in this aspect was so provoking that the work had to continue. Work on subsurface launches completed with three successful underwater launches in the White Sea near Severodvinsk. Soviet Navy representatives were satisfied, and a report on the test results was drafted. Korolyov spoke highly of this work, frankly admitting to Charnko that he had little faith in its success. In 1959, with the technical feasibility of deep subsurface rocket launches now proved experimentally, recommendations of the implementation of such launch methods were written and design documents were corrected. Shortly after that Charnko and his deputy, A. Galkin were summoned to the Central Committee of the CPSU, where OKB-10 was offered to relocate to Miass for serial work deployment. Charnko, suffering a heart attack, refused the offer, considering that the work can be done in Kaliningrad, and his team followed suit, refusing to relocate. Despite this situation, with high appreciation on the work done in the field of underwater launches, the Director of NII-88, Alexey Spiridonov, nominated it for the Lenin Prize. However, the \\"stubbornness\\" of Charnko and his team was punished--the nomination did not go through and the Prize was not awarded. OKB-10 was soon transferred to under the lead of Sergei Korolyov under the supervision of his deputy, I. P. Sadovsky, who was engaged in developing solid-propellant rockets. Loktev worked here until his retirement. ==Retirement and death== Loktev retired with pension in December, 1969, and died on April 28, 1981. He was buried in Vagankovo Cemetery, Plot No. 16. ==Comments== Mark Olevsky, then Chief Engineer of Gorky No. 92, the largest artillery factory in 1940, commented on Loktev: Loktev and his work was also mentioned in History of Russian Artillery (1964), 50 years of the Armed Forces of the USSR (1968), and on the 70th anniversary of his birth, Soviet magazine Equipment and Weapons. ==Awards== *Stalin Prize 2nd degree (1941) for work on new models of artillery (the 37 mm automatic air defense gun M1939 (61-K) *Stalin Prize 2nd degree (1943) for development on a new type of artillery (the 25 mm automatic air defense gun M1940 (72-K) Stalin Prize 1st degree (1950) for work in the field of weaponry (the AZP S-60 *Lenin Prize *Order of Lenin *Order of the Red Star ==See also== *Arsenal Machine-Building Plant *Mikhail Loginov ==References== Category:1908 births Category:1981 deaths ","title":"Lev Loktev"},{"id":"60324609","text":"Kulakovka () is a rural locality (a selo) in Tryokhprotoksky Selsoviet, Privolzhsky District, Astrakhan Oblast, Russia.

There are four main types of OGCTs, namely dysgerminomas, yolk sac tumor, teratoma, and choriocarcinoma. Dygerminomas are Malignant germ cell tumor of ovary and particularly prominent in patients diagnosed with gonadal dysgenesis. OGCTs are relatively difficult to detect and diagnose at an early stage because of the nonspecific histological characteristics. Common symptoms of OGCT are bloating, abdominal distention, ascites, and dyspareunia. OGCT is caused mainly due to the formation of malignant cancer cells in the primordial germ cells of the ovary. The exact pathogenesis of OGCTs is still unknown however, various genetic mutations and environmental factors have been identified. OGCTs are commonly found during pregnancy when an adnexal mass is found during a pelvic examination, ultrasound scans show a solid mass in ovary or blood serum test shows elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels. They are unlikely to have metastasized and therefore the standard tumor management is surgical resection, coupled with chemotherapy. The occurrence rate is less than 3% worldwide. == Classification == OGCTs can be classified into dysgerminoma, teratomas, yolk sac tumors, and choriocarcinomas, listed in the order of prevalence. === Dysgerminoma === A micrograph view of dysgerminoma, showing actively dividing lobulated nuclei.Dysgerminomas are comparable to testicular seminomas and account for approximately 32- 37% of all OGCTs. They are particularly prominent in individuals with dysgenic gonads of 46, XY pure gonadal dysgenesis patients. Based on gross examinations, dysgerminomas are characterized by having a ‚Äòsolid, lobulated, tan, flesh-like gross appearance with a smooth surface'. Microscopically, the cellular structure is distinguished by a round-ovoid shape containing ample eosinophilic cytoplasm and an irregularly shaped nuclei. The uniformly positioned cells are separated through the fibrous strands and lymphocytic infiltration is commonly observed. === Teratomas === A alt= Teratoma are most common germ cell tumor of ovary .Teratomas can be divided into two types: mature teratoma (benign) and immature teratoma (malignant). Immature teratomas contain immature or embryonic tissue which significantly differentiates them from mature teratomas as they carry dermoid cysts. It is commonly observed in 15 to 19-year-old women and rarely in women after menopause. Immature teratomas are characterized with a diameter of 14‚Äì25 cm, encapsulated mass, cystic areas, and occasional appearance of hemorrhagic areas. The stage of immature teratomas is determined depending on the amount of immature neuroepithelium tissue detected. === Yolk sac tumor === A alt= The ovarian yolk sac tumors, also known as endodermal sinus tumors, are accountable for approximately 15.5% of all OGCTs. They have been observed in women particularly in their early ages, and rarely after 40 years of age. The critical pathologic features are a smooth external surface and capsular tears due to their rapid rate of growth. A study consisting of 71 individual cases of ovarian yolk sac tumor provides evidence to the proliferation of the tumor. In one of the cases, the pelvic examination revealed normal activity until a 9 cm and 12 cm sized tumor was discovered 4 weeks later. In another case, a 23 cm tumor was discovered in a pregnant woman who was monitored regularly and had normal findings until oophorectomy became essential. Histologically, these tumors are characterized by mixed solid and cystic components. The mixed solid components are characterized by a soft gray to yellow solid components accompanied with significant hemorrhage and necrosis. The cysts are approximately 2 cm in diameter and populated throughout the tissue which results in giving the neoplasm a ‚Äòhoneycombed appearance‚Äô. === Choriocarcinoma === A alt= Choriocarcinomas are exceptionally rare which account for 2.1%-3.4% of all OGCTs. Under gross examination, the syncytiotrophoblast cells are aligned in a plexiform arrangement with the mononucleated cytotrophoblast cells surrounding the foci of the hemorrhage. Choriocarcinomas can be divided into gestational choriocarcinomas and non-gestational choriocarcinomas which have immunohistochemical differences. == Signs and Symptoms == OGCTs are relatively difficult to detect and diagnose at an early stage mainly because the symptoms are normally subtle and nonspecific. They become detectable when as they become large, tangible masses. Symptoms include bloating, abdominal distention, ascites, and dyspareunia. In rare cases where the tumor ruptures, acute abdominal pain can be experienced. The critical indicator of malignancy is usually the appearance of the Sister Mary Joseph Nodule. OGCTs can further give rise to ovarian torsion, hemorrhage, and even isosexual precocious puberty in young children. == Causes == The exact cause of OGCT is yet to be determined. However, a few factors have been identified which may contribute to increased risk of OGCTs including endometriosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and genetic risk factors. Individuals who are more prone to developing OGCTs usually contain the autosomal dominant, BRCA-1/ BRCA-2, mutations. Complications with other cancers such as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, also known as the Lynch syndrome, increases the risk of developing ovarian cancer. Pregnancy, breastfeeding, and oral contraceptives are known to have reduced risk for OGCTs. The etiology of OGCT is still under study, however, genetic alterations may contribute to development of OGCTs, such as the classical tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. Along with genetic modifications, certain environmental factors such as endocrine disruptors, presence of a daily routine that affects the individual's biochemistry, and exposure to maternal hormones could also contribute to the proliferation of OGCT. A recent study on rats showed the transgenerational epigenetic inheritance supporting the influence of hazardous environmental substances, including plastics, pesticides, and dioxins, on the pathogenesis of OGCT. == Pathogenesis == Nonetheless, a few speculations for the causes have been made. During ovulation, the follicle ruptures resulting in epithelial cell damage. In order to heal the tissue and replace the damage, the cells undergoes cell division. Each time the cell divides, there is a possibility for mutations to occur and the chance of tumor formation increases. The tumor is caused when the germ cells in the ovaries begin divide uncontrollably and become malignant which are characterized with their less organized nuclei and unclearly defined border. Another potential etiology is the dysfunctioning of the tumor suppressor gene, TRC8/RNF139, or even karyotypic abnormalities after close molecular examination. OGCT has its roots in embryonic development where the primordial germ cells (PGCs) are isolated in early stages and have the ability to alter the genome as well as the transcriptome. OGCTs can be attributed to the internal mechanism of PGCs and their transforming characteristics. == Staging== After OGCT has been diagnosed, various tests will be conducted to determine whether the cancer has spread to other areas in the body. The spread of OGCT is identified through different stages: stage I, stage II, stage III, and stage IV namely. Stage I: Tumor cells are localized in the ovaries or the fallopian tubes without extensive spread to other body regions. Stage II: The cancer is in one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes and has spread into the pelvis. Stage III: The cancer has spread beyond the pelvis into the abdomen and to the retroperitoneal lymph nodes (located at the back of the abdomen). The substages are characterized by the relative size of the tumor. Note: Stage II ovarian cancer will also be declared if the cancerous cells have spread to the liver. Stage IV: The cancer has spread outside of the abdomen and pelvis to more distant organs, such as the lungs. == Diagnosis == A CT scan shows a solid mass in the pelvis in stage I without yet established blood vessels and septa The preliminary diagnosis begins with a pelvic examination, serum tumor marker test and imaging. Physicians may feel a large palpable mass or lump in lower abdomen upon insertion of the gloved fingers into the vagina. To further identify the histologic subtypes of OGMTs, blood samples of patients are collected to analyse the serum level of biomarkers released by the tumor cells. A surge in the plasma levels of human chorionic gonadotropin and alpha- fetoprotein is indicative of OGMTs. Lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase and cancer antigen 125 might potentially increase as well. To visualize the location and morphology of the tumor, transvaginal ultrasonography is usually employed. The most characteristic appearance is a parenchymal-like heteroechoic mass with sharp borders and high vascularization. Computed tomography would produce stacked image inside the peritoneal region of the body to visualise the lobular pattern of the tumour. Usually for dysgerminoma, solid mass being compartmentalized into lobules with enhancing septa may be evident for haemorrhage or necrosis. === Preoperative procedures === In accordance with FIGO staging guidelines, comprehensive surgical staging will be conducted to examine the extent of tumor spread via peritoneal regions or lymph drainages. 28% of stage II patients will be found with the development of secondary malignant growths at lymph nodes with a distance from a primary site of cancer, called lymph node metastasis. There are three major lymphatic drainage pathways: # drainage to the paraaortic lymph nodes via ovarian veins # drainage from broad ligament to the iliac lymph nodes # drainage from round ligament to the inguinal lymph nodes Palpation or biopsies of unilateral pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes will be conducted as a preoperative step to deduce the prognosis of the tumour and lymphatic spread Peritoneal biopsies and omentectomy will also be employed to evaluate the extent of tumour content spillage or implantation in peritoneal cavity. Tumor cells may shed off from the original site into the peritoneal cavity and implant onto the liver capsule surface or diaphragm. They may clog up inside the lymphatic vessel around the diaphragm and prevent resorption of peritoneal fluid. In the end, pericardiophrenic lymphadenopathy and ascites may result from this frank invasion. == Treatment == === Surgery === Malignant OGCTs are predominantly unilateral and chemosensitive, which means they are localized in only one side of the ovary. Fertility-preserving surgery is primarily standardized to keep the contralateral ovary and fallopian tube intact, also known as unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. For Stage II patients with observable metastasis, cytoreductive surgery may be performed to debulk the volume of the tumor, such as hysterectomy (removal of all or part of the uterus) and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. A surgical incision at the abdominal cavity after the completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, called second look laparotomy, is best applicable for patients reported with teratomatous elements after previous cytoreductive surgery. === Adjuvant Chemotherapy === A schematic diagram showing the operation of alt= With a recurrence up to 15-25% for early-stage patients, adjuvant chemotherapy needs to couple with surgical resection of tumor to ensure full salvage. For systemic chemotherapy (issued orally or intravenously), the regimen is standardised in every FIGO staging to comprise bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin, also known as the BEP treatment. Patients should be issued with 3-4 cycles of BEP to ensure full salvage. Depending on the personalised conditions, some patients who are non-responders to BEP therapy will be prescribed with salvage therapy, which consists of cisplatin, ifosfamide and paclitaxel. Yet, it is likely that OGCT survivors after BEP therapy will have premature menopause at a rough age of 36. Alternatively, some hospitals opted for platinum-based chemotherapy since the platinum complexes present in the drug intervenes DNA transcription by forming chemical cross-links within the DNA strands, which prevents the reproduction of cancerous cells. The major elements are cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin. It has been reported with full recovery among early-stage patients and only a quarter of advanced-stage patients are not salvaged potentially due to drug resistance. For advanced-stage patients, after cytoreductive surgery, invisible microscopic cancerous cells or nodules may still be present at the site of infection. Therefore, doctors may instill a heated chemotherapy solution (~42-43 ¬∞C) into the abdominal cavity through carters tubes for 1.5 hours. Based on the principle that cancer cells normally dies at 40 ¬∞C, somatic cells remains unaffected since they die at 44 ¬∞C. This novel method is proven effective with only 10% recurrence rate and no mortality recorded. It is known as the hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), containing docetaxel, and cisplatin. Given the drug is disseminated locally in intraperitoneal regions, it has no systemic side effects on other actively reproducing cells and is preferred over systemic chemotherapy. Typically, uncontrollable drug distribution in systemic chemotherapy results in myelosuppression, specifically with observed febrile neutropenia, neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, and nephrotoxicity. Remedial treatments to deal with chemotherapy-induced toxicities is through injection of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or myeloid growth factors or oral intake of prophylactic antibiotics. == Epidemiology == OGCT is a rare tumour under the scope of ovarian cancer, accounting for less than 5% of all ovarian malignancies. It occurs mostly in 15-19-year-old women and shows 75% incidence rate for women aged <30 years. In 2011, the number of new cases occurred worldwide is 5.3 per million. In most countries, the occurrence rate on average is less than 3% of the population. However, Asia has reported the highest proportion of cases up to 4.3% due to the younger age profile of the population. For other regions, the incidence rates reported are 2.5% in Oceania, 2.0% in North America and 1.3% in Europe. The five-year survival rates have reached up to 90-92%, which is much higher than that of epithelial ovarian cancers. The main reason is the high effectiveness of platinum-based chemotherapy. == References == == External links == Category:Ovarian cancer ","title":"Ovarian germ cell tumors"},{"id":"60324683","text":"Up Jumped Benny is a live album by saxophonist/composer Benny Golson that was recorded in 1996 and originally released by the Arkadia Jazz label.Arkadia Jazz discography: album details accessed March 25, 2019Benny Golson website: discography accessed March 25, 2019Jazzdisco: Benny Golson catalog accessed March 25, 2019 ==Reception== The AllMusic review by Richard S.

The subspecies transvaalensis is sometimes called pokkiesblom in Afrikaans. == Description == Felicia clavipilosa subsp. clavipilosa is an upright, richly branched shrub of up to high. The stems are woody and pale brown, but in the upper part herbaceous, green, with appressed hairs or very glandular, especially near the tips, and then with perpendicular bristles. The leaves are arranged alternately, lack a leaf stalk, are narrowly lance-shaped to narrowly inverted lance-shaped in outline, long and 1‚Äì3 mm (0.04‚Äì0.14 in) wide, flat, with a single vein, bristly hairs pressed against the surface, or perpendicular bristly and glandularly hairy. The flower heads sit individually at the tip of an indistinct inflorescence stalk. These stalks are up to about 2 cm long, leafy, mostly covered in protruding bristly hairs and glands. The greenish involucre that envelops the florets is up to in diameter, and consists of three to four rows of overlapping bracts that are lance-shaped to inverted lance-shaped. The bracts in the outer whorl are about long and wide, covered in bristly hair and often with glands. The bracts in the inner whorl are about 3 mm (0.14 in) long and mm (0.03 in) wide, eventually hairless and have an indistinct papery margin. About twenty five female ray florets have pale violet straps of about 5 mm (0.22 in) long and 1 mm (0.04 in) wide. In the center of the head are many yellow, bisexual disc florets of about long. In the center of the corolla of each disc floret are five anthers merged into a tube, through which the style grows when the floret opens, hoovering up the pollen on its shaft. The style in both ray- and disc florets forks, and at the tip of both style branches is a triangular appendage. Surrounding the base of the corolla are white, serrated, deciduous pappus bristles of about long. The eventually yellowish brown, dry, one-seeded, indehiscent fruits called cypsellae are inverted egg-shaped, about long and wide, with a prominent ridge along the margin, with some scales on its surface and unique, short, club-shaped hairs. === Differences between the subspecies === The subspecies transvaalensis is a tetraploid (4n=36) that differs from the diploid nominate subsp. clavipilosa (2n=18) by its much wider leaves of up to , is always set with perpendicular, bristly hairs and never has glands. It is also characterised by longer involucral bracts that may be long in the inner whorl, and the ray florets that are almost always white. Finally, the sterile cypselae are quick to loose their club-shaped hairs. === Differences with related species === F. clavipilosa differs from all other Felicia species by the club-shaped hairs on the cypselae. It differs from F. deserti by its strongly branching habit, subsp. clavipilosa in addition differs by the always protruding bristly hairs. Young branches of F. hyssopifolia are white felty. == Taxonomy == Rudolf Schlechter was the first to recognise the distinctiveness of this species from F. hyssopifolia, but he never published a description or name. J√ºrke Grau described it in his 1973 Revision of the genus Felicia, based on a collection made near Klein Windhoek in Namibia by Hermann Merxm√ºller and Willi Giess in 1957, and he named it Felicia clavipilosa. He described in the same publication a somewhat different form, collected by Cornelis Eliza Bertus Bremekamp and Herold Georg Wilhelm Johannes Schweickerdt at the westside of Soutpansberg in 1931, which he called F. clavipilosa subsp. transvaalensis. The species is considered to be part of the section Felicia. == Distribution, ecology and conservation == Felicia clavipilosa subsp. clavipilosa occurs in Botswana, Namibia, southern and western Zimbabwe, Northern Cape and North West provinces of South Africa. In Zambia an isolated population occurs near Lusaka. In Zimbabwe it grows in open, often disturbed places in woodland and grassland. F. clavipilosa subsp. transvaalensis can be found in southeastern Botswana, the Limpopo, Gauteng, and Mpumalanga provinces of South Africa, and western, central and southern Zimbabwe. In South Africa, the continued survival of both subspecies is considered to be of least concern. == References == == External links == * line drawing of subsp. clavipilosa * line drawing of subsp. transvaalensis * line drawing cypsela figure 5 * distribution map of subsps. clavipilosa and transvaalensis claviculata Category:Flora of Southern Africa Category:Flora of South Tropical Africa Category:Plants described in 1973 ","title":"Felicia clavipilosa"},{"id":"60324922","text":"The Melbourne International Gateway, colloquially known as The Cheese Stick or Cheesestick, is a giant yellow sculptural work and iconic roadside attraction of the CityLink motorway near the airport in the Flemington area of Melbourne, the state capital of Victoria, Australia.

UN forces, having been repeatedly defeated by the advancing North Koreans, were forced back to the \\"Pusan Perimeter\\", a defensive line around an area on the southeastern tip of the Korean Peninsula that included the port of Pusan. The UN troops, consisting mostly of forces from the South Korea and the United States (US) mounted a last stand around the perimeter, fighting off repeated North Korean attacks for six weeks as they were engaged around the cities of Taegu, Masan, and Pohang and the Naktong River. The massive North Korean assaults were unsuccessful in forcing the UN forces back further from the perimeter, despite two major pushes in August and September. Following the UN counterattack at Inchon on 15 September, on 16 September UN forces within the Pusan Perimeter mounted an offensive to drive back the North Koreans and link up with the UN forces at Inchon. ==Background== The Inchon landing put the US X Corps in the rear of the Korean People's Army (KPA). Concurrently, US Eighth Army was to launch a general attack all along its front to fix and hold the KPA's main combat strength and prevent movement of units from the Pusan Perimeter to reinforce the threatened area in his rear. This attack would also strive to break the KPA cordon that had for six weeks held Eighth Army within a shrinking Pusan Perimeter. If Eighth Army succeeded in breaking the cordon it was to drive north to effect a linkup with X Corps in the Seoul area. ===Planning=== The Eighth Army published its attack plan on 6 September, and the next day it was sent to Tokyo for approval. Eighth Army revised the plan on 11 September, and on the 16th made it an operations directive. It set the hour for attack by UN and Republic of Korea Army (ROK) forces in the Perimeter at 09:00, 16 September, one day after the Inchon landing. The U.S. Eighth and the ROK armies were to attack \\"from present bridgehead with main effort directed along the Taegu-Kumch'on-Taejon-Suwon axis,\\" to destroy the KPA forces \\"on line of advance,\\" and to effect a \\"junction with X Corps.\\" The operations directive required the newly formed US I Corps in the center of the Perimeter line to strive for the main breakthrough. The following reasons dictated this concept: (1) the distance to the link-up area with X Corps was shorter than that from elsewhere around the Perimeter, (2) the road net was better and had easier grades, (3) the road net offered the armor better opportunity to exploit a breakthrough, and (4) supply to advancing columns would be easier. The plan called for the US 5th Regimental Combat Team and the 1st Cavalry Division to seize a bridgehead over the Naktong River near Waegwan. The US 24th Infantry Division would then cross the river and drive on Kumch'on-Taejon, followed by the 1st Cavalry Division which would patrol its rear and lines of communications. While this breakthrough attempt was in progress, the 25th and 2nd Infantry Divisions in the south on the army left flank and the ROK II and I Corps on the east and right flank were to attack and fix the KPA troops in their zones and to exploit any local breakthrough. The ROK 17th Regiment was to move to Pusan for water movement to Inchon to join X Corps. Supplementing the 5th Regimental Combat Team's mission of establishing a bridgehead across the Naktong, the US 2nd and 24th Divisions were to strive for crossings of the river below Waegwan and the ROK 1st Infantry Division above it. Execution of this plan was certain to run into difficulties because the engineer troops and bridging equipment available to General Walker were not adequate for several quick crossings. Eighth Army had equipment for only two pontoon treadway bridges across the Naktong. To help replace the Marine Air squadrons taken from the Eighth Army front for the Inchon operation, Fifth Air Force commander General Stratemeyer obtained the transfer from the 20th Air Force on Okinawa to Itazuke Air Base, Japan, of the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing and the 16th and 25th Fighter-Interceptor Squadrons. The situation at the Pusan Perimeter did not afford Eighth Army commander General Walton Walker an opportunity to concentrate a large force for the breakout effort in the center. The KPA held the initiative and their attacks pinned down all divisions under Eighth Army command except one, the US 24th Infantry Division, which Walker was able to move piecemeal from the east to the center only on the eve of the projected attack. The problem was to change suddenly from a precarious defense to the offensive without reinforcement or opportunity to create a striking force. In theater perspective, Eighth Army would make a holding attack while X Corps made the envelopment. A prompt link-up with X Corps along the Taejon-Suwon axis was a prerequisite for cutting off a large force of North Koreans in the southwestern part of the peninsula. Eighth Army anticipated that the news of the Inchon landing would have a demoralizing effect on the North Koreans in front of it and an opposite effect on the spirit of its own troops. For this reason, General Walker had requested that the Eighth Army attack not begin until the day after the Inchon landing. While the news of the successful landing spread to Eighth Army troops at once on the 15th, apparently it was not allowed to reach the KPA forces in front of Eighth Army until several days later. The corridors of advance in the event of a breakout from the Perimeter necessarily would be the same that the KPA had used in its drive south. KPA forces blocked every road leading out of the Perimeter. The axis of the main effort required the use of the highway from the Naktong opposite Waegwan to Kumch'on and across the Sobaek Mountains to Taejon. A second corridor, the valley of the Naktong northward to the Sangju area, could be used if events warranted it. The Taegu-Tabu-dong ()-Sangju road traversed this corridor, with crossings of the Naktong River possible at Sonsan and Naktong-ni (). From Sangju the line of advance could turn west toward the Kum River above Taejon or bypass Taejon for a more direct route to the Suwon-Seoul area. Eastward in the mountainous central sector, the ROK would find the best route of advance by way of Andong and Wonju. On the east coast they had no alternative to a drive straight up the coastal road toward Yongdok and Wonsan. An important step taken by the Far East Command in preparation for the offensive was the establishment of Corps organization within Eighth Army. Up to this time Eighth Army had controlled directly the four infantry divisions and other attached ground forces of regimental and brigade size. Beginning in August, preparations were made to provide Eighth Army with two corps. On 2 August, I Corps was activated at Fort Bragg, with General John B. Coulter in command. Eleven days later General Coulter and a command group arrived in Korea and began studies preparatory to a breakout effort from the Perimeter. The main body of the corps staff arrived in Korea on 6 September, but it still had no troops assigned to it. IX Corps was activated on 10 August at Fort Sheridan, with Maj. Gen. Frank W. Milburn in command. General Milburn and a small group of staff officers departed Fort Sheridan on 5 September by air for Korea. The main body of the corps staff, however, did not reach Korea until the end of September and the first part of October. Both I and IX Corps had previously been part of Eighth Army in Japan, the I Corps with the 24th and 25th Divisions with headquarters in Kyoto, and the IX Corps with the 1st Cavalry and the 7th Divisions with headquarters in Sendai. General Walker had decided to group the main breakout forces under I Corps. He gave long and serious thought to the question of a commander for the corps. Walker eventually shifted General Milburn on 11 September from IX Corps to I Corps and General Coulter from I Corps to IX Corps. Milburn assumed command of I Corps that day at Taegu and Coulter assumed command of IX Corps the next day at Miryang. I Corps became operational at 12:00, 13 September, with the US 1st Cavalry Division, the 5th Regimental Combat Team and the ROK 1st Division attached. On 15 and 16 September the 5th Regimental Combat Team and the 24th Division moved to the Taegu area, and by the evening of 16 September I Corps comprised the US 24th and 1st Cavalry Divisions, the 5th Regimental Combat Team, the British 27th Infantry Brigade, the ROK 1st Division and supporting troops. During the first week of the offensive IX Corps was not operational. It became so at 14:00, 23 September, on Eighth Army orders which attached to it the US 25th and 2nd Infantry Divisions and their supporting units. Until 23 September, therefore, these two divisions operated directly under Eighth Army command. The delay was principally because of a critical lack of communications personnel and equipment. The Signal battalion and the communications equipment intended for this corps had been diverted to X Corps. Even after IX Corps became operational the lack of proper communications facilities hampered its operations. ===Opposing forces=== On the eve of offensive US intelligence estimated that the KPA had 13 infantry divisions on line supported by 1 armored division and 2 armored brigades, with the KPA I Corps on the southern half of the front having 6 infantry divisions with armored support‚Äî a strength of 47,417 men, and the II Corps on the northern and eastern half of the front having 7 infantry divisions with armored support‚Äîa strength of 54,000 men. This made a total of 101,417 enemy soldiers around the Perimeter. KPA formations were estimated to be at an average of 75 percent strength in troops and equipment. The estimate credited the KPA with sufficient strength to be able to divert three divisions from the Pusan Perimeter to the Seoul area without endangering their ability to defend effectively their positions around the Perimeter. The estimate stated, \\"Currently the enemy is on the offensive and retains this capability in all general sectors of the Perimeter. It is not expected that this capability will decline in the immediate future.\\" With respect to both KPA troop strength and equipment the Eighth Army estimate was far too high. Although it is not possible to state precisely the strength of the KPA units facing Eighth Army in mid-September and the state of their equipment, an examination of prisoner of war interrogations and captured documents reveals that it was far less than Eighth Army. The Chief of Staff, KPA 13th Division, Col. Lee Hak Ku, gave the strength of that division as 2,300 men (not counting 2,000 untrained and unarmed replacements not considered as a part of the division) instead of the 8,000 carried in the Eighth Army estimate. The KPA 15th Division, practically annihilated by this time, numbered no more than a few hundred scattered and disorganized men instead of the 7,000 men in the Eighth Army estimate. Also, the KPA 5th Division was down to about 5,000 men instead of 6,500, and the KPA 7th Division was down to about 4,000 men instead of the estimated 7,600. The KPA 1st, 2nd and 3rd Divisions almost certainly did not begin to approach the strength of 7,000-8,000 men each in mid-September accorded to them in the estimate. KPA losses were exceedingly heavy in the first half of September. No one can accurately say just what they were. A fair estimate of KPA strength facing Eighth Army at the Perimeter in mid-September would be about 70,000 men. KPA, far below the Eighth Army 75 percent estimate of a few days earlier, particularly in heavy weapons and tanks, was probably no more than 50 percent of the original equipment. Morale in the KPA was at a low point. No more than 30 percent of the original troops of the divisions remained. These veterans tried to impose discipline on the recruits, most of whom were from South Korea and had no desire to fight for the North Koreans. It was common practice in the KPA at this time for the veterans to shoot anyone who showed reluctance to go forward when ordered or who tried to desert. Food was scarce, and undernourishment was the most frequently mentioned cause of low morale by prisoners. Even so, there had been few desertions up to this time because the men were afraid the UN forces would kill them if they surrendered and that their own officers would shoot them if they made the attempt. Standing opposite approximately 70,000 KPA soldiers at the Pusan Perimeter in mid- September were 140,000 men in the combat units of the Eighth Army and the ROK. These comprised four US divisions with an average of 15,000 men each for a total of more than 60,000 men, to which more than 9,000 attached ROK recruits must be added, and six ROK divisions averaging about 10,000 men each with a total of approximately 60,000 men. The three Corps' headquarters added at least another 10,000 men, and if the two army headquarters were counted the total would be more than 150,000 men. ==Offensive== ===Crossing the Naktong=== The morning of 16 September dawned over southern Korea with murky skies and heavy rain. The weather was so bad the air force canceled a B-29 saturation bombing scheduled against the KPA positions in the Waegwan area. The general attack set for 09:00 did not swing into motion everywhere around the Perimeter at the appointed hour for the simple reason that at many places the KPA were attacking and UN troops defending. Only in a few places were significant gains made on the first day of the offensive. The ROK 15th Regiment, 1st Division advanced to the right of the KPA strongpoint at the Walled City north of Taegu in a penetration of the KPA line. Southward, the US 2nd Division after hard fighting broke through to the hills overlooking the Naktong River. The most spectacular success of the first day occurred in the 2nd Division zone. There, west of Yongsan and Changnyong, the 2nd Division launched a 3-regiment attack with the 9th Infantry Regiment on the left, the 23rd Infantry Regiment in the center and the 38th Infantry Regiment on the right. Its first mission was to drive the KPA 4th, 9th and 2nd Divisions back across the Naktong. The attack on the left failed as the KPA continued to hold Hill 201 against all attacks of the 9th Infantry. In the center, a vicious KPA predawn attack penetrated the perimeter of C Company, 23rd Infantry, and caused twenty-five casualties, which included all company officers and the platoon leader of the attached heavy weapons platoon. On the 15th, the 3rd Battalion had returned to regimental control from attachment to the 1st Cavalry Division, and because it had not been involved in the preceding two weeks of heavy fighting, Regiment commander Colonel Paul L. Freeman Jr. assigned it the main attack effort in the 23rd Infantry zone. After the early morning attack on the 16th was repulsed, Lt. Col. R. G. Sherrard ordered his 3rd Battalion to move out at 10:00 in attack, with C Company of the 72nd Tank Company in support. KPA resistance was stubborn and effective until about midafternoon when the North Koreans began to vacate their positions and flee toward the Naktong. To take advantage of such a break in the fighting, a special task force comprising B Battery, 82nd Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion and the 23rd Regimental Tank Company had been formed for the purpose of advancing rapidly to cut off the KPA. From about 16:00 until dark this task force with its heavy volume of automatic fire cut down large numbers of fleeing KPA along the river. The weather had cleared in the afternoon and numerous air strikes added to the near annihilation of part of the routed army. The 38th Infantry on the right kept pace with the 23rd Infantry in the center. Four F-51s Napalmed, rocketed, and strafed just ahead of the 38th Infantry, contributing heavily to the 2nd Battalion's capture of Hill 208 overlooking the Naktong River. Fighter planes operating in the afternoon caught and strafed large groups of KPA withdrawing toward the river west of Changnyong. That night the KPA 2nd Division command post withdrew across the river, followed by the 4th, 6th and 17th Rifle Regiments and the division artillery regiment. Their crossings continued into the next day. On the 17th, air attacks took a heavy toll of KPA soldiers trying to escape across the Naktong in front of the 2nd Division. During the day, fighter planes dropped 260 110-gallon tanks of napalm on the enemy in this sector and strafed many groups west of Changnyong. The fleeing KPA abandoned large quantities of equipment and weapons. In pursuit the 23rd Infantry captured 13 artillery pieces, 6 antitank guns, and 4 mortars; the 38th Infantry captured 6 artillery pieces, 12 antitank guns, 1 self-propelled gun, and 9 mortars. During the morning of 18 September patrols of the 2nd and 3rd Battalions, 38th Infantry, crossed the Naktong near Pugong-ni, due west of Changnyong, and found the high ground on the west side of the river clear of KPA troops. Colonel Peploe, regimental commander, thereupon ordered Lt. Col. James H. Skeldon, 2nd Battalion commander, to send two squads across the river in two-man rubber boats, with a platoon to follow, to secure a bridgehead. Peploe requested authority to cross the river in force at once and at 13:20 he was authorized to move one battalion across the river. Before 16:00, E and F Companies and part of G Company had crossed the wide and deep current. Two hours later the leading elements secured Hill 308 west of the Naktong, dominating the Ch'ogye () road, against only light resistance. This quick crossing clearly had surprised the KPA. From Hill 308 the troops observed an estimated KPA battalion 1,000 yards farther west. That evening Colonel Skeldon requested air cover over the bridgehead area half an hour after first light the next morning. During the day, the 38th Infantry captured 132 prisoners; 32 of them were female nurses, 8 were officers and 1 a major. Near the crossing site on the east bank buried in the sand and hidden in culverts, it found large quantities of supplies and equipment, including more than 125 tons of ammunition, and new rifles still packed in grease. The 38th Infantry's crossing of the Naktong by the 2nd Battalion on 18 September was the first permanent crossing of the river by any unit of Eighth Army in the breakout, and it was the most important event of the day. The crossing was two days ahead of division schedule. On the 19th the 3d Battalion, 38th Infantry, crossed the river, together with some tanks, artillery, and heavy mortars. The 3rd Battalion was to protect the bridgehead while the 2nd Battalion pushed forward against the KPA. In order to support the two battalions now west of the river it was necessary to get vehicles and heavy equipment across to that side. The two destroyed spans of the Changnyong-Ch'ogye highway bridge across the Naktong could not be repaired quickly, so the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion prepared to construct a floating bridge downstream from the crossing site. By the end of the third day of the attack, 18 September, the US 2nd Division had regained control of the ground in its sector east of the Naktong River except the Hill 201 area in the south and Hill 409 along its northern boundary. Elements of the KPA 9th Division had successfully defended Hill 201 against repeated air strikes, artillery barrages, and attacks of the 9th Infantry. At its northern boundary Eighth Army, for the moment, made no effort to capture massive Hill 409. There, air strikes, artillery barrages, and patrol action of the 1st Battalion, 38th Infantry, merely attempted to contain and neutralize this force of the KPA 10th Division. Behind the 2nd Division lines there were many KPA groups, totaling several hundred soldiers, cut off and operating as far as east of the river. ===The 5th Regimental Combat Team captures Waegwan=== The 5th Regimental Combat Team (5th RCT) was attached to the 1st Cavalry Division on 14 September. It went into an assembly area west of Taegu along the east bank of the Naktong River below Waegwan and prepared for action. On 16 September it moved out from its assembly area to begin an operation that was to prove of great importance to the Eighth Army breakout. Numbering 2,599 men, the regiment was 1,194 short of full strength. The three battalions were nearly equal, varying between 586 and 595 men in strength. On the 16th only the 2nd Battalion engaged the KPA as it attacked north along the Naktong River road toward Waegwan, but by the end of the second day the 3rd Battalion had joined in the battle and the 1st Battalion was deployed to enter it. The next day, 19 September, as the 38th Infantry crossed the Naktong, the 5th RCT began its full regimental attack against Hill 268, southeast of Waegwan. An estimated 1,200 soldiers of the KPA 3rd Division, supported by tanks, defended this southern approach to Waegwan. The hills there constituted the left flank of KPA II Corps. If the North Koreans lost this ground their advanced positions in the 5th Cavalry Regiment zone eastward along the Taegu highway would become untenable. The tactical importance of Hill 268 and related positions was made the greater by reason of the gap in the KPA line to the south. At the lower side of this gap the British 27th Infantry Brigade held vital blocking positions just above strong forces of the KPA 10th Division. In hard fighting all day the 5th RCT gained Hill 268, except for its northeast slope. By night the 3rd Battalion was on the hill, the 1st Battalion had turned northwest from it toward another KPA position and the 2nd Battalion had captured Hill 121, only south of Waegwan along the river road. Air strikes, destructive and demoralizing to the KPA, had paced the regimental advance all the way. In this important action along the east bank of the Naktong, the 5th Cavalry Regiment and part of the 7th Cavalry Regiment protected the 5th RCT's right flank and fought very heavy battles co-ordinated with the combat team on the adjoining hills east of Waegwan. At 18:00 that evening, 18 September, the 5th RCT and the 6th Medium Tank Battalion reverted to 24th Division control. The next morning the battle for Hill 268 continued. More than 200 KPA soldiers in log-covered bunkers still fought the 3rd Battalion. Three flights of F-51's napalmed, rocketed, and strafed these positions just before noon. This strike enabled the infantry to overrun the bunkers. Among the KPA dead was a regimental commander. About 250 KPA soldiers died on the hill. Westward to the river, other KPA troops bitterly resisted the 2nd and 1st Battalions, losing about 300 men in this battle, but the 5th RCT pressed forward. The 2nd Battalion entered Waegwan at 14:15. Fifteen minutes later it joined forces there with the 1st Battalion. After surprising a KPA group laying a minefield in front of it, the 2nd Battalion penetrated deeper into Waegwan and had passed through the town by 15:30. On 19 September the KPA 3rd Division defenses around Waegwan broke apart and the division began a panic-stricken retreat across the river. At 09:00 aerial observers reported an estimated 1,500 KPA troops crossing to the west side of the Naktong just north of Waegwan, and in the afternoon they reported roads north of Waegwan jammed with KPA groups of sizes varying from 10 to 300 men pouring out of the town. By mid-afternoon observers reported KPA soldiers in every draw and pass north of Waegwan. During the day the 5th RCT captured 22 45-mm antitank guns, 10 82-mm mortars, 6 heavy machine guns and approximately 250 rifles and submachine guns. On 20 September the 5th RCT captured the last of its objectives east of the Naktong River when its 2nd Battalion in the afternoon seized Hill 303 north of Waegwan. In securing its objectives, the 5th RCT suffered numerous casualties during the day: 18 men killed, 111 wounded, and 3 missing in action. At 19:45 that evening the 1st Battalion started crossing the river above the Waegwan railroad bridge. By midnight it had completed the crossing and advanced westward. The 2nd Battalion followed the 1st Battalion across the river and dug in on the west side before midnight. During the day the 3rd Battalion captured Hill 300, north of Waegan. The following afternoon, 21 September, after the 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment, relieved it on position, the 3rd Battalion crossed the Naktong. The 5th RCT found large stores of KPA ammunition and rifles on the west side of the river. The 5th RCT in five days had crushed the entire right flank and part of the center of the KPA 3rd Division. This rendered untenable the division's advanced positions on the road to Taegu where it was locked in heavy fighting with the 5th Cavalry Regiment. ===The 24th Division deploys west of the Naktong=== The Eighth Army and I Corps' plans for the breakout from the Pusan Perimeter called for the 24th Division to make the first crossings of the Naktong River. Accordingly, General John H. Church on 17 September received orders to force a crossing in the vicinity of the Hasandong ferry () due west of Taegu. The 5th RCT had just cleared the ground northward and secured the crossing site against KPA action from the east side of the river. The 21st Infantry Regiment was to cross the river after dark on 18 September in 3rd Engineer Combat Battalion assault boats. Once landed on the other side, the regiment was to attack north along the west bank of the Naktong to a point opposite Waegwan where it would strike the main highway to Kumch'on. The 24th Reconnaissance Company and the 19th Infantry Regiment were to cross at the same time a little farther south and block the roads leading from Songju, a KPA concentration point, some west of the river. The unexpected crossing of the Naktong during the day by the 2nd Battalion, 38th Infantry, farther south did not alter the Eighth Army plan for the breakout. In moving up to the Naktong, the 24th Division had to cross one of its tributaries, the Kumho River, that arched around Taegu. On the morning of the 18th, Colonel Stephens, the 21st Infantry regimental commander, discovered that the I Corps engineers had not bridged the Kumho as planned. The division thereupon hurried its own engineer troops to the stream and they began sandbagging the underwater bridge that the 5th RCT had already used so that large vehicles could cross. A makeshift ferry constructed from assault boats moved jeeps across the Kumho. Constant repair work on the underwater sandbag bridge was necessary to keep it usable. By nightfall there was a line of vehicles backed up for east of the Kumho, making it clear that the regiment would not be in position to cross the Naktong that evening after dark as planned. As midnight came and the hours passed, General Church began to fear that daylight would arrive before the regiment could start crossing and the troops consequently would be exposed to possibly heavy casualties. He repeatedly urged on Stephens the necessity of crossing the Naktong before daylight. During the night supporting artillery fired two preparations against the opposing terrain. Despite nightlong efforts to break the traffic jam and get the assault boats, troops, and equipment across the Kumho and up to the crossing site, it was 05:30, 19 September, before the first wave of assault boats pushed off into the Naktong. below Waegwan and just south of the village of Kumnan-dong () on the west side, Hill 174 and its long southern finger ridge dominated the crossing site. In the murky fog of dawn there was no indication of the KPA on the opposite bank. The first wave landed and started inland, almost at once KPA machine gun fire from both flanks caught the troops in a crossfire and then KPA mortar and artillery fire began falling on both sides of the river. The heaviest fire, as expected, came from Hill 174 and its long southern finger ridge. For a while it was doubtful that the crossing would succeed. The 1st Battalion, continuing its crossing under fire, suffered approximately 120 casualties in getting across the river. At 07:00 an air strike hit Hill 174. On the west side the 1st Battalion reorganized and, supported by napalm and strafing strikes, attacked and captured Hill 174 by noon. That afternoon the 3rd Battalion crossed the river and captured the next hill northward. During the night and the following morning the 2nd Battalion crossed the Naktong. On 20 September the 1st Battalion advanced north to Hill 170, the high ground on the west side of the river opposite Waegwan, while the 3rd Battalion occupied the higher hill northwestward. Meanwhile, south of the 21st Infantry crossing site, the 2nd Battalion, 19th Infantry, began crossing the Naktong at 16:00 on the afternoon of the 19th and was on the west side by evening. KPA mortar and artillery fire inflicted about fifty casualties while the battalion was still east of the river. Once across the river, however, the battalion encountered only light resistance. In the 24th Division crossing operation the engineers' role was a difficult and dangerous one, as their casualties show. The 3rd Engineer Combat Battalion lost 10 Americans and 5 attached Koreans killed, 37 Americans and 10 Koreans wounded, and 5 Koreans missing in action. On 20 September the 19th Infantry consolidated its hold on the high ground west of the river along the Songju road. The 24th Reconnaissance Company, having crossed the river during the night, passed through the 19th Infantry and started westward on the Songju road. During the day I Corps attached the British 27th Infantry Brigade to the 24th Infantry Division and it prepared to cross the Naktong and take part in the division attack. Relieved in its position by the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, the British 27th Brigade moved north to the 19th Infantry crossing site and shortly after noon started crossing single file over a rickety footbridge that engineer troops had thrown across the river. A KPA gun shelled the crossing site sporadically but accurately all day, causing some British casualties and hampering the ferrying of supplies for the 19th Regiment. Observers could not locate this gun because it remained silent while aircraft were overhead. Thus, on 20 September, all three regiments of the 24th Division and the attached British 27th Brigade were across the Naktong River. The 5th RCT held the high ground north of the Waegwan-Kumch'on highway, the 21st Infantry that to the south of it, the 19th was below the 21st ready to move up behind and support it and the 24th Reconnaissance Company was probing the Songju road west of the Naktong with the British brigade preparing to advance west on that axis. The division was ready to attack west along the main Taegu-Kumch'on-Taejon-Seoul highway. With the 24th Division combat elements west of the river, it was necessary to get the division transport, artillery, tanks, and service units across to support the advance. The permanent bridges at Waegwan, destroyed in early August by the 1st Cavalry Division, had not been repaired by the North Koreans except for ladders at the fallen spans to permit foot traffic across the river. A bridge capable of carrying heavy equipment had to be thrown across the Naktong at once. Starting on 20 September and working continuously for thirty-six hours, the 11th Engineer Combat Battalion and the 55th Engineer Treadway Bridge Company completed at 10:00, 22 September, an M2 pontoon float treadway bridge across the wide and deep stream at Waegwan. Traffic began moving across it immediately. Most 24th Division vehicles were on the west side of the Naktong by midnight. In the action of 20‚Äì21 September near Waegwan, the KPA lost heavily in tanks, as well as in other equipment and troops on both sides of the Naktong. In these two days the 24th Division counted 29 destroyed KPA tanks, but many of them undoubtedly had been destroyed earlier in August and September. According to KPA sources, the 203rd Regiment of the 105th Armored Division retreated to the west side of the Naktong with only 9 tanks, and the 107th Regiment with only 14. Nevertheless, the KPA covered its retreat toward Kumch'on with tanks, self-propelled guns, antitank guns, and small groups of supporting riflemen. On 22 September the 24th Division was concentrated west of the river with its immediate objective to drive northwest to Kumch'on, headquarters of the KPA field forces. ===The 2nd Infantry Division attacks west=== Below the 24th Division, the 2nd Division waited for the 9th Infantry Regiment to capture Hill 201. On the 19th, the 1st and 2nd Battalions, 23rd Infantry, were put into the fight to help reduce the KPA stronghold. While the 1st Battalion helped the 9th Infantry at Hill 201, the 2nd Battalion attacked across the 9th Infantry zone against Hill 174, a related KPA defense position. That evening this stubbornly held hill on the 2nd Division left flank was in 9th Infantry hands and the way was open for the 2nd Division crossing of the Naktong. In pre-dawn darkness, 20 September, the 3rd Battalion, 23rd Infantry, without opposition slipped across the river in assault boats at the Sangp'o ferry () site, just south of where the Sinban River enters the Naktong from the west. The battalion achieved a surprise so complete that its leading element, L Company, captured a KPA lieutenant colonel and his staff asleep. From a map captured at this time, US troops learned the locations of the KPA 2nd, 4th and 9th Divisions in the Sinban-ni area. By noon the 3rd Battalion had captured Hill 227, the critical terrain dominating the crossing site on the west side. In the afternoon, the 1st Battalion, 23rd Infantry, crossed the river. Its objective was Hill 207, upstream from the crossing site and dominating the road which crossed the Naktong there. In moving toward this objective, the lead company soon encountered the Sinban River which, strangely enough, no one in the company knew was there. After several hours of delay in attempting to find a method of crossing it, the troops finally crossed in DUKWs and, in a night attack, moved up the hill which they found undefended. Meanwhile, the 3rd Battalion had dug in on Hill 227. That night it rained hard and, under cover of the storm, a company of North Koreans crept up near the crest. On the morning of 21 September while L Company men were eating breakfast the KPA charged over the hill shooting and throwing grenades. They drove one platoon from its position and inflicted twenty-six casualties. Counterattacks regained the position by noon. While this action was taking place on the hill south of it, the 1st Battalion, 23rd Infantry, with a platoon of tanks from the 72nd Tank Battalion, attacked up the road toward Sinban-ni, a known KPA headquarters command post west of the river. The advance against strong KPA opposition was weakened by ineffective co- ordination between tanks and infantry. The great volume of fire from supporting twin-40 and quad-50 self-propelled anti-aircraft gun vehicles was of greatest help, however, in enabling the troops to make a advance which bypassed several KPA groups. The next morning a KPA dawn attack drove B Company from its position and inflicted many casualties including the company commander, who was killed. During the day an estimated two battalions of KPA in heavy fighting held the 23rd Infantry in check in front of Sinban-ni. The 2nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry crossed the Naktong and moved up to join the 1st Battalion in the battle north of the road. South of it the 3rd Battalion faced lighter resistance. The next day, 23 September, the 23rd Regiment gained Sinban-ni, and was ready then to join the 38th Infantry in a converging movement on Hyopch'on. On the next road northward above the 23rd Infantry, away, the 38th Infantry had hard fighting against strong KPA delaying forces as it attacked toward Ch'ogye and Hyopch'on. An air strike with napalm and fragmentation bombs helped its 2nd Battalion on 21 September break KPA resistance on Hill 239, the critical terrain overlooking Ch'ogye. The next day the battalion entered the town in the early afternoon. Before midnight the 1st Battalion turned over its task of containing elements of the KPA 10th Division on Hill 409 east of the Naktong to the 2nd Battalion, 9th Infantry, and started across the river to join its regiment. On the afternoon of 22 September the 2nd Division completed a bridge across the stream at the Sadung ferry site, and was ready to start moving supplies to the west side of the river in support of its advanced units. ===Encirclement above Taegu=== In the arc above Taegu and on the right of the 5th RCT, the 1st Cavalry Division and the ROK 1st Division had duelled for days with the KPA 3rd, 1st and 13th Divisions in attack and counterattack. The intensity of the fighting there in relation to other parts of the Perimeter is apparent in the casualties: of 373 casualties evacuated to Pusan on 16 September, for instance, nearly 200 came from the Taegu area. The fighting centered, as it had for the past month, on two corridors of approach to Taegu: (1) the Waegwan-Taegu highway and railroad, where the 5th Cavalry Regiment blocked the advanced elements of the KPA 3rd Division southeast of Waegwan and northwest of Taegu; and (2) the Tabu-dong road through the mountains north of Taegu where other elements of the 1st Cavalry Division and the ROK 1st Division had been striving to hold off the KPA 13th and 1st Divisions for nearly a month. There the KPA was still on hills overlooking the Taegu bowl and only north of the city. General Hobart R. Gay's plan for the 1st Cavalry Division in the Eighth Army breakout effort was: (1) to protect the right flank of the 5th RCT as it drove on Waegwan by having the 5th Cavalry Regiment attack and hold the KPA troops in its zone east of the Waegwan-Taegu highway; (2) to maintain pressure by the 8th Cavalry Regiment on the KPA in the Ch'ilgok area north of Taegu, and be prepared on order to make a maximum effort to drive north to Tabu-dong; and (3) the 7th Cavalry Regiment on order to shift, by successive battalion movements, from the division right flank to the left flank and make a rapid encirclement of the KPA over a trail and secondary road between Waegwan and Tabu-dong. If the plan worked, the 7th and 8th Cavalry Regiments would meet at Tabu-dong and enclose a large number of KPA troops in the Waegwan-Taegu-Tabu-dong triangle. General Gay started shifting forces from right to left on 16 September by moving the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, to Hill 188 in the 5th Cavalry area. North of Taegu on the Tabu-dong road units of the KPA 13th Division fought the 8th Cavalry Regiment to a standstill during the first three days of the Eighth Army offensive. Neither side was able to improve its position materially. The KPA attacked the 2nd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, repeatedly on Hill 570, the dominating height east of the mountain corridor, north of Taegu. West of the road, the 3rd Battalion made limited gains in high hills closer to Taegu. The KPA on either side of the Tabu-dong road had some formidable defenses, with a large number of mortars and small field pieces dug in on the forward slopes of the hills. Until unit commanders could dispose their forces so that they could combine fire and movement, they had to go slow or sacrifice the lives of their men. General Walker was displeased at the slow progress of the 8th Cavalry Regiment. On the 18th he expressed himself on this matter to General Gay, as did also General Milburn. Both men believed the regiment was not pushing hard. The next day the division attached the 3rd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, to the 8th Cavalry Regiment, and Colonel Holmes, the division chief of staff, told Colonel Palmer that he must take Tabu-dong during the day. But the KPA 13th Division frustrated the 8th Cavalry's attempt to reach Tabu-dong. KPA artillery, mortar, and automatic weapons crossfire from the Walled City area of Ka-san east of the road and the high ground of Hill 351 west of it turned back the regiment with heavy casualties. On 20 September the 70th Tank Battalion lost seven tanks in this fight. Meanwhile, on the right of the 1st Cavalry Division, the ROK 1st Division made impressive gains. General Paik Sun-yup's right-hand regiment, the 12th accompanied by the US 10th Anti- Aircraft Artillery Group, found a gap in the KPA positions in the high mountains and, plunging through it, reached a point on the Tabu-dong-Kunwi road northeast of Tabu-dong, and approximately beyond the most advanced units of the 1st Cavalry Division. There the ROK troops were in the rear of the main body of the KPA 1st and 13th Divisions and in a position to cut off one of their main lines of retreat. This penetration caused the KPA 1st Division on 19 September to withdraw its 2nd and 14th Regiments from the southern slopes of Ka-san (Hill 902) to defend against the new threat. That day also a ROK company penetrated to the south edge of the Walled City. Along the Waegwan- Taegu road at the beginning of the UN offensive, the 5th Cavalry Regiment attacked KPA positions, centering on Hills 203 and 174 north of the road and Hill 188 opposite and south of it. Approximately 1,000 soldiers of the KPA 8th Regiment, 3rd Division, held these key positions. The 1st Battalion, 5th Cavalry, began the attack on 16 September. The next day the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, joined in, moving against Hill 253 farther west. There North Koreans engaged F and G Companies of the 7th Cavalry in heavy combat. When it became imperative to withdraw from the hill, G Company's Capt. Fred P. DePalina, although wounded, remained behind to cover the withdrawal of his men. Ambushed subsequently by enemy soldiers, DePalina killed six of them before he himself died. The two companies were forced back south of the road. For three days the KPA on Hill 203 repulsed every attempt to storm it. In the fighting, A Company of the 70th Tank Battalion lost nine tanks and one tank-dozer to KPA action on 17 and 18 September, six of them to mines, two to KPA tank fire, and two to KPA antitank fire. In one tank action on the 18th, US tank fire knocked out two of three dug-in KPA tanks. Finally, on 18 September, Hill 203 fell to the 1st Battalion, 5th Cavalry, but the KPA continued to resist from the hills northwest of it, their strongest forces being on Hill 253. In this battle the three rifle companies of the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, were reduced to a combined strength of 165 effective men, F Company was down to forty-five effectives. The KPA's skillful use of mortars had caused most of the casualties. At the close of 18 September the KPA 3rd Division still held the hill mass east of Waegwan, centering on Hills 253 and 371. On 18 September forty-two B-29s bombed west and northwest of Waegwan across the Naktong, but apparently without damage to the KPA. The battle on the hills east of Waegwan reached a climax on the 19th when the 1st Battalion, 5th Cavalry, and the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, engaged in very heavy fighting with the KPA on Hills 300 and 253. Elements of the 1st Battalion, 5th Cavalry, gained the crest of Hill 300. On that hill the 1st Battalion suffered 207 battle casualties, 28 Americans killed, 147 wounded, and 4 missing in action, for a total of 179, with 28 additional casualties among the attached South Koreans. At noon, F Company reported 66 men present for duty; E and G Companies between them had 75 men. That afternoon the battalion reported it was only 30 percent combat effective. The 5th Cavalry's seizure of the 300 and 253 hill mass dominating the Taegu road southeast of Waegwan unquestionably helped the 5th RCT to capture Waegwan that day. But to the north of these hills, the KPA on Hill 371 in a stubborn holding action turned back for the moment all efforts of the 5th Cavalry to capture that height. In its subsequent withdrawal from the Waegwan area to Sangju the KPA 3rd Division fell from a strength of approximately 5,000 to about 1,800 men. Entire units gave way to panic. Combined UN ground and air action inflicted tremendous casualties. In the area around Waegwan where the 5th Cavalry Regiment reoccupied the old Waegwan pocket a count showed 28 KPA tanks, 27 T-34s and one US M4 Sherman refitted by the North Koreans, as destroyed or captured. During the 19th General Gay started maneuvering his forces for the encirclement movement, now that the hard fighting east of Waegwan had at last made it possible. Lt. Col. Clainos led his 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, from the division right to the left flank, taking position in front of the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, to start the movement toward Tabu-dong. Gay ordered the 3rd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, to shift the next morning from the right flank to the left, and prepare to follow the 1st Battalion in its dash for Tabu-dong. On the morning of 20 September the 3rd Battalion boarded trucks north of Taegu and rolled northwest on the road toward Waegwan. The regimental commander, apparently fearing that KPA mortar and artillery fire would interdict the road, dismounted his troops short of their destination. Their foot march tired the troops and made them late in reaching their assembly area. This over-caution angered General Gay because the same thing had happened when the 2nd Battalion of the same regiment had moved to the left flank four days earlier. In the meantime, during the morning the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, led off down the road toward Waegwan past Hill 300. At 09:00 short of Waegwan the lead elements turned off the main highway onto a poor secondary road which cut across country to a point east of Waegwan, where it met the Waegwan-Tabu-dong road. This latter road curved northeast, winding along a narrow valley floor hemmed in on both sides by high mountains all the way to Tabu-dong, away. Even though an armored spearhead from C Company, 70th Tank Battalion, led the way, roadblocks and KPA fire from the surrounding hills held the battalion to a slow advance. By midafternoon it had gained only , and was only halfway on the cutoff road that led into the Waegwan-Tabu-dong road. The column stopped completely when a tank struck a mine. General Gay showed his irritation over the slow progress by ordering the regimental commander to have the 1st Battalion bypass KPA on the hills and \\"high-tail it\\" for Tabu-dong. Acting on General Gay's orders, the 1st Battalion pushed ahead, reached the Tabu-dong road, and turned northeast on it toward the town away. This road presented a picture of devastation, dead oxen, disabled T-34 tanks, wrecked artillery pieces, piles of abandoned ammunition and other military equipment and supplies littered its course. As the battalion halted for the night, an exploding mine injured Colonel Clainos. He refused evacuation, but the next day was evacuated on orders of the regimental commander. That evening the 1st Battalion, with the 3rd Battalion following close behind, advanced to the vicinity of Togae-dong, short of Tabu-dong. The premature de-trucking of the 3rd Battalion during the day was the final incident that caused General Gay to replace the 7th Cavalry regimental commander. That evening General Gay put in command of the regiment Colonel Harris, commanding officer of the 77th Field Artillery Battalion, which had been in support of the regiment. Harris assumed command just before midnight. Colonel Harris issued orders about midnight to assembled battalion and unit commanders that the 7th Cavalry would capture Tabu-dong in the morning, and that the element which reached the village first was to turn south to contact the 8th Cavalry Regiment and at the same time establish defensive positions to secure the road. The next morning, 21 September, the 1st Battalion resumed the attack and arrived at the edge of Tabu-dong at 12:55. There it encountered KPA resistance, but in a pincer movement from southwest and northwest cleared the village by 16:35. An hour later the battalion moved out of Tabu-dong down the Taegu road in attack southward toward the 8th Cavalry Regiment completing the encirclement later that afternoon. Meanwhile, the 3rd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, arrived at Tabu- dong and turned north to deploy its troops in defensive positions on both sides of the road. By this time, elements of the ROK 1st Division had cut the Sangju road above Tabu-dong and were attacking south toward the village. The ROK 12th Regiment, farthest advanced, had a roadblock to the northeast below Kunwi. It appeared certain that the operations of the 1st Cavalry Division and the ROK 1st Division had cut off large numbers of the KPA 3rd, 13th and 1st Divisions in the mountains north of Taegu. The next day, 22 September, the 11th Regiment of the ROK 1st Division and units of the South Korean National Police captured the Walled City of Ka-san, and elements of the ROK 15th Regiment reached Tabu-dong from the north to link up with the 1st Cavalry Division. ===The right flank=== In the mountainous area of the ROK II Corps the KPA 8th Division was exhausted and the 15th practically destroyed. The ROK divisions were near exhaustion, too, but their strength was greater than the KPA's and they began to move slowly north again. The ROK 6th Infantry Division attacked against the KPA 8th Division, which it had held without gain for two weeks, and in a 4-day battle destroyed the division as a combat force. According to KPA sources, the 8th Division suffered about 4,000 casualties at this time. The survivors fled north toward Yech'on in disorder. By 21 September the ROK 6th Division was advancing north of Uihung with little opposition. Eastward, the ROK 8th Infantry Division, once it had gathered itself together and begun to move northward, found little resistance because the opposing KPA 15th Division had been practically annihilated. In the battle-scarred Kigye ()-An'gangni-Kyongju area of the ROK I Corps sector, units of the Capital Division fought their way through the streets of An'gang- ni on 16 September, the day the UN offensive got under way. Beyond it, the ROK 3rd Infantry Division had moved up to the north bank of the Hyeongsan River just below P'ohang-dong. The next day a battalion of the 7th Infantry Division advancing from the west, established contact with elements of the Capital Division and closed the 2-week-old gap between the ROK II and I Corps. Retiring northward into the mountains, the KPA 12th Division fought stubborn delaying actions and did not give up Kigye to the Capital Division until 22 September. It then continued its withdrawal toward Andong. This once formidable organization, originally composed largely of Korean veterans of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, was all but destroyed, its strength stood at approximately 2,000 men. The ROK divisions had numerical superiority, better supply, daily close air support and, in the P'ohang-dong area, naval gunfire. On the 16th, naval support was particularly effective when Admiral Charles C. Hartman's Task Group, including the battleship , appeared off P'ohang-dong. The battleship pounded the KPA positions below the town, along the dike north of the Hyongsan River, with 2,000-pound shells from its 16-inch guns. Two days later the Missouri again shelled these dike positions under observed radio fire direction by Colonel Emmerich, Korean Military Advisory Group (KMAG) adviser to the ROK 3rd Division. ROK troops then assaulted across the bridge, but KPA machine gunners cut them down. The number killed is unknown, but 144 were wounded in trying to cross the bridge. In a final desperate step, thirty- one ROK soldiers volunteered to cross the bridge. Fighter planes helped their effort by making dummy strafing passes against the KPA dike positions. Of the thirty-one who charged, nineteen fell on the bridge. Other ROK soldiers quickly reinforced the handful of men who gained a foothold north of the river. There they found dead KPA machine gunners tied to their dike positions. As a preliminary move in the UN offensive in the east, naval vessels on the night of 14‚Äì15 September had transported the ROK Miryang Guerrilla Battalion, specially trained and armed with Russian-type weapons, to Changsa-dong (), above P'ohang-dong, where the battalion landed two and a half hours after midnight in the rear of the KPA 5th Division. Its mission was to harass the KPA rear while the ROK 3rd Division attacked frontally below P'ohang-dong. That evening the KPA 5th Division sent a battalion from its 12th Regiment to the coastal hills where the Miryang Battalion had taken a position and engaged it. The ROK guerrilla battalion's effort turned into a complete fiasco. The US Navy had to rush to its assistance and place a ring of naval gunfire around it on the beach, where KPA fire had driven the battalion. This saved it from total destruction. Finally, on 18 September, with great difficulty, the navy evacuated 725 of the ROK's, 110 of them wounded, by LST. Thirty-nine dead were left behind, as well as 32 others who refused to try to reach the evacuating ships. Although this effort to harass the KPA rear came to nothing and gave the ROK 3rd Division little help, elements of 3rd Division had combat patrols at the edge of P'ohang-dong on the evening of 19 September. The next morning at 10:15 the division captured the destroyed town. One regiment drove on through the town to the high ground north of it. And in the succeeding days of 21 and 22 September the ROK 3rd Division continued strong attacks northward, supported by naval gunfire and fighter planes, capturing Hunghae, and driving the KPA 5th Division back on Yongdok in disorder. ===The left flank ‚Äî the KPA withdraws from Sobuk-san=== At the other end of the UN line, the left flank in the Masan area, H-hour on 16 September found the 25th Division still fighting KPA forces behind its lines, and the KPA appeared stronger than ever on the heights of Battle Mountain, P'il-bong-san () and Sobuk-san. 25th Division commander General William B. Kean and his staff felt that the division could advance along the roads toward Chinju only when the mountainous center of the division front was clear of the KPA. The experience of Task Force Kean in early August, when the KPA had closed in behind it from the mountains, was still fresh in their minds. They therefore believed that the key to the advance of the 25th Division lay in its center where the KPA held the heights and kept the 24th Infantry Regiment under daily attack. The 27th Infantry Regiment on the left and the 35th Infantry Regiment on the right, astride the roads between Chinju and Masan, could do little more than mark time until the situation in front of the 24th Infantry improved. To carry out his plan, General Kean on 16 September organized a composite battalion-sized task force under command of Maj. Robert L. Woolfolk, commanding officer of the 3rd Battalion, 35th Infantry, and ordered it to attack the KPA-held heights of Battle Mountain and P'il-bong-san the next day, with the mission of restoring the 24th Infantry positions there. On the 17th and 18th the task force repeatedly attacked these heights, heavily supported by artillery fire from the 8th and 90th Field Artillery Battalions and by numerous air strikes, but KPA automatic fire from the heights drove back the assaulting troops every time with heavy casualties. Within twenty- four hours, A Company, 27th Infantry, alone suffered fifty-seven casualties. Woolfolk's force abandoned its effort to drive the KPA from the peaks after its failure on the 18th and the task group was dissolved the next day. During the morning of 19 September it was discovered that the KPA had abandoned the crest of Battle Mountain during the night, and the 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry, moved up and occupied it. On the right, the 35th Infantry began moving forward. There was only light resistance until it reached the high ground in front of Chungam-ni () where cleverly hidden KPA soldiers in spider holes shot at 1st Battalion soldiers from the rear. The next day the 1st Battalion captured Chungam-ni, and the 2nd Battalion captured the long ridge line running northwest from it to the Nam River. Meanwhile, the KPA still held strongly against the division left where the 27th Infantry had heavy fighting in trying to move forward. On 21 September the 35th Infantry Regiment captured the Notch, southwest of Chungam- ni, and then swept westward without resistance, past the Much'on-ni road fork, to the high ground at the Chinju pass. There at 22:30 the lead battalion halted for the night. At the same time, the 24th and 27th Regiments in the center and on the division left advanced, slowed only by the rugged terrain they had to traverse. They passed abandoned position after position from which the North Koreans previously had fought to the death, and saw that KPA automatic positions had honeycombed the hills. The events of the past three days made it clear that the KPA in front of the 25th Division in the center and on the right had started his withdrawal the night of 18‚Äì19 September. The KPA 7th Division withdrew from south of the Nam River, while the 6th Division sideslipped elements to cover the entire front. Covered by the 6th Division, the 7th had crossed to the north side of the Nam River by the morning of the 19th. Then the KPA 6th Division had withdrawn from its positions on Sobuk-san. Although the KPA withdrawal had been general in front of the 25th Division, there were still delaying groups and stragglers in the mountains. Below Tundok on the morning of 22 September some North Koreans slipped into the bivouac area of A Company, 24th Infantry. One platoon leader awoke to find an enemy soldier standing over him. He grabbed the enemy's bayonet and struggled with him until someone else shot the man. Nearby another enemy dropped a grenade into a foxhole on three sleeping men, killing two and wounding the third. A little later mortar fire fell on a company commanders' meeting at 1st Battalion headquarters and inflicted seven casualties, including the commanding officer of Headquarters Company killed. Up ahead of the division advance, elements of the KPA 6th Division at the Chinju pass blocked the 35th Infantry all day on 22 September, covering the withdrawal of the main body across the Nam River and through Chinju, westward. The assault companies of the 1st Battalion, 35th Infantry, got within of the top of Hill 152 at the pass but could go no further. ===The KPA withdraws=== Aerial observers' reports on 22 September gave no clear indication of KPA intentions. While there were reports of large KPA movements northward there were also large ones seen going south. Eighth Army intelligence on that day estimated the situation to be one in which, \\"although the enemy is apparently falling back in all sectors, there are no indications of an over-all planned disengagement and withdrawal.\\" This estimate of KPA intentions was wrong. Everywhere the KPA were withdrawing, covering their withdrawal by strong blocking and delaying actions wherever possible. There can be little doubt that when news of the Inchon landings reached the KPA it was demoralizing in the extreme and was perhaps the greatest single factor in their rapid deterioration. The evidence seems to show that news of the Inchon landing was kept from most of the KPA officers as well as nearly all the troops at the Pusan Perimeter for nearly a week. It would appear that the North Korean High Command did not decide on a withdrawal from the Perimeter and a regrouping somewhere farther north until three or four days after the landing when it became evident that Seoul was in imminent danger. The pattern of fighting and KPA action at the Perimeter reflects this fact. Nowhere on 16 September, when Eighth Army began its offensive, did it score material gains except in certain parts of the 2nd Division zone where the 38th and 23d Infantry Regiments broke through decimated KPA forces to reach the Naktong River. Until 19 September there was everywhere the stoutest KPA resistance and no indication of voluntary withdrawal, and, generally, UN advances were minor and bought only at the cost of heavy fighting and numerous casualties. Then during the night of 18‚Äì19 September the KPA 7th and 6th Divisions began withdrawing in the southern part of the line where they were farthest from North Korea. The 6th Division left behind well organized and effective delaying parties to cover the withdrawals. On 19 September Waegwan fell to the US 5th RCT, and the ROK 1st Division in the mountains north of Taegu penetrated to points behind the KPA 1st and 13th Divisions' lines. These divisions then started their withdrawals. The next day the ROK 3rd Division on the east coast recaptured P'ohang-dong and in the ensuing days the KPA 5th Division troops in front of it fell back rapidly northward on Yongdok. At the same time the ROK made sweeping advances in the mountains throughout the eastern half of the front. The 1st Cavalry Division was unable to make significant gains until 20 and 21 September. On the 21st it finally recaptured Tabu-dong. West of the Naktong the US 2nd Division fought stubborn KPA delaying forces on 21 and 22 September. ==Aftermath== The effect of the Inchon landing and the battles around Seoul on KPA action at the Pusan Perimeter from 19 September onward was clearly apparent. By that date the North Korean High Command began to withdraw its main forces committed in the south and start them moving northward. By 23 September this North Korean retrograde movement was in full swing everywhere around the Perimeter and their cordon was no more. The Eighth Army and the ROK then began their counteroffensive to pursue the retreating KPA. ==See also== *Battle of Inchon *Second Battle of Seoul *UN September 1950 counteroffensive == References == Category:Conflicts in 1950 Category:1950 in Korea Category:History of Busan Category:Battles of the Korean War Category:Battles involving North Korea Category:Battles involving South Korea Category:Battles of the Korean War involving the United Kingdom Category:United States Marine Corps in the 20th century Category:Battles of the Korean War involving the United States ","title":"Pusan Perimeter Offensive"},{"id":"60325275","text":"The Deulti railway station in the Indian state of West Bengal, serves Deulti, India in Howrah district.

Formerly known as Waddington Galleries, it has been situated on Mayfair‚Äôs Cork Street since 1958. == Owner history == Waddington Custot Galleries was founded on Cork Street as Waddington Galleries by Victor Waddington, a long-standing art dealer based in Dublin, in 1958. He headed the gallery with his son, London- based art dealer Leslie Waddington. Victor eventually left to set up his own Victor Waddington Gallery, also on Cork Street, in 1965. Leslie remained at the original location, establishing his own business but keeping the Waddington Galleries name. For this venture, he had the backing of Alex Bernstein as part of the Granada Group. After Lord Bernstein died in 2010, his 50% of the shares were sold to London-based French art dealer, Stephane Custot. This deal followed a long-time partnership between Custot and the gallery, and the gallery was renamed Waddington Custot Galleries. Leslie Waddington died on 30 November 2015, leaving Custot as the sole director of Waddington Custot Galleries. == Location timeline == Waddington Custot Galleries is currently found at 11-12 Cork Street. It has occupied various addresses on the Mayfair road in its history, making the Waddington name almost synonymous with Cork Street. Waddington Galleries first opened in March 1958 at 2 Cork Street. The second gallery opened in February 1965 at 25 Cork Street, which sat opposite No. 2. Victor Waddington followed to this new address in 1966, setting up his own Victor Waddington gallery, leaving Leslie heading Waddington Galleries at No. 2. In November 1968, Leslie opened the Leslie Waddington Gallery around the corner, on 8 Vigo Street. This new gallery specialised in prints and later returned to Cork Street, at No. 31 as Waddington Graphics, eventually closing in January 1995. Two additional galleries were opened at 23 Cork Street in December 1969. These were known as Waddington Galleries II and III‚Äîwith No. 2 being known as Waddington Galleries I. In 1982, a fourth gallery was opened at 4 Cork Street, which hosted exhibitions until the end of 1983. The main gallery then moved to 11 Cork Street, which was a new build designed by British architect John Pawson. By the end of the 80s, a further two Waddington galleries had opened at 5 and 12 Cork Street. All galleries eventually closed, aside from the main space. By the end of the 90s, Waddington Galleries was consolidated at 11-12 Cork Street, merging the two galleries into one large exhibition space. == Notable exhibitions == Waddington Custot has held a number of high-profile exhibitions from its launch in the 1950s.Waddington Custot History Waddington Galleries opened with an exhibition of works by the late Jack B. Yeats, who had been represented by Victor Waddington in Ireland. The gallery continued to exhibit Yeats‚Äô pieces, as well as smaller works of artists from the School of Paris, like Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso. Waddington Galleries introduced the works of emerging British talent, specifically with St Ives artists, including Patrick Heron, Terry Frost, and Roger Hilton. After introducing additional British painters and sculptors such as Ivon Hitchens, Elisabeth Frink, and William Turnbull, the gallery became known for championing British contemporary art. Following the opening of the Victor Waddington gallery in 1966, Leslie Waddington increased the scope of contemporary British artists. Artists featured in Bryan Robertson‚Äôs New Generations exhibitions‚Äîwhich were held at the Whitechapel Gallery in the mid-60s‚Äîwere particular favourites, with artists such as David Annesley and Michael Bolus being featured at Waddington. The gallery also promoted post-war American art in Britain, upon being renamed Waddington Galleries I. From 1969, and throughout the 1970s, American Color Field painters such as Morris Louis, Kenneth Noland, and Jules Olitski were featured heavily. == Current artists == Waddington Custot represents a number of British and international artists, including Peter Blake, credited with designing the sleeve for The Beatles' album Sgt.

Arvay (born July 22, 1980) is a biologist and non-fiction author of books with an emphasis on health ecology. His works have been published in several languages. == Biography == Arvay was born in 1980 in Graz, Styria. After initially undergoing an apprenticeship as a bookbinder while completing secondary school at the same time, Arvay studied landscape ecology at the University of Graz until 2005. In 2007, he also completed his master's degree of studies in applied plant sciences at the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences in Vienna. Arvay subsequently held various positions, including quality manager for the organic brand \\"Zur√ºck zum Ursprung\\" (Back to Origin) of the Hofer supermarket chain. Later, Arvay temporarily obtained a position working for the Austrian environmental protection organization, Global 2000. Since 2012 he has worked exclusively as a freelance author. He is a member of the expert council of Forum Wissenschaft & Umwelt (Forum Science & Environment) in Austria, where he is listed as responsible for health ecology. Arvay plays several musical instruments and employs music in his work with children on the autism spectrum in the context of forest therapy. == Publications == In 2011, Arvay published his first non-fiction book on forgotten species of vegetables. The author reached a wide readership with his second book \\"Der gro√üe Bio-Schm√§h\\" (The Big Organic Fraud): Released in 2012, the author offered a look \\"behind the scenes of the supposedly picture-perfect world of organic foods,\\" which was touted as being \\"a dispassionate and therefore also credible account.\\" Within a few weeks, the book ascended to the Austrian bookseller association's bestseller list for non-fiction books. In 2013, in an additional book, Arvay advocated reining in \\"power-hungry food conglomerates\\" in favor of regional, small-scale farming. This book also was published in Japanese. In 2014, Arvay teamed up with the actor Roland D√ºringer on a book titled \\"Leb wohl Schlaraffenland\\" (Fare Well, Land of Plenty) in which both authors discussed the \\"major philosophical questions in life.\\" As an experiment, D√ºringer decided to do without modern advances and to live according to the way things were 40 years ago. In the course of additional activities as an author, Arvay once again took on the ramifications of industrial farming, in his book published in 2014, having to do above all with the artificial standardization of food by policymakers and industry, along with the practices of large seed producers. In \\"Der Biophilia-Effekt\\" (The Biophilia Effect, 2015) and \\"Das Biophilia-Training\\" (The Biophilia Training, 2016), the author analyzed the healing effect of the forest. In the two books, Arvay touted the forest as the \\"best fitness gym in the world\\"; both books became bestsellers. The English edition of \\"The Biophilia Effect\\" was published in 2018. It contains a foreword by biologist Marc Bekoff. In 2016, Arvay revisited this topic in a book entitled \\"Der Heilungscode der Natur\\" (English edition: The Healing Code of Nature, 2018). Specifically, the work discusses the positive effects of plants and animals on the human immune system. Among other accolades was a review from the people magazine Bunte, praising the book as a \\"great introduction into the medical aspects of how human beings and nature interact.\\" His work \\"Biophilia in der Stadt‚Äù (Biophilia in the City, 2018) deals with the effects of nature and green spaces on urban public health. Brain scientist Gerald H√ºther wrote the foreword to the book. In the book \\"Mit den B√§umen wachsen wir in den Himmel: Autistische Kinder mit der Heilkraft des Waldes f√∂rdern\\" (Forest therapy and the autism spectrum ‚Äì advancing the development of children through biodiversity, 2019), Arvay describes development opportunities in the forest for autistic children, supporting his explanations with current research. In 2019, the International Handbook of Forest Therapy was published by Cambridge Scholars Publishing; it consists of two chapters that are written by Arvay. 2020, he published \\"Wir k√∂nnen es besser\\" (We Can Do Better), claiming a correlation between environmental damages, loss of biodiversity, and the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2. == References == == External links == * Official website of Clemens G.

In the 1960s and 1970s the school was a seat of academic excellence. However, it fell on hard times in subsequent years, and as of 2018, was \\"a shadow of its former self\\". ==Location== The school campus is situated in Nyapea, a town located approximately , by road, north-west of Paidha, at the international border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

In 2012, the government of Uganda allocated USh450 million (approx. US$180,000 at that time), to rehabilitate the school's dilapidated infrastructure. The funds were sourced from the African Development Bank under the bank's AfDB Four Grant Project. However, the renovations were botched as only part of the work was done and what was done was determined to be substandard. Since then the Uganda's State House has commissioned a forensic audit of the school renovations. ==Recent developments== Supported by their Old Boys Association (Alumni Association), the school has started a slow academic comeback. Support comes in the form of student scholarships, mattresses, uniforms, books, and clothing. ==Prominent alumni== Former students of Nyapea College include a former prime minister, current and former cabinet ministers, lawyers, academics, and sportsmen. Some of the prominent alumni of the school include: * Kania Mario Obiga: Member of Parliament for Terego County East, Arua District in the 10th Parliament (2016‚Äî2021) and State Minister for Internal Affairs in the Ugandan Cabinet. * George Cosmas Adyebo (18 June 1947‚Äì19 November 2000): Prime Minister of Uganda, from 22 January 1991 until 18 November 1994. * Dr Amos Nyathirombo: Medical doctor, who successfully carried out research on River Blindness. * Fred Omach: Former State Minister for Finance (General Duties) in the Cabinet of Uganda. ==See also== * Education in Uganda * List of schools in Uganda ==References== ==External links== *37 Hurt In Nyapea College Bullying As of 23 April 2004.

For the next sixty years, it housed businesses related to transportation. The ground floor was home to a livery stable with a series of owners, while the upstairs was home to and carriage and wagon-building and painting shops. IN about 1890, a frame wong was moved from a lot across the alley and attache to the original building. By the 1920s, there was also \\"auto livery\\" available, and by the late 1920s the entire building housed an auto garage and service station. In 1929, Marshall's resident historic booster, Harold C. Brooks, proposed converting the building into Marshall's town hall as a way of conserving the historic integrity of the former stable. Brooks hired architect Howard F. Young to oversee the conversion, and the new town hall opened in 1930. ==History== The William Prindle Livery Stable is a two-story, hip-roof structure with walls made of yellow sandstone, coursed in the front and rubble on the sides. The original front facade was broad and utilitarian, with segmental-arch wagon entranceways located in the center and on one end, and an office area with a wide storefront on the other end. Windows on the second floor were square-head double-hung units with six-pane sashes. On one side, a flank-gable, two-story frame wing is attached. In 1929-30, the building was refurbished with additional architectural elements to transform it into the town hall. the former livery stable was transformed into the Marshall Town Hall. All the existing openings in the front facade were retained, with the broad storefront opening slightly reduced in size and the windows replaced with nine-over-six or nine-over-nine double-hung units. The wagon entrances were fitted with doors and re-purposed as entrances: the central on to the town hall proper and the end on providing access to a fire station. Elements added during the remodeling included a broad entablature, classical cornice, and a central pediment with fanlight, as well as a square tower on the roof topped with an octagonal, domed cupola. When the fire department discontinued use of the building, the former fire entrance was refitted with double doors. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Calhoun County, Michigan Category:Colonial Revival architecture in Michigan Category:Neoclassical architecture in Michigan Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1858 ","title":"William Prindle Livery Stable"},{"id":"60325550","text":"Chorizo de Cebu, also known as longganisa de Cebu, is a Filipino pork sausage originating from Cebu, Philippines.

It was the most important union of cotton spinners, and dominated the Spinners' Amalgamation. ==History== Bolton saw the earliest known unions of cotton spinners, one being in existence by 1810. A succession of societies grew and then collapsed, but there appears to have been a union in continuous existence from at least 1842, and in 1848 it was reformed as the United Operative Cotton Spinners and Self-Actor Minders' Association of Bolton and District. The Bolton Self-Actor Minders' Society split away in 1861, but the two unions merged in 1880, forming what in 1882 became known as the Operative Cotton Spinners' Provincial Association of Bolton and District. The union was not restricted to Bolton, but included branches in Atherton, Farnworth, Leigh, Manchester and Reddish. As the hand mule spinning trade declined, machine spinning grew, and with it, so did the union, admitting branches in Chorley and Tyldesley in 1883, Hindley and Pendlebury in 1885, and several more in Manchester. The union proved successful in co-ordinating wage bargaining, with all the unions having similar, locally determined, wage lists, payment being based on the type of yarn used. In 1918, the union also admitted a branch in Wigan, and with the Manchester branches consolidated, this meant it had a total of eleven branches. The union was affiliated to the Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton Spinners, but it retained control over the welfare benefits it paid members, and over wage negotiations. The Amalgamation led on trade disputes and strike benefits payments, but the Bolton District was allocated an automatic majority of seats on its executive. For many years, the union also represented cotton piecers, although they were not entitled to a vote in union business. In 1914, they split away to form the United Piecers' Association, significantly reducing the union's membership to below that of the Oldham Spinners. However, the breakaway was not a success, dissolving by 1919, and the piecers soon rejoined. Membership reached a peak of 18,501 in 1927, but the Great Depression saw up to 30% of union members unemployed, emptying the union's substantial reserves. The outlying districts of Wigan and Hindley were dissolved in 1941, and the decline in the Lancashire cotton industry began to hit the union. By 1947, membership was 6,200, and by 1959 it was only 2,250. In response, in 1960, the Atherton, Manchester and Reddish districts were dissolved, followed in 1961 by Chorley, Farnworth and Pendlebury, and in 1962 by Tyldesley. Leigh was dissolved in 1964, leaving only the central Bolton district, and its membership fell rapidly, from 516 in 1964, to 187 in 1970, and just 23 in 1972. In October 1973, the union held its final meeting, which agreed to dissolve the organisation, with the final few members transferring to the Rochdale Spinners. It was deregistered as a union in 1975. ==General Secretaries== :1880: John Fielding :1894: :1896: Alfred Gill :1914: Peter Bullough :1919: William Wood :1940: Charles Schofield :1960: J. G.

Outward from the Sun, the planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Jupiter's diameter is about 11 times that of the Earth's and the Sun's diameter is about 10 times Jupiter's. The planets are not shown at the appropriate distance from the Sun. The historical models of the Solar System began during prehistoric periods and is updated to this day. The models of the Solar System throughout history were first represented in the early form of cave markings and drawings, calendars and astronomical symbols. Then books and written records then became the main source of information that expressed the way the people of the time thought of the Solar System. New models of the Solar System are usually built on previous models, thus, the early models are kept track of by intellectuals in astronomy, an extended progress from trying to perfect the geocentric model to eventually using the heliocentric model of the Solar System. The uses of the Solar System model began as a time source to signify particular periods during the year and also a navigation source which is exploited by many leaders from the past. Astronomers and great thinkers of the past were able to record observations and attempt to formulate a model that accurately interprets the recordings. This scientific method of deriving a model of the Solar System is what enabled progress towards more accurate models to have a better understanding of the Solar System that we are in. == Prehistoric astronomy == Conventionally, astronomy began by Hipparchus discovering the equinoxes a few Millennia BC, however, prehistoric cave markings prove otherwise. Ancient cave paintings that monitor the equinoxes and solstices were found from as early as 40 000 years ago by researchers in the University of Edinburgh and Kent. These events were used as an annual time reference in √áatalh√∂y√ºk during 7000 BCE: *Summer solstice *Autumn equinox *Winter solstice *Spring equinox Jegu√®s Wolkiewiez found that 122 out of 130 ice age Paleolithic caves she visited were aligned to equinoxes and solstices. The researchers concluded that these were calendar experts who used these astronomical events to know when to begin their rituals. This highlights their knowledge of the Sun and Moon's positioning which is the foundation of formulating a model of the Solar System. Also, according to NASA, the first cave markings of a lunar cycle were made by the Aurignacian Culture in 32 000 BCE. These cave markings are thought of as calendars that helped the people contain the cycles of the Solar System which is a method of keeping track of time. In Lascaux caves, there were many cave drawings in which a dot is in the middle and 11 to 14 dots are drawn around the centre dot which archaeologists date back to as early as 15 000 BCE. Alexander Marshack, Professor of Paleolithic Archaeology at Harvard University's Peabody Museum, concluded that these dots represent lunar cycles. == Early astronomy == === The Nebra Sky Disc === The Nebra Sky Disc, dating back to the Bronze Age in 1600 BCE, is a bronze disc that represents the cosmos, consisting of a crescent moon, the Sun, 32 stars and 3 arcs. According to Professor Dr. Wolfhard Schlosser, the most correct interpretations of the sky disc of Nebra are that the 32 points represent the stars and the arcs on the edges of the disk making an 82 degree angle indicates the sunset and sunrise during summer and winter. === Babylonian interpretation === Babylonians thought the universe revolved around heaven and Earth. They used methodological observations of the patterns of planets and stars movements to predict future possibilities such as eclipses. Babylonians were able to make use of periodic appearances of the Moon to generate a time source - a calendar. This was developed as the appearance of the full moon was visible every month. The 12 months came about by dividing the ecliptic into 12 equal segments of 30 degrees and were given zodiacal constellation names which was later used by the Greeks. === Chinese theories === The Chinese had multiple theories of the structure of the universe. The first theory is the Gaitian (celestial lid) theory, mentioned in an old mathematical text called Zhou bei suan jing in 100 BCE, in which the Earth is within the heaven, where the heaven acts as a dome or a lid. The second theory is the Huntian (Celestial sphere) theory during 100 BCE. This theory claims that the Earth floats on the water that the Heaven contains, which was accepted as the default theory until 200 AD. The Xuanye (Ubiquitous darkness) theory attempts to simplify the structure by implying that the Sun, Moon and the stars are just a highly dense vapour that floats freely in space with no periodic motion. == Greek astronomy == Since 600 BCE, Greek thinkers noticed the periodic fashion of the Solar System. Many theories were announced during this period. Parmenides claimed that the Solar System is spherical and moonlight is actually a reflection of sunlight. 312x312px Anaxagoras suggested that the Moon is closer to the Earth than the Sun, comets are formed by collisions of planets and that the motion of planets is controlled by the nous (mind). Pythagoras's students thought the motion of planets is caused by a fire at the centre of the universe that powers them and Earth orbits that fire. They also claimed that the Moon, the Sun and planets orbit the Earth. Eudoxus, in around 400 BCE, introduced a technique to describe the motion of the planets called the method of exhaustion. Eudoxus reasoned that since the distances of the stars, the Moon, the Sun and all known planets do not appear to be changing, they are fixed in a sphere in which the bodies move around the sphere but with a constant radius and the Earth is at the centre of the sphere. Eudoxus emphasised that this is a purely mathematical construct of the model in the sense that the spheres of each celestial body do not exist, it just shows the possible positions of the bodies. However, Aristotle modified Eudoxes' model by supposing the spheres are real. He was able to articulate the spheres for most planets, however, the spheres for Jupiter and Saturn crossed each other. Aristotle solved this complication by introducing an unrolled sphere. Aristotle also tried to determine whether the Earth moves and concluded that all the celestial bodies fall towards Earth by natural tendency and since Earth is the centre of that tendency, it is stationary. Around 360 BCE when Plato proposed his idea to account for the motions. Plato claimed that circles and spheres were the preferred shape of the universe and that the Earth was at the centre and the stars forming the outermost shell, followed by planets, the Sun and the Moon. However, this did not suffice to explain the observed planetary motion. During the period 127 to 141 AD, Ptolemy deduced that the Earth is spherical based on the fact that not everyone records the solar eclipse at the same time and that observers from the North can not see the Southern stars. Ptolemy attempted to resolve the Planetary motion dilemma in which the observations were not consistent with the perfect circular orbits of the bodies. Ptolemy proposed a complex motion called Epicycles. Epicycles are described as an orbit within an orbit. For example, looking at Venus, Ptolemy claimed that it orbits the Earth, and as it orbits the Earth, it also orbits the original orbit which is demonstrated in the illustration to the right. Ptolemy emphasised that the epicycle motion does not apply to the Sun. This model were Earth is positioned at the centre of the Solar System, is known as the Geocentric model. alt= == Medieval Astronomy == === Islamic astronomy === The Islamic golden age period in Baghdad, picking off from Ptolemy's work, had more accurate measurements taken followed by interpretations. In 1021, Ibn Al Haytham adjusted Ptolemy's geocentric model to his specialty in optics in his book Al-shukuk 'ata Batlamyus which translates to \\"Doubts about Ptolemy\\". Ibn al-Haytham claimed that the epicycles Ptolemy introduced are inclined planes, not in a flat motion which settled further conflicting disputes. However, Ibn Al Haytham agreed with the Earth being in the centre of the Solar System at a fixed position. Nasir al- Din, during the 13th century, was able to combine two possible methods for a planet to orbit and as a result, derived a rotational aspect of planets within their orbits. Copernicus arrived to the same conclusion in the 16th century. Ibn al-Shatir, during the 14th century, in an attempt to resolve Ptolemy's inconsistent lunar theory, applied a double epicycle model to the Moon which reduced the predicted displacement of the Moon from the Earth. Copernicus also arrived at the same conclusion in the 16th century. === Chinese Astronomy === In 1051, Shen Kua, a Chinese scholar in applied mathematics, rejected the circular planetary motion. He substituted it with a different motion described by the term ‚Äòwillow-leaf‚Äô. This is when a planet has a circular orbit but then it encounters another small circular orbit within or outside the original orbit and then returns to its original orbit which is demonstrated by the figure on the right. == Up to Newton == === Copernicus's Heliocentric Model === Nicholas Copernicus, in reflecting about Ptolemy and Aristoles interpretations of the Solar System, believed that all the orbits of the planets and Moon must be a perfect uniform circular motion despite the observations showing the complex retrograde motion. During the 16th century, Nicholas Copernicus introduced a new model which was consistent with the observations and allowed for perfect circular motion. This is known as the Heliocentric model where the Sun is placed at the centre of the Solar System and the Earth is, like all the other planets, orbiting it. The heliocentric model also resolved the varying brightness of planets problem.. Copernicus also supported the spherical Earth theory with the idea that nature prefers spherical limits which are seen in the Moon, the Sun, and also the orbits of planets. Copernicus believed that the universe had a limit, a spherical limit. Copernicus contributed further to practical Astronomy by producing advanced techniques of observations and measurements and providing intsructional procedure. A visual representation of the Earth-orbiting around the Sun in an elliptical orbit. === Kepler's model === In 1609, Johannes Kepler, using his teacher's (Tycho Brahe) accurate measurements, noticed the inconsistency of a heliocentric model where the sun is exactly in the centre. Instead Kepler developed a more accurate and consistent model where the sun is located not in the centre but at one of the two foci of an elliptic orbit. Kepler derived the three laws of planetary motion which changed the model of the Solar System and the orbital path of planets. The three laws of planetary motion are: # All planets orbit the Sun in elliptical orbits (image on the left) and not perfectly circular orbits. # The radius vector joining the planet and the Sun has an equal area in equal periods. # The square of the period of the planet (one revolution around the Sun) is proportional to the cube of the average distance from the Sun. :\\\\frac{a^3}{T^2}=\\\\frac{GM}{4\\\\pi^2} where a is the radius of the orbit, T is the period, G is the gravitational constant and M is the mass of the Sun. The third law explains the periods that occur during the year which relates the distance between the Earth and the Sun. === Galileo's discoveries === With the help of the telescope providing a closer look into the sky, Galileo Galilei proved the heliocentric model of the Solar System. Galileo observed the phases of Venus's appearance with the telescope and was able to confirm Kepler's first law of planetary motion and Copernicus's heliocentric model. Galileo claimed that the Solar System is not only made up of the Sun, the Moon and the planets but also comets. By observing movements around Jupiter, Galileo initially thought that these were the actions of stars. However, after a week of observing, he noticed changes in the patterns of motion in which he concluded that they are moons, four moons. === Newton's interpretation === After all these theories, people still did not know what made the planets orbit the Sun. Until the 16th century when Isaac Newton introduced The Law of Universal Gravitation. This theory claimed that between any two masses, there is an attractive force between them proportional to the inverse of the distance squared. :F = G \\\\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} where m_1 is the mass of the Sun and m_2 is the mass of the planet, G is the gravitational constant and r is the distance between them. This theory was able to calculate the force on each planet by the Sun, which consequently, explained the planets elliptical motion. == See also == *Timeline of Solar System astronomy *History of astronomy *Timeline of astronomy == References == Category:History of astronomy ","title":"Historical models of the Solar System"},{"id":"60325963","text":"Pampanga longganisa is a Filipino pork sausage originating from the province of Pampanga.

The election will be conducted by the New South Wales Electoral Commission (NSWEC). The third-term incumbent Liberal/National Coalition government, currently led by Premier Gladys Berejiklian, will seek a fourth four-year term against the Labor opposition, currently led by Opposition Leader Jodi McKay. New South Wales has compulsory voting, with optional preferential voting in single-member seats for the lower house and single transferable vote with optional preferential above-the-line voting in the proportionally represented upper house. ==Background== At the 2019 election, the Coalition won a third term in government for the first time since 1971 while Gladys Berejiklian became the first woman in New South Wales to lead a party to a state election victory. At the election the Liberals won 35 seats while the Nationals won 13 seats, thus giving the Coalition a combined total of 48 seats, one more than the minimum 47 required for a majority. The Labor Party won 36 seats and overtook the Liberals to become the largest single party in the Legislative Assembly. However, the party only managed to gain two seats from the Coalition, Coogee from the Liberals and Lismore from the Nationals. The Greens strengthened their hold on the three seats they held prior to the election while the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers held onto Orange, a seat the party had won from the Nationals at a by-election, while also taking Barwon and Murray from the Nationals. Independents Greg Piper and Alex Greenwich both retained the seats of Lake Macquarie and Sydney, respectively, while Joe McGirr successfully held on to the seat of Wagga Wagga he won in a by-election. Following a controversy surrounding koala policy, on 10 September 2020, Nationals leader John Barilaro announced his party would no longer support government legislation and sit on the crossbench, while still holding ministerial positions. Premier Berejiklian has threatened to sack all Nationals ministers if they do not abandon their plan by 9:00am, 11 September 2020. However, following a meeting between the Premier and Deputy Premier in the morning of 11 September, the Nationals backed down on their decision to move to the crossbench. ==Date== The parliament has fixed four-year terms with the election held on the fourth Saturday in March, though the Governor may dissolve the house sooner on the advice of the Premier. ==Registered parties== 17 parties are registered with the New South Wales Electoral Commission (NSWEC). * Animal Justice Party * Australian Labor Party * Christian Democratic Party (Fred Nile Group) * Country Labor Party * Flux Party * Greens NSW * Liberal Democratic Party * Liberal Party of Australia * National Party of Australia * Open Party * Pauline Hanson's One Nation * Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party * Small Business Party * Socialist Alliance * Sustainable Australia * Reason Party ==Polling== ===Voting intention=== ===Voting intention=== Polling that is conducted by Newspoll and published in The Australian is conducted via random telephone number selection in city and country areas.

Located across Federal Street from the main Armory grounds, Federal Square was the site of some of armory's early facilities, including a Continental Army magazine during the American Revolutionary War. It was also the site of a brief clash in Shays' Rebellion, in which four rebels were killed. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. It is currently being developed by Springfield Technical Community College as a technology business center. ==Description and history== Federal Square is located adjacent to the Springfield Armory National Historic Site, but forms part of the historic armory grounds, occupying an entire city block bounded by Federal, State, Magazine, and Lincoln Streets. The block is lined by wrought iron fencing, with the principal vehicular entrance on Federal Street. There are nine historically significant buildings square, including four built in the period between 1880 and 1900 in the Classical Revival style, and two built in the 1940s with Art Deco styling. Near the junction of State and Federal Streets stands a replica of one of the 1767 Milestones. The Federal Square area has been part of the Springfield Armory since 1782 but was not significantly developed for the manufacture of arms until the second half of the 19th century. It is here that weapons were made for the Spanish-American War and World War I, and where the M1 carbine rifle was developed. During World War II Federal Square is believed to have been the largest single manufactory of weapons in the world, producing 3.5 million M1s. In the post- war years, Federal Square became a research and development center, and was closed along with the rest of the armory in 1968. ==See also== * National Register of Historic Places listings in Springfield, Massachusetts * National Register of Historic Places listings in Hampden County, Massachusetts ==References== Category:Historic districts in Hampden County, Massachusetts Category:National Register of Historic Places in Springfield, Massachusetts Category:Springfield, Massachusetts Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Massachusetts ","title":"Federal Square Historic District (Springfield, Massachusetts)"},{"id":"60326022","text":"The 22nd season of Arthur started airing on PBS Kids in the United States from May 13, 2019 to May, 16 2019.

It comprises the cities of Erfurt, Weimar and Jena and Gera as well as parts of the districts of Weimarer Land, S√∂mmerda, Gotha, Ilm-Kreis, Saale-Holzland-Kreis and Burgenlandkreis. The transport association Verkehrsverbund Mittelth√ºringen is supported by Verkehrsgemeinschaft Mittelth√ºringen GmbH (VMT GmbH). As part of this transport association, the Verbundtarif Mittelth√ºringen (short for VMT or Voll-Mobil-Ticket) was introduced, which applies to trains and trams as well as various bus routes in the independent cities of Erfurt, Weimar, Jena and Gera and in the district of Weimarer Land with the city of Apolda. The tariff merger was mainly due to the high number of passengers and commuters between the four cities. ==History== The tariff came into force on April 1, 2006, replacing the RegioMobil tariff, which was a predecessor of Deutsche Bahn. The price of the tickets depends on the tariff zones to be crossed. With the ticket, trains of DB Regio, Abellio Rail Mitteldeutschland, S√ºd-Th√ºringen-Bahn and Erfurter Bahn, the regional public transport in the cities as well as the intercity bus services of the municipal and private transport companies in the network area can be used. When the timetable was changed in February 2009, validators were introduced at the stations in the tariff area, so that the rule that all tickets had already been validated, which some customers found impractical, no longer applied. On 12 December 2010, the VMT was extended to include the Saale-Holzland-Kreis, the remaining parts of the Weimarer Land district, the Gotha district and the city of Gera. In addition, the railway lines to Bad Langensalza as well as individual bus lines to S√∂mmerda, Zeitz, Neustadt an der Orla, Rudolstadt, Oberhof, Schmalkalden and Eisenach are included in the integrated tariff. ==Fare zones== Verkehrsverbund Mittelth√ºringen is divided into 106 tariff zones. There are four city tariff zones: Erfurt (10), Weimar (20), Jena (30), Gera (40) and 102 regional tariff zones. ===Railway lines=== The following railway lines are complete or sectional in the tariff area: *Halle‚ÄìBebra railway (Gro√üheringen‚ÄìApolda‚ÄìWeimar‚ÄìErfurt‚ÄìGotha‚ÄìMechterst√§dt) *Weimar‚ÄìGera railway (Weimar‚ÄìJena‚ÄìGera) *Gro√üheringen‚ÄìSaalfeld railway/Orla Railway (Gro√üheringen‚ÄìJena‚ÄìOrlam√ºnde‚ÄìFreienorla) *Leipzig‚ÄìProbstzella railway (Crossen Ort‚ÄìGera-Zw√∂tzen) *Strau√üfurt‚ÄìGro√üheringen railway (Buttst√§dt‚ÄìGro√üheringen) *Ilm Valley Railway *Sangerhausen‚ÄìErfurt railway (Erfurt‚ÄìStotternheim) *Wolkramshausen‚ÄìErfurt railway (Erfurt‚ÄìRingleben-Gebesee) *Bad Langensalza‚ÄìK√ºhnhausen railway *Gotha‚ÄìLeinefelde railway (Gotha‚ÄìBad Langensalza) *Friedrichroda Railway ==Transport companies== ===Railway companies=== * Abellio Rail Mitteldeutschland * DB Regio * Erfurter Bahn * S√ºd-Th√ºringen-Bahn ===Tram and bus=== * Erfurter Verkehrsbetriebe (SWE EVAG) * Stadtwirtschaft Weimar (SWG) * Jenaer Nahverkehrsgesellschaft (JeNah) * Personenverkehrsgesellschaft Weimarer Land (PVG), ApoldaWebseite des PVG Weimarer Land. ‚ÄûDie ehemaligen Gesellschaften PVG mbH Apolda und OVG mbH Weimar b√ºndeln ab sofort ihre Kr√§fte und sind f√ºr Sie als Personenverkehrsgesellschaft mbH Weimarer Land t√§tig.‚Äú ‚Äì abgerufen 29.

The majority of rail traffic in the tariff area takes place on the Erfurt-Weimar- Jena axis. Here, in turn, the proportion of only rail drivers is very high. Since the introduction of the integrated tariff, this customer group has been confronted with sometimes drastic price increases without making use of a corresponding service. In the rest of the integrated area beyond the main axis, which is characterized by a strong regional breakdown, the local transport offer often does not represent an alternative to individual transport, so that the positive aspects of an integrated tariff cannot unfold in the desired way either. The criticism is supported by the Pro Bahn passenger association and is now also being expressed in initiatives by local transport users. ===BahnCard-50 holder=== The initial non-recognition of the BahnCard 25 and 50 led to price increases for holders of these cards. The price difference between regional trains and ICE trains on the Erfurt-Weimar route was only 0.85 euros for a BahnCard 50 customer. This led to unwanted use of the ICE between Erfurt and Weimar by local transport customers. A 25% BahnCard discount was therefore introduced on 1 January 2008. This is granted to holders of the BahnCard 25 or BahnCard 50 when travelling through at least two tariff zones. The BahnCard 100 is recognised as an annual ticket on trains and in city traffic in Erfurt, Weimar, Jena and Gera. A 25% discount applies to all BahnCards on regional bus services. For BahnCard-50 holders, a curiosity may arise in the case of pure train journeys that longer journeys or long-distance journeys that break away from the network are cheaper than journeys at the network tariff. There are two reasons for this. The group tariff includes possible bus and tram journeys and the transport companies participating in the group receive only a small compensation for the recognition of the BahnCards. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Transport in Thuringia Category:Transport associations in Germany Category:Companies based in Erfurt Category:2006 establishments in Germany Category:Companies established in 2006 ","title":"Verkehrsverbund Mittelth√ºringen"},{"id":"60326183","text":"Pat Murpy was an Australian rugby league footballer who played in the 1920s.

It was often the large spinners' union, and provided much of the leadership of the Spinners' Amalgamation. ==History== A union of spinners existed in Oldham by 1797, and may have been in continuous existence thereafter. In 1843, it was reconstituted under the name of the Oldham Provincial Cotton Spinners' and Self Actor Minders' Association, and established an office on Roch Street in the town. From the start, the union had branches in Lees, Shaw and Waterhead, in addition to Oldham, and it soon expanded to included branches in Chadderton, Hollinwood, Middleton and Royton. By 1868, it had 2,226 members. The union was a member of the Association of Operative Cotton Spinners, Twiners and Self-Actor Minders of the United Kingdom from its formation in 1845, but left in 1853, and held membership intermittently thereafter. In 1870, it was a founder member of the new Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton Spinners, but it retained control over the welfare benefits it paid members, and over wage negotiations. Initially its second-largest province, after Bolton, it grew steadily. By 1919, it provided 40% of the entire membership of the amalgamation, but when piecers were admitted, it again fell behind Bolton. In 1939, it still had 10,000 members, spread over 15 branches. After World War II, membership of the union declined rapidly, and in 1973 it stood at only 12 people. Despite this, it survived until 1980, when it was dissolved. ==General Secretaries== :1868: Thomas Ashton :1913: Fred Birchenough :1936: Albert Knowles :1953: Walter Lee :1967: Frederick Mayall ==References== Category:Oldham Category:Defunct trade unions of the United Kingdom Category:Cotton industry trade unions Category:Trade unions established in the 1840s Category:Trade unions disestablished in 1980 Category:1843 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:1980 disestablishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"Oldham Operative Cotton Spinners' Provincial Association"},{"id":"60326221","text":"Pinuneg is a Filipino blood sausage originating from the Igorots.

In need of trying a different genre than his previous fictions, Iqbal focused the novel on major three themes; sexual abuse to men, domestic violence and bullying. In an interview Iqbal said; \\"I initially struggled to develop the story considering the fact that its themes are labelled to be disgusting in the Maldivian culture\\". After posting three to four episodes of his narration, Iqbal received positive comments from readers and decided to build the story further. ===Production=== On 11 March 2016, it was announced that a new production studio, Me studio, has acquired the rights to develop a film based on Ahmed Iqbal's 2012 novel, Ehenas Hama Loabiveyey. The production team expressed their interest to produce the film due to the \\"lukewarm response\\" the novel has received despite its \\"fragile issue\\" the original story touches upon. They projected to start filming in May 2016 and release the film before the year ends. However, on 30 January 2019, it was reported that the producers later changed the project to be developed as a web series rather than a feature film, citing the idea of expanding the story and hence \\"incidence can be fully elaborated and justified\\" in a series without being \\"trimmed\\" for a film. A casting call was opened for interested actors on the same day by actress Aishath Rishmy. Workshops were held for those actors who were selected to star in the film from the audition. Director, Ravee Farooq revealed that majority of the actors are newcomers though the film will feature established actors like Sheela Najeeb and Mohamed Manik. Filming for the series began on 15 February 2019. ==Soundtrack== ==Release== The teaser trailer of the series was released on 24 March 2019. The official trailer came out on Youtube on 20 April 2019. The first episode of the show was streamed on 16 July 2019. ==Response== The series opened to mainly positive reviews from critics.

It was promulgated by a constitutional convention of 35 members: 19 from the Executive and Advisory Councils of the Provisional Government of Hawaii and 18 delegates elected by those who were eligible to do so. While based on the American system of government, there were several notable changes. ==Preparations for the constitutional convention== When it was obvious that annexation to the United States would not be immediate, the Provisional Government decided to end their temporary form of government and establish a more permanent system of government. A resolution to elect a constitutional convention to draft a permanent constitution passed the Provisional Government on February 15, 1894, who appointed a committee to draft a law for it. That committee came back with a draft on March 8, which was passed into law a week later on March 15. The election was set for May 2, 1894. The method of election was changed from those of previous ones in Hawaii: each voter had as many votes as delegates his district were to choose, and could split them however they wish. Voters were required to be male and at least twenty years old, to have lived in Hawaii for at least a year and be a registered voter, to swear allegiance to the Provisional Government, to be \\"of Hawaiian, American or European birth or descent\\", and to have paid their taxes for 1893. Those who had not paid their taxes or resided in Hawaii for the required time could still vote, though, if they could prove they were soldiers, militiamen, or policemen on January 1, 1894. Some supporters of the Provisional Government, not to mention supporters of the Kingdom of Hawaii, opposed the allocation of delegates since it ensured members of the government would always have a majority. That opposition did not prompt any changes in the apportionment of delegates. Clubs supportive of annexation combined to form an American Union Party, which requested government endorsement but was denied as in their view it would be \\"impolitic\\". The government also encouraged Native Hawaiians to register, and asked Albert S. Willis, the ambassador of the United States to Hawaii, to issue a statement that the monarchy was over; he refused because he stated he did not have the authority to do so. Portuguese on the islands were also enticed to vote by the promise that the oath to the Provisional Government would not affect their status as Portuguese citizens. In April 1894 the Provisional Government began to prepare a draft for the Convention to consider when writing the final document. Eight to twelve people from Honolulu advised them, and Lorrin A. Thurston, Hawaiian minister to the US at the time, also sent in his thoughts on the matter. They also received many proposals from the United States, but discarded most of them because they did not consider them \\"in line with existing circumstances\\". There was some competition, but no organized opposition parties, in the election. Against the wishes of the administration that government officials not be nominated, a judge was nominated in a Honolulu district, while another campaigned for the constitution to be ratified by popular vote, not just by the convention. A little more than four thousand people were reported to be registered, less than half the number of those registered for the preceding one. On the day of the election, 2,904 people voted, about three-quarters of those registered and 2.9 percent of the whole population of the islands. While people from many countries with many political views were elected, none were opposed to annexation. ==The convention== The convention The convention opened at 11 AM on May 30, 1894, at the legislative hall in the Judiciary Building. President Sanford B. Dole gave the opening address, in which he declared that the monarchy had come to its end by attempting to deprive the people of their rights. He also reminded the delegates that they had a \\"difficult and delicate...duty...to perform.\\", as the people of Hawaii came from many countries and were \\"without a common origin, religion or purpose\\". He stated voting was a duty, not a right, which only intelligent people could perform well, and recommended that only people who owned a certain amount of property should be allowed to vote, as in his view this would reflect intelligence. After settling a dispute over whether one of its members had been lawfully elected, the Convention decided upon how it was to approve the constitution: there would be two readings, in each of which the constitution would be considered article by article. Later a third reading was added \\"for purposes of revision only.\\" The first thirteen articles, relating to the rights of the people, were mostly passed by unanimous consent, but a clause banning advocacy for restoring the monarchy, violently overthrowing the government, or invading the country, was shot down and replaced by a clause banning \\"the publication or public utterance of seditious or indecent language\\". A section allowing the government to make laws for the \\"registration, supervision, control and identification of all persons or of any class or nationality of persons\\" was placed in the very first article. At the second reading it was decided that the government should have the right to appeal acquittals in criminal cases, but later it was repealed. The question of who could vote and be a citizen hung over the Convention. The draft allowed people who had lived in Hawaii for a year, spoke English, come from a country \\"with express treaty stipulations with the Republic of Hawaii concerning naturalization\\", had a way to support themselves, owned $200, and swore an oath of loyalty to the Republic of Hawaii to be naturalized. After much debate between those who favored one and three years of residence in Hawaii to qualify for citizenship, a compromise at two years of residence was carried by one vote. The requirement for the naturalized person to come from a nation with treaty relations with the Republic of Hawaii led the Chinese population of the islands, whose government did not have a treaty with Hawaii, to petition the convention twice requesting equal rights, as well as the Japanese consul on Hawaii to demand equal rights of suffrage for his people, but the convention did not amend this clause. In fact, there were no countries in the world who had signed a naturalization treaty with Hawaii, but the problem was solved with the mechanism of \\"denization\\". ==References== Category:Republic of Hawaii Category:1894 in Hawaii Constitution of the Hawaiian Republic Category:Hawaii state constitutions ","title":"1894 Constitution of the Republic of Hawaii"},{"id":"60326406","text":"Scofray Nana Yaw Yeboah (born 13 September 1980) is a Ghanaian writer, author, columnist, and a transformational coach.

The work is based on her family biography, with Casa de Mujeres focusing on the experience and impact of colonialism in Panama, and La Negra addressing the time when her family migrated first to the American south, and then to New York City in the mid 1960s. The name for the title La Negra, comes from the nickname given to her grandmother by her family. Mozman Solano has been awarded residencies at LMCC workspace, Smack Mellon, The Camera Club of New York, and Light Work, as well as a Fulbright Fellowship.Mozman Solano's work has been reviewed in The New York Times, Artnexus, The Village Voice, The Wall Street Journal.

His work examines the constraints and potential in the desire for Indigenous advancement, while challenging existing gazes onto traditional Native culture. Polys is known for his films, institutional critique, and carved sculptures incorporating materials such as abalone, glass, liquids, resins, silicone, as well as the ready-made. == Early life and education == Polys was born in the Tlingit territory located in the Pacific Northwest of the United States near the border of British Canada. At the early age of three, Polys began carving with his father Nathan Jackson (artist). He was adopted into the Dakl‚Äôaweid√≠ Clan of the Jilk√°at Kw√°an and worked as a visual artist with the names of Stephen Paul Jackson and Stron Softi. During this time Polys began to carve large-scale totemic sculptures.

He is the recipient of a 2017 Native Arts and Culture Foundation (NACF) Mentor Artist Fellowship, and Advisor to Indigenous New York. == Art == Jackson Polys' artistic practice explores the history, historiography, and contemporary experience of native peoples. Polys practices wood carving from his traditional training with his father Nathan Jackson (artist), integrating research into traditional native-American carving techniques. In \\"Manifest X,\\" a collaboration with Robert Mills, the two artists created sculptures that Tlingit visual traditions while revealing the expansive potential for self expression through these forms. This project, among others, seeks to correct the treatment of native artifacts and objects by institutions such as museums.

His work incorporates traditions in oil painting, acrylic, collage and printmaking to comment on intersections of identity and culture. ==Early life and education== William was born in 1983 in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. He grew up in Miami, Florida, and received his BFA in painting from The Maryland Institute College of Art. William earned his MFA in painting and printmaking from Yale University School of Art. He was an artist in residence at the Marie Walsh Sharpe Art Foundation in Brooklyn, NY and has taught at the Yale School of Art, Vassar College, Columbia University, and SUNY Purchase. In 2016 he was appointed Chair of the MFA Program at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia. He vacated this position in May 2019. In the fall 2019, Didier was appointed Assistant Professor in Expanded Print at Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University, NJ. ==Career== Didier William's paintings are concerned with blackness and other identities subjected to an othering gaze and socioeconomic oppression, drawing on his experiences of immigrating to the United States from Haiti. His works embrace traditional conventions of painting in their size and planarity, but integrate collage and mixed media to reflect to layers on meaning in each piece. Didier's exploration of the gaze, Haitian Voudou, history, folklore, and identity is expressed through works that depict human figures. His Curtains, Stages, Shadows series (2017-2018) was in part inspired by events surrounding Trayvon Martin, an unarmed teenager who was shot to death in 2012. He is currently working on a large-scale project related to Curtains, Stages, Shadows for 2020. ===Exhibits=== His work has been exhibited at group shows and solo exhibitions in various institutions, including The Museum of Latin American Art in Long Beach, Bronx Museum of Art, Frederick and Freiser Gallery, The Fraenkel Gallery, and Gallery Schuster in Berlin. ====Solo exhibitions==== 2010\\\\.

Based in Brooklyn and Mexico City, Barbata's work uses art and performance to encourage social justice by documenting traditions and involving communities in her practice. == Early life and education == Laura Anderson Barbata was born 1958 in Mexico City, Mexico. She moved to Sinaloa, where her father was a restaurateur, and spent the early part of her childhood in Mazatl√°n with little or no access to museums. When she was 10 years old, Barbata's family moved to Europe. The first museum her parents took her to was the Louvre. Deeply impacted by the Winged Victory of Samothrace, Barbata began to explore the world through drawing. She studied sculpture and engraving at the School of Visual Arts at the University of Rio de Janeiro and architecture in Mexico City. == Work == Anderson has exhibited in the United States, Mexico, Europe, and South America. She is in the permanent collection and has shown at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, NY; The Museum of Modern Art, Mexico City, Mexico; and the Museum of Modern Art, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, among others. Barbata has organized projects in the Amazon of Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, Mexico, Norway and the USA. Among her current projects include The Repatriation of Julia Pastrana and her project Transcommunality (ongoing since 2001) with traditional stilt dancers from New York, West Africa, the Caribbean, and Oaxaca, Mexico. Barbata's art is deeply entwined with social practice, community engagement, and postcolonial critique. For the Yanomami Paper Project, Barbata worked as an apprentice to the Yanomami Community in the Amazonas region of Venezuela. In return, she taught the community how to make books and paper from local resources. Barbata has continued to work with this community, producing books in the Yanomami language with drawings by the community's children. The Yanomami community continues to make their own papers and books. Some of these books are now held in collections including the Library of Congress, and the New York Public Library. === Transcommunality === In 2002, while working as an artist-in-residence in Trinidad and Tobago, Barbata was introduced to the founder of the Keylemanjahro School of Arts and Culture in Port-of-Spain. The school hosted an after school stilt dancing program open to all kids, intended to keep children out of trouble while also engaging them in the cultural tradition of stilt dancing to prepare for the annual NCBA Junior Carnival Parade. Barbata worked with Keylemanjahro for 5 years alongside the students and parents to create costumes for their performances. The group worked with little to no resources and relied exclusively on the help of parents in the neighborhood. The children had been creating their costumes by painting their bodies with toxic house paint. Additionally, students participated in carnival with the same presentation every year, which excluded them from competing for character awards. Barbata suggest that the children could develop and create their own costumes to learn about the environment and other cultures, and worked with Keylemanjahro to discuss possible themes and design of characters for the kids to portray and compete. In 2007, Barbata returned to New York and continued her work with stilt dancing by collaborating with the Brooklyn Jumbies, a group of stilt dancers from the West Indies and West Africa. Together they hosted Jumbie Camp, a workshop to train young stilt dancers and prepare for a street performance on 24th Street in Chelsea, and later for the West Indian American Junior Carnival Parade. Barbata has continued to work with the Brooklyn Jumbies to extend outreach programs in different parts of the country, particularly in communities or areas that are populated by Mexican descendants and African-Americans. They have staged multiple spontaneous interventions around New York City. In 2011, Barbata and the Brooklyn Jumbies staged Intervention: Wall Street in response to the economic crisis. The performance took place in the financial district of New York. The Moko Jumbies walked on stilts in business suits towards Wall Street, while Barbata strolled and danced in front handing out gold-covered chocolate coins. The coins had the word Mexico on it. Intervention: Indigo took place in 2015 in Brooklyn, New York in response to violence against African American communities. The performance began at the Bushwick police precinct and ended in an area populated by artists. The performers were dressed in indigo-colored textiles inspired by the Danza de los Zancudos (traditional stilt dancers from Zaachila) from Oaxaca and the Dance of the Devils (Danza de los diablos) from the Afro-Mexican coast of Guerrero. === Julia Pastrana === In 2003, Barbata learned about Julia Pastrana when she was invited to collaborate on designs for the New York premiere of the play The True History of the Tragic Life and the Triumphant Death of Julia Pastrana, the Ugliest Woman in the World by Shaun Prendergast. Barbata felt deeply moved by Pastrana's story and drew a connection to her own childhood experience growing up in the same area of Mexico as Pastrana and dancing for money. Barbata's ultimate dream goal was that Pastrana should go back to Mexico and be buried. In 2005, during a residency in Oslo, Barbata began petitioning the Institute of Forensic Medicine at the University of Oslo for Pastrana's repatriation. In September, she published an obituary for Pastrana in an Oslo newspaper that informed that there would be a catholic ceremony (faith that Ms. Pastrana practiced during her life). Barbata organized the catholic mass in memory of Julia Pastrana in the Cathedral of Oslo. The ceremony was attended by hundreds of people, many of whom were circus performers who brought her flowers. Barbata sent documents making her case for Pastrana's release to Norway's National Committee for the Evaluation of Research on Human Remains. Barbata also wrote letters to the National Research Ethics Committee for the Social Sciences and Humanities, the Governor of Sinaloa in Mexico, the Foreign Affairs Department of Mexico, the University of Oslo, journalists, artists, and anthropologists. Many of these recipients became invested in the project. In 2012, Governor Mario L√≥pez Valdez of Sinaloa joined Barbata's cause and petitioned for Pastrana's repatriation. L√≥pez Valdez sent a letter to the National Committee for Ethical Evaluation on Human Remains, NESH, to request for the repatriation of Julia Pastrana to her native state for burial. His letter was accompanied by a letter by Barbata that included the moral, ethical and social justifications for Pastrana's return to Mexico for burial. NESH responded to the repatriation petition with a document recommending that Julia Pastrana be repatriated to M√©xico. The University of Oslo and the Institute of Basic Medicine of the University of Oslo received NESH's recommendation, a formal petition from L√≥pez Valdez's, as well as a letter from Barbata herself. The university accepted Julia Pastrana's repatriation to Mexico, but with the conditions that she never be exhibited again, that she be buried and not cremated, and that she be given funeral services following her Catholic faith. On February 7, 2013, Barbata confirmed the identity of Pastrana's body in Oslo before the coffin was sealed. Ms. Barbata and a University of Oxford forensic anthropologist, Nicholas M√°rquez-Grant, noticed that Pastrana's feet still had bolts and metal rods that were used for exhibiting her body. The bolts were removed and placed at the foot of her coffin. Pastrana's coffin was transported by plane from Oslo to Culiac√°n where she was welcomed with a military arrival. The following day, on February 12, the coffin of Julia Pastrana was transported from Culiac√°n to Sinaloa de Leyva. She was welcomed with official ceremonies and a funeral mass, then taken to the Municipal Cemetery following local traditions. Julia Pastrana's coffin was covered in flowers and buried. Pastrana was dressed in an indigenous huipil made by Francisca Palafox, a master weaver from Oaxaca and placed in her coffin with a photograph of her child on her chest. Her tomb was covered in concrete and enclosed in walls that measure more than 1 meter in thickness to ensure that her tomb will never be vandalized and to guarantee that she will never be exposed again. The tomb was then covered with thousands of flowers that had arrived from all over the world. Barbata's book The Eye of the Beholder: Julia Pastrana‚Äôs Long Journey Home brings together contributors from a wide variety of fields to explore Pastrana's story. Barbata has explored Pastrana's story through a variety of other mediums, such as through performance work, photography, and stop motion animation. == Selected exhibitions == === Solo exhibitions/performances === * Intervention: Indigo.

This documentary film accounts the problems faced by Dalits and caste-based discrimination in their daily life. It recounts the story of the people who have faced abomination like social boycott, communal attacks by Jatts (upper caste) in Punjab. The project records the recent disturbances in the state. ==Background== The documentary analysis about the caste and class system in Punjab, India. According to the ancient Hindu law book Manusmriti, society is divided into four Varnas; Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras and there are people who don't belongs to these Varnas, they known as Avarnas (Untouchables). They are considered as sub-humans and are set to do the jobs considered foul and disregarded in a society, like, manual scavenging. They were not allowed get education, to enter the religious buildings, and they were not permitted to use the public spaces as Varnas. The documentary talks about Punjab, where the caste-dynamics is unlike the rest of India due to the establishment of Sikh religion in this state in the mid-1500s. The Sikh religion had no space for caste-discrimination in theory, the Gurus preached egalitarianism across all the classes and caste groups and sought for the upliftment of the classes and groups marginalised by Hinduism. This attracted the disregarded groups to Sikhism. ==References== Category:Indian documentaries Category:Punjabi- language films ","title":"Landless (film)"},{"id":"60326641","text":"Guadalupe Maravilla, formerly known as Irvin Morazan (born 1976) is a multidisciplinary artist born in San Salvador, EL Salvador and based in Brooklyn, New York and Richmond, Virginia. Maravilla explores current events, migration, ancient medicine, indigenous cultures and autobiography through various mediums including performance, sculpture and video. Maravilla has performed and presented his work across the United States and Latin America, including institutions such as the Whitney Museum, the New Museum, El Museo Del Barrio, the Caribbean Museum in Colombia and MARTE Museum in El Salvador. == Early life and education == Irvin Morazan was born in El Salvador in 1976. Maravilla was in a boy band in El Salvador from when he was 6 to 8 years old that toured Central America. Maravilla often played on the steps of the pyramids in El Salvador and spent his early childhood drawing and creating sculptures. In 1984, Maravilla crossed the border into Texas alone escorted by a coyote to escape the Salvadorian Civil War. Maravilla and his family later arrived in New York City where he started attending art school and exploring different aspects of New York culture, like hip-hop. He was undocumented until he became a US citizen at 16 years old. Maravilla was the first in his family to go to college. He received his BFA in 2003 from the School of Visual Arts where he studied photography and later received a MFA in sculpture from Hunter College in 2013. == Art == Maravilla's practice combines indigenous traditions with urban culture. He often makes sculptural headdresses that mimic pre- Columbian dress, which serve as costumes in his performances. In 2011, Maravilla performed Crossing Performance at the Mexico-United States border. Maravilla wore a tall, spiky headdress fusing Mayan and futuristic imagery while swimming across the Rio Grande. The headdress contained a large solar reflector that reflected the sun's light, drawing the attention of Border Patrol agents. Maravilla's work is largely inspired by his childhood experience of emigrating to the United States. In 2016, Irvin Morazan changed his name to Guadalupe Maravilla as a gesture of solidarity with his undocumented father‚Äîwho uses Maravilla as his last name in his fake identity. The el coyote‚Äîor border-crossing agent‚Äîis featured in his overall work. The sculptural work Border Crossing Headdress is Maravilla's interpretation of the coyote, made using soil from the American-Mexican border region. Maravilla has staged multiple large-scale performances incorporating hip-hop, theater, sculpture, sound, video, and photography. His performance BOOM! BOOM! WHAMMM! SWOOSH!(2017) consisted of him directing a feminist motorcycle gang inside the Texas State Capitol parking garage. Maravilla conducted over thirty immigrant performers. The participants included quince√±eras, Tibetan throat singers, and immigrants with disabilities. In 2018, Maravilla collaborated with undocumented immigrants to create 10 drawings alongside a 42 ft mural. Participants drew onto digital manipulations of the Historia Tolteca- Chichimeca (ca. 1550), a colonial Mexican manuscript that combines Nahua pictorial writing with European conventions of the historical annal. The lines are drawn based a Salvadoran game called Tripa Chuca, in which participants draw lines connecting pairs of matching numbers distributed across the page without crossing over previously drawn paths. == Selected exhibitions == === Solo exhibitions === * The Neighbors, part three: Love Thy Neighbor, Bronx Museum of the Arts, Bronx (2017) * Xolo Yawning, Y Gallery, New York (2016) * Temple of the Bearded Man, DCKT Contemporary, New York (2011) === Group Exhibitions/Performances === * Pacha, Llaqta, Wasichay: Indigenous Space, Modern Architecture, New Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, NY (2018) * FIRST WE TAKE MANHATTAN, Ethan Cohen New York, NY (2016) * The Magus Performance, Metropolitan Museum of Art, NY (2014) * 10, an exhibition celebrating MARTE Contemporary's 10 year anniversary, Museo de Arte de El Salvador (MARTE) and MARTE Contemporary (MARTE-C), San Salvador (2014) * Tandem in Pursuits: Armor & Ichthyology, Bronx, NY (2012) * 9th Annual BRONX RIVER Sights & SOUNDS Festival, Bronx River Art Center, Bronx, NY (2012) * Performa 11, The Dating Game, El Museo Del Barrio, NY (2011) * I Didn't Cross the Border, the Border Crossed Me, Museum of Contemporary Native Arts, Santa Fe, NM (2010) * Hair Tactics, Jersey City Museum, Jersey City, NJ (2010) * == Awards == * Creative Capital Emerging Fields Award (2016) * Virginia Commonwealth University Fountainhead Fellowship (2014) * Dedalus Foundation Fellowship (2013) * Art Matters Grant (2012) * Cisneros Foundation Grant (2012) * Robert Mapplethorpe Award, Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation (2003) == References == == External links == * Official Website * Profile at Creative Capital Category:Living people Category:American contemporary artists Category:American performance artists Category:21st-century American artists Category:Salvadoran emigrants to the United States Category:1976 births ","title":"Irvin Morazan"},{"id":"60326642","text":"Camille Hoffman is a painter and mixed-media installation artist, living and working in New York, NY. Using everyday materials and drawing from Philippine weaving and Jewish folk traditions, Hoffman combines personal narrative and historical critique. Hoffman's work reflects on the embedded meanings of light, nature, the frontier, borders, race, gender and power in American landscape paintings of the 19th century. Hoffman has worked as an arts educator and community organizer in Phoenix, the San Francisco Bay Area, New Haven, Brooklyn, and Queens. == Early life and education == Camille Hoffman was born in Chicago, IL in 1987. She earned her BFA in Community Arts and Painting from the California College of the Arts in 2009. She received her MFA in Painting and Printmaking from the Yale School of Art in 2015, during which she received the Carol Schlosberg Memorial Prize for excellence in painting and a Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship for research in Spain. == Art == Camille Hoffman's work examines colonial histories, consumerism, and play. Her paintings and installations layer traditional art materials with textures and objects from the everyday. Hoffman's landscape works are a mixed- media meditation on Manifest Destiny and its representation in the romantic American landscape. She reflects on the enclosed meanings found in light, nature, the frontier, borders, race, gender and power in the 19th century American landscape paintings. Taking inspiration from her ancestors' Philippine weaving techniques and Jewish folk traditions, with the addition of traditional landscape painting techniques from her academic training, Hoffman integrates refuse into the image, to reveal trans-cultural contradictions. These works incorporate holiday-themed tablecloths, discarded medical records, nature calendars, plastic bags, paint, and other materials to make imaginary landscapes grounded in accumulation, personal narrative and history. Hoffman has been the recipient of numerous honors, including a National Endowment for the Arts Award and the Van Lier Fellowship from the Museum of Arts and Design. == Exhibits == Hoffman has exhibited her work throughout the United States and in Europe. === Solo exhibitions === 2005\\\\.

It is the fifth novel in his planned Quincunx Cycle, a thematically linked series that examines faith, place, love, power and hatred which began with his 2014 novel Pastoral. Though labelled the fifth work in The Quincunx Cycle, it is the fourth by order of publication as the third quincunx will be the final one to be written and released. Days by Moonlight was published in 2019 by Coach House Books. The novel also featured illustrations by Linda Watson. It follows a botanist, Alfred Homer, who has lost his parents, who joins his friend, professor Morgan Bruno on a journey through Southern Ontario. ==Plot== Alfred \\"Alfie\\" Homer is a botanist who has just broken up with his long-term girlfriend, Anne, and who is coming up on the year anniversary of his parents' death in a car accident. He is invited to take a road trip through Southern Ontario with a friend of his parents, Morgan Bruno, a literature professor writing a book on a mysterious poet, John Skennen, who lived in various towns in Southern Ontario before mysteriously disappearing. As they travel through several small towns, Homer and Bruno encounter several exploitative and malevolent practices kept up by the smaller towns. In Nobleton they witness a house raising and a house burning, where poor families who have been given the raised house from the previous year must struggle to keep it from burning or be homeless again. In Coulson's Hill they witness the Indigenous Parade, a festivity of reparations for oppressed minorities to be given the opportunity to throw fruit at the colonial oppressors of the past which overtime had grown so increasingly racist and prejudiced that when Homer and Bruno arrive all participants wear blue sheets in order to disguise their identities. They then proceed to the town of Schomberg where a long standing law forbidding black people to talk during the day has led to the rise in a region specific sign language. While in Schomberg, the two pick up a hitch hiker who persuades them to head to New Tecumseth to visit the museum of Canadian Sexuality. While the museum leaves Homer feeling disconcerted, Bruno befriends their tour guide, Michael. Michael invites Bruno and Homer to visit them in Marsville. While there they befriend Michael's roommate, Judith, and her father John, who reveals himself to be John Skennen, now going by his birth name, John Stephens. Stephens reveals that after his girlfriend left him he was devastated and walked to Feversham, a town with more religious leaders than the Vatican City, where he had a religious experience that convinced him to tend the road to Feversham for 21 years and which caused him to accept the loss of his girlfriend and eventually, to quit writing poetry. Hearing of his experience Homer realizes that one of the things Stephens has described is a rare plant that Homer had been looking for. Homer goes to Feversham where he finds the plant and also has a vision. Returning to normal life Homer discovers that he suddenly has healing abilities, something that Bruno is skeptical of, despite witnessing Homer heal an arthritic man and two dogs near death. They go to see Skennen in his home in Barrow where Skennen tells Homer that people who have visions in Feversham often get one of three gifts. Skennen can cause anything he touches to multiply, which he demonstrates by multiplying grains of sand, Homer has the power to heal, which he does by resurrecting a dead mouse, and the third and final gift is the ability to cause fires which is the rarest of all and which Skennen only claims to have seen in one other person. Skennen also warns Homer to keep his gift secret, telling him of a man with healing abilities who was caught and abused by a biker gang who eventually murdered him. Homer returns with Bruno to Toronto and lies to him about his gifts, reassuring him that Skennen told him that his restorative powers were a delusion. Returning home Homer contemplates whether his ability to resurrect animals extends to humans and contemplates resurrecting his own parents. ==The Quincunx Cycle== The novel contains various allusions whether direct or indirect to other novels in Alexis' cycle. Frick and Frack, two of the dogs featured in Fifteen Dogs make cameo appearances in a story told about John Skennen as attack dogs who were set upon the unwanted suitors of Carson Michaels, John Skennen's love. The novel directly references Pastoral as a book Alfie Homer has read, and the final segment of the novel takes place in the fictional town of Barrow, where Pastoral is set. ==Reception== The novel received positive reviews upon publication. Writing for the Toronto Star, Robert Wiersema called it \\"deceptively simple, and almost overpoweringly rich.\\" The novel was longlisted for the 2019 Giller Prize,\\"Margaret Atwood, Andre Alexis among 12 authors up for $100,000 Giller book prize\\".

Coxon was a foundation player for South Sydney being a part of the club's first ever season. ==Playing career== Coxon made his first grade debut for Souths against Cumberland in Round 2 1908 at the Royal Agricultural Society Grounds. Souths went on to claim the inaugural minor premiership in 1908 and reach the first New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) grand final against Eastern Suburbs. Coxon played a hooker as Souths claimed their first premiership winning 14-12 at the Royal Agricultural Society Grounds in front of 4000 spectators. In 1909, Coxon played 11 times for the club as Souths claimed their second premiership in a row against Balmain in controversial circumstances. Balmain were furious that the 1909 NSWRL grand final was to be played as the under card to the Wallabies v Kangaroos match. Balmain were seemingly aggrieved at the demotion of importance of the Final, and asked the NSWRL to ensure it was played on a separate day. They also argued that their players labour should not go towards paying money owed to Joynton-Smith and the NSWRL. The League refused and Balmain announced that they would not play. On the day of the Final the Balmain players arrived outside the ground in the early afternoon, well before the scheduled kick-off time of 2 o‚Äôclock. They then picketed the entrance, endeavouring to convince patrons not to enter. Despite very heavy rain and the protests of the Balmain footballers, enough of a crowd turned up to clear the debts of Joynton-Smith and the NSWRL.

It is set in Germany and America, primarily in the years leading up to World War II and details how a mysterious harmonica and the music it makes ties together the lives of three children: Friedrich Schmidt, an intern at the Hohner factory; Mike Flannery, an orphan in Philadelphia; and Ivy Maria Lopez, the daughter of migrant farm workers. It was named a Newbery Honor book in 2016. ==Plot summary== The framing story is set in Germany circa 1889;The prologue begins with \\"Fifty years before the war to end all wars ...\\" while playing hide-and-seek with his friends, Otto becomes absorbed in a book he had purchased from a Gypsy entitled The Thirteenth Harmonica of Otto Messenger, which relates the story of three unwanted princesses given over to a witch for safekeeping. Their father, the king, had given each of them to a midwife shortly after their births while he was waiting for a male heir; the midwife, in turn, passed them on to her sister, a witch. After the heir arrives, the princesses are informed of their royal birth and prepare to rejoin their family; however, rather than releasing them, the witch curses the girls: Hohner Marine Band harmonica Otto is so engrossed in the story that he has wandered into the woods where the princesses have been trapped. He has in fact brought a harmonica with him (one pressed on him by the same Gypsy who sold him the book) and is able to retrieve their spirits, now stored in the harmonica. When the story resumes almost 70 years later, the harmonica is discovered in a storage room of the Hohner factory by Friedrich Schmidt; it is in a box marked \\"Marine Band/1896\\" with a matching cover plate for export to the United States and is distinguished by a red script letter M on the pearwood comb. Herbert Hoover with Albert N. Hoxie and the Harmonica Band of Philadelphia The novel traces the journey of the harmonica from Friedrich to two orphan brothers, Mike and Frankie Flannery in Philadelphia, and then to a migrant worker's daughter, Ivy Maria Lopez in California. Each child has unusual musical talent and faces unique challenges in their lives: Friedrich, who dreams of being a conductor, was forced to drop out of school after the bullying that resulted from his appearance, and is threatened with sterilization in Nazi Germany; Mike, a talented pianist, wishes to join Albert N. Hoxie's Philadelphia Harmonica Band of Wizards as a way to escape the orphanage and poverty while taking care of his younger brother, Frankie; and Ivy, just discovering her talent and love for music, is forced to attend a segregated school while helping her father and mother take care of the Yamamoto family farm after the Yamamotos were forced into internment camps after the attack on Pearl Harbor. === First Part === The harmonica's first messenger after Otto is Friedrich Schmidt. Set in October 1933, Friedrich is a German boy afflicted with a birthmark on his face that causes him to look deformed. After Friedrich was bullied and beaten up at school for his conducting obsession, he works and is taught at the Hohner Harmonica Factory in the town Trossigen in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany, where his father used to work. While eating lunch, Friedrich hears music being played and discovers a harmonica with the letter M on it. He pockets the instrument and rushes back to the factory. Since the harmonica was not a traditional instrument in Germany, he hid it in one of the boxes of harmonicas sent to shops in order to protect himself. ==Development== Mu√±oz Ryan began researching the first successful school desegregation case, Roberto Alvarez v. the Board of Trustees of the Lemon Grove School District (1931). During her research into integrated classrooms, she found an old photograph of an elementary school harmonica band, which gave her the ideas of a girl in an integrated band and (as in Hoxie's), a band filled with orphans, which developed into the stories of Ivy and Mike, respectively. Contemporary photographs showed the children played the Marine Band harmonica, so Mu√±oz Ryan contacted Hohner and visited their harmonica museum in Trossingen, where she was inspired to begin developing Friedrich's story. ==Reception== In 2016, the American Library Association named Echo to its list of Newbery Honor winners, alongside Kimberly Brubaker Bradley's The War That Saved My Life and Victoria Jamieson's Roller Girl. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2015 American novels Category:Young adult novels Category:Newbery Honor-winning works ","title":"Echo (Mu√±oz Ryan novel)"},{"id":"60326906","text":"The Morgan State University Memorial Chapel, also known as the Student Center for Morgan State College, Morgan Christian Center, Morgan Interfaith Center, and Susie Carr Love Chapel, is a historic building located on the campus of Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland, United States.

Carson Transit Center is the hub for public transit in Indianapolis, Indiana. Opened in 2016, it is sited in downtown Indianapolis at 201 East Washington Street and is near the Cultural Trail and YMCA Bike Hub. The center received awards for \\"Excellence in Built Environment\\" at the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce's Monumental Awards ceremony in 2017. A waiting pavilion and IndyGo services center comprise the northeastern portion of the facility. The center is named after Julia M. Carson, a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1997 until her death in 2007. == Facilities == The facility is located on a half-block of land in the Mile Square that is bounded on the north by Washington Street, the east by Alabama Street, the west by Delaware Street, and the south by Pearl Street. It is between the City-County Building and its Richard G. Lugar Plaza to the north and the present Marion County Jail I to the south. The facility contains nineteen right-side entry/exit bus bays, with two curbside bays (one each along Alabama and Delaware streets), eleven in the middle portion of the center, and six along the north curb of Pearl Street. These bays are identified by letter, from A through H and J through T. Upon completion, IndyGo's Customer Service Retail Center moved from 34 North Delaware Street to the center. Additionally, the center includes free Wi-Fi, public restrooms, a conference room, administrative offices, a bus operator lounge, seating, real- time arrival and departure information, 19 bus bays, and of retail space. Of IndyGo's 31 routes, 26 routes offer transfers at the station. ==History== After years of planning, public officials held a groundbreaking for IndyGo's downtown transit center in September 2014. The site, a surface parking lot bounded by East Washington, East Pearl, South Delaware, and South Alabama streets in downtown Indianapolis, was the public transportation corporation's first unified transit center. The project was paid for with a $13.5 million federal grant and $6.5 million from the agency's capital improvement budget. In May 2015, construction halted after excavators unearthed archaeological finds dating to the 1800s, including building foundations. The discoveries delayed the project seven months and increased costs by $5 million, with work commencing in October 2015. In April 2016, the Indianapolis City-County Council passed a special resolution formally naming the transit center for Julia Carson, former U.S. Representative for Indiana's 7th congressional district from 1997 until her death in 2007. During her tenure in Congress, Carson helped secure federal funding for the $26.5 million transit center. A ribbon-cutting ceremony was held on June 21, 2016, with formal bus service beginning on June 26, 2016. Since its completion, the transit center has received accolades for its contemporary design and environmental- sustainability components. The Indy Chamber recognized the project at its 40th Monumental Awards on October 19, 2017. IndyGo's design team, including AECOM, Axis Architecture + Interiors, Guidon Design, Rundell Ernstberger Associates (REA), and Loftus Engineering, Inc., received the Honor in Architecture, Achievement in Engineering, and Honor in Landscape Architecture awards.

Millar and Permelia Kennedy Millar. His father had emigrated to the United States from Scotland in 1845. He grew up in Warren, Ohio. During his primary education, he took some painting lessons from John Bell (1846-1895), a local landscape painter. In his late teens, he won three consecutive awards from The Youth's Companion, in their annual art contests. This prompted his parents to allow him to go to Cincinnati to take formal lessons from the genre painter, De Scott Evans. Following these studies, he set himself up as a portrait painter in Cleveland. By 1883, he was living in New York City, where he attended the Art Students League. In addition, he attended the Shinnecock Hills Summer School of Art with William Merritt Chase. In 1894, he went to Paris, where he studied at the Acad√©mie Julian with Jean-Joseph Benjamin- Constant and Giovanni Boldini. He remained in Europe for several years, travelling and painting. In 1895, while visiting Spain with his friend Chase, he crossed over to Algiers; a trip which would provide inspiration for many of his best known works. He held exhibits in cities across the country, including shows in Philadelphia, Boston and Chicago. He held memberships with the Society of American Artists and the National Academy of Design. He and his wife were both killed when an express train ran into their car in South Norwalk, Connecticut. In addition to the Smithsonian Institution, the New York Public Library, the Boston Museum of Fine Art and the Biblioth√®que nationale de France, his work has been featured at the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Library of Congress and the Rhode Island School of Design. == Legacy == In 2011, an auction in Connecticut sold Millar's ‚ÄúRue du Sphinx, Algers‚Äù for $7,200.

Arrested on 30 March 1968 at Barcelona's La Gran Cava, she was eventually convicted and sentenced to between 127 days and one year in prison, followed by a two‚Äìyear mandatory ban from going to Barcelona and two years of government supervision. Mar√≠a Helena's case indicates that, although past and current conservative narratives challenge the existence of lesbians and gender-nonconforming women in Spain, the state was aware of them. == Biography == According to prison records, as a young child, Mar√≠a Helena never wanted to play with dolls, nor liked playing in the kitchen. She would have her first sexual experience with another woman at the age of 12 in Montevideo. She did not like wearing women's underwear. 21-year-old Mar√≠a Helena was charged in Catalonia with violating the Ley de Vagos y Maleantes on 30 March 1968, with a file number of 296.Platero, R.

She was arrested after going to the La Gran Cava, where while dressed as a man she tried to pick up a woman. Her case was brought before Judge Antonio Sabater, one of the principle authors of the first draft of the Ley de Vagos y Maleantes de 1933. The charge against her read, \\"She was arrested when she was in the bar La Gran Cava, located on Calle Conde del Asalto number 25 in a suspicious attitude and dressed as a man. She has no background, stating that he does not engage in any activity, living off the charities she is given and sometimes making blood donations. She says that she dresses as a man so that he can deceive women towards whom he feels an irresistible inclination.\\" () The act that precipitated her arrest was drinking wine at a bar while appearing in masculine clothes, violating state norms by challenging the gender norms of the period. While there are elements of transvestism in the arrest sheet, it is unclear if she was transgender. In the sentencing decision, the court ruled, \\"Her clearly, defined and manifest tendency towards homosexuality, make it particularly dangerous to coexist with the young women who have received this patronage, whom she has already tried to make her homosexual practices in the few days she has been hospitalized. Such dangerousness [...] is what makes us put the aforementioned young woman at the disposal of the illustrious Special Court, especially when, to a greater extent, our rehabilitation services inform us in an absolutely negative sense as regards the possibility of reeducation of this young woman, given her age and characteristics.\\" () While initially held in a Barcelona prison, she was then transferred to the Women's Section of the Junta Provincial de Madrid prison facilities as a dependent of the Ministry of Justice. While in prison, her body and mental state were examined by the state. This included searching for physical deformities, measuring the size of her clitoris and asking for detailed information about her sexual habits. Her final prison sentence term was given at between 127 days and one year in prison, followed by a 2-year mandatory ban from going to Barcelona and two years of government supervision. This sentence followed guidance spelled out in the Ley de Vagos y Maleantes. == Historical importance == Mar√≠a Helena's behavior was so transgressive that the state felt a need to interfere with it and punish it. Despite this, the state does not make clear if the problematic nature of her behavior is that it was homosexual and transvestite in manner. Was she a butch lesbian or a trans man? Government texts discussing her incarceration do not make this clear. While not much more is known about Mar√≠a Helena, her story is important in highlighting how women who expressed masculine attributes were not acceptable to the Franco regime. Further, her story makes clear that despite regime propaganda, lesbians and lesboerotic behavior did exist during this period. This is important as religious groups and political parties like Partido Popular have continued to argue that the Francoist period was one in which lesbians did not exist, and that sexually deviant and sexually immoral behavior only existed in Spain as a consequence of the liberalization following the Spanish transition to democracy. Mar√≠a Helena's story is important because her exception case destabilizes narratives by repressive regimes by challenging false dichotomies. == Context == The 1933 Ley de Vagos y Maleantes defined homosexuality as criminal act. It was constitutionally replaced by the 1970 Ley de Peligrosidad Social, which labeled homosexuality as a mental illness. These laws would later be used to imprison women and to commit them to mental institutions. Under the 1933 era law, only two charges were made against women. One of the women prosecuted under the law was prosecuted in the period between 1971 and 1978. At the time of Mar√≠a Helena's arrest, women did not go out alone to bars, and they did not transgress on masculine spaces. == References == Category:1947 births Category:Possibly living people Category:People from Barcelona Category:Lesbian history in Spain Category:LGBT people from Spain ","title":"Mar√≠a Helena NG"},{"id":"60327022","text":"Martha Kunig-Rinach, n√©e Martha Rinach (1 April 1898 ‚Äì 24 March 1993) was a German actress and operetta singer (mezzo-soprano). == Life and career == Born in Munich, Kunich-Rinach made her debut at the age of 17 at the Munich Residenz Theatre.

She is known for glass, ceramic, and mixed media sculptures that portray the processes of birth, death, and renewal. Many of her pieces involve human-animal hybrids. Reviewing her 1997 solo exhibition Living with Ghosts at the Radix Gallery, New York, critic Mark Zimmerman said of her \\"Bothwell‚Äôs work turns symbols into spirits of creation.\\" Her work is held in permanent public collections such as the Corning Museum of Glass, Corning NY; Racine Art Museum, Racine, WI; Shanghai Museum of Glass Art, Shanghai, China; Mobile Museum of Art, Mobile, AL; Palm Springs Museum, Palm Springs, CA and the Alexander Tutsek - Stiftung foundation, Munich, Germany. == Biography == Christina Bothwell was born in New York City, and grew up primarily in town and cities in New York and Pennsylvania. Her parents were not conventional. Her father James was a psychologist, while her mother Rosemary was a realist painter. Bothwell drew her mother's nude models from a young age, and created a dollhouse out of clay for herself. Beginning in childhood, Bothwell has had ‚Äúexperiences beyond the five senses,‚Äù such as premonitions and lucid dreams, that have convinced her of a spiritual dimension that transcends the material world. That awareness has heavily influenced her later work. Bothwell studied painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts from 1979 to 1983, working with Will Barnet. She later moved to Manhattan, where she met her husband, writer and illustrator Robert Bender. She spent ten years in New York City, trying to further her artistic career, but increasingly felt pressured and inauthentic. A major turning point for her occurred when she and her husband moved to rural Pennsylvania. Bothwell states that ‚ÄúMoving out to the country was the point where I started following my heart.‚Äù She now sees nature as the main source for her artistic ideas and influences. ‚ÄúThere have been times, usually when I‚Äôm in nature, when I‚Äôve felt completely in alignment with the best of who I am.\\" She has tried to bring that sense of attunement to her pieces. Increasingly drawing on animals and the natural world around her, she created figures in mixed media using clay, found objects, and old cloth. Although some of her pieces were described as \\"exceptionally crafted, exquisitely detailed figurative offerings\\", her work in the late 1990s was also characterized as nightmarish, or as having a disturbing quality. Bothwell achieved a second breakthrough in 1999, when she attended a workshop on glassmaking at the Corning Museum. She saw the potential for combining glass with the materials she was already using, to bring lightness and delicacy to her work. In her work she challenges herself to portray the soul, inner awareness, and the connections between life and nature. Combining pit-fired clay with translucent layers of fired glass helps her to create a sense of mystery and things seen and unseen. Although still seen at times as \\"unsettling\\", these later works are also described as \\"beautiful\\", \\"ethereal\\" and \\"serene\\". In a 2017 review, curator and art critic William Warmus describes Bothwell's work as both metaphorical and narrative. He emphasizes the skill required to master and combine three media: painting, ceramics, and glass. He sees the transitions that occur when she combines those media in her works as a way of encompassing time: \\"When her figures fuse together or break apart, it is generally a sign that time is flowing, on the move, toward the future from the past.\\" Warmus describes Bothwell's pieces as \\"tender\\" and \\"gentle\\", suggesting that \\"Perhaps they are uncomfortable in the present, preferring the transitional territory defined by the processes of birth and death?\\" == Awards == Bothwell has won numerous scholarships and grants including a Pollock-Krasner Foundation Grant and a Virginia A. Groot Foundation award for excellence in sculpture. == Setbacks == On August 8, 2018 a massive fire destroyed Bothwell's art studio, a converted barn in Pennsylvania. Four days later a flood raged through the area, causing further destruction. A significant number of her works along with equipment, materials and personal objects, were destroyed in addition to the studio itself. Losses also included several thousand copies of Robert Bender's children's books, stored in the barn. Since the structure was insured only as a residence, and not as a commercial property, Christina and her husband did not receive compensation for the value of the studio and its contents. Bothwell has encouraged other artists to learn from her experience, and urges people not to cut corners by declaring their studios or home offices as residential, since they will not be adequately covered in the event of a disaster. She has chosen to view the disaster as a new start, and an opportunity to revitalize and expand her work. == References == Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:Artists from New York City Category:Glassblowers Category:20th-century American women artists Category:Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts alumni Category:21st-century American women artists ","title":"Christina Bothwell"},{"id":"60327067","text":"Bez Tebe (; ; stylized in sentence case) is the debut studio album by Slovenian singer-songwriter Senidah. It was released on 25 March 2019 under Belgrade-based label Bassivity Digital. Songs were written by the artist and Benjamin Krnetiƒá and produced by An≈æe Kacafura, with the exception of \\"Crno Srce\\", which is written and produced by Slobodan Veljkoviƒá. The record, containg ten tracks, is primarily urban music incorporating electronic, soul and indie music. Lyrically, songs are about searching for love. ==Background== In March 2018 Senidah released her trap solo single \\"Slaƒëana\\" for Belgrade- based label Bassivity Digital, quickly acquiring enormous popularity on the West Balkans. The second single \\"Belo\\" (White) was then released on 3 June. The title track and \\"Nisi Bio Tu\\" (You Weren't Here) were released on 28 December, alongside lyrics videos. \\"Slaƒëana\\" won The Best Hip-Hop Song of the Year Award at the 2019 Music Awards Ceremony. She started teasing the album on the ceremony red carpet, alongside her collaboration with RAF Camora. On 19 March 2019 Senidah announced the release of her debut studio album via Instagram. On the day of release, she held a promotion for media, friends and colleagues and presented the music video for \\"Crno Srce\\" (Black Heart). The rest of the songs were uploaded to YouTube on 15 May. ==Music and lyrics== A trap and soul record, Bez Tebe also features elements of synth-pop and indie music. The songs were composed by Senidah alongside album's producer An≈æe Kacafura, while the lyrics were written by Benjamin Krnetiƒá. The album's opening track, \\"Soba\\" (Room), has a slow trap beat completed with emotional lyrics, settling the tone for the whole record. The meaning behind the title of the lead single, \\"Slaƒëana\\", which is a common female first name, was said to be a representation of a random girl seeking for love, whom people can relate to. Whilst, some believe that the title is referring to the street slang term for amphetamine and its influence as an escape from reality, disappointment and loneliness. Others think it's referring to Serbian rock musician Slaƒëana Milo≈°eviƒá, who's noted for her unique appearance and musical style. The third track, \\"Crno Srce\\" (Black Heart), deepens the dark atmosphere. However, \\"Aman\\" (Enough Already) brings brighter vibe, despite singing about a relationship coming to its end. The song also incorporates several Turkish terms common to the West Balkans. The title track, \\"Bez Tebe\\", is a melancholic trap ballad. Sixth track, \\"Treƒái Svet\\" (Third World), was described as a 'summer jam'. \\"Vatra\\" (Fire), also features summer motives, but with a darker tone. \\"Belo\\" (White), again holds a drug reference this time with explicit allusions laced throughout the track. \\"Strava\\" (Horror) was described as a rave love song influenced by the '80s music. The final track, \\"Nisi Bio Tu\\" (You Weren't Here) was based on an unfortunate event from Senidah's life and brings honest ending to the album, featuring acoustic guitar and powerful vocals. In an interview for the Serbian edition of Hello! she dubbed it \\"her saddest song that she doesn't want to talk about\\". ==Critical reception== Bez Tebe was met with generally positive reviews from critics. On behalf of Slovenian magazine Mladina, Gregor Kocijanƒçiƒç praised the album and remarked that Senidah brought back the epicentre of Balkan music to Ljubljana for the first time following the punk scene of the 1980s. Nevertheless, he was critical of the record's occasional embrace of turbo-folk elements, while abandoning the frames of R&B.; Writing for Muzika.hr, Patrik Horvat called the album the artist's \\"powerful and interesting introduction to the general public\\", noting that she \\"faithfully transformed her heavy emotions into impressive pieces of art that were authentically brought out by her voice\\". Vanja Ratkoviƒá of Noizz.rs drew comparisons between the voice of the artist and the voice of British musician FKA twigs \\"due to their mysteriousness\\", claiming that \\"the Balkans have finally come up with an artist who can compete at an international level\\". ==Track listing== Credits adapted from Discogs.

It served on the Western Front, including the Attack on the Gommecourt Salient, the Battle of Passchendaele, and the crushing victories of the Allied Hundred Days Offensive in 1918. ==Mobilisation== 93rd Siege Battery was formed under War Office Instruction 181 of 16 December 1915 from a cadre of three officers and 78 other ranks (the establishment of a TF garrison company) supplied by the Cornwall (Duke of Cornwall's) Royal Garrison Artillery, a coast defence unit of the Territorial Force based in Falmouth, Cornwall. It was formed at Plymouth and equipped with four 9.2-inch howitzers, carrying out its final training at Avonmouth during April 1916.WO Instructions for December 1915.Frederick, pp. 702‚Äì3.'Allocation of Siege Batteries RGA', The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 95/5494/4.MacDonald, Lack of Offensive Spirit, pp. 104‚Äì5.MacDonald, Pro Patria, pp. 174‚Äì6. ==Service== A Holt caterpillar tractor hauling a 9.2-inch howitzer on the Somme, summer 1916. The battery left for the Western Front on 5 May, the men sailing from Folkestone to Boulogne where they were joined on 8 May by the guns and lorries from Avonmouth. They then had to drag their heavy howitzers by road to Bayencourt; the Commanding Officer (CO) noted that the caterpillar tractor drivers appeared not to have had any training with the guns attached. The gun platforms were constructed and the guns mounted by 27 May and the gunners spent the next three weeks preparing their positions, digging 10 dugouts and four shell shelters. ===Gommecourt=== On 29 May the battery was assigned to 35th Heavy Artillery Group (HAG) which was due to support VII Corps' Attack on the Gommecourt Salient in the forthcoming 'Big Push' (the Battle of the Somme). Its main role was to use the high-angle fire of its howitzers to bombard German trenches and strongpoints facing 46th (North Midland) Division's attack frontage. Firing from the south-west of the Gommecourt salient they could take the trench lines in enfilade. The specific targets assigned to 93rd Siege Bty were the German support and reserve trenches from Gommecourt Road to a position known as the 'Little Z', the western edge of Gommecourt Wood, and Fortune, Form and Force trenches. (The divisional commander requested that the German front trench should not be bombarded because he wanted it kept intact for use by his own troops.) The howitzers joined in the bombardment on 25 June ('V' Day, four days before 'Z' day, the date set for the attack). Ammunition for the modern howitzers like the 9.2-inch was in short supply, and had to be carefully rationed during the preliminary bombardment: The planned rate of fire was 50 rounds per gun on V to X days, then 70 rounds on Y day. At all times during daylight, No 8 Squadron Royal Flying Corps had a BE2c observation aircraft in the air spotting fall of shot for 35th HAG's batteries. Because of poor weather for observation, the attack was postponed for two days, and the additional days (Y1 and Y2) were used for further bombardment, although the lack of ammunition resulted in a reduced rate of fire. There were also many 'duds' among the 9.2-inch shells, despite the care taken over fuzes at the insistence of the CO of 35th HAG.Edmonds, 1916, Vol I, pp. 460‚Äì1.MacDonald, Lack of Offensive Spirit, pp. 216‚Äì25, 254‚Äì6, 262‚Äì3.MacDonald, Pro Patria Mori, pp. 188, 191‚Äì2. 9.2-inch howitzer in action on the Somme, 1916. A final bombardment began at 06.25 on Z Day (1 July), with 65 minutes of intense fire before H Hour at 07.30. The 9.2-inch howitzers fired at a rate of nearly two rounds per minute for this period (120 rounds per gun). At 07.28 the heavy howitzers lifted onto their pre-arranged targets in the German support and reserve lines as the infantry got out of their forward trenches and advanced towards Gommecourt behind a smoke screen. The attack of 139th (Sherwood Foresters) Brigade on the left, south of The Z, was initially successful, the leading waves getting into the first German trench (albeit with heavy casualties) and some parties entering the second line. But they were hit by enfilade fire from The Z, even though the RFC observers reported British troops in the Z and Little Z.Edmonds, pp. 461, 465‚Äì7.MacDonald, Lack of Offensive Spirit, pp. 295‚Äì6, 361‚Äì400. There was little that the battery could do to help: communication with its Forward Observation Officer (FOO) was broken for most of the day, and the 9.2s had few shells left. They had been allocated 10 rounds per gun for the first pre-arranged lift, 15 for the second, and their last 25 rounds for the third and final lift. After the initial phase of the attack, therefore, the intensity of the shelling the Germans received, and the direct support that the heavies could offer, was severely limited. Fire from the Z positions and unsuppressed German artillery prevented 139th Brigade's follow-up waves and ammunition carrying parties from crossing No man's land. 139th Brigade's attack had been halted by 09.00 and the leading attack waves were destroyed or driven out of their small gains by the end of the day.Edmonds, pp. 468‚Äì71.MacDonald, Lack of Offensive Spirit, pp. 296‚Äì7, 401‚Äì7, 425. ===1916‚Äì17=== 9.2-inch howitzer in action in April 1917. The Gommecourt attack had only been a diversion for the main attack of the First day on the Somme, and it was not renewed after the failure on 1 July. Third Army was not involved in any major operations for the rest of the year. 93rd Siege Bty remained with Third Army during the summer, but the practice was to move batteries between HAGs as required: it joined 46th HAG on 7 July, then 19th HAG on 18 July, before moving on to 48th HAG. The battery then reverted to 19th HAG on 19 October and remained with it when it came under Fifth Army in December.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 92‚Äì98.'Headquarters Heavy Artillery Groups', TNA file WO 95/5494/1.Farndale, Western Front, Annex E. Fifth Army carried out a series of small Operations on the Ancre, January‚ÄìMarch 1917. 93rd Siege Bty then transferred to 1st HAG on 26 March as Fifth Army followed the German Army's retreat to the Hindenburg Line (Operation Alberich). It moved back to 19th HAG on 18 May (arriving on 23 May) while Fifth Army was engaged in actions against the Hindenburg Line on the fringe of the Arras Offensive.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 114‚Äì20. ===Ypres=== Moving a 9.2-inch howitzer on its travelling carriage, 1917. On 19 June 93rd Siege Bty joined 10th HAG with Third Army, but was actually at rest until 11 July. Then on 11 July it switched to 33rd HAG, which was moving to Second Army in the Ypres Salient. From 1 August Second Army carried out operations in support of the Third Ypres Offensive. During the summer and autumn of 1917 the command of 93rd Siege Bty shifted constantly, though the heavy howitzers were moved less often. It was under 76th HAG from 24 August, 51st HAG from 27 August, 86th HAG from 5 September and 9th HAG from 22 September. Meanwhile, Fifth Army's Ypres offensive was making little progress, and Second Army took over its direction. The Battles of the Menin Road, Polygon Wood and Broodseinde were highly successful because of the weight of artillery brought to bear on German positions. But as the offensive continued with the Battle of Poelcappelle and First and Second Battles of Passchendaele, the tables were turned: British batteries were clearly observable from the Passchendaele Ridge and were subjected to counter-battery (CB) fire, while their own guns sank into the mud and became difficult to aim and fire.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 82‚Äì7.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 201‚Äì214, Maps 28‚Äì31.Edmonds, 1917, Vol II, pp. 237‚Äì62, 280‚Äì309, 323‚Äì34, 338‚Äì60.Wolff, pp. 223‚Äì35, 249‚Äì51. During these battles 93rd Siege Bty had transferred back to 86th HAG on 27 September. After the campaign ground to a halt, the battery was sent to 57th HAG on 19 November, arriving on 24 November. From 28 November it was resting and training in VIII Corps area, where on 14 December it was joined by a section from 183rd Siege Bty, which was being broken up. This brought 93rd Siege Bty up to a strength of six howitzers. On 24 December it joined 69th HAG, now under Fourth Army (which had taken over from Second Army HQ).Becke, Pt 4, pp. 102‚Äì9. ===Spring Offensive=== Section of 9.2-inch howitzers in action, 1917. By now HAG allocations were becoming more fixed, and on 1 February 1918 the 69th was converted into a permanent RGA brigade. The battery stayed with 69th Bde until the Armistice a year later. Because of the inclusion of 93rd Siege Bty it was defined as a 9.2-inch Howitzer Brigade, though the other three batteries were each equipped with 6-inch howitzers.Farndale, Western Front, Annex M. On 1 February 69th HAG was transferred to Fifth Army, which took over a wide front near Amiens. Fifth Army was attacked on 21 March 1918, the first day of the German Spring Offensive. FOOs were blinded by early morning mist and many were overrun along with the infantry in the forward zone. The German bombardment was savage. Some heavy artillery units were caught in the fighting or forced to abandon their guns as the Germans advanced rapidly. Over following days the RGA struggled to get their guns back during the 'Great Retreat'.Blaxland, pp. 35‚Äì68.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 262‚Äì74.Murland. Fourth Army HQ took over all of Fifth Army's formations and units on 2 April. The last attack in the first phase of the German offensive came in on 4 April (the Battle of the Avre) and it was stopped dead by the guns.Blaxland, pp. 98, 103‚Äì6.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 276‚Äì9. Further attacks came on other parts of the front for several months, but none broke through completely. ===Hundred Days Offensive=== 9.2-inch howitzer and crew. The Allied counter-offensive (the Hundred Days Offensive) opened with Fourth Army's attack at the Battle of Amiens at 04.20 on 8 August. 69th Brigade was supporting the Australian Corps on whose front the barrage fired by field and heavy artillery was so thick and accurate that scarcely a German shell fell after 05.40, and all the Australian objectives were secured.Blaxland, pp. 167‚Äì71.Edmonds, 1918, Vol IV, pp. 61‚Äì73.Farndale, Western Front, p. 290. By the end of September Fourth Army had closed up to the Hindenburg Line. On 29 September IX Corps carried out an assault crossing of the St Quentin Canal, with 69th Bde specially attached to 46th (North Midland) Division. The canal defences had largely been destroyed by the heavy guns, which continued firing on the canal banks until the last possible moment as 137th (Staffordshire) Brigade stormed the outpost line and then scrambled across the canal in the morning mist. The objectives were taken by 15.30. 69th Brigade moved its battery positions forward during the night of 30 September/1 October.Blaxland, pp. 232-7.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 101‚Äì6, 139. On 8 October, IX Corps attacked the next German defensive position, the Beaurevoir Line. This time 6th Division attacked, supported by 69th Bde. Harassing fire (HF) had been carried out on the night of 6/7 October, and all through 7 October and up to Zero the heavies carried out CB fire and shelled important localities. Once the attack went in the heavies continued intense CB and long- range HF fire until the infantry were on the objective. The brigade's lighter howitzers (not 93rd's 9.2s) then followed up.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 189‚Äì92. On 11 October preparations began for IX Corps' assault on the German line along the River Selle. CB fire began on 13 October, together with bombardment by the heavy howitzers of important localities chosen by Corps HQ. On 15 and 16 October mist and rain disrupted air reconnaissance, but Zero for the Battle of the Selle was fixed on 16 October for 05.20 the next day. The first day of the battle went well, one German counter-attack being broken up when all available guns were turned onto it, but the attackers were still short of their objective, the Sambre Canal. Steady progress was also made on the second and third days as Fourth Army closed up to the canal.Blaxland, pp. 251‚Äì2.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 295‚Äì305, 318, 325.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 307‚Äì9. IX Corps renewed its advance on 23 October, with 69th Bde part of a massive corps artillery reserve. The attack went in at 01.20 in moonlight, after the heavy guns had done the usual CB and HF bombardments, and the results were extremely satisfactory.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 352‚Äì61. As the regimental historian relates, 'The guns of Fourth Army demonstrated, on 23 October, the crushing effect of well co-ordinated massed artillery. they simply swept away the opposition'.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 311‚Äì2. After a pause to regroup and reconnoitre, IX Corps stormed across the canal on 4 November (the Battle of the Sambre). After that the campaign became a pursuit of a beaten enemy, in which the slow-moving siege guns could play no part. The war ended with the Armistice with Germany on 11 November.Blaxland, pp. 254‚Äì6.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 386‚Äì8, 463‚Äì71.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 318‚Äì20. In the interim order of battle for the postwar army the battery was supposed to form 127th Bty RGA, but this was rescinded after the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, and the battery was disbanded in 1919. ==Footnotes== ==Notes== ==References== * Maj A.F.

He played for South Sydney in the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) competition. Leveson was a foundation player for South Sydney playing in the club's first ever game. ==Playing career== Leveson made his first grade debut for Souths against North Sydney at Birchgrove Oval in Round 1 1908 which was the opening week of the NSWRL competition in Australia. Souths won the match 11-7 with Leveson playing at halfback. Souths went on to claim the inaugural minor premiership in 1908 and reach the first NSWRL grand final against rivals Eastern Suburbs. Leveson played at halfback as Souths claimed their first premiership winning 14-12 at the Royal Agricultural Society Grounds in front of 4000 spectators. In 1909, Leveson played 10 times for the club as Souths claimed their second premiership in a row against Balmain in controversial circumstances. Balmain were furious that the 1909 NSWRL grand final was to be played as the under card to the Wallabies v Kangaroos match. Balmain were seemingly aggrieved at the demotion of importance of the Final, and asked the NSWRL to ensure it was played on a separate day. They also argued that their players labour should not go towards paying money owed to Joynton-Smith and the NSWRL. The League refused and Balmain announced that they would not play. On the day of the Final the Balmain players arrived outside the ground in the early afternoon, well before the scheduled kick-off time of 2 o‚Äôclock. They then picketed the entrance, endeavouring to convince patrons not to enter. Despite very heavy rain and the protests of the Balmain footballers, enough of a crowd turned up to clear the debts of Joynton-Smith and the NSWRL. Balmain stuck to their word and did not appear on the field. Souths kicked off, picked up the ball and scored a try. The referee awarded them the match, and with it the 1909 premiership. In 1910, Leveson played in his third grand final as Souths reached the decider against Newtown. In the dying minutes of the game Souths led 4-2 until Howard Hallett kicked the ball from the near the Souths goal line. Newtown player Albert Hawkes caught the ball on the full near the halfway line and on the touch line. The rules allowed Newtown to claim a fair mark which meant they had the chance to tie the game with a shot at goal.

She joined the staff of the St Cyres School in the Vale of Glamorgan in 1960 and rose to the position of deputy head teacher. During her career, Jones encouraged young girls to study mathematics and art to combat sexism in education, worked to further girls' education and on sex discrimination research in schools. In retirement she focused on campaigning for women's rights with the Wales Assembly of Women (WAW) on the world scene and through the Vale of Glamorgan Labour Party. The WAW established the Audrey Jones Memorial Awards for Research in her honour and her documents and personal papers were deposited at the Glamorgan Archives ==Family background and education== Audrey Evelyn Jones was born in Bushey, Hertfordshire, England on 15 October 1929. She was the oldest of three children to the police officer John Henry Reed and the newsagent Evelyn Mary Reed (n√©e Tofield). Jones' parents were married at the St George's Hanover Square Church in 1928. She had a younger brother, Bernard, and a younger sister, Marion. The family moved to Essex after the death of her mother in 1938 and her father took up a job in the industry of radio engineering. Jones enrolled at Chelmsford County High School for Girls and admired its headteacher Geraldine Cadbury. She later went on to graduate from the University of Southampton. Additionally Jones completed a postgraduate certificate in education at the University of Manchester. ==Teaching career== In 1960 she joined the staff of the St Cyres School in the Vale of Glamorgan. Jones gained the reputation as \\"an uncompromising\\" champion of girls' education and rose to the position of deputy headteacher, a distinction that few woman earned in comprehensive schools of the 1980s. She encouraged young girls to study science and mathematics in an effort to combat sexism in the education system and fostered art and music appreciation. Jones worked with the National Union of Teachers to further girls' education and research on sex discrimination in schools. She co-founded the Wales Women's Rights Committee (WWRC), which petitioned the European Parliament on giving women workers equal treatment to men in 1975. Jones authored a report on the proportion of female secondary school head teachers in Wales for a conference at Nairobi in 1984. That year, the WWRC evolved into Wales Assembly of Women (WAW) and it became her primary campaign platform. ==Retirement from education and death== Following her retirement from teaching in 1990, Jones focused more on campaigning for women's rights with various organisations. She represented the WAW in the preparation for the World Conference on Women, 1995 in Beijing that led to the foundation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. Jones regularly attended sessions in New York City to review on the progress that the Beijing conference had made. Entering Welsh Devolution in 1999 Jones became an impassioned campaigner to persuade the National Assembly for Wales to commit to equal opportunity and marched publicly in her effort to persuade Welsh Labour to adopt constituency twinning to prompt the first Assembly to have gender equality. She campaigned through the Vale of Glamorgan Labour Party, serving on its general committee and the executive, and argued for women's views to be heard to promote equality. Jones collected the works of Welsh contemporary artists and was chair of the Women's Arts Association. She was a founder member of the Women's Archive Wales and was part of the Fawcett Society. In 2003, Jones authored a paper on Violence Against Women. Eight years later, she was one of 60 feminists selected for interview by the British Library for its Sisterhood and After: The Women's Liberation Oral History Project to document activist's memories of seeking political and social equality during the 1970s and the 1980s. Jones became unwell after returning from a meeting in London to prepare for an international conference of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and died of a heart condition on 16 August 2014. She was given a humanist funeral service and was later buried in the Cardiff Natural Burial Meadow. ==Personal life== She married the Welsh-born Hugh Gabriel Jones in 1951 and they had a son, Robert. The family relocated to Wales in 1960 as Hugh had become the head of transport logistics for the multinational chemical company Dow Corning. ==Legacy== Jones was known as \\"a generous, witty and convivial person who worked towards achieving equality of opportunity for all.\\" As an advocate against sexism in secondary education, she became an influence to Welsh students. In 2016, the WAW established the Audrey Jones Memorial Awards for Research in her honour.

Both two embassies of two nations are accredited in Moscow. ==History== Armenians have a long presence in Central Asia since antiquity, in which Armenians, mostly traders, established trade and economic links with the Turks of Central Asia. It would have continued with little interruption, despite Armenia falling into the hands of the Byzantine Empire, Safavid dynasty and to the later Russian Empire, although it declined in the 19th century. Armenian and Russian research materials indicate that in 1890 more than 4,000 Armenians lived in Central Asia, many in what is today‚Äôs Uzbekistan and its neighboring countries. This figure climbed to 5,000 in 1897 and to more that 25,000 in 1917, according to the same sources. The main Armenian communities were in the Uzbek cities of Bukhara, Khiva, Andijan, Kokand and Tashkent. Armenian immigrants moved in large number to the Central Asian region, especially during the World War I which occurred the Armenian Genocide. As part of Tsarist Russia and later Soviet Union, ethnic Armenians were trusted to ongoing immigration to the region, and Armenian immigration also met with little resistance from local Uzbeks. Uzbeks and Armenians were able to get along well until the rise of ethnic nationalism at 1990s that saw clashes between Armenians and Muslim peoples, mainly Tajiks but also a minority of Uzbeks, which ended deadly. However, with the erupt of Tajikistani Civil War, newly independent Uzbekistan tolerated and encouraged Armenians fighting against Tajik-backed forces in the war, mostly Islamists. Consequently, Uzbekistan had its own Armenian militias fighting on the side of Tashkent, and for its efforts, soon became recognized among Uzbek citizens. On the other hand, Uzbekistan was thought to have unofficially acknowledged the Armenian Genocide, though not proven. Uzbekistan served as transit for Armenians to transport weapons, ammunitions, and aids to Armenian forces fighting against Azerbaijani Armed Forces throughout the Nagorno-Karabakh War at 1990s. ==Today== Owned by this closeness, Armenia and Uzbekistan established official tie following the fall of USSR. This close relations was followed by Uzbekistan's embracing Armenian ethnic minority within the country, with its Armenian minority holds annual festivals in the country. There are several Armenian Churches in Uzbekistan, both are well-perceived by the host nation.

The algorithm is based on a classic 1936 paper of J. H. C. Whitehead.J. H. C. Whitehead, On equivalent sets of elements in a free group, Ann. of Math. (2) 37:4 (1936), 782‚Äì800. It is still unknown (except for the case n = 2) if Whitehead's algorithm has polynomial time complexity. ==Statement of the problem== Let F_n=F(x_1,\\\\dots, x_n) be a free group of rank n\\\\ge 2 with a free basis X=\\\\\\\\{x_1,\\\\dots, x_n\\\\\\\\}. The automorphism problem, or the automorphic equivalence problem for F_n asks, given two freely reduced words w, w'\\\\in F_n whether there exists an automorphism \\\\varphi\\\\in \\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n) such that \\\\varphi(w)=w'. Thus the automorphism problem asks, for w, w'\\\\in F_n whether \\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w=\\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w'. For w, w'\\\\in F_n one has \\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w=\\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w' if and only if \\\\operatorname{Out}(F_n)[w]=\\\\operatorname{Out}(F_n)[w'], where [w], [w'] are conjugacy classes in F_n of w, w' accordingly. Therefore, the automorphism problem for F_n is often formulated in terms of \\\\operatorname{Out}(F_n)-equivalence of conjugacy classes of elements of F_n. For an element w\\\\in F_n, w_X denotes the freely reduced length of w with respect to X, and \\\\w\\\\_X denotes the cyclically reduced length of w with respect to X. For the automorphism problem, the length of an input w is measured as w_X or as \\\\w\\\\_X, depending on whether one views w as an element of F_n or as defining the corresponding conjugacy class [w] in F_n. ==History== The automorphism problem for F_n was algorithmically solved by J. H. C. Whitehead in a classic 1936 paper, and his solution came to be known as Whitehead's algorithm. Whitehead used a topological approach in his paper. Namely, consider the 3-manifold M_n=\\\\\\\\#_{i=1}^n \\\\mathbb S^2\\\\times \\\\mathbb S^1, the connected sum of n copies of \\\\mathbb S^2\\\\times \\\\mathbb S^1. Then \\\\pi_1(M_n)\\\\cong F_n, and, moreover, up to a quotient by a finite normal subgroup isomorphic to \\\\mathbb Z_2^n, the mapping class group of M_n is equal to \\\\operatorname{Out}(F_n); see.Suhas Pandit, A note on automorphisms of the sphere complex. Proc. Indian Acad. Sci. Math.

Given w,w'\\\\in F_n the first part of Whitehead's algorithm consists of iteratively applying Whitehead moves to w,w' to take each of them to an \`\`automorphically minimal\\" form, where the cyclically reduced length strictly decreases at each step. Once we find automorphically these minimal forms u,u' of w,w', we check if \\\\u\\\\_X=\\\\u'\\\\_X. If \\\\u\\\\_X e \\\\u'\\\\_X then w,w' are not automorphically equivalent in F_n. If \\\\u\\\\_X=\\\\u'\\\\_X, we check if there exists a finite chain of Whitehead moves taking u to u' so that the cyclically reduced length remains constant throughout this chain. The elements w,w' are not automorphically equivalent in F_n if and only if such a chain exists. Whitehead's algorithm also solves the search automorphism problem for F_n. Namely, given w,w'\\\\in F_n , if Whitehead's algorithm concludes that \\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w=\\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w', the algorithm also outputs an automorphism \\\\varphi\\\\in\\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n) such that \\\\varphi(w)=w'. Such an element \\\\varphi\\\\in\\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n) is produced as the composition of a chain of Whitehead moves arising from the above procedure and taking w to w'. ===Whitehead automorphisms=== A Whitehead automorphism, or Whitehead move, of F_n is an automorphism \\\\tau\\\\in \\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n) of F_n of one of the following two types: (i) There is a permutation \\\\sigma\\\\in S_n of \\\\\\\\{1,2,\\\\dots, n\\\\\\\\} such that for i=1,\\\\dots, n :: \\\\tau(x_i)=x_{\\\\sigma(i)}^{\\\\pm 1} :Such \\\\tau is called a Whitehead automorphism of the first kind. (ii) There is an element a\\\\in X^{\\\\pm 1}, called the multiplier, such that for every x\\\\in X^{\\\\pm 1} :\\\\tau(x)\\\\in \\\\\\\\{x, xa, a^{-1}x, a^{-1}xa\\\\\\\\}. :Such \\\\tau is called a Whitehead automorphism of the second kind. Since \\\\tau is an automorphism of F_n, it follows that \\\\tau(a)=a in this case. Often, for a Whitehead automorphism \\\\tau\\\\in\\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n), the corresponding outer automorphism in \\\\operatorname{Out}(F_n) is also called a Whitehead automorphism or a Whitehead move. ====Examples==== Let F_4=F(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4). Let \\\\tau: F_4\\\\to F_4 be a homomorphism such that : \\\\tau(x_1)=x_2x_1, \\\\quad \\\\tau(x_2)=x_2, \\\\quad\\\\tau(x_3)=x_2x_3x_2^{-1},\\\\quad \\\\tau(x_4)=x_4 Then \\\\tau is actually an automorphism of F_4, and, moreover, \\\\tau is a Whitehead automorphism of the second kind, with the multiplier a=x_2^{-1}. Let \\\\tau': F_4\\\\to F_4 be a homomorphism such that : \\\\tau'(x_1)=x_1, \\\\quad \\\\tau'(x_2)=x_1^{-1}x_2x_1, \\\\quad\\\\tau'(x_3)=x_1^{-1}x_3x_1,\\\\quad \\\\tau'(x_4)=x_1^{-1}x_4x_1 Then \\\\tau' is actually an inner automorphism of F_4 given by conjugation by x_1, and, moreover, \\\\tau'is a Whitehead automorphism of the second kind, with the multiplier a=x_1. ===Automorphically minimal and Whitehead minimal elements=== For w\\\\in F_n, the conjugacy class [w] is called automorphically minimal if for every \\\\varphi\\\\in\\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n) we have \\\\w\\\\_X\\\\le \\\\\\\\varphi(w)\\\\_X. Also, a conjugacy class [w] is called Whitehead minimal if for every Whitehead move \\\\tau\\\\in \\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n) we have \\\\w\\\\_X\\\\le \\\\\\\\tau(w)\\\\_X. Thus, by definition, if [w] is automorphically minimal then it is also Whitehead minimal. It turns out that the converse is also true. ===Whitehead's \\"Peak Reduction Lemma\\"=== The following statement is referred to as Whitehead's \\"Peak Reduction Lemma\\", see Proposition 4.20 in and Proposition 1.2 in:Ilya Kapovich, Paul Schupp, and Vladimir Shpilrain, Generic properties of Whitehead's algorithm and isomorphism rigidity of random one-relator groups. Pacific Journal of Mathematics 223:1 (2006), 113‚Äì140 Let w\\\\in F_n. Then the following hold: (1) If [w] is not automorphically minimal, then there exists a Whitehead automorphism \\\\tau\\\\in \\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n) such that \\\\\\\\tau(w)\\\\_X< \\\\w\\\\_X. (2) Suppose that [w] is automorphically minimal, and that another conjugacy class [w'] is also automorphically minimal. Then \\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w=\\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w' if and only if \\\\w\\\\_X=\\\\w'\\\\_X and there exists a finite sequence of Whitehead moves \\\\tau_1,\\\\dots, \\\\tau_k\\\\in\\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n) such that :\\\\tau_k\\\\cdots \\\\tau_1(w)=w' and : \\\\\\\\tau_i\\\\cdots\\\\tau_1(w)\\\\_X=\\\\w\\\\_X \\\\text{ for } i=1,\\\\dots, k. Part (1) of the Peak Reduction Lemma implies that a conjugacy class [w] is Whitehead minimal if and only if it is automorphically minimal. ===The automorphism graph=== The automorphism graph \\\\mathcal A of F_n is a graph with the vertex set being the set of conjugacy classes [u] of elements u\\\\in F_n. Two distinct vertices [u], [v] are adjacent in \\\\mathcal A if \\\\u\\\\_X=\\\\v\\\\_X and there exists a Whitehead automorphism \\\\tau such that [\\\\tau(u)]=[v]. For a vertex [u] of \\\\mathcal A, the connected component of [u] in \\\\mathcal A is denoted \\\\mathcal A[u]. ===Whitehead graph=== For 1 e w\\\\in F_n with cyclically reduced form u, the Whitehead graph \\\\Gamma_{[w]} is a labelled graph with the vertex set X^{\\\\pm 1}, where for x,y\\\\in X^{\\\\pm 1}, x e y there is an edge joining x and y with the label or \\"weight\\" n(\\\\\\\\{x,y\\\\\\\\};[w]) which is equal to the number of distinct occurrences of subwords x^{-1}y, y^{-1}x read cyclically in u. (In some versions of the Whitehead graph one only includes the edges with n(\\\\\\\\{x,y\\\\\\\\};[w])>0.) If \\\\tau\\\\in\\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n) is a Whitehead automorphism, then the length change \\\\\\\\tau(w)\\\\_X-\\\\w\\\\_X can be expressed as a linear combination, with integer coefficients determined by \\\\tau, of the weights n(\\\\\\\\{x,y\\\\\\\\};[w]) in the Whitehead graph \\\\Gamma_{[w]}. See Proposition 4.6 in Ch. I of. This fact plays a key role in the proof of Whitehead's peak reduction result. ===Whitehead's minimization algorithm=== Whitehead's minimization algorithm, given a freely reduced word w\\\\in F_n, finds an automorphically minimal [v] such that \\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w=\\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)v. This algorithm proceeds as follows. Given w\\\\in F_n, put w_1=w. If w_i is already constructed, check if there exists a Whitehead automorphism \\\\tau\\\\in\\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n) such that \\\\\\\\tau(w_i)\\\\_X<\\\\w_i\\\\_X. (This condition can be checked since the set of Whitehead automorphisms of F_n is finite.) If such \\\\tau exists, put w_{i+1}=\\\\tau(w_i) and go to the next step. If no such \\\\tau exists, declare that [w_i] is automorphically minimal, with \\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w=\\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w_i, and terminate the algorithm. Part (1) of the Peak Reduction Lemma implies that the Whitehead's minimization algorithm terminates with some w_m, where m\\\\le\\\\w\\\\_X, and that then [w_m] is indeed automorphically minimal and satisfies \\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w=\\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w_m. ===Whitehead's algorithm for the automorphic equivalence problem=== Whitehead's algorithm for the automorphic equivalence problem, given w,w'\\\\in F_n decides whether or not \\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w=\\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w'. The algorithm proceeds as follows. Given w,w'\\\\in F_n, first apply the Whitehead minimization algorithm to each of w,w' to find automorphically minimal [v],[v'] such that \\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w=\\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)v and \\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w'=\\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)v'. If \\\\v\\\\_X e \\\\v'\\\\_X, declare that \\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w e\\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w' and terminate the algorithm. Suppose now that \\\\v\\\\_X=\\\\v'\\\\_X=t\\\\ge 0. Then check if there exists a finite sequence of Whitehead moves \\\\tau_1,\\\\dots, \\\\tau_k\\\\in\\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n) such that :\\\\tau_k\\\\dots \\\\tau_1(v)=v' and : \\\\\\\\tau_i\\\\dots\\\\tau_1(v)\\\\_X=\\\\v\\\\_X=t \\\\text{ for } i=1,\\\\dots, k. This condition can be checked since the number of cyclically reduced words of length t in F_n is finite. More specifically, using the breadth-first approach, one constructs the connected components \\\\mathcal A[v], \\\\mathcal A[v'] of the automorphism graph and checks if \\\\mathcal A[v]\\\\cap \\\\mathcal A[v']=\\\\varnothing. If such a sequence exists, declare that \\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w=\\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w', and terminate the algorithm. If no such sequence exists, declare that \\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w eq\\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w' and terminate the algorithm. The Peak Reduction Lemma implies that Whitehead's algorithm correctly solves the automorphic equivalence problem in F_n. Moreover, if \\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w=\\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w', the algorithm actually produces (as a composition of Whitehead moves) an automorphism \\\\varphi\\\\in\\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n) such that \\\\varphi(w)=w'. ==Computational complexity of Whitehead's algorithm== * If the rank n\\\\ge 2 of F_n is fixed, then, given w\\\\in F_n, the Whitehead minimization algorithm always terminates in quadratic time O(w_X^2) and produces an automorphically minimal cyclically reduced word u\\\\in F_n such that \\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w=\\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)u. Moreover, even if n is not considered fixed, (an adaptation of) the Whitehead minimization algorithm on an input w\\\\in F_n terminates in time O(w_X^2 n^3).Abd√≥ Roig, Enric Ventura, and Pascal Weil, On the complexity of the Whitehead minimization problem. International Journal of Algebra and Computation 17:8 (2007), 1611‚Äì1634; * If the rank n\\\\ge 3 of F_n is fixed, then for an automorphically minimal u\\\\in F_n constructing the graph \\\\mathcal A[u] takes O\\\\left(\\\\u\\\\_X\\\\cdot \\\\\\\\#V\\\\mathcal A[u]\\\\right) time and thus requires a priori exponential time in u_X). For that reason Whitehead's algorithm for deciding, given w,w'\\\\in F_n, whether or not \\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w=\\\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w', runs in at most exponential time in \\\\max\\\\\\\\{w_X,w'_X\\\\\\\\}. * For n=2, Khan proved that for an automorphically minimal u\\\\in F_2, the graph \\\\mathcal A[u] has at most O\\\\left(\\\\u\\\\_X\\\\right) vertices and hence constructing the graph \\\\mathcal A[u] can be done in quadratic time in u_X.Bilal Khan, The structure of automorphic conjugacy in the free group of rank two.

Circa 1770, at the request of the Republic of Lucca, the monastery of the Lateran Canons of Santa Maria di Fregionaia was suppressed, with the papal request that it become an institution affiliated with the Hospital of San Luca della Misericordia in Lucca. Some records speak of it transition into an Insane asylum or Spedale de' Pazzi opening in 1773 with 11 patients transferred here from the municipal prison of Torre. Lorenzo Bartolini, then rector of the Hospital of San Luca della Misericordia, during 1772-1775 reorganized the institution. During the second decade of the 19th century, Giovanni Buonaccorsi, altered the institution from one merely housing the insane to one employing manual, mainly agricultural or janitorial, occupation as part of rehabilitation therapy. In 1860, a dance hall with a keyboard organ were added. In the 20th-century, the psychiatrist and author Mario Tobino, was linked to this asylum.

Adopting location- based technology, Cluetivity‚Äôs games use mobile device GPS to follow a treasure hunt inspired storyline. Often equipped with an ‚ÄòActionPack‚Äô ‚Äì an optional extension consisting of a briefcase containing physical items to be used throughout the game - users must follow the on-screen instructions and story to explore their local area, and find clues, source objects, and crack riddles presented by the game. Some titles might also require players engage in activities such as taking a group photo or using specific items in the ActionPack to complete a task. Using geolocation services, the game‚Äôs storyline also adapts itself to match real-world landmarks in the user‚Äôs surrounding area. Cluetivity utilise a license-based business model, where companies purchase a license from Cluetivity to offer pay-per-play games to their own customers. These companies are referred to as Cluetivity‚Äôs partners. This license also guarantees partners city-wide exclusivity to Cluetivity games they purchase. The platform launched in 2010. Cluetivity released their first geocaching-based game, The Magic Portal, in 2016. As of October 2019, Cluetivity‚Äôs games are available in over 170 locations worldwide. == Gameplay == Cluetivity‚Äôs games can separated into 2 categories - indoor AR games and outdoor AR games. Whilst each game allows for 2-6 players per team, the platform has functionality for 2000 players to play at the same time. Using the iOS app, each player inputs their names into the game and follow the storyline presented on screen. Initially establishing their location using mobile network data, players must explore their local area, aided by GPS, to find clues to solve riddles and tasks each game presents. For every task each team completes, the team receive EXP points which can be used in exchange for hints, which help players out in difficult situations.

Emilio Milutinoviƒá (Serbian: –ï–º–∏–ª–∏–æ –ú–∏–ª—É—Ç–∏–Ω–æ–≤–∏—õ; 1870 ‚Äì after 1919) was a Chetnik voivode in Old Serbia during the struggle for Macedonia. As a subject of Austria-Hungary at the turn of the twentieth century, he was called to serve in the army but later his conscience would not allow him to continue because it went against his patriotic feelings as a Serb. He deserted and fled to Serbia where he entered the Serbian army with the rank of sergeant. From the year 1904, he was a Chetnik in the company of ƒêorƒëe Ristiƒá-Skopljance, Vanƒëel Skopljanƒçe, Rista Staraƒçki, and Vojislav Tankosiƒá. Because he had a military education and Chetnik experience at the end of 1905, he was appointed voivode by the Serbian Chetnik Organization to head their staff headquarters in Skopska Crna Gora. Vasilije Trbiƒá was given the task to take Emilio Milutinoviƒá to his post in Skopska Crna Gora. But they never reached their destination. On 21 January 1906 (Julian Calendar), Vasilije Trbiƒá came close to losing his entire ƒçeta of 22 men when a Turkish force together with Albanians from surrounding areas ambushed them at ƒåelopek (not to be confused with the Fight on ƒåelopek, the previous year, 1905). Emilio Milutinoviƒá, who survived the slaughter with Trbiƒç and a couple of his men, was so grieved that he resigned from further guerrilla action. Later, however, he went on to participate in both Balkan Wars and the Great War as a Chetnik volunteer.–î. –°. –à–µ—Ä–∏–Ω–∏—õ, –í–æ—ò–≤–æ–¥–µ –∏–∑ —á–µ—Ç–Ω–∏—á–∫–µ –∞–∫—Ü–∏—ò–µ —É –°—Ç–∞—Ä–æ—ò –°—Ä–±–∏—ò–∏ –∏ –ú–∞—õ–µ–¥–æ–Ω–∏—ò–∏ 1903-1912, –î–æ–±—Ä–æ–≤–æ—ô–∞—á–∫–∏ –≥–ª–∞—Å–Ω–∏–∫, –±—Ä. 32. –≥–æ–¥–∏–Ω–∞ 17, 2008. ==See also== *List of Chetnik voivodes ==References== ===Footnotes=== ===Sources=== * D.

Drafted into the Imperial Russian Army during World War I, Rakovsky briefly served as a non-commissioned officer without seeing action in 1917 before the dissolution of the army and was conscripted by the White forces in Siberia during the Russian Civil War, deserting to the Red Army. Decorated for his actions as a junior commander, he served at a military school during much of the 1930s and became commander of the 167th Rifle Division as the Red Army expanded before Operation Barbarossa. Rakovsky led the division in a temporarily successful counterattack during the Battle of Smolensk, and managed to lead a small group from his command out of encirclement several weeks later. His division disbanded due to its losses, Rakovsky was given command of the 53rd Separate Rifle Brigade in late 1941, leading it with the 2nd Shock Army in the first days of the January 1942 Lyuban Offensive. Relieved of command in the same month, he headed a military school for the rest of the war. Postwar, he served on the faculty of the Vystrel course before retiring in the late 1950s. ==Early life, World War I, and Russian Civil War== An ethnic Russian, Rakovsky was born on 1 January 1898 in the village of Plavna, Brakhlovskoy volost, Novozybkovsky Uyezd, Chernigov Governorate. During World War I, he was mobilized for service in the Imperial Russian Army on 13 February 1917 and sent to the training detachment of the 28th Siberian Rifle Regiment in Omsk. After graduation with the rank of junior unter-ofitser, Rakovsky served with the regiment for one and a half months. The regiment was disbanded after the October Revolution in November, and following his demobilization Rakovsky went to Barnaulsky Uyezd of Tomsk Governorate, where he worked as a miner. During the Russian Civil War, he was conscripted into the White army of Alexander Kolchak on 13 August 1918 while at Kamen and sent to Novonikolayevsk to serve with the Nikolayevsk Reserve Regiment. After deserting on 28 December, Rakovsky joined the Red Army at the beginning of January 1919, serving with the 1st Separate Glazov Battalion of the 3rd Army of the Eastern Front, with which he fought in the battles against the army of Kolchak. Wounded near Perm in March, he was evacuated to a hospital. Upon his recovery, Rakovsky entered the eight-month command course in Samara. Two weeks later, he was sent with the courses to the Southern Front to fight against the White Armed Forces of South Russia in the area of Millerovo and Voronezh. For their \\"courage in battle\\", the course was awarded the Order of the Red Banner, returning to Samara in early July. After graduating in May 1920, Rakovsky became a platoon commander in the 458th Rifle Regiment of the 51st Rifle Division. With the latter, he was sent to the Southern Front during July to fight against the Army of Wrangel. As a company commander and acting battalion commander, Rakovsky fought on the Kakhovka bridgehead and in the Perekop‚ÄìChongar Offensive, receiving the Order of the Red Banner for his actions in the latter, which defeated the Army of Wrangel in Crimea. After the end of the fighting in Crimea, the regiment fought against Ukrainian People's Army insurgents in Podolian Governorate. == Interwar period == After the end of the Russian Civil War, Rakovsky served with the 51st Rifle Division as an assistant company commander in the 459th Rifle Regiment, and from April 1922 as assistant company commander and company commander in the 153rd Rifle Regiment. He completed a chemical course at Kharkov in 1923 and passed an external examination of the military normal school at the Kiev Infantry School in 1926, studying at the Vystrel course between October 1927 and August 1928. Rakovsky completed a course for mobilization work of the Ukrainian Military District headquarters in 1930, and in October of that year transferred to the Odessa Red Army Commanders' Infantry School in October 1930, where he served as a tactics instructor and as chief of staff and commander of a student battalion. He was appointed assistant commander for drill units of the 138th Rifle Regiment of the 46th Rifle Division of the Kiev Military District in January 1937. From December of that year he commanded the 45th and then the 351st Rifle Regiments of the 15th Rifle Division at Kherson. Now a colonel, Rakovsky was appointed assistant commander of the 95th Rifle Division of the Kiev Special Military District at Kotovsk in February 1939. He became commander of the 20th Reserve Rifle Brigade of the Volga Military District at Saratov in January 1940, later transferring to command the 19th Reserve Rifle Brigade at the same location. He became commander of the 167th Rifle Division, then forming at Balashov, on 16 July of that year, with the rank of Kombrig. Just before the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, the June 1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union, the division became part of the 63rd Rifle Corps. == World War II == After the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, the division and its corps were sent to the front, joining the 21st Army of the Reserve of the High Command (Stavka reserve). From 28 June, Rakovsky led the 167th in defense of positions between Rogachev and Zhlobin. During the Battle of Smolensk the division repulsed German attempts to cross the Dnieper. Launching a counterattack, it advanced to the line of the Drut River and remained there until 12 August, when it was withdrawn to the army reserve. For \\"successful attacks\\" towards Bobruisk Rakovsky was promoted to major general on 31 July. Relocated to the area of Dovsk, the division defended the latter as part of the 67th Rifle Corps, fighting in encirclement from 13 August. Due to its loss of contact with the 67th Rifle Corps, the 167th returned to the control of the 63rd Rifle Corps from 14 August. In the encirclement, Rakovsky decided to destroy heavy weapons and ordered the division to escape in groups. He led a group of 25 others out of the encirclement with their weapons in the sector of the 155th Rifle Division of the Bryansk Front on 18 September; about 2,500 men of the division escaped the encirclement. The units that escaped encirclement were disbanded and their men used to reinforce other units, and Rakovsky was appointed assistant deputy commander of the Bryansk Front by 15 October, then placed at the disposal of the Main Personnel Directorate of the People's Commissariat of Defense. Appointed commander of the 53rd Separate Rifle Brigade of the 26th Army (redesignated as the 2nd Shock Army in late December) in Stavka reserve in November, Rakovsky led the brigade in the Lyuban Offensive Operation from 7 January. Ten days later, he was relieved of command for \\"not fulfilling orders and tolerating heavy losses\\", being again placed at the disposal of the Main Personnel Directorate. Rakovsky never held a combat command again and in February was appointed head of the 2nd Leningrad Infantry School, evacuated to Glazov, where he spent the rest of the war. == Postwar == Postwar, between October 1945 and March 1946, Rakovsky was again placed at the disposal of the Main Personnel Directorate, then sent to become an instructor at the Vystrel course at Solnechnogorsk. There, he served as head of a class, senior tactics instructor, head of the 5th class, and head of a special department for the training of foreign military personnel, before his retirement on 7 January 1957.

He served as a federal deputy from 2015 to 2018 in the LXIII Legislature of the Mexican Congress and as a deputy to the Congress of Mexico City, in addition to having enjoyed a long career in media. ==Early life and career== Caballero was born in Tampico, Tamaulipas, into a family of 11 children, moving to Mexico City at a young age and was a normal school teacher who also studied anthropology. However, he first fell in love with radio at the age of seven, when he participated in a kids' radio program at XEB \\"La B Grande de M√©xico\\". As a professor of communications, he was instrumental in establishing the communications program at the Universidad Aut√≥noma Metropolitana Cuajimalpa campus. In 1977, Caballero began hosting a show on Canal Once and was eventually named the channel's director of news, the first in a series of public media leadership posts that Caballero would hold. In 1981, he was tapped to head Canal 13, at the time state-owned, leaving soon after to help establish and lead state broadcast systems in Sonora (1982‚Äì1984), Quintana Roo (1983‚Äì1988), and Oaxaca (1988‚Äì1992). After a pair of two-year stints in the press offices of the Secretariat of Tourism and National Savings Bonds, Caballero returned to television in 1996, hosting the successful series Realidades for CNI Canal 40. In 1999, he became the first director of the new Canal del Congreso, a tenure that would make him a lightning rod for controversy. The head of the Chamber of Deputies, Beatriz Paredes Rangel, opted to remove Caballero from the post in 2002 after a series of controversial decisions, including covering demonstrations by striking teachers, placing former students of his in high- paying positions, and staging three straight hours of coverage of an EZLN event. Caballero remained active in journalism and communications, founding the Mexican Association for the Right to Information (AMEDI) in 2001 and hosting a program on TV UNAM from 2012 to 2014. In 2014, he was honored by the Universidad de Guadalajara with the Fernando Ben√≠tez Cultural Journalism Award. ===Federal and local legislator=== In 2014, Caballero became a founding member of the new National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) party. The next year, he was elected from Mexico City's third electoral district, in Azcapotzalco, to the Chamber of Deputies for the LXIII Legislature of the Mexican Congress. During his three years in San L√°zaro, Caballero was a secretary on the Radio and Television Commission and also sat on the special commission set up to investigate the 2016 conflict in Nochixtl√°n, Oaxaca. While a legislator, Caballero's apartment was destroyed by the 2017 Mexico City earthquake. After his three years in the federal legislature, Caballero successfully ran to represent a portion of Azcapotzalco in the Mexico City legislature, becoming the spokesman for the MORENA caucus in the legislature.

The company has two food brands in its portfolio ‚ÄòBagrry's‚Äô and ‚ÄòLawrence Mills‚Äô. Bagrry's is the second biggest Indian brand of breakfast cereals in India after Kellogg's. Bagrry's product includes breakfast cereals such as muesli, oats, corn flakes plus, choco+ and a range of healthy foods such as bran, organic quinoa, chia seed, apple cider vinegar, peanut butter, and makhana. The Bagrry's group with interests in grain milling, FMCG & QSR has a lineage of over 50 years in food processing and is one of India's leading suppliers of cereal-based products such as cereal flours, wheat flours, oats, wheat bran, and other cereal products to leading food brands such as Nestle, KFC, Yum Brands, Mondelez, ITC, and Britannia. Bagrry's is one of the biggest suppliers of oats, wheat bran, and other cereal products to brands, including Nestle (Maggi noodles), ITC, KFC, and Britannia. ==History== The founder of Bagrry's, Shyam Bagri joined his family business of flour milling at an age of 21 years and set up a flour mill unit in Delhi in 1979 with only the scraps and spares form the group's other flour mills. He expanded this unit and scaled it up an institutional business adding leading customer names such as Britannia, Parle Agro, Modern Foods and Nestle. The motivation behind Bagrry's originated from none other than, Father of Nation Mahatma Gandhi. Shyam Bagri, in his early days, went over a passage from Mahatma Gandhi's book 'India of My Dreams' that illustrated the nutritive value of 'choker' or wheat bran (a by-product of flour milling) especially fiber, which is lost in processed foods. From there on, he set out on his journey to create his own brand of high fiber health foods, Bagrry's. In the early 1990s, he started manufacturing and distributing wheat bran as a high fiber health food under the brand name Wheatex. In 1993, Bagri launched another healthy product, oats- under the label Oatex. In 1994, he went on to manufacture a Swiss breakfast cereal called muesli - oats, wheat flakes and corn flakes blended with dried fruit and nuts. This is when he created ‚ÄòBagrry's‚Äô - an umbrella brand for all his health food products. In 2000, US President Bill Clinton was served Bagrry's muesli when he visited India and it added support in making the muesli brand popular. In 2004, Bagrry's had launched its own brand of cornflakes but withdrew it soon after, when Bagri realized cornflakes were not healthy. In September 2011, Bagrry's re-entered the cornflakes market with bran-added corn flakes. However, it found success in the corn flakes category after it launched Corn Flakes Plus, a fiber fortified corn flakes in 2016. In 2016, the company ventured into food retailing with QSR (quick service restaurants) called Bagrry's On The Go. The stores serve healthy foods and beverages such as sandwiches, bagels, burgers, cookies, cakes, brownies, crackers and muffins made without butter and using Bagrry's ingredients such as oats, muesli, wheat bran, and quinoa. In 2018, Bagrry's also ventured into the impulse healthy snacking category with flavored foxnuts - Makhanas.The company has been studying in the fox nut (makhana) for several years for its nutritive benefits and later started selling them from the QSR vertical - Bagrry's Health Cafe. Bagri always had an emphasis on quality sourcing and imported ingredients such as raw oats from England, and almonds and natural soya-based antioxidants for his muesli from the United States.

Slovenia's laws guarantee the freedom of religion and establish a separation between church and state, as well as prohibiting religious discrimination and religious hatred. Religious groups may easily register with the government in order to receive some privileges, largely consisting of various forms of monetary compensation. Slovenia's laws prohibit circumcision for nonmedical reasons and animal slaughtering practices that are necessary for meat to be considered kosher or halal. Members of the Jewish and Muslim communities observe these practices outside of the country (importing meat, and traveling to neighboring countries for religious circumcision) without obstruction from Slovenia's government. During the medieval and early modern periods, modern Slovenia was part of the Holy Roman and later Austro-Hungarian empires, and thus had a strict state religion of Catholicism. Religious laws were slowly liberalized starting in the late 18th century, although a formal separation of church and state was not implemented until the establishment of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1946. The Yugoslavian government promoted atheism and expropriated the Catholic Church, but otherwise engaged in minimal religious repression in Slovenia. Following the collapse of Yugoslavia and the establishment of an independent Slovenia, Slovenia continues to use religious freedom laws lightly adapted from previous Yugoslavian legislation. == Demographics == According to the 2002 census, as of 2017 the most recent available, 57.8 percent of the population is Roman Catholic, 2.4 percent Muslim, 2.3 percent Serbian Orthodox, 0.9 percent ‚Äúother Christian,‚Äù and 10.1 percent atheist. In addition, 23 percent identified as ‚Äúother‚Äù or did not declare a religion, 3.5 percent declared themselves ‚Äúunaffiliated,‚Äù and 10.1 percent selected no religion. The Jewish community estimates its size at approximately 300 individuals (less than 1 percent of the total population). The Orthodox and Muslim communities include a large number of immigrants from Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, respectively.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Slovenia, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. ==History== Prior to the 20th century, the territories corresponding to modern Slovenia were part of the Holy Roman Empire and later Austria-Hungary. As such, their state religion was Roman Catholicism for this period.A ƒårniƒç, M Komel, M Smrke, K ≈†abec, T Vovk - Religious Pluralisation in Slovenia, Teorija in praksa, 2013 In the late 15th and early 16th centuries, Jews were expelled from many Slovene territories. Jews were invited back into Inner Austria in 1709. Beginning in the late 18th century, Austria-Hungary adopted reforms that granted some religious freedom, first to Orthodox and Protestant Christians, and later to Jews as well. The 19th century saw a slow liberalization of religious laws, with Christian minority denominations inching towards equal footing with the Catholic Church, although Catholicism remained the state religion. This state of affairs was preserved in Slovenia upon its accession to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, although Jews, Muslims, and minority Christian denominations gained recognition from the state following this transition. Atheists, however, were considered second class citizens, and the Catholic Church played a significant role in circumscribing intellectual life in Slovenia. During World War II, Slovenia was occupied by various Axis powers and almost the entirety of its Jewish population was killed or fled. For much of the second half of the 20th century, Slovenia was part of Yugoslavia, which established a secular state, and did not engage in anti- religious campaigns to the extent of other countries in the Eastern Bloc. Even as compared to other republics within Yugoslavia, Slovenians enjoyed relative religious freedom. The Roman Catholic Church had much of its property confiscated and many priests were persecuted by the Yugoslavian government, although this was largely due to the Church's collaboration with Axis forces during World War II. Nevertheless, religious instruction was removed from school curricula in 1952, and atheism was promoted. Beginning in the 1960s, Yugoslavia's attitudes toward religion thawed further, although religious belief was considered incompatible with membership in the League of Communists of Yugoslavia until the 1980s. According to surveys conducted in the 1990s, only 11% of Slovenes felt that they had been discriminated against due to their religiosity at any point in their lives; 18% reported that they knew friends or family that had been subject to such discrimination. Unlike the other regions of Yugoslavia, Slovenia was much more ethnically and religiously homogeneous, and consequently avoided being affected by sectarian civil war following the dissolution of Yugoslavia. == Legal framework == The constitution guarantees the freedom of religion and the right of individuals to express their beliefs in public and private. It declares that all religious communities shall have equal rights and provides for the separation of religion and state. The constitution also prohibits the incitement of religious discrimination and inflammation of religious hatred and intolerance. The constitution recognizes the right of conscientious objection to military service for religious reasons. === Anti-discrimination laws === The penal code's definition of hate crimes includes publicly provoking religious hatred and diminishing the significance of the Holocaust. Punishment for these offenses is imprisonment of up to two years, or, if the crime involves coercion or endangerment of security ‚Äì defined as a serious threat to life and limb, desecration, or damage to property ‚Äì imprisonment for up to five years. If an official abusing the power of his or her position commits these offenses, he or she may be subject to imprisonment of up to five years. Members of groups that engage in these activities in an organized and premeditated fashion ‚Äì hate groups, according to the law ‚Äì may also receive a punishment of up to five years in prison. === Government rulings limiting religious practices === The law requires that animals be stunned prior to slaughter, which effectively bans halal or kosher butchers from operating in Slovenia. As of 2017, this law has been under review since 2014 following complaints from Muslim and Jewish organizations. The Ombudsman for the Protection of Human Rights has issued an opinion that, based on the constitution and the law, ‚Äúcircumcision for nonmedical reasons is not permissible and constitutes unlawful interference with the child‚Äôs body, thereby violating his rights.‚Äù The ombudsman has stated that additional legislation is necessary to legalize and regulate circumcision for religious reasons, with the actual status of circumcision remaining unclear. The procedure is consequently inconsistently available at hospitals. Some members of the Muslim and Jewish communities have chosen to undergo the procedure in the neighboring country of Austria, and have not faced any legal restrictions on doing so. === Religious group registration === The law requires churches and other religious communities to register with the government to obtain status as legal entities, but it does not restrict the religious activities of unregistered religious groups. The rights of registered religious groups as recognized legal entities include eligibility for rebates on value-added taxes, government cofinancing of social security for clergy, and authorization to request social benefits for their religious workers. To register legally with the government, a religious group must submit an application to the Ministry of Culture providing proof that it has at least 10 adult members who are citizens or permanent residents; the name of the group in Latin letters, which must be clearly distinguishable from the names of other religious groups; the group's address in the country; and a copy of its official seal to be used in legal transactions. It must also pay an administrative tax of 22.60 euros ($27). The group must also provide the names of the group's representatives in the country, a description of the foundations of the group's religious beliefs, and a copy of its organizational act. If a group wishes to apply for government cosponsorship of social security for clergy members, it must show it has at least 1,000 members for every clergy member. It has been noted that these requirements for registration are even stricter than the ones enacted by the Socialist government in the 1970s. If these registration requirements were to be applied to religious organizations already recognized by the government at the time of the new law's passing in 2007, more than half of the existing religious organizations in Slovenia would not meet the criteria. The government may only refuse the registration of a religious group if the group does not provide the required application materials in full or if the Ministry of Culture determines the group is a hate group ‚Äì an organization engaging in hate crimes as defined by the penal code. By law the Ministry of Culture's Office for Religious Communities monitors and maintains records on registered religious communities and provides legal expertise and assistance to religious organizations. The Ministry of Culture establishes and manages the procedures for registration, issues documents related to the legal status of registered communities, distributes funds allocated in the government's budget for religious activities, organizes discussions and gatherings of religious communities to address religious freedom concerns, and provides information to religious groups about the legal provisions and regulations related to their activities. == Attitudes toward religious minorities == The Muslim minority in Slovenia experiences prejudice and some discrimination from broader Slovenian society, although they are still largely tolerated and are viewed as sharing a South Slavic heritage and identity with the Christian majority. The government of Slovenia has been described as \\"disinterested\\" in issues faced by religious minorities, and has been slow to act to resolve such issues, such as taking decades to approve the construction of a mosque in Ljubljana. According to a 2019 study by the European Commission, 33 percent of Slovenians believe religious discrimination to be widespread, compared with 62 percent who believe that it is rare. 81 percent of the population said that they would be comfortable with a head of state that did not belong to the country's majority religion. As of 2019, there have been instances of anti-Muslim speech both on social media and in conventional media platforms. Muslim community leaders, NGOs, and government officials reported in 2019 that anti-Muslim sentiment appeared to be declining since the prior year, with rhetoric adopting an increasingly anti-migrant tone instead of an explicitly anti-Muslim tone. Jewish community leaders in 2019 were divided as to whether Slovenia was generally a safe place for Jews. == Education == The government requires all public schools to include education on world religions in their curricula, with instruction provided by school teachers. The government allows churches and religious groups to provide religious education in their faiths in both private and public schools and preschools, on a voluntary basis outside of school hours, but the inclusion of denominational instruction or religious rites practiced with the intent of instructing children to practice the religion is forbidden in schools.Blaz, Ivanc.

During World War I, Blond served in the Austrian Army. He was captured and imprisoned by Russians in Siberia but escaped through Persia and Turkey, back to Vienna.Baskett, Thomas F. (2019). Eponyms and Names in Obstetrics and Gynaecology. Cambridge University Press. p. 44 He was educated at the University of Vienna, where he graduated M.D. in 1917.A. W. B. (1964). K. Blond, M.D., F.I.C.S. The British Medical Journal 2 (5417): 1143. He worked as a surgeon at the Vienna General Hospital. During World War II, Blond fled Austria and worked at hospitals in Britain. In 1940, he qualified L.R.C.P and L.R.F.P.S. He worked as a senior surgeon at Whipps Cross University Hospital until 1943. He conducted experiments on the pathology of the liver, which were published in 1928 and 1930. In 1950, he co-authored the book The Liver: Porta Malorum, which proposed the hypothesis that many diseases and disorders such as allergies, cholecystitis, nephritis, jaundice, piles are caused by a malfunctioning liver.Tyler, David B. (1953). Reviewed Work: The Liver. Porta Malorum (The Gateway to Disease) by Kasper Blond, David Haler. The Quarterly Review of Biology 28 (3): 323. Their hypothesis was described as too dogmatic by critics. A review in the California Medicine journal noted that \\"as soon as they present their principal hypothesis, they speak like religious fanatics with a body of dogma to be taken on faith without support of scientific fact.\\"Anonymous. (1951). The Liver, Porta Malorum (The Gateway to Disease). California Medicine 74 (5): 411. In 1923, Blond and Hans Heidler (1889-1955) invented the Blond-Heidler saw, an obstetric tool used to remove a dead fetus. The saw has been used in cases of fetal decapitation without maternal trauma. Blond died in London. ==Cancer theory== Blond developed a theory of cancer which he wrote about in his book The Liver and Cancer, first published in 1954 with a second edition in 1960. Blond argued that the basis of all malignant disease is a mutation of somatic tissues caused by chronic liver damage. He believed that 98% of all cancers in adults are of alimentary origin.J. H. O, Earle. (1955). Reviewed Work: The Liver And Cancer: A New Cancer Theory by Kasper Blond. The British Medical Journal 2 (4955): 1543. His hypothesis was that cancer is a nutritional disease and is caused by liver damage.Ward, Grant E. (1956). Reviewed Work: The Liver and Cancer. A New Cancer Theory by Kaspar Blond. The Quarterly Review of Biology 31 (4): 336-337. Blond believed that cancer treatment requires the healing of liver damage. He argued that if the liver detoxifies correctly then cancer cannot develop because it thrives only on toxic products of digestion.Peller, Sigismund. (1955). Book Review: The Liver and Cancer. Science 122 (3178): 1023. His suggestions of treatment opposed any radiation therapy or surgery.Anonymous. (1960). The Liver and Cancer.

The Liver and Cancer by Kasper Blond. The Indian Journal of Medical Research 50 (4-6): 666. He cited cases of cancer patients being successfully treated with vegetable juices, yoghurt, raw vegetables and fruit. Pathologist J. H. O. Earle in The British Medical Journal noted that: Physician Louis Lasagna negatively reviewed the book, stating that it promoted his theory that cancer is due to a sick liver but that was about all and it was \\"rather a disjointed and unconvincing bit of hobbyhorse riding\\".Lasagna, Louis. (1961). The liver and cancer: A new cancer theory. Journal of Chronic Diseases 13 (4): 377. Physician Grant E.

Mary is sent away to her uncle, Lord Archibald Craven's Misselthwaite Manor in Yorkshire, England. She is an unpleasant and unkind young girl who has had to repress her own emotions whilst growing up in the Raj. Upon arriving in England she meets Mrs Medlock, a strict and firm lady who is Lord Craven's servant and housekeeper. Mary is instructed to not explore the house and is confined to her room at night. There, she meets Martha, a servant who is unsettled by her demands. Mary is allowed to leave the house to explore the estate and woods nearby and stumbles upon a stray dog whom she names Jemima. Later that night, she hears tiny screams and wailings throughout the corridors only to find Lord Craven's bedridden son, Colin Craven. The next day, Lord Craven sees Mary in his study and confides in her to not cause any trouble. Mary continues her escapade of heading to the forest in which she finds a hidden garden by climbing a wall. Later, on the way home, she calls out to Martha's brother Dickon who fades within the mist of the moors. Later she finds Jemima's leg caught in a trap. She helps Jemima by freeing her from the trap but the dog runs away into the garden. Subsequently Mary continues to explore the garden Mary is then guided by a Robin to a stone statue within the garden which has a key to the garden within it. She leaves the garden as Mrs. Medlock calls out for her. Back at the estate, Mary meets with Colin again as he talks about having a hunchback and is not able to walk. She reveals to him the garden on their estate but Colin is uninterested. She later snoops around, finding a room with pictures of both Mary's mother and Grace Craven. She grabs a souvenir, a pearl necklace. The next day, Mary heads back into the garden to find Dickon who offers to help heal Jemima. Mary then brings Colin on his wheelchair for the first time to the same room with his mother's pictures and dresses. Both Mary and Dickon hatch a plan to bring Colin to the garden in hopes of healing his immobility, But upon returning, Mrs Medlock confronts Mary for stealing the pearl necklace and she is reprimanded by being sent to a boarding school.

From 1997-1999, he served as Associate and Deputy Independent Counsel under Kenneth W. Starr during the Whitewater Investigation & Clinton-Lewinsky Investigations. Wisenberg is a frequent commentator on legal issues related to the ongoing investigation of Donald Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. He makes frequent appearances on NBC, Fox News, CBS, ABC, MSNBC CNN, PBS and NPR. ==Early career== Wisenberg studied at the University of Texas Law School and clerked with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. He then served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in North Carolina and Texas from 1987 to 1997. In 1993, as Chief of the Financial Institution Fraud Unit in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Texas, Wisenberg first chaired the Victoria Savings Association investigation and trial that resulted in the conviction of eleven individuals for defrauding the Victoria Savings Association of $200 million. Victoria Savings Association had been previously identified by Congress as one of the Top 100 Savings and Loan failures in the United States. A history of prosecuting complex financial crimes made Wisenberg a top candidate to assist Independent Counsel Starr in the investigation of the Clinton's financial involvement with the Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association, and he was recruited by Starr's Office. ==Clinton Investigation== Wisenberg joined the Starr team in 1997 as Associate Independent Counsel to work on aspects of the Madison Guaranty Savings Investigation and in 1998 was promoted to Deputy Independent Counsel,. Wisenberg was one of four Deputy Independent Counsels who took part in the federal grand jury questioning of President Bill Clinton. In January 1998, at the request of Starr and U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, the scope of Starr's investigation was broadened to include possible obstruction of justice in Clinton v. Jones, a sexual harassment suit brought against Clinton by Paula Jones. The expanded investigation came after Starr's office received an allegation that former White House intern Monica Lewinsky signed a false affidavit in Clinton v. Jones and was offered a job in Manhattan in return for her false affidavit. Wisenberg led the grand jury phase of the Lewinsky Investigation and questioned Clinton during his videotaped grand jury testimony that took place on August 17, 1998. Wisenberg elicited Clinton's most infamous answer during federal grand jury questioning in the Lewinsky Investigation. Wisenberg asked Clinton: \\"[T]he statement that there was ‚Äòno sex of any kind in any manner, shape or form, [between Lewinsky and] President Clinton,‚Äô was an utterly false statement. Is that correct?\\" Clinton responded: \\"It depends on what the meaning of the word ‚Äòis‚Äô is.\\" By mid-1998, Wisenberg and the rest of the Starr team were facing accusations of partisanship for pursuing the Lewinsky sex scandal as part of an investigation that had primarily begun as an inquiry into financial improprieties and potential corruption. But Wisenberg has stated that from the perspective of the Office of Independent Counsel, the attempt to cover up the Lewinsky affair in Clinton v. Jones and provide her a job in return for her silence was similar enough to other areas of investigation that it bore serious inquiry by Starr or another prosecutor. The Starr Report was released on September 11, 1998 and the House of Representatives subsequently voted to impeach. Clinton was acquitted in the Senate and Wisenberg entered private practice in 1999. During his time on the Starr team he worked alongside Brett Kavanaugh, now a United States Supreme Court Justice, Rod Rosenstein, Deputy Attorney General under President Trump, and Alex Azar, who was appointed Secretary of Health and Human Services in January 2018. ==Mueller Investigation== Since the launch of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election by Special Counsel Robert Mueller in May 2017, Wisenberg has made numerous media appearances on NBC, Fox News, MSNBC, CBS, CNN, NPR, PBS, and in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and other national publications. In the absence of released or leaked information from the Mueller team, members of the media have drawn on Wisenberg's experience investigating and questioning Bill Clinton to provide insight into the procedures involved and the potential strategies the Mueller team may have been following. On September 19, 2017, Wisenberg's analysis of Mueller's pre-dawn raid on Paul Manafort's home appeared in the New York Times. He stressed that Mueller was sending a message, saying: \\"They are setting a tone. It‚Äôs important early on to strike terror in the hearts of people in Washington, or else you will be rolled.\\" In May 2018, Wisenberg criticized Trump lawyer and former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani for making statements highlighting the political value of hush money payments made to Stormy Daniels with Trump's personal funds. Wisenberg likened Giuliani's statements to a murder-suicide. Following the appearance of former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen before the House Oversight Committee on February 27, 2019, Wisenberg concluded that Cohen's testimony provided no new information about potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence agencies or crimes around payments to Stormy Daniels. He did conclude that Cohen's testimony may have increased Trump's legal exposure by indicating that he has provided purposely inaccurate financial information to lending institutions and the Internal Revenue Service. Wisenberg is the primary author of White Collar Crime: Securities Fraud (Thomson Reuters Third Edition 2016). ==References== == External links == * Category:American lawyers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people ","title":"Solomon L.

It is an unfriendly portrait of Corbyn. ==Reception== Peter Oborne of Middle East Eye writes the \\"new book on Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, contains numerous falsehoods. It systematically omits relevant facts\\" and that \\"Again and again he [the author] withholds relevant information\\". Stephen Bush of The Guardian criticised the book as a \\"hatchet job, it is a dismal failure\\" and said it committed \\"rudimentary errors\\". A Labour Party spokesman stated it was ‚Äúpoorly researched and tawdry hatchet job . . . packed with obvious falsehoods and laughable claims.‚Äù The Times called it \\"a bit of a bore\\". The Canary called it an \\"utter sham\\". Matthew Norman of The Independent states, \\"The only ‚Äòdirt‚Äô investigative journalist Tom Bower managed to dig up was the Labour leader‚Äôs domestic amnesia and proneness to debt through helping those in need\\" and that the book \\"appears to contain a fatal paradox: on the one hand, as hinted by the subtitle Corbyn‚Äôs Ruthless Plot for Power, [Corbyn] has plotted ruthlessly for power; on the other, the author reports that Corbyn was on the brink of retiring to Wiltshire to keep bees\\". VICE News stated that the book is \\"garbage\\" and full of factual errors. According to journalist Gaby Hinsliff, who describes the book as flawed, there is little that is new in the book because \\"We all know by now about the meetings with Holocaust deniers and perpetrators of blood libel, the somersaults turned to avoid blaming the Kremlin for the Salisbury poisonings, the long history of antipathy to the EU.\\" The most \\"telling criticism,\\" in Hinsliff's view, is that \\"Corbyn is simply not very bright... His backbench career was long on expressing passionate solidarity with causes but short on concrete achievements, and he comes across as prone to ducking arguments that he lacks the skill to win.\\" She argues that the book's greatest flaw is Bower's eagerness to condemn its subject, but concludes that Dangerous Hero, \\"is the most compelling in-depth study so far of a man whose head is unusually difficult to get inside, given his suspicion of anyone who isn‚Äôt a fellow traveller.\\" Ex Labour MP Tom Harris writes that the book is a \\"meticulous and highly readable account\\", that \\"stands as an indictment of both the Labour Party and a political system that allows an individual such as Jeremy Corbyn to come within shouting distance of the levers of power in the UK\\". A reviewer for The Times wrote that according to the book, the October 1968 Rodney riots in Kingston, Jamaica convinced Corbyn to become a Trotskyist with the goal of turning Britain into a communist state. ==Libel case== In June 2020, it was announced that Associated Newspapers, the publishers of The Mail on Sunday and MailOnline, paid substantial damages and costs over a ‚Äúgrotesque‚Äù libel made against a non- profit Palestinian refugee group in its serialisation of the book. Lawyers for the plaintiff, the Palestinian Return Centre, said: ‚ÄúNeither Mr Bower, the Mail nor Harper Collins (the publisher of the book) saw fit to properly verify the true position, nor to put the allegation to the PRC prior to publication.‚Äù The news outlets have also published a correction and apology. Harper Collins and Bower had already withdrawn the allegation, explaining that the author had relied on a contemporaneous newspaper report of the incident that had not been amended or corrected. ==References== Category:2019 non-fiction books Category:Biographies about politicians Category:Books by Tom Bower Category:Jeremy Corbyn Category:William Collins, Sons books ","title":"Dangerous Hero (Corbyn biography)"},{"id":"60328431","text":"The 1993‚Äì94 Idaho Vandals men's basketball team represented the University of Idaho during the 1993‚Äì94 NCAA Division I men's basketball season.

The Ka-27PS helicopters were delivering various cargoes onto the ship and back to shore. Academic Pashin successfully completed the trials in late June 2019, and was commissioned on 21 January 2020. In April 2020, Academic Pashin is spotted in the Channel off Cherbourg during the Suffren first sea trial. ==References== Category:Auxiliary replenishment ship classes Category:Auxiliary ships of the Russian Navy Category:Oilers Category:2016 ships ","title":"Russian replenishment oiler Academic Pashin"},{"id":"60328532","text":"Apple TV+ is an ad-free subscription video on demand web television service of Apple Inc. that debuted on November 1, 2019. It was announced during their March 2019 Apple Special Event held at Steve Jobs Theater, where celebrities involved with Apple TV+ projects appeared on-stage for the announcement, including Jennifer Aniston, Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg and Jason Momoa. Apple TV+ content is viewable through Apple's website and through Apple's TV app, which in 2019 expanded its availability to numerous consumer electronics devices, including those of Apple's competitors, with further plans to expand availability to more devices over time. However, Apple has created no native app for the Windows and Android platforms, or an official method to stream the content on television-connected Android TV and Chromecast devices, leaving users of those devices to workarounds for viewing Apple TV+. At debut, Apple TV+ was accessible in about 100 countries, fewer than the early reported target of a global launch in 150 countries, and not including a number of the highest population countries in the world, within some of which Apple sells other content generally. However, commentators note that the fairly wide initial reach of the service will offer it an advantage over other streaming services debuting at approximately the same time in a more limited number of countries, such as Disney+, and that because Apple distributes its own content through the service instead of the third-party licensed content used by more established streaming services like Hulu, it will not be hamstrung by international content licensing issues during global expansion. By early 2020, Apple TV+ showed poor growth and subscriber numbers relative to competing services, and in mid-2020 Apple began efforts to license older television and movie content from other content holders for the service, attempting to stay competitive with other streaming services, keep a viewership base for its original content in production for the future, and convert trial users into paid users. Apple TV+ access is included as part of Apple's new Apple One subscription bundle, in an effort to increase viewership. Apple TV+, along with the simultaneously announced Apple TV Channels a la carte premium video subscription aggregation service, is part of the company's concerted effort to expand its service revenues by making recurring monthly charge distributed video content available widely to the public. ==History== ===Origins=== Apple had long been rumored to have an interest in beginning a streaming television service, and in 2015 entered into negotiations with various television studios and programmers to aggregate their content for a live-television streaming bundle. Negotiations fell apart over differing views on how to value the content, lack of transparency on details, and the personality of Apple's chief negotiator, Eddy Cue. In October 2016, Apple CEO Tim Cook was reported as saying that television is \\"of intense interest to me and other people here.\\" He added that Apple has \\"started focusing on some original content\\" which he called \\"a great opportunity for us both from a creation point of view and an ownership point of view. So it's an area we're focused on.\\" === Staffing === In June 2017, Apple began to take the first major steps in forming its new television unit by hiring the co-presidents of Sony Pictures Television, Jamie Elricht and Zack van Amburg, to oversee all aspects of worldwide video programming. Staff acquisition and financial investments rapidly followed as many additional people were brought on board. ===Celebrity content partnerships and programming decisions=== In October 2017, following reports of sexual abuse allegations against producer Harvey Weinstein, Apple announced that they were severing ties with The Weinstein Company and cancelling a planned biopic series about Elvis Presley. In April 2018, Apple signed Kerry Ehrin to a multi-year deal to produce original content. Ehrin and Apple renewed the multi-year deal in May 2020. In June 2018, Apple signed the Writer's Guild of America's minimum basic agreement and Oprah Winfrey to a multi-year content partnership. That same month, Apple announced that they given a multi-series order to Sesame Workshop to produce various Live action and animated series as well as a single puppet-based series. In September 2018, it was reported that Apple had decided to shelve Vital Signs, a six- episode biopic television series centering on the life of hip-hop producer and performer Dr. Dre and starring Ian McShane, Sam Rockwell, and Michael K. Williams, due to concerns about the show's content being too graphic with moments cited including characters using cocaine, instances of gun violence, and an explicit orgy scene. Reports further indicated that Apple CEO Tim Cook was taking a hands-on approach in regards to the company's Worldwide Video Unit with programming decisions reportedly being aligned to Cook's personal tastes, with a preference for family-friendly shows. Various programs in different stages of production have apparently had their content altered including the toning down of the Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston morning show drama series and the removal of crucifixes from a scene in the M. Night Shyamalan drama series. Additionally, Apple reportedly passed on a television series from comedian Whitney Cummings about the #MeToo movement because it was \\"too sensitive a topic.\\" The Cummings series was ultimately put into development by Amazon Video in October 2018. In November 2018, Apple entered into a multi-year agreement with entertainment company A24 to produce a slate of original films in partnership with their Worldwide Video Unit. That same month, Apple signed a deal with DHX Media, and its subsidiary Peanuts Worldwide, to develop and produce original programs, including new series, specials and shorts based on the Peanuts characters created by Charles M. Schulz. One of the first productions created through the deal was an original short-form, STEM-related series featuring astronaut Snoopy. Also that month, Apple signed Justin Lin, and his production company Perfect Storm Entertainment, to a multi-year overall deal to produce original television content. In January 2019, Apple signed Jason Katims, and his production company True Jack Productions, to a multi-year overall production and development deal to produce original television content. That same month, Apple signed a first look deal with Imagine Documentaries to develop non- fiction features and series. In February 2019, Harpo Productions hired Terry Wood as executive Vice President in which Wood will oversee Harpo's production of original programming for Apple as part of the multi-year agreement between Oprah Winfrey and Apple. In March 2019, it was reported that five television series commissioned by Apple had finished filming and six series would finish filming in the next few months. On April 10, 2019, Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, announced on Instagram that he was working alongside Winfrey on the mental health documentary series as a co-creator and executive producer. In October 2019, Apple signed Monica Beletsky to multi-year deal. In January 2020, Apple signed a five-year production deal with Richard Plepler, the former CEO and chairman of HBO. Under the production deal, Plepler's production company Eden Productions will create television series, documentaries and feature films exclusively for Apple TV+. Also in January 2020, Apple signed a multi-year deal with Lee Eisenberg, ahead of the premiere of his series Little America, as well as another multi-year deal with Julia Louis-Dreyfus. Louis-Dreyfus is set to develop new projects as both executive producer and star. In May 2020, Apple signed a two-year production deal with Annie Weisman, the creator of Almost Family. As part of her deal with Apple, Weisman will create television projects exclusively for Apple TV+. In July 2020, Apple signed a multi-year deal with The Maurice Sendak Foundation, to produce new children's television series and specials based on the books and illustrations of Maurice Sendak. In August 2020, Apple signed a multi-year first look deal with Leonardo DiCaprio's film and television production company, Appian Way Productions. Also in August 2020, Apple signed a multi- year first look deal with Martin Scorsese's film and television production company, Sikelia Productions. ==== Acquisition of old movie and TV content ==== In mid-2020, Apple began discussions with movie and television studios to license older content as part of an effort to build a back catalog of non- original movies and television shows for the streaming service. The shift was designed to help the service better compete against the large content libraries offered by competitors like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+. This represented a pivot for Apple, which had initially attempted to build the service entirely on original content, avoiding licensing fees to help keep monthly subscription fees low, and relying on its Apple TV Channels content partners to supply other content users wanted. Analysts believed that the addition of older, highly re-watchable content like popular sitcoms and well liked movies would help to retain the slowly growing subscriber base, while Apple continues to develop original content. The shift was also an acknowledgement of poor growth, especially relative to competing services. The back catalog development was also seen as a move by Apple to attempt to persuade free trial users to transition into paid users as the first wave of one-year trials expired in November 2020. On May 26, 2020 Apple announced their first acquisition of catalogue content would be the Fraggle Rock series. In addition to being the exclusive home of the 1983-1987 Jim Henson Company series, Apple will develop a new full length, rebooted Fraggle Rock series after the success of the Fraggle Rock: Rock On short-form series on Apple TV+. On October 19, 2020, Apple announced the exclusive transmission rights of the various animated productions of the Peanuts franchise, withdrawing them from television after 55 years; as part of that agreement, Apple TV+ must make the major Peanuts specials available for free in short windows. === Technical details reporting === In May 2018, it was reported that Apple was expected to start a sister project to its original content service, and begin selling subscriptions to certain video services directly via its TV application on iOS and tvOS, rather than asking Apple device owners to subscribe to those services through applications individually downloaded from Apple's application store. In October 2018, it was reported that Apple would be distributing their future original content through a still-in-development digital video service to be located within their TV application that is pre-installed in all iOS and tvOS devices. The service was expected to feature both original content, free to owners of Apple devices, as well as subscription \\"channels\\" from legacy media companies such as HBO and Starz, which would allow customers to sign up for online-only services. Later that month, it was further reported that Apple intended to roll out the service in the United States during the first half of 2019 and that it would expand its availability to around 100 countries in the months following its initial launch. === Announcement details === On March 25, 2019, Apple held a press event to announce Apple TV+. At the event, Apple showed a teaser of its upcoming original content and formally announced some of its content with actors and producers attached to the content attending the event. Furthermore, Helpsters, the first series from Sesame Workshop (which also produces Sesame Street), was announced, and Oprah Winfrey announced her first projects for Apple TV+ including a documentary‚Äîunder the working title Toxic Labor‚Äîabout workplace sexual harassment, a documentary series about mental health as well as a revival of Oprah's Book Club as a standalone television series. On September 10, 2019, Apple announced at their yearly keynote that Apple TV+ would launch on November 1, 2019, at $4.99 per month (with a 1-week free trial) for an account that can be shared with up to six family members. Apple also announced that they would be giving away a year of Apple TV+ for free to anyone who bought a new Apple TV, Mac, iPad, iPhone, or iPod Touch beginning that same day. Student subscribers to the monthly Apple Music service at a discounted rate also have Apple TV+ bundled in at no additional cost for the time being. On August 17, 2020, Apple announced that current Apple TV+ subscribers in the United States are eligible for a bundle including CBS All Access and SHOWTIME US$9.99 per month after a seven-day free trial. === Growth and impact === On October 17, 2019, Irish telecommunications company eir confirmed it would be the first non-Apple related company to use the Apple TV 4K set-top boxes as its main source of supplying digital television content along with Apple content. By February 2020, about 10 million people had signed up for Apple TV+. This included users who received a free one-year trial with the purchase of an Apple device, although it was estimated that less than 10% of Apple device owners eligible for the trial had activated it, perhaps out of Apple's failure to promote the service, Apple's desire to slow the uptake rate due to accounting concerns, or because of users' lack of interest in the service's perceived poor content options. About half of those 10 million users actively used the service. ==Programming== During the announcement of Apple TV+, Apple announced a number of prominent names of writers, directors, and stars that will be featured in the service. , five of the upcoming series had already completed production, with six more already well into filming. On September 10, 2019, Apple announced that Apple TV+ would have eight original series (seven scripted and one non-scripted) and one original documentary available at launch, with plans to launch new original content every month thereafter. Most series are expected to launch with three episodes, with a new episode being released weekly thereafter, although Apple has stated that not all series will follow this model and that some series might instead launch all at once. Early critical reaction to the bulk of the service's programming was mixed to poor, but with commentators predicting that Apple would have time to grow into its new role as a content provider and to produce well-regarded content, especially as the free year of the service provided with many Apple product purchases would entice users to continue watching, and for some to eventually pay for a subscription, as new series are released. On March 13, 2020, Apple suspended all active filming on Apple TV+ shows due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and all production on series have been postponed indefinitely. Apple's decision in mid-2020 to license large swaths of existing older content for the Apple TV+ service was viewed as part of an effort to buy time for its original content production, by keeping users engaged and in a habit of visiting the service regularly, so that a viewer base would be in place by the time new sets of Apple original content are released. In addition, the service endeavored to gain high-profile content, taking advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic disrupting theatrical film distribution. Among such acquisitions include the 2020 feature film, Greyhound starring Tom Hanks, which they purchased from Sony for $70 million. In July 2020, the service won a heated bidding war for Emancipation, a slavery-based action-thriller starring Will Smith and directed by Antoine Fuqua. Apple paid a record $105 million for the rights, which will possibly exceed $120 million after all backend deals are completed. ==References== ==External links== * ‚Äì official site Category:Apple Inc. services Category:Internet properties established in 2019 Category:Internet television streaming services Category:Subscription video on demand services ","title":"Apple TV+"},{"id":"60328542","text":"Antonio Marcucci (born 7 November 1937) is an Italian wrestler.

It enables businesses to set up a current account and get instant access to various financial services (including automated bookkeeping and integrated invoicing). Established in 2015, Tide is one of the first digital-only finance platforms in the UK to provide current accounts for businesses. As of 2020, it had offices in London (headquarters), Sofia (Bulgaria) and Hyderabad (India). ==History== Tide was founded by George Bevis, who previously worked as a banker. He was joined by the UK Government advisor, venture capitalist and founder of Passion Capital, Eileen Burbidge, who became the Chairman of Tide. The company was registered on May 18, 2015. It received the Financial Conduct Authority‚Äôs permission to provide financial products and services in February 2016. Banking services are provided by PrePay Solutions, which is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. Tide became one of the first digital-only finance platforms in the UK to provide accounts for businesses. In July 2016, the company received $2 million (¬£1.5 million) in seed funding from Eileen Burbidge‚Äôs Passion Capital, Robin Klein‚Äôs LocalGlobe, Zoopla‚Äôs founder Alex Chesterman, Wonga founder Errol Damelin and a number of other investors. The Tide mobile app was in beta mode until the official launch in January 2017. In March 2017, the company opened a pop-up store at London‚Äôs Old Street station. In July 2017, Tide secured an ¬£11m series A investment from specialist fintech funds Anthemis and Creandum. Money was also raised from Tide‚Äôs existing investors Passion Capital and LocalGlobe. Alongside this, Tide announced a partnership with European online lender iwoca, to initiate its first loan program. An integration named Tide Credit was launched in October 2017. Tide offered credit lending of up to ¬£150,000 directly through the app. In January 2018, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) granted Tide authorisation as an electronic money institution (Authorised Electronic Money Institution). In March 2018, Tide presented a new logo and launched several product features, including a new vertical card design, an updated FreeAgent integration and Team Cards. Later in March 2018, George Bevis announced he intended to stand down from his CEO role. In August 2018, Oliver Prill, former chief operating officer at German online lender Kreditech, joined Tide as CEO. Later in August 2018, Tide secured ¬£8m in bridge funding by existing investors Anthemis, Creandum and Passion Capital joined by new investor Augmentum Fintech.

CEO Oliver Prill wrote to the Treasury urging it to change the rules for the contest. In January 2019, ClearBank announced a partnership with Tide to bid for a grant from Pool A of the Capability and Innovation Fund that formed part of RBS‚Äôs alternative remedies package. Later in February 2019, Banking Competition Remedies Ltd granted ClearBank ¬£60 million in funding from Pool A of the Capability and Innovation Fund. This decision has been criticized by competitors, saying that Tide didn‚Äôt have a banking licence and stating that a ¬£60 million grant was no more than a boost to Tide‚Äôs venture capital investors. In February 2019, Tide backed calls for a financial services tribunal for small businesses to settle disputes with their lenders. In March 2019, the company announced plans to raise ¬£60 million from investors. In October the same year, the company raised ¬£44.1m in Series B fundraising, with the SBI Group and Augmentum Fintech leading the funding round.This fundraising followed the appointment of Guy Duncan as CTO in September 2019.

It was released in the United States on August 20, 2019. Additional cardholders and joint accounts are not supported. Apple Card was announced at an Apple Special Event on March 25, 2019. Unlike previous special events which have historically served as platforms to announce upcoming hardware, this event focused on new internet software and services. Other services announced at the event include Apple TV+, Apple News+, and Apple Arcade. ==Enrollment== === Instant issuance === Users can apply for an Apple Card directly from within the Wallet app. Upon approval, a digital Apple Card is made available immediately on all of the user's devices. Users also can order a physical card for use at locations that do not accept contactless payments. The physical card does not display numbers on the front; instead, users receive a 16-digit virtual card number for websites and apps that do not accept Apple Pay. Apple Card details are accessible in the user's iCloud Keychain and can be auto- filled into online forms. === Titanium card === Apple has designed a titanium Apple Card for shopping at locations where Apple Pay contactless payment is not accepted. The logos on the card are engraved, and the cardholder's name is laser-etched onto the card. The card has no card number, CVV security code, expiration date, or signature printed on the card. On delivery, users with the iPhone 11, 11 Pro, XS, XS Max, and XR can activate the physical card by moving their phone near a NFC tag concealed within the card's packaging. Users with an iPhone X or earlier need to open the Wallet app before tapping the phone against the card. ==Features== === Cashback === Regular purchases made using the physical card earn 1%, purchases made with Apple Pay earn 2%, and purchases on Apple's stores earn 3%. Cashback on eligible purchases is deposited into the customer's Apple Cash account or applied as a statement credit. === Fees === Apple Card does not charge late, foreign transaction, returned payment, or annual credit card fees, but it does generate interest fees when carrying a balance and interchange fees charged to the vendor. === Card management === The Wallet app collates Apple Card transactions by category and provides weekly and monthly activity summaries. Apple Maps is used to provide a colour-coded category, map location, and contact details for the merchant (where available). === Privacy and security === A unique card number is created for each device and is stored in a secure element which is used by Apple Pay to handle transactions and on-device cryptographic functions. Each transaction uses its own one-time dynamic security code and is authorized with Face ID, Touch ID, or passcode. As with Apple Cash, transaction history for Apple Card is stored on and synced across devices using iCloud and encrypted such that only the authorized account holder can view it. Two-factor authentication must be enabled on the user's Apple ID account in order to apply for Apple Card. == Partnerships == For Apple Card's initial US launch, Goldman Sachs assumed the role of the issuing bank, while Mastercard served as the payment network. == Reception == According to Ron Shevlin of banking consultancy Cornerstone Advisors, as of March 2020, about 3.1 million Americans hold the Apple Card. Six in ten Apple Card users use it as their primary credit card. On October 1, 2019, MarketWatch published an article stating that Goldman Sachs is not reporting payments to the credit reporting agencies. The article suggests that Apple and Goldman Sachs rushed development of the card, and that the companies would fix the issue over time. On November 7, 2019, David Heinemeier Hansson posted on Twitter that he was given 20 times the credit limit than was offered his wife despite her having a better credit score. He accused Goldman Sachs of gender discrimination by using algorithms to determine a person's credit limit. Apple's co-founder Steve Wozniak also tweeted that he received ten times the credit limit that his wife was offered. In response to Hansson's tweets, the New York State Department of Financial Services launched an investigation into Goldman Sachs's practices. == References == ==External Links== * Category:Financial services companies established in 2019 Category:2019 introductions Category:Apple Inc. services Category:Contactless smart cards Category:Credit cards in the United States ","title":"Apple Card"},{"id":"60328686","text":"Mansford in 1932 Augustus Edward Cheesman Craig Mansford (27 September 1885 ‚Äì 13 June 1962) was Mayor of Palmerston North (New Zealand) from 1931 to 1947; the longest-serving mayor in the city's history. ==Early life== Mansford was born in 1885 at Suffolk Villa in Wellington. His father was Alfred Edward Nelson (died 1921) and his mother was Jessie Graham Mansford ( Cheesman, 1851‚Äì1898). Gus Mansford had two younger siblings; his sister Ellen was born in 1887 and his brother Thomas was born in 1890. Mansford received his education at Nelson College.

The three-story brick house overlooks the Severn River and is believed to have been constructed by the McCubbin or Linstead families between 1772 and 1780. In 1906, the property was sold to Francis and Harry Riggs of Baltimore, and it was subsequently used in the summers to entertain guests and throw lavish parties. During this period, the Riggs brothers also allowed the area Boy Scouts to use a large portion of the surrounding property as \\"Camp Linstead.\\" Even the famous Maryland governor Albert Ritchie was known to occasionally stop by the Linstead House to partake in the Riggs brothers' parties. The house was a homestead and part of a larger farm for much of its history, boasting a wine cellar and prize chickens and hogs. A short distance down the road from Linstead House is a cemetery dating back to the 1830s and containing the graves of multiple Linstead family members and Linstead House residents.

The opposition coalition consists of the Democratic Party of Albania, the Socialist Movement for Integration, the Party for Justice, Integration and Unity, the Republican Party and other minor opposition parties. After the first protests opposition MP's decided to resign in mass from Parliament. ==The Background== Following a 6-month boycott period, the opposition parties returned to parliament in January and announced mass protests to be held against the Rama Government. Meanwhile, the government was reshuffled as an aftermath of the student protests. In a similar rhetoric as in 2017 the opposition coalition accused the government of corruption and electoral fraud. The first nationwide protest was announced on February 16 in Tirana. Prior to that, the State Police issued a warning about the presence of criminal elements in the protest which was condemned as a form of intimidation by the opposition coalition. ==Protests and Mass Resignation== On February 16 opposition supporters from different cities gathered in Tirana demanding new elections and the resignation of the Rama Government. The protest turned violent as there were clashes with the police and use of tear gas and water cannon against the protesters. Some of them tried to enter the Prime Minister's Office as they broke through police ranks. Thousands of opposition supporters attended the protest that was considered as being one the biggest protests that the country had seen in years. In the aftermath, the opposition parties announced that all their MP's in the Parliament would resign from the parliament in an unprecedented act. On February 22 another protest was announced outside the Parliament's building, while other MP's were attending the plenary session. The peaceful demonstration culminated in a march led by opposition leader Lulzim Basha and members of the opposition parties in the Parliament, to hand over signed statements giving up their parliamentary seats and demanding fresh elections. More than 40 seats were vacated and the Central Elections Commission started in the following days the procedures to replace the MP's with mostly unknown and inexperienced figures that were part of the candidate lists during the 2017 election. Some MP's from opposition parties refused to resign their mandate, among them the daughter of one of the founders of the Democratic Party Rudina Hajdari. On March 16 another big demonstration was announced. It started outside the Prime Minister's Office building and continued outside the Parliament, where once again protesters clashed with police and water cannons and tear gas were used to controlling the situation. Another big protest was called on April 18, this time in the afternoon. In the days prior to the protest, the two main opposition parties have refused to enlist in the local elections of June 30, signaling a boycott. ==Boycotting local elections== The opposition parties decided to boycott the local elections previously set to be held on 30 June. ===The Wiretap Scandal=== Wiretaps part of an investigation still on process by the prosecution office in Albania, were released by Bild on June, where government and socialist party officials were taped dealing with vote buying and forcing people to vote for the Socialist Party in the elections of Dibra. Among the officials in the tapes was also the Prime Minister Edi Rama, former minister of Energy Damian Gjiknuri and former minister of interior Saimir Tahiri. ==Reactions== After the protest of 16 February turned violent, the US Embassy in Tirana issued a press statement condemning the violence and destruction. Other foreign embassies issued similar statements condemning the violence and calling for political dialogue to solve the situation. The mission of OSCE in Albania called the instigators and the perpetrators to ‚Äúbear the responsibility for the incidents. Following the mass resignation of the opposition MP's, the European Union condemned the extreme action through a joint statement issued by the EU Diplomatic Chief Federica Mogherini and Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn, considering the acts as counterproductive and against the democratic choice of Albanian citizens, undermining progress in the path to accessing the European Union and hindering the functioning of democracy in Albania. ==References== Category:Riots and civil disorder in Albania Albanian opposition protests Category:2019 in Albanian politics Category:Protests in Albania Category:February 2019 events in Europe Category:March 2019 events in Europe Category:Ongoing protests ","title":"2019‚Äì20 Albanian political crisis"},{"id":"60328812","text":"Mitrephora pallens is a species of plant in the family Annonaceae.

It is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Spanish Banco Santander S.A. The Santander Group is one of the largest banks in the world with over 133 million customers and presence in more than 40 countries. In Germany, the bank is represented by the Santander Consumer Bank AG. The Santander Consumer Bank AG has a loan portfolio of ‚Ç¨30.8 billion and has about 5.6 million customers. The business model of Santander Consumer Bank AG is based on three pillars: retail banking, vehicle financing and consumer financing. The Santander Consumer Bank AG is the largest manufacturer-independent bank in the field of car, motorcycle, and (motor) caravan financing and maintains ten dealer sales centers in the metropolitan areas of Hamburg, Frankfurt, Leipzig, Munich, Hanover, Berlin, Stuttgart and M√∂nchengladbach. The consumer financing business focuses on the consumer electronics, computer and furniture retail sectors. The Santander Consumer Bank AG has 211 branches in Germany (as of 31 December 2017). All banking services are also offered directly via online and telephone banking. In total, Santander employs 3,672 people in Germany. The Santander Consumer Bank AG is a member of CashPool, the Bankenfachverband e.V., the Bankenarbeitsgemeinschaft e.V. and the Verband deutscher Pfandbriefbanken. Santander is affiliated to the Deposit Guaranty Fund of the Bundesverband deutscher Banken. ==History== Historical company logo The bank was founded in 1957 as Curt Briechle KG Absatzfinanzierung by businessman Curt Briechle in M√∂nchengladbach as a sales financing company for automobiles. In 1968, the company was converted into a public limited company and renamed Bankhaus Centrale Credit AG. In 1987, the Spanish bank Banco Santander Central Hispano (BSCH) acquired 100% of the bank and renamed it CC-Bank AG. In 1988, the Royal Bank of Scotland acquired 50% of the CC-Bank's shares. In 1996, the Santander Central Hispano bought back the shares from the Royal Bank of Scotland. In 2002, the Cologne-based AKB Privat- und Handelsbank merged with the CC-Bank AG. The Cologne headquarter of AKB at Friesenplatz was dissolved. In 2003, the Santander Direkt Bank AG from Frankfurt, which also belonged to the BSCH- Group, was merged with the CC-Bank. As of 1 October 2004, the bank's market presence was adapted to the corporate design of the Spanish parent company. Since then, the name of the brand was Santander Consumer CC-Bank; for the time being the official company name remained CC-Bank AG. In August 2007 the official renaming in the commercial register to Santander Consumer Bank AG was made. On 1 July 2008, the Royal Bank of Scotland sold its consumer credit business unit ECF (European Consumer Finance) to Santander Consumer Finance. This included RBS (RD Europe) GmbH with branches in Ratingen (Germany), Houten (Netherlands), Merelbeke (Belgium) and Vienna (Austria), which now belong to the German Santander Consumer Holding GmbH. With the purchase the ComfortCard brand in those countries was also taken over. As of 1 July 2009, GE Money Bank GmbH in Hanover, which was acquired in November 2008, was merged with the Santander Consumer Bank AG. In July 2010 it was announced that the German private customer business of SEB will be sold to Banco Santander. The purchase price for the 173 SEB branches amounted to ‚Ç¨555 million. As of 31 January 2011, the private customer business with about 1 million customers and about 2,400 employees was transferred to Santander and now operates under Santander Bank ‚Äì Zweigniederlassung der Santander Consumer Bank AG. On 1 July 2016, a joint venture in which the Santander Consumer Bank AG holds a 50 percent stake, was launched by the PSA Bank Deutschland GmbH. The PSA Bank offers car financing, leasing products and dealer financing with the Peugeot Bank and Citro√´n Bank brands. Deposits are available through the PSA Direct Bank. In September 2016, the bank obtained the license to issue bonds. At the end of November 2017, the bank issued a bond certificate for the first time. In 2018, the Santander Consumer Bank AG will unify its brand image and will only perform in Germany as \\"Santander\\". As a result, the distribution networks of \\"Santander Consumer Bank\\", \\"Santander Direkt Bank\\" and \\"Santander Bank\\" are merged. ==Corporate Office and New Work Concept== As the number of employees rose to more than 1,300 after the merger with AKB Bank and as they worked at five different locations in M√∂nchengladbach, a new corporate headquarter was built at Karmannsstra√üe in M√∂nchengladbach by mid-2007 at the address Santander-Platz 1. In the building planned by the architects Hentrich- Petschnigg & Partner, the employees of the Santander Consumer Bank AG are to work with the so-called New Work concept. Meeting rooms for larger groups or small rooms, so-called \\"think tanks\\", for 1 to 3 persons are used for communication as well as \\"chillout lounges\\" or coffee bars. Between 2013 and 2015, another complex of buildings was built on Madrider Stra√üe in the Nordpark within sight of the M√∂nchengladbach stadium. Its shape and layout are based on the corporate headquarters at Santander-Platz. ==Engagement== The Santander Universities global business unit partners with more than 1,200 academic institutions in 20 countries worldwide, including the German Universities of Bremen, Heidelberg, Cologne, the Humboldt University of Berlin, Free University of Berlin, University of D√ºsseldorf, Justus Liebig University Giessen, Goethe University Frankfurt, University of G√∂ttingen, University of M√ºnster, Saarland University, University of T√ºbingen, TU Dresden, the Technical University of Munich and the Hochschule Niederrhein. ==Criticism== The Santander Consumer Bank AG is not a member of the Employers' organization of the private banking industry and thus not bound by collective agreements. At Santander, according to union information, there is a \\"proliferation of varying salaries\\" that has arisen in recent years as a result of acquisitions of banks. Almost one third of the employees work in a company-owned temporary employment agency and outsourced subsidiaries. According to J√∂rg Reinbrecht from the ver.di Financial Services Division, \\"even employees who only work on a commission basis have no fixed salary. They work in small branches that only sell loans, nothing else\\". The bank denies this. The union ver.di has been negotiating with Santander since February 2012 on a company collective agreement. In particular, the employees taken over from SEB demanded the continuation of their collective agreement for all Santander employees. In April 2013, after 14 months of negotiations, an agreement was reached between Santander and ver.di. For the employees in the branches, a collective agreement came into force retroactively to April 1, 2013. There is still no collective agreement for employees in the head offices; the Santander Consumer Bank has committed to negotiations with ver.di for 2014. In the spring of 2012 Santander withdrew from the free checking account and demanded from part of the customers account maintenance fees again. The information of the affected customers was packaged as a marketing campaign. In a judgment from November 2012 the district court M√∂nchengladbach saw in the procedure of the bank a misleading of the customers, a contract change requires the explicit agreement of the customer. Consumer advocates also criticize inadmissible fees for loans. For example, Santander requires processing fees of up to 3.5 percent of the loan amount for installment loans. Meanwhile, there are several court judgments against Santander because of loan processing fees. Consumer advocates have organized a protection community for bank customers because of the large number of those affecteded, which has already filed lawsuits against banks in 150 cases to repay the fees. Consumer advocates criticized in 2015 unjustified and inadmissibly high fees for address inquiries, reminders and ruptured direct debits. ==Awards (selection)== * At the \\"BankenMonitor 2017\\" of the magazine \\"Autohaus\\", the Santander Consumer Bank won first place with Mazda Finance in the \\"Brands without manufacturer bank\\" category. * \\"markt intern\\": For the thirdteens time in a row, car dealers choose the Santander Consumer Bank as the \\"Best Autobank 2017\\" * \\"Fair Company\\" Seal of approval of the job and business magazine \\"Karriere\\" of the publishing group Handelsblatt * The \\"IHK Mittlerer Niederrhein\\" ranked the Santander Consumer Bank M√∂nchengladbach several times as one of the best IHK training companies in the region ==References== ==External links== * Official Website Category:Banco Santander Category:Banks of Germany Category:Companies based in North Rhine-Westphalia Category:Corporate finance Category:1957 establishments in West Germany Category:German companies established in 1957 Category:Banks established in 1957 ","title":"Santander Consumer Bank (Deutschland)"},{"id":"60329084","text":":This article uses Spanish naming customs: the first or paternal family name is Ngua and the second or maternal family name is Akeng.

The event took place on June 29, 2019, at Ocean Center in Daytona Beach, Florida, alongside the CEO fighting game event. The name, slogan, and logo of the event are a parody of the fraudulent Fyre Festival. The event aired for free on the B/R Live streaming service in North America, and was available through pay-per-view internationally. It was the second edition of CEO's professional wrestling event at the Ocean Center, following the previous year's CEOxNJPW: When Worlds Collide, which was in co-sponsorship with New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW). The card comprised nine matches, including three on the Buy In pre-show. In the main event, Jon Moxley defeated Joey Janela in an unsanctioned match. In other prominent matches, The Elite (Kenny Omega, Matt Jackson, and Nick Jackson) defeated the Lucha Brothers (Pentag√≥n Jr. and Rey F√©nix) and Laredo Kid in a six-man tag team match, and Cody vs. Darby Allin ended in a time limit draw. ==Production== ===Background=== In June 2018, Community Effort Orlando (CEO) partnered with New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) to produce CEO's first professional wrestling show called CEOxNJPW: When Worlds Collide. The show took place as part of the CEO fighting game event.https://ceogaming.org/ceo/njpw/ For 2019's gaming event, CEO partnered with the upstart All Elite Wrestling (AEW) by way of AEW Executive Vice President Kenny Omega‚Äîa former prominent wrestler of NJPW who was responsible for the 2018 event‚Äîto produce a second wrestling show for CEO called Fyter Fest. The name of the event is a parody of the fraudulent Fyre Festival. On June 11, it was announced that Fyter Fest would air for free in the United States on the B/R Live streaming service. It was available on pay-per-view internationally. ===Storylines=== Fyter Fest comprised nine professional wrestling matches, including three on the pre-show, that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Storylines were produced on The Young Bucks' YouTube series Being The Elite and Cody's Nightmare Family YouTube series The Road to Fyter Fest. On Being The Elite, it was shown that Joey Janela had confronted Jon Moxley right after the latter's debut at Double or Nothing. During the segment, Janela laughed at Moxley and lit a cigarette. Moxley took the cigarette, smoked a quick bit of it, and blew smoke in Janela‚Äôs face before exiting. A couple of days later, a match between the two was scheduled for Fyter Fest. Just prior to the event, their match was made a non-sanctioned match. At Double or Nothing, the AEW World Championship belt was unveiled by wrestling legend Bret Hart. Hart brought out Adam Page, who won the pre-show's Casino Battle Royale to challenge for the title (later confirmed for All Out). They were interrupted by MJF, who taunted both Hart and Page. Page went to attack MJF, who backed off. As MJF tried exiting the arena, he was confronted by Jungle Boy and Jimmy Havoc. Page, Jungle Boy, and Havoc then proceeded to attack MJF. In humorous segments on Being The Elite, Page wanted a match against MJF at Fyter Fest, but was misunderstood and matches against Jungle Boy and Havoc, respectively, were promoted until it was finally announced that Page, Jungle Boy, Havoc, and MJF would face each other in a four-way match at the event. During the pre- show of CEOxNJPW in June 2018, CEO organizer Alex Jebailey defeated Michael Nakazawa.https://www.f4wonline.com/japan/ceo-x-njpw-when-worlds-collide- results-omega-ibushi-vs-lij-260686 On Being The Elite a year later, a rematch between the two was scheduled for the Fyter Fest pre-show and as a hardcore match. Prior to the event, it was announced that Best Friends (Chuck Taylor and Trent Beretta), SoCal Uncensored (represented by Frankie Kazarian and Scorpio Sky), and Private Party (Isiah Kassidy and Marq Quen) would face each other in a three-way tag team match on the Fyter Fest pre-show with the winning team advancing to All Out on August 31 for an opportunity at a first round bye in the AEW World Tag Team Championship tournament. == Event == {class= style=\\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\\" + Other on-screen personnel !Role !Name - rowspan=5Commentators Jim Ross - Excalibur - Goldenboy - Logan Sama - Kip Sabian - rowspan=1Ring announcer Justin Roberts - rowspan=3Referees Aubrey Edwards - Bryce Remsburg - Rick Knox } === The Buy In === Three matches occurred during The Buy In.

In the end, Cody performed a Cross Rhodes on Allin, but during the pin, as referee Aubrey Edwards had counted two, the bell sounded to signify the end of the 20-minute time limit. As a result, the match was ruled a draw. After the match, Shawn Spears appeared and struck Cody with an unprotected chair shot to Cody's head, causing Cody to bleed. In the penultimate match, The Elite (Kenny Omega, Matt Jackson, and Nick Jackson) faced the Lucha Brothers (Pentagon Jr and Rey Fenix) and Laredo Kid. Omega performed a One-Winged Angel on Kid to win. === Main event === In the event's final contest, Jon Moxley faced Joey Janela in an unsanctioned match, a match not officially recognized by AEW.

Omega performed a Snap Double Underhook DDT on the trash can on Moxley. Officials escorted Moxley out as the event ended. ==Reception== Around 4,200 tickets were sold for the show, with around 5,000 attendees. According to Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter, this number was \\"great for a company with no television [show], and above what house shows in markets that size are doing even by WWE.\\" On America's BR Live, Fyter Fest recorded 350,000 unique viewers in total for the initial viewing, although the average number of BR Live viewers during the show itself was 140,000. Meltzer wrote that this was \\"considered a success\\" for BR Live. In non-American markets, there were around 14,000 internet pay-per-view buys via FITE TV, \\"very good\\" according to Meltzer. Meltzer also wrote that Fyter Fest \\"got a generally favorable reaction\\". The Elite versus Laredo Kid and the Lucha Bros was the best rated match at 4.50 stars. Moxley-Janela, rated 4.25 stars, was \\"great for what it was\\": a match featuring \\"extreme shocking spots\\". The next highest rated matches were the pre-show tag team match and Cody-Darby Allin at 3.75 stars. The pre-show matches of Allie-Leva and Nakazawa-Jebailey received \\"most of the negativity\\", but Shawn Spears' chair shot to Cody also received fans' \\"outrage\\". Much of the discussion after the event was due to the unprotected chair shot that Cody Rhodes took to his head from Shawn Spears following his match with Darby Allin, which necessitated the insertion of 12 surgical staples, with Jim Ross mentioning on-air about long-term health concerns for Rhodes. The Young Bucks claimed in an interview after the event that the chair was \\"gimmicked\\" in order to make the chair shot look unprotected (while remaining safe), but something went wrong, causing the head laceration. AEW received criticism by those in the industry for allowing the spot due to concerns of head trauma and CTE; by contrast, WWE legitimately banned chair shots to the head following the Chris Benoit double-murder and suicide. == Aftermath == A few days after Fyter Fest, a rematch between The Elite (Kenny Omega, Matt Jackson, and Nick Jackson) and the Lucha Brothers (Pentag√≥n Jr. and Rey F√©nix) and Laredo Kid was confirmed for AAA's event, Tripleman√≠a XXVII, on August 3, 2019. Shawn Spears challenged Cody to a match at All Out that was made official. ==Results== ==See also== *2019 in professional wrestling *List of All Elite Wrestling pay-per-view events ==References== ==External links== *All Elite Wrestling Official website *Official Fyter Fest website 2019 Category:2019 All Elite Wrestling pay-per-view events Category:2019 in Florida Category:Events in Daytona Beach, Florida Category:June 2019 events in the United States Category:Professional wrestling in Florida ","title":"Fyter Fest (2019)"},{"id":"60329298","text":"Amar Sejdiƒá (born November 29, 1996) is a German soccer player who plays for Montreal Impact.

She is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and is a recipient of the Audubon Medal. == Early life and education == Packard grew up in the Santa Clara Valley in Northern California, where she rode horses and explored nature on the extensive grounds of San Felipe Ranch each weekend. With her father, David Packard, the co- founder of Hewlett-Packard, she planted a vegetable garden every year. Packard spent much time outdoors, and was always very curious; as a student at University of California, Santa Cruz, her biology professor said she \\"was able to synthesize and ask great questions. She had a wide-open, inquisitive mind.\\" Her most fond experiences as a student were early mornings wearing hip waders, combing through algae and animals of the intertidal zone. She graduated from Castilleja School in 1970, then graduated from the University of California, Santa Cruz with a bachelor's degree in biology in 1974, and a Master of Arts in 1978, focusing on marine algae. == Career == Packard joined other members of her family in the undertaking to create Monterey Bay Aquarium. Her sister, Nancy Burnett, also has a degree in marine biology, and her father helped design the facility's infrastructure. Packard became the aquarium's executive director by the time the aquarium opened in 1984. As part of her role at Monterey Bay Aquarium, Packard was instrumental in the creation of the sustainable seafood advisory list, Seafood Watch, and its endeavor to prevent the import of seafood harvested through slavery. Packard chairs the board of directors of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, and is also a trustee of the David and Lucile Packard Foundation. She received the Audubon Medal from the National Audubon Society in 1998 for her work in conservation and environmental protection, and she was elected as a fellow to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2009.

The great-great granddaughter of the surgeon William Marsden, she trained in art schools of London before earning employment sketching portraits of motion picture personalities. Sandwith hitchhiked the Birdsville Track from August 1952 to February 1953 and sketched its people before travelling to the South Pacific. In 1954, she was the first person to produce a portrait of SƒÅlote Tupou III, Queen of Tonga. A year later, Sandwith returned to England to train to become a nurse, remaining in the health industry until 1979. ==Early life and education== Sandwith was born in Cape Town in the Union of South Africa on 31 July 1927. She was the daughter of the English authors and photojournalists Francis and Frieda Johnson Sandwith. Among her ancestors were the surgeon William Marsden (her great, great grandfather) and also the poet Matthew Arnold. Sandwith was brought up in Carshalton, Surrey. She was trained in the arts at the Kingston School of Art from 1944 to 1945, the Croydon School of Art in 1946, and the Heatherley School of Fine Art between 1947 and 1948. During this period, Sandwith became proficient in sketching poses of humans and learning about the human form. ==Career== Her first job was with a small advertising agency, where she sketched portraits of motion-picture personalities from publicity photographs, which were displayed in cinemas for promotional purposes. In 1950 at the age of 23, Sandwith flew to Sydney to meet her uncle, and she later accompanied him to an embarkment to Tonga from 1950 to 1951. She completed several paintings of the country before returning to Sydney to seek employment. Resisting pressure from her family to return to England, Sandwith hitchhiked along the Birdsville Track, a cattle route linking Queensland and South Australia, between August 1952 to February 1953. She used public transport and hitched trucks to reach some of its remote areas. During her journey, Sandwith sketched the Aboriginal peoples, sheep shearers, landladies, and fellow travellers, mostly in pencil but occasionally in pastel. The journalist of The Sydney Morning Herald wrote that Sandwith had realised she \\"stumbled on a part of the world that had never been adequately documented\\" and her work became \\"an incredible record of the harsh outback landscape ‚Äì and the characters, white and black, who called it home.\\" She subsequently travelled to Fiji, Samoa, and the Pitcairn Islands in 1953. Sandwith returned to Tonga to teach English at the Free Church of Tonga, and lived with a Tongan family, during her work to sketch and record the islanders' culture, earning her the name \\"The Drawing Girl\\". In 1954, she persuaded SƒÅlote Tupou III to sit for a portrait, the first of a queen of Tonga, after a cabinet meeting of Tongan nobles convened to grant her permission for the painting. Sandwith returned to England in 1955 and lived in London. She decided to train to become a nurse, enrolling at the Royal Free Hospital from 1956 to 1959. After completing her training, Sandwith worked as a staff nurse at the St Mary's Hospital between 1962 and 1963. She continued to exhibit her sketches during this period, at the Royal Society of British Artists, the Society of Women Artists, and the Brighton Museum & Art Gallery. Sandwith spent part of 1965 sketching in Canada and also worked as a nurse in British Columbia. She later returned to London and attained employment as a health visitor in the Borough of Newham from 1972 to 1975 and Redbridge and Waltham Forest between 1975 and 1979. Sandwith continued to visit unusual places and took up courses in drawing and design and also garnered an interest in etching on copper. She eschewed photography of human subjects as she believed draughtsmanship captured better details and delivered spontaneity. ==Final years and death== In 1993 she donated 105 sketches of her work and photographs and letters in the Birdsville Track to the National Archives of Australia. She subsequently became affected by Alzheimer's disease and was taken to a care home.

Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains west into Evan-Thomas Creek, which is a tributary of the Kananaskis River, or east into the Little Elbow River which is a tributary of the Elbow River. ==History== The peak was named in 1920 after John Arbuthnot Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher, a British admiral known for reforming and modernizing the Royal Navy prior to World War I. Jackie Fisher, as he was commonly known, has been considered the second most important person in British naval history. The mountain's name was officially adopted by the Geographical Names Board of Canada in 1924. The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1950 by J.F. Tarrant. ==Geology== Fisher Peak is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. ==Climate== Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Fisher Peak is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers.

The house features a sandstone foundation and a hip roof with attic dormers. Lintels and window sills are trimmed with stone. The house includes a large, cross facade porch with square posts decorated by geometric ornaments below the capitals. The Gakey house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. With In 1910 the Idaho Statesman described the house as \\"one of the first of its kind in the city.\\" The newspaper noted wide overhanging eaves to protect second floor windows from direct sunlight, natural ventilation, and air pockets behind the brick veneer to keep the house warm and dry in winter. The house included pieces of built in furniture. ==John H. Gakey== John H. Gakey (December 17, 1864--May 8, 1953) arrived in Boise City in 1882, having moved from Cheyenne, Wyoming. Although a resident of Boise, Gakey owned a large sheep ranch near Nampa.John Gakey also may have been a silent partner in a Boise shoe store, Konrad & Gakey, with purchase of the Logan & Walker store in 1901. However, the Idaho Statesman listed G.H. Gakey, not J.H. Gakey, as the silent partner. The newspaper never again referred to G.H. Gakey, and further research is needed. Gakey sold the business in 1904 to John and Frank Rader of Kansas, but the Statesman only identified his surname. Gakey married Martha Elizabeth Baker in Boise in 1886. By 1910, the year of construction of the J.H. Gakey House, Mrs. Gakey was being treated for stomach cancer, and she died of the disease before the Gakeys could occupy their new home. John Gakey never lived in the house, and he sold it to its first occupant, Frank Blackinger, in 1911. Gakey was remarried in 1918 to Elizabeth Lynch in Boise, and the Gakeys later sold their Nampa ranch and moved to Napa, California, in 1947. John Gakey died in Napa in 1953.

He played his college basketball for three years at New Hampshire where he averaged 8.8 points per game in 77 career games before transferring to Siena for his final season of eligibility. After graduation, Maciariello obtained Italian citizenship and professional basketball in Italy for four seasons. ==Coaching career== Maciariello's first coaching opportunity came with his alma mater as the director of basketball operations at Siena under Fran McCaffery in his first season at the helm. He then went on to work with the Albany City Rocks AAU program until returning to the college coaching ranks in 2008 at Fairfield under Ed Cooley. He'd follow Cooley briefly to Providence to serve as the director of operations, but would ultimately take an assistant coaching position at Boston University in that same offseason. After two years at BU, Maciariello joined the staff at George Washington, where he was on staff for the Colonials' 2016 NIT Championship. In 2018, Maciariello returned to his alma mater as an assistant coach under Jamion Christian. He was elevated to head coach on March 25, 2019 after Christian accepted the head coaching position at George Washington, making him the 18th head coach in Siena basketball history. In his first season, he led the Saints to the #1 seed and a regular season championship for the first time since 2010. The Saints entered the MAAC tournament as heavy favorites to advance to the NCAA tournament, Manhattan coach Steve Masiello, went as far to reference the tournament as \\"The Siena Invitational\\". In their first game at the MAAC Tournament, the Saints easily defeated Manhattan 63-49. Shortly before their semifinal, the MAAC was forced to cancel the tournament due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As regular season champions, the MAAC announced Siena would be named Conference Champions and were awarded the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. It was Siena's first bid since winning three consecutive MAAC tournaments between 2008-10. The tournament was later cancelled along with the remainder of the college basketball season as a result of the outbreak. Despite the cancellation of the tournament, Maciariello became just the second coach in program history to earn a berth to the NCAA tournament in his first season as head coach, and was the first in program history to win the MAAC regular season title in his first year. ==Head coaching record== ==References== Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:American men's basketball coaches Category:American men's basketball players Category:Basketball coaches from New York (state) Category:Basketball players from New York (state) Category:Boston University Terriers men's basketball coaches Category:College men's basketball head coaches in the United States Category:Fairfield Stags men's basketball coaches Category:George Washington Colonials men's basketball coaches Category:New Hampshire Wildcats men's basketball players Category:People from Clifton Park, New York Category:Providence Friars men's basketball coaches Category:Siena Saints men's basketball coaches Category:Siena Saints men's basketball players ","title":"Carmen Maciariello"},{"id":"60329952","text":"William Glanville (c.1686‚Äì1766), of St Clere, Kent was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons for 38 years from 1728 to 1766.

Granite and quartz, which are commonly found on Earth but very rare to find on the Moon, were confirmed to exist in this fragment. To find the sample's age, the research team from Curtin University looked at bits of the mineral zircon embedded in its structure. \\"By determining the age of zircon found in the sample, we were able to pinpoint the age of the host rock at about four billion years old, making it similar to the oldest rocks on Earth,\\" researcher Alexander Nemchin said, adding that \\"the chemistry of the zircon in this sample is very different from that of every other zircon grain ever analyzed in lunar samples, and remarkably similar to that of zircons found on Earth.\\" This means that Big Bertha is both the first discovered terrestrial meteorite and the oldest known Earth rock. ==See also== * Great Scott * Seatbelt basalt * Big Muley * Bench Crater meteorite * Hadley Rille meteorite * Moon rock == References == Category:Lunar samples Category:Apollo 14 Category:Meteorites found on the Moon Category:Meteorites by name Category:Alan Shepard ","title":"Big Bertha (lunar sample)"},{"id":"60330013","text":"Elizabeth Gardner (August 25, 1957 ‚Äì June 18, 1988) was a British theoretical physicist. She is best known for her groundbreaking work on a phase transition known as the Gardner transition and on disordered networks. == Early life and education == Gardner was born in Cheshire, UK. Both of her parents were chemical engineers. Gardner was interested in science from an early age. In 1975, she enrolled in University of Edinburgh to study mathematical physics. She graduated with first class honors, and was awarded the Tait Medal, Robert Schlapp Prize, and the Class medal. Gardner completed her D.Phil. studies at Oxford under the supervision of I.J.R. Aitchison. Her thesis was in particle physics, and focused on non-Abelian gauge theories. Despite fulfilling requirements, Gardner did not formally graduate from Oxford. == Career == Following her D.Phil., Gardner moved to University of Paris-Saclay, where she spent two years, supported by a Royal Society Fellowship. She worked on a variety of topics in field theory and the theory of disordered systems, and began to work on spin glasses. In 1984, Gardner returned to the University of Edinburgh. She was supported initially by the Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC) to work on particle physics, and later by the university itself to work on disordered systems and neural networks. In 1985, Gardner published a paper titled \\"Spin glasses with p-spin interactions,\\" in which she described a phase transition for the first time that is now known as the Gardner transition. At the Gardner transition, a glass becomes marginally stable. The Gardner transition has attracted significant recent attention, as new evidence for it has been discovered through simulations and calculations about jamming of hard spheres. In 1988, Gardner published two consecutive papers, one with Bernard Derrida, on neural networks. It has received significant attention in recent years, and was recently celebrated as one of the 50 of the most influential papers published in the Journal of Physics A. Gardner's prolific research career was cut short by cancer. She was first diagnosed in 1986, and died in June 1988. == References == Category:English women physicists Category:1957 births Category:1988 deaths ","title":"Elizabeth Gardner (physicist)"},{"id":"60330039","text":"Peter Mokaya Tabichi, OFM (born 1982) is a Kenyan science teacher and Franciscan friar at Keriko Mixed Day Secondary School in Pwani, Nakuru County.

For additional information regarding this time period, see the Great Depression in Australia and Sydney Harbour Bridge. Lennie Gwyther (18 April 1922 - 1992), often referred to as \\"Lennie the Legend\\", was an Australian figure of significance due to his 1932 solo horseback journey, as a nine-year old boy, from Leongatha, Victoria, to Sydney, New South Wales. Accompanied by his horse, Ginger Mick, Gwyther undertook a journey to watch the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. == Personal life == Lennie Gwyther (Lennie the Legend) was born in Leongatha, on 18 April 1922 to Australian parents Captain Leo Tennyson Gwyther and Clara (Clare) Amelia Gwyther (n√©e Simon). Lennie had four younger siblings, Beryl Ferrier n√©e Gwyther, Noel Harry Gwyther, Keith Roy Gwyther and Leta Gardenal n√©e Gwyther who was born in 1934, two years after Lennie's journey. They grew up on a farm, known as 'Flers' in the country town. When Lennie was nine, his father (The Captain), broke his leg on the Gwyther Farm and Lennie took over the responsibilities on the farm such as ploughing 24 fields. Consequently, Lennie was offered a reward, and he asked to attend the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. That was largely because of his interest with the engineering and construction of the bridge. His mother, Clara (Clare) Gwyther, was unsure of this arrangement but, due to the fulfilment of his duties, communication with those in Sydney, and the map Lennie and Captain Leo Tennyson Gwyther created, she allowed Lennie to go. On 3 February 1932, Lennie and Ginger Mick left Leongatha on the expedition to Sydney. He carried a haversack that included his toothbrush, silk pyjamas, spare clothes and a water bottle. Lennie alongside Ginger Mick before he departed. On 10 June, after his tenth birthday, Lennie Gwyther returned home and resumed with his family commitments on the Leongatha 'Flers' farm. Several years later, at the age of 19, he enlisted in the army for World War II. In that, he followed his father who fought on the Western Front in World War I and who was awarded the Military Cross and bar in 1916 and 1917, respectively. After serving in the Morotai Islands in the Pacific, Lennie commenced work as an engineer with General Motors' Holden at Fishermans Bend, Victoria and moved to Hampton, Melbourne, Victoria. Lennie Gwyther married and had a daughter, Mary Gwyther, and granddaughter, Sally Gwyther. He built a house for his mother, Clara (Clare) Gwyther. In later life, Lennie's passion for fishing and sailing was reflected in the fact that he built a yacht, with the intention of sailing to Tasmania and then to New Zealand. His granddaughter commented in 2015 that \\"he had a lathe in the shed and he was always turning wood or making tools or tables. There wasn't really anything he couldn't do. I'm sure he would have attempted sailing around the world, that's how adventurous he was.\\" The Adelaide Advertiser of 22 December 1951 published news of Lennie's brother, Pte. Keith Roy Gwyther, then serving in Korea. A photograph of Clare and Lennie Gwyther carried the caption: \\"At her home in Leongatha (Vic.) the mother of Pte. Keith Roy Gwyther looks at his photograph ... With her is another son, Len. Pte. Gwyther was reported killed in action in Korea last April. This week the Chinese Communists named him as a POW\\". Keith Gwyther was later released and returned to Australia. Lennie Gwyther died of cancer in 1992, at the age of 70. ===Ginger Mick=== On his second birthday in 1924, Lennie's grandfather, on his mother's side, Charles Simon, gifted him a two-year-old horse named Ginger Mick. Beryl Ferrier, Lennie's sister, stated \\"the horse was foaled on the same day as my brother was born, and they grew up together\\". Lennie Gwyther commented on Ginger Mick saying he was \\"...dark chestnut just 12.2 hands high...\\". He was named after his father's favourite character from C.J Dennis' book The Moods of Ginger Mick. Ginger Mick also competed and won competitions in two separate categories, school pony and ponies 12.2 and below in \\"Leongatha, Foster and Yarram\\". Ginger Mick would later go with Lennie on his 600 mile journey to Sydney. Eighteen years later, in 1949, Ginger Mick died and was buried on the Leongatha farm. Lennie photographed on his journey with Ginger Mick. == Significance == Lennie Gwyther became famous for his solo horseback journey to Sydney from the Victorian town of Leongatha as a nine- year-old boy. His journey was widely publicised in the media, particularly newspapers. Frequent updates regarding his whereabouts led Lennie to encounter experiences that were unprecedented on his departure. For example, outside of Parliament House in Canberra he met, shook the hand of, and had tea with Prime Minister Joseph Lyons'. Other instances include being \\"...attacked by vagabonds...\\" and being met with a bushfire. In Sydney, he met with Lord Mayor, Sir Samuel Walder, while also looking at Circular Quay, Bondi Beach and Taronga Zoo, where he rode an elephant. As he arrived in Martin Place, accompanied by 25 police, Gwyther was met by 10,000 cheering citizens. The Secretary of the Royal Agricultural Society, Colonel Somerville, also greeted him. He was wearing \\"...khaki breeches, boots, and leggings, and a thick coat, and [was] carrying a cloth sun hat in his hand.\\" Taking part in the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge parade. On 19 March, 1932, Gwyther, with Ginger Mick, participated in the Royal Easter Show and paraded across the Sydney Harbour bridge in its opening. Following that, on 21 March, Lennie met cricketer Don Bradman at the Sydney Cricket Ground where he was gifted with a signed cricket bat. His journey home involved talking to children at Gunning Public School about his experience as well as celebrating his tenth birthday with shire councillors, being given one Australian pound. As he passed through Urana, he attended a children's ball as well as a reception organised by the local shire president. He also spent a couple of days in Widgiewa with councillor Otway McLaurin Falkiner. Upon his arrival back to Leongatha, Lennie was met by 800 citizens. He also delivered a return letter from Sydney's Lord Mayor to the president of the Woorayl Shire Council. Gwyther was also recorded in the Guilds Records as the \\"youngest known person to make a solo equestrian journey.\\" In Leongatha, Victoria, Gwyther Siding Road was named after him. == Commemoration and References in Popular Culture == Lennie Gwyther has been commemorated and referenced in popular culture, indicating his ongoing legacy into the 21st century. === Books === On 1 February 2015, NLA Publishing published Lennie the Legend: Solo to Sydney by Pony by Stephanie Owen Reeder. It is a children's book which follows Gwyther and Ginger Mick on their journey to New South Wales from Victoria while also referencing Lennie and his family history. In 2016, this book won Children's Book Council of Australia's (CBCA's) Eve Pownall Award for Information Books. Peter Lalor's book The Bridge: An Epic Story of an Australian Icon - the Sydney Harbour Bridge (2006) also commemorate Lennie Gwyther in chapter 11. Mary Small's book Lennie's Ride (2010), published by Small Endeavour Publishing, also references Lennie Gwyther and his story. The illustrator of the pictures is Marion Wilcocks. It also includes a chapter that was written with assistance from Beryl Ferrier, Lennie's sister, regarding their family and the farm. Lennie's sister, Beryl Ferrier, also wrote a book Lennie Rides on and Reflections which was published in 2016. === Media Publications === Newspapers have been publishing articles about Lennie Gwyther since 1932. The story of Lennie Gwyther was so widespread that The London Times reported on him. Some of the publications that had articles about him include: The Sydney Morning Herald * \\"550-MILE JOURNEY Thousands Greet Boy (9 March 1932) *\\"BOY'S LONG RIDE TO ATTEND THE ROYAL SHOW.\\" (10 March 1932) *\\"THE BOY WITH THE PONY.

The Sydney Morning Herald published a poem by V.G Williams entitled \\"My Latest Ambition\\". The Australian * \\"Lennie Gwyther‚Äôs harbour bridge ride captured nation‚Äôs heart\\", Peter Lalor, 13 October 2017. ABC News * \\"Leongatha's legendary 9yo Lennie Gwyther garners a statue for epic Sydney Harbour Bridge pony ride\\", Rachael Lucas, 19 October 2017. The Age * \\"Epic trek of boy and his horse inspired the nation\\", Carolyn Webb, 23 January 2015 * \\"A herd of Lennies saddle up for epic tale\\", Carolyn Webb, 28 October 2015 === Production === The books prompted enabled others to refer to Lennie, such as the October 2015 musical, produced by primary school teacher Roz Girvan at Clifton Hill Primary, which involved the composition of twelve songs, including a rap song about when Lennie met Donald Bradman. Peter Watchorn, a spokesperson for the Leongatha Chamber of Commerce, noted that media company Village Roadshow was interested in the books about Lennie, leading to speculation about a film. Bernie Wheatley composed a song, 'Lennie', about Gwyther and his journey, which was performed at the unveiling of the bronze statue. In February 2018, on the ABC radio program \\"Conversations\\", -Richard Fidler and Sarah Kanowski, with guest Peter Lalor, spoke about Lennie Gwyther and his journey in the \\"depression-era Australia\\". On 17 April 2018, the ABC program \\"History Listen\\", produced by Lyn Gallacher, included a \\"Lennie the Legend\\" episode, featuring Lennie's family members, Julie Campbell and Beryl Ferrier, author Stephanie Owen Reeder, and music teachers Roz Girvan from Clifton Hill and Jess Stein from Leongatha Primary School. === Statue and Plaque === In January 2015, Bob Newton, South Gippsland Shire councillor and former mayor, recognised the significance of the story of Lennie Gwyther and Ginger Mick for children of this generation, and asked for a statue to be made. Bob Newton, assisted by a committee, applied for a Federal Government community grant and, through the Leongatha Chamber of Commerce and Industry, established a fund-raising division, because the quotes for the statue, and the other associated items such as a plaque, totalled $60,000. Local residents Glenn Wright and his wife Shirley-Ann, started the fund-raising campaign with a $1,000 donation. Almost three years later, on 14 October 2017, a bronze statue of Lennie Gwyther riding Ginger Mick was unveiled in Leongatha by the Gwyther family. In attendance were his siblings Beryl Ferrier, Leta Gardenal and Keith Roy, his daughter and granddaughter Mary and Sally, his niece Julie Campbell, and sister-in-law Shirley Gwyther. Peter Watchorn noted that the importance of the statue was that Lennie's achievement had been somewhat forgotten, and it should be commemorated within the community as it . The plaque alongside the statue, made by C&L; Stainless, reads: The statue is located next to a public rest stop at 8 Anderson Street, Leongatha. == References == Category:1922 births Category:1992 deaths Category:Australian folklore ","title":"Lennie Gwyther"},{"id":"60330182","text":"Marvel's Iron Man VR is a virtual reality shooter video game developed by American studios Camouflaj and Darkwind Media and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 4's PlayStation VR headset. It is based on the Marvel Comics superhero Iron Man, and is inspired by the long- running comic book mythology and adaptations in other media. The game's story revolves around Iron Man's conflict with a mysterious computer hacker and terrorist known only as Ghost, who targets Tony Stark and his company while seeking revenge for the deaths caused by the weapons the company manufactured prior to Stark becoming Iron Man. Gameplay is presented from a first-person perspective, calling on the player to navigate the game's virtual space by using the flying mechanics and weapon systems of the Iron Man armor to attack enemies primarily in aerial combat across several environments. Iron Man can freely navigate the different environments in the game accessed through a linear progression of different levels, interacting with characters, undertaking missions, and unlocking new armor upgrades by progressing through the main story or completing challenge modes outside of the story. After a series of delays and a disruption in the game's production caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the game was released for PlayStation VR on July 3, 2020. The game received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic. ==Gameplay== Iron Man VR is an aerial shooter played from a first- person perspective, taking place across various global locales as Iron Man attempts to thwart his enemy Ghost and the various combat drones she employs to bring ruin to Tony Stark and his company. As a virtual reality game, it is played from a first-person perspective, employing the use of one PlayStation Move controller in each of the player's hands to allow control of Iron Man's palm-mounted repulsor weapons and flight stabilizers. Based on hand and head positioning of the PlayStation VR headset and Move controllers, the player can freely fly around the game's various environments in order to attack combat drones while also interacting with elements of the game map in order to do things like deactivate explosives, repair broken items or put out fires. Environments can be navigated freely as opposed to employing elements of rail shooting, with the player in total control of roaming each game map by use of the Iron Man armor. The player uses the weapon systems of the armor including the repulsors and various auxiliary weapons (such as small missiles or larger- scale explosives) to defeat enemies, and can also employ melee attacks that are given additional power through the use of the armor's jet propulsion systems. Successful completion of missions earns the player up to five \\"research points\\" based on their received score-based star rating, which can then be used to purchase upgrades to the Iron Man armor that can be crafted and installed in Tony Stark's garage between missions. The upgrades can augment the capabilities of the Iron Man armor while also adding new auxiliary weapons that have different effectiveness in different combat scenarios, and the player can create and choose between two different armor loadouts while in the garage featuring different upgrades and armor shaders (\\"decos\\"). Cutscenes which progress the story are also presented from the first-person perspective, allowing the player to interact with objects and look around freely while story material is taking place around them. Challenge modes consist of racing and combat-based exercises taking place through the game's pre-existing environments, giving the player an additional opportunity to earn research points they can use to upgrade the armor. ==Synopsis== ===Characters and setting=== Iron Man VR features an ensemble cast of characters drawn from the history of Iron Man and Avengers comics. Tony Stark (voiced by Josh Keaton) is a billionaire industrialist and weapons manufacturer who became a superhero after a life-changing experience, wherein he was captured and held hostage by terrorists in Afghanistan. With help from fellow captive Ho Yinsen, he built the first iteration of the Iron Man armor and managed to escape his captors, but failed to save Yinsen, who was killed during the escape. After his return to the United States, Stark turned his life around; he announced that his company, Stark Industries, would stop manufacturing weapons, and revealed himself as the superhero Iron Man. The events of the game take place five years after Stark first became Iron Man. By this point, he has established himself as a world-renowned hero. Stark is aided in his endeavors by the recently appointed Stark Industries CEO Virgina \\"Pepper\\" Potts (Jennifer Hale), and his sentient A.I. assistant F.R.I.D.A.Y. (Leila Birch). The game features another A.I. called \\"the Gunsmith\\" (also voiced by Keaton), which was made in Stark's image and used to assist him in designing weapons before he became Iron Man. Throughout the game, Iron Man's adventures bring him into contact with several supporting characters, including S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury (Ike Amadi) and Deputy Director Maria Hill (Ali Hillis); Stark's relationship with Fury was strained after the former stopped supplying S.H.I.E.L.D. with weapons, but the two nonetheless respect and admire each other. Iron Man also comes into conflict with supervillains including Ghost (Chantelle Barry) and the Living Laser (Leonardo Nam). Iron Man VR depicts fictional locations and entities adapted from both the Marvel Comics Universe and the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including a Stark Tower based in Shanghai, Tony Stark's beachfront home in Malibu, and a S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier (described as Stark's final project before Stark Industries stopped manufacturing weapons). There are also in-game references to Iron Man being a member of the Avengers, including blueprints of Stark Tower's transformation into the Avengers Tower that the player can find. The downtown Shangai level features advertisements for other fictional companies in the Marvel Universe, such as the Roxxon Energy Corporation and Advanced Idea Mechanics. Oscorp can also be seen in-game, and the loading screens offer information on the company's background, revealing that it was founded by both Norman Osborn and Otto Octavius (which matches the story of Oscorp's foundation in Marvel's Spider-Man). ===Plot=== Shortly after revealing himself to the world as the superhero Iron Man, Tony Stark decides to fully move on from his former life as a weapons dealer by deactivating the \\"Gunsmith,\\" an A.I. modeled after him that was designed to assist Stark with manufacturing weapons and planning out battle tactics. While breaking the news to the Gunsmith, Stark reveals that the A.I.'s \\"retirement\\" will consist of \\"full internet privileges\\" and that his consciousness will continue to exist. Five years later, Stark has cemented himself as a world-renowned hero and member of the Avengers, having walked away entirely from weapons manufacturing, much to the dismay of S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury. After appointing his former assistant Pepper Potts as the new CEO of Stark Industries‚Äînow a clean energy company‚ÄîStark is attacked aboard a company jet by a mysterious computer hacker known as \\"Ghost,\\" who uses a tech suit that allows her to fly and to phase in and out of solid matter. Ghost blames Stark for all the deaths caused by his weapons over the years and attempts to exact revenge by reviving a series of Stark-manufactured combat drones and having them attack Stark Industries' assets across the globe. Blindsided by the effectiveness of Ghost's initial attack, a desperate Stark reactivates the Gunsmith due to his instrumental role in designing the drones now used by Ghost, much to the dismay of his current A.I. assistant F.R.I.D.A.Y., who has been modeled to exemplify Stark's new, more heroic aspirations and goals. After the Stark Tower in Shanghai is attacked, Iron Man races there to find Ghost waiting for him, who expresses her desire to seek justice for \\"Tim Shung,\\" a name that neither Stark nor F.R.I.D.A.Y. recognize. When Iron Man is overhelmed by Ghost's drones, the Gunsmith revives his powerful unibeam weapon, allowing him to destroy them. Meanwhile, Ghost's attacks catch the attetion of S.H.I.E.L.D., and Fury calls Stark to the Helicarrier to offer intel on her, just as Ghost attacks, but is driven off by Iron Man and the S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel. Stark then learns that a former disgruntled Stark Industires employee named Arthur Parks has been revived by Ghost and provided with laser armor technology to assist her in her vendetta against Stark. Ghost later attacks Stark's home in Malibu, prompting the Gunsmith to employ orbital satellites to destroy her contingent of drones, while causing a massive amount of collateral damage. F.R.I.D.A.Y. leaves in protest of Tony's continued association with the Gunsmith, whom she sees as embodying the dangerous impulses of his former, pre-heroic lifestyle. After tracking Parks, now calling himself the \\"Living Laser,\\" and Ghost to a Roxxon facility in Kazakhstan, Iron Man defeats them both, but the Gunsmith commandeers his armor to kill Ghost against Stark's wishes. He resists and subsequently fires the Gunsmith, while Ghost escapes during the chaos. Stark returns home to find F.R.I.D.A.Y. who reassures him and refocuses him on the mission at-hand. After the Living Laser launches a solo attack on the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, Iron Man defeats him and discovers the location of the base he and Ghost have been using: the same cave in Afghanistan where Stark built his first Iron Man armor to escape from his terrorist captors. Returning to the cave and finding the original armor still inside, Iron Man is attacked by Ghost, who forcefully removes the arc reactor keeping him alive from his chest. As Stark struggles through a \\"trial\\" Ghost has planned, he learns that she was orphaned as a child by an attack involving Stark weapons, and that her desire for revenge led her to correspond online with a faceless Stark Industries employee: Tim Shung. In her eyes, Shung was a hero and a whistleblower who selflessly revealed the extent of Stark's criminality before allegedly being killed by the company. F.R.I.D.A.Y. helps recover the arc reactor and Iron Man defeats Ghost, who is subsequently aboard the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. Later, Stark and Pepper realize that \\"Tim Shung\\" is an anagram for \\"Gunsmith,\\" who reveals himself as the mastermind behind the ordeal involving Ghost in an effort to maneuver Stark Industries into producing weapons again, believing the world was safer with Stark weapons on the market. Realizing he cannot go up against Gunsmith using his regular armor that the rogue A.I. has access to, Stark retrofits the newly recovered Mark I armor and returns to his home to fight the Gunsmith. There, he reluctantly allies himself with an escaped Ghost, who manages to go through an impenetrable barrier surrounding the mansion erected by the Gunsmith. Using the information that Ghost finds about the A.I.'s weaknesses, Iron Man defeats a giant construct of the Gunsmith wearing an advanced version of his armor, and destroys him for good. Afterward, Ghost ends her temporary truce with Stark and departs. Months later, Iron Man and Pepper‚Äînow in her own Rescue armor‚Äîare called into space by Nick Fury to examine a S.H.I.E.L.D. orbital satellite that has become suspiciously unresponsive. ==Development== The game was revealed on March 25, 2019 during SIE's first \\"State of Play\\" online presentation. The game features a new suit for Iron Man, referred to as the \\"Impulse Armor,\\" designed by comic book artist Adi Granov.

Reliability is also used as a probabilistic measure of structural safety. The reliability of a structure is defined as the probability of complement of failure (\\\\text{Reliability} = 1 - \\\\text{Probability of Failure}). The failure occurs when the total applied load is larger than the total resistance of the structure. Structural reliability has become known as a design philosophy in the twenty-first century, and it might replace traditional deterministic ways of design and maintenance. == Theory == In structural reliability studies, both loads and resistances are modeled as probabilistic variables. Using this approach the probability of failure of a structure is calculated. When loads and resistances are explicit and have their own independent function, the probability of failure could be formulated as follows. P_f=\\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} F_R(s)f_s(s)\\\\,ds \\\\qquad\\\\mathrm{(1)} where P_fis the probability of failure, F_R(s)is the cumulative distribution function of resistance (R), and f_s(s)is the probability density of load (S). However, in most cases, the distribution of loads and resistances are not independent and the probability of failure is defined via the following more general formula. P_f=\\\\int\\\\int\\\\int_{G(X)} f_X(X)\\\\,dX \\\\qquad\\\\mathrm{(2)} where ùëã is the vector of the basic variables, and G(X) that is called is the limit state function could be a line, surface or volume that the integral is taken on its surface. == Solution approaches == === Analytical solutions === In some cases when load and resistance are explicitly expressed (such as equation (1) above), and their distributions are normal , the integral of equation (1) has a closed-form solution as follows. p_f=1-\\\\Phi(\\\\beta),\\\\beta=\\\\frac{\\\\mu_R-\\\\mu_S}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\sigma^2_R+\\\\sigma^2_S}} \\\\qquad\\\\mathrm{(3)} === Simulation === In most cases load and resistance are not normally distributed. Therefore, solving the integrals of equations (1) and (2) analytically is impossible. Using Monte Carlo simulation is an approach that could be used in such cases. == References == Category:Reliability analysis Category:Reliability engineering Category:Structural engineering ","title":"Structural reliability"},{"id":"60330192","text":"Parks M.

He later earned his Ph.D. from the University of University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1975, where his adviser was Lloyd Eastman. Coble became an assistant professor at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln in 1976 and has remained there ever since. His early academic work was concerned with the relationship between Chinese business elites and the KMT government during the Nanjing Decade. His first book, The Shanghai Capitalists and the Nationalist Government, 1927-1937, challenged earlier scholarship that had spoken of a close collaboration between the KMT government and business elites. After the book's publication in 1980, a second edition followed in 1986. Chinese translations followed in 1988 and 2015. Coble's later work dealt with Sino-Japanese relations, the fate of Chinese businesses under Japanese occupation and the history of Chinese war reporters in World War II. He held fellowships at Harvard University, the Institute for Advanced Studies, Princeton and the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.

First platted in 1879, the primarily residential area was annexed by Jacksonville in 1925. The Trout River, a tributary of the St. Johns River, is North Shore's most notable feature and also forms the neighborhood's northern border. ==Geography== Tallulah-North Shore is located on Jacksonville's Northside, along the banks of Trout River. The neighborhood's boundaries consist of Trout River on the northern edge, Moncrief Creek to the west, Main Street to the east, and CSX rail lines bordering the Brentwood neighborhood to the south. ==History== View of Trout River from Tallulah-North Shore Throughout most of the 1800s the area now considered Tallulah-North Shore consisted mainly of farms, lumberyards and naval stores operations. In 1879, anticipating residential growth in the region, a man by the name of Jeremiah Fallausbee platted an area he called Tallulah. The name \\"Tallulah\\" is an American Indian name meaning \\"leaping water.\\" The area would remain sparsely populated until housing needs increased in the wake of the Great Fire of 1901. In 1915, additional areas were platted under the name North Shore. The city annexed the entire area in 1925. ==Education== North Shore Elementary, operated by the Duval County Public Schools district, is the only public school in the neighborhood or North Shore. ==Economy== ===Commercial districts=== The corner of N. Pearl Street and Tallulah Avenue is the commercial area most associated with the Tallulah- North Shore neighborhood. Made up of a small agglomeration of buildings, the area houses a meat market, a seafood market and local restaurants. Currently the home of Miller's Soulfood Kitchen, the intersection's most striking building was designed by local architect Taylor Hardwick as a milk house for the Skinner's Dairy company. The neighborhood's eastern border is made up exclusively of commercial development paralleling Main Street (US 17). On its southwestern edge, North Shore is also proximal to commercial areas along Norwood Avenue, including the Gateway Town Center, a 700,000 square feet shopping center housing a chain grocer and pharmacy. ==Transportation== ===Public transportation=== Tallulah-North Shore is served by several Jacksonville Transportation Authority (JTA) bus routes. These routes include the following: https://sharepoint.jtafla.com/sites/ROI/Pages/Main.aspx *1 North Main *12 Myrtle / Lem Turner *51 Edgewood *86 Northside *First Coast Flyer Green line (BRT) ==Features== ===North Shore Park=== North Shore Park is located along the Trout River at the northern terminus of Pearl Street. The park was included and named on the 1915 plat of North Shore. The city later expanded the park by acquiring adjacent properties in 1943 and 1944. The park contains picnic facilities, a boat landing, an asphalt walking trail and stone benches. A shoreline kayak launch was added to the park in 2018. ===Tallulah Park=== Tallulah Park is located on Tallulah Avenue at Vermillion Street. Land for the park was purchased by the city in 1935, and it was later expanded in 1949. The four-acre park contains many of the same facilities that it did in 1965. Facilities include lighted tennis courts, a baseball diamond and basketball courts. An attractive tree canopy surrounds the perimeter of the park. ===Signet Park=== Signet Park is located along the banks of Trout River. The park was included in the 1915 plat of North Shore but it was unnamed at that time. Though the tract may have been known as Trout Park for a time, it eventually became known as Signet Park, due in part to the name change of Silver Street to Signet Street, which is adjacent to the park. An additional parcel extending to the Trout River was later incorporated onto the northern end of the park. ===Rolliston Park=== Rolliston Park is located along the west side of a canal that leads into the Trout River. The developers of North Shore donated most of the land for the park to the city in 1940 and 1941. The city purchased the remainder from the developer in 1944. Known as Rolliston Street Park in 1969, the park's most striking feature is an elongated expanse of lawn, which is bordered by a tree-lined canal and the Trout River. ==See also== * Neighborhoods of Jacksonville * Architecture of Jacksonville ==References== Category:Neighborhoods in Jacksonville, Florida Category:Northside, Jacksonville ","title":"Tallulah-North Shore"},{"id":"60330511","text":"In algebra, specifically in the theory of commutative rings, a quasi-unmixed ring (also called a formally equidimensional ring in EGA) is a Noetherian ring A such that for each prime ideal p, the completion of the localization Ap is equidimensional, i.e. for each minimal prime ideal q in the completion \\\\widehat{A_p}, \\\\dim \\\\widehat{A_p}/q = \\\\dim A_p = the Krull dimension of Ap. ==Equivalent conditions== A Noetherian integral domain is quasi-unmixed if and only if it satisfies Nagata's altitude formula.

It stipulated that it is an offense to participate in a conspiracy to carry out a course of conduct that leads to an offense in another jurisdiction. It gave courts in England and Wales the authority to try conspiracies to commit offences abroad. The law also provided stricter punishment for being a member of a terror group. Parts of it were replaced by the Terrorism Act 2000 and the Proceeds of Crime Act passed in 2002. == Background == The Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act 1998 was adopted after the August 15, 1998 Real IRA bombing in Omagh, Northern Ireland. It followed statutes drafted in response to acts of terrorism such as the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporal Provisions) Act introduced following the 1974 Birmingham bombings. During the parliamentary debate, then Prime Minister Tony Blair said that the decision to include the offence to conspire in the UK offences to be committed abroad was made as part of the government's total commitment to defeating terrorism wherever it is plotted or executed. A related law called 1999 Criminal Justice Act was also passed in Ireland in response to the Omagh bombing. Several other laws combating terrorism were introduced afterward and a number of these replaced parts of the Criminal Justice Act. For instance, the terrorism provisions (sections 1-4) have been repealed and incorporated in the Terrorism Act 2000, leaving the conspiracy provisions (sections 5-7). The high number of terrorism-related statutes is attributed to the emergent legal activism in the UK, which is driven by the fear on the part of legislators of being blamed for inaction after the incidence of a terror event. There is also the public's increasing willingness to give up civil liberties in favor of counter- terrorism. == Offence == In the legislation, an act would constitute an offence to conspire to carry out an offence in another jurisdiction if: * the conduct would also amount to an offence in England and Wales; and * a party to the conspiracy or his agent does something in England or Wales in relation to it before its formation; or * a party became a party to the conspiracy in England or Wales; or * a party to the conspiracy did or omitted to do something in England or Wales in pursuance of the agreement. An offender accused of violating the Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act 1998 was charged contrary to s1(A) of the Criminal Law Act of 1977. Section 8 of the Act required the Secretary of State to report before the Parliament the working of the statute at least once every year. This particular provision was abolished in 2002 based on a recommendation that the annual review did not contribute any real value to the scrutiny through the judicial process of the working of the Act. == Criticism == There were critics who argued that the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act were obscurely worded and were hastily introduced in response to the Omagh bombing incident as well as the terrorist activities in Dar es Salaam and Kenya, which transpired prior to the law's passage. In a briefing, the Belfast-based Committee on the Administration of Justice (CAJ) stated that the legislation was not only draconian but it also violated the UK's human rights obligations under international law. == References == Category:United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 1998 Category:Terrorism laws in the United Kingdom ","title":"Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act 1998"},{"id":"60330620","text":"St√©phane Imbach (born in Lausanne), performing as Madwave, is a Swiss trance DJ and producer. == Career == St√©phane Imbach's interest in music began in the early 1990s, when he came into contact with trance and rave.

It was Australia's third tour of New Zealand, after tours in 1877-78 and 1880-81, and the shortest of the three. The Australians played five matches against provincial teams, four of which fielded 22 players (the other team, Canterbury, fielded 18) with the aim of providing more evenly- matched contests. As the matches were not 11-a-side they are not considered to have been first-class. The Australians won two of the matches and drew the other three. ==The Australian team== The Australians were returning from their 1886 tour of England, apart from George Bonnor and Tup Scott, who had remained in England. The 11 remaining players toured New Zealand, with the addition of Jim Phillips. Several of them were carrying injuries, and most of them were fatigued. * Jack Blackham (captain) * Tom Garrett (vice-captain) * William Bruce * Edwin Evans * George Giffen * Affie Jarvis * Sammy Jones * John McIlwraith * Joey Palmer * Jim Phillips * Fred Spofforth * John Trumble Blackham and Spofforth had been on the previous two tours of New Zealand. Giffen was sick throughout the tour and unable to play at all. He umpired in the match against Hawke‚Äôs Bay. Blackham suffered a severe gash to his hand while batting against Canterbury, and was unable to play thereafter, so the Australians played with only 10 men for the last three matches, the local associations lending them substitute fieldsmen. Blackham umpired in the match against Auckland. ==The tour== Most of the Australians sailed from England on the Arawa, stopping only briefly in Hobart, where Phillips joined them, on the way to Port Chalmers. Spofforth and Garrett arrived on a slightly later ship, missing the first day of the Otago match. * Otago v Australians, Carisbrook, Dunedin, 22, 23, 24 November 1886. Otago XXII 63 and 158; Australians 60 and 162 for 4. Australians won by six wickets. Evans took 16 for 25 and 10 for 37, for match figures of 96.1‚Äì58‚Äì62‚Äì26 (four-ball overs). Trumble top-scored in each innings with 30 and 52. The Australians were dismissed at stumps on the first day, when Spofforth and Garrett had not yet arrived in Dunedin, so they batted only nine men in their first innings. Otago's top-scorer was Andrew Grieve, who made 33 in the second innings. The Australians considered Charlie Frith, who took 4 for 33 in their first innings, \\"the most troublesome bowler\\" they faced on this tour. * Canterbury v Australians, Lancaster Park, Christchurch, 26, 27, 29 November 1886. Canterbury XVIII 178 and 139; Australians 99 and 82 for 5. Drawn. The Australians, who had lost to Canterbury in 1877-78, again struggled. They found the bowling of David Dunlop difficult to handle, as he bowled his leg-breaks cleverly into a strong wind and took 5 for 50 and 3 for 17. Two Canterbury batsmen, the captain William Millton in the first innings and Edward Barnes in the second, scored 35, but the highest Australian innings was 32 by Blackham in the first innings. In the second innings a ball from Frederick Wilding struck Blackham on the first finger of his left hand, opening a gash an inch and a half long and putting him out of action for the rest of the tour. * Wellington v Australians, Basin Reserve, Wellington, 1, 2, 3 December 1886. Wellington XXII 182 and 41 for 4; Australians 475. Drawn. The Australians' total of 475 set a record for the highest total in any match in New Zealand. It occupied 323.2 four-ball overs. Jones (159 in five and a half hours) and Palmer (76) put on 202 for the first wicket. * Hawke's Bay v Australians, Napier Recreation Ground, Napier, 4 December 1886. Australians 115; Hawke's Bay XXII 92. Australians won by 23 runs. Palmer took 15 for 47 off 27 four-ball overs, bowling unchanged through the Hawke's Bay innings. Garrett, with 31, was the only batsman on either side to reach 20. For Hawke's Bay, Charles Edwards took 6 for 39. * Auckland v Australians, Auckland Domain, Auckland, 6, 7, 8 December 1886. Australians 104 and 225; Auckland XXII 114 and 44 for 15. Drawn. The Auckland batsman Dan Lynch, who had bowled so effectively against the Australians on their previous two tours, scored 46 in Auckland's first innings. It was the highest score by any New Zealand batsman against the Australians on their first three tours of New Zealand. After taking figures of 57‚Äì32‚Äì41‚Äì12 in Auckland's first innings, Palmer made 72 in Australia's second innings, which lasted 212 overs; the Auckland bowler Edward Mills had figures of 59‚Äì32‚Äì53‚Äì7. An extra day was added, but the slowness of the match prevented a result: off 462.3 four-ball overs only 487 runs were scored. The Australians sailed for Sydney on the Mararoa shortly after seven o'clock at the end of the third day's play. ==References== ==External links== * Australia in New Zealand 1886-87 at CricketArchive * \\"Melbourne Club Australian Team in New Zealand\\" in Cricket magazine, 27 January 1887 Category:1886 in Australian cricket Category:1886 in New Zealand cricket 1886 Category:International cricket competitions from 1844 to 1888 Category:New Zealand cricket seasons from 1863‚Äì64 to 1889‚Äì90 ","title":"Australian cricket team in New Zealand in 1886‚Äì87"},{"id":"60330728","text":"The United States recognized the Golan Heights as part of Israel through a presidential proclamation signed by U.S. president Donald Trump on March 25, 2019. The directive made the United States the first country, other than Israel, to recognize Israeli rather than Syrian sovereignty over the Golan Heights region. The Golan Heights are widely viewed as Syrian territory under Israeli military occupation. The proclamation was seen as a political gift from Trump to help Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's bid in the legislative election to be held two weeks after the recognition. The proclamation was criticized by those who had previously been critical of Israel's recognition, with Syria calling it a \\"blatant attack\\" on its sovereignty and territorial integrity. ==Background== right Israel captured Golan from Syria in the 1967 Six-Day War and formally annexed it with the Golan Heights Law in 1981, in a move that was not internationally recognized. The international community has condemned the capture and annexation as an illegal military occupation by Israel.* \\"The international community maintains that the Israeli decision to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration in the occupied Syrian Golan is null and void and without international legal effect.\\" * In 2008, a plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly voted by 161‚Äì1 in favour of a motion on the \\"occupied Syrian Golan\\" that reaffirmed support for UN Resolution 497.

In December 2017, Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and moved the U.S. embassy to the city, despite the international community viewing East Jerusalem as under Israeli military occupation. ==Announcement== On March 21, 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that it was \\"time for the United States to fully recognize Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights.\\" The move was welcomed by Israel. Dozens of people from the Druze community in the Golan Heights protested against Trump's announcement. Four days later, on 25 March 2019, in a joint press conference in Washington with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump signed a proclamation stating that \\"the United States recognizes that the Golan Heights are part of the State of Israel.\\" The proclamation was signed in the context of Trump accusing his political opponents of allegedly making \\"anti-Semitic\\" comments in prior weeks. Trump designed the proclamation signing and Netanyahu's visit to the United States just two weeks prior to the April 2019 Israeli legislative election as a boost to Netanyahu's bid. The proclamation is also expected to raise Trump's popularity amongst pro-Israel voters in the United States. ==Justification for the proclamation== ===American officials=== The proclamation cited \\"aggressive acts by Iran and terrorist groups, including Hizballah, in southern Syria\\" as justification for Israel to maintain sovereignty over the Golan Heights as Israel has a \\"need to protect itself from Syria and other regional threats.\\" In refuting a supposed double standard in recognizing Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights but placing sanctions on Russia for annexing Crimea in 2014, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said \\"What the President did with the Golan Heights is recognize the reality on the ground and the security situation necessary for the protection of the Israeli state. It‚Äôs that ‚Äî it‚Äôs that simple.\\" A State Department spokesperson claimed the day following the proclamation that \\"Israel gained control of the Golan through its legitimate response to Syrian aggression aimed at Israel‚Äôs destruction. Russia has occupied Crimea despite the fact that it has recognized Crimea as part of Ukraine in bilateral agreements and despite its international obligations and commitments, including core OSCE principles.‚Äù ===Israeli officials=== Netanyahu claimed at the press conference following the announcement that \\"Israel won the Golan Heights in a just war of self- defence,\\" referring to the 1967 war that began with Israel launching controversial pre-emptive strikes after Egypt, Jordan, and Syria began mobilizing troops towards the Israeli border. An anonymous Israeli official echoed Netanyahu's claims, telling The Washington Post that the recognition of the Golan Heights was justified since the occupied territory was gained in a \\"defensive war\\". ====Reaction to claims of \\"defensive war\\"==== The Electronic Intifada published an article were they stated: \\"Israel falsely argues that the 1967 war was ‚Äúdefensive,‚Äù despite the fact it began with an Israeli surprise attack on Egypt. In a 1976 interview, Israel‚Äôs defense minister at the time of the war, Moshe Dayan, admitted that Israel‚Äôs occupation of the Golan, as well as its provocations in the years preceding the war, were driven by a lust for the conquest of land.\\"https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/michael-f-brown/after-golan-are- trump-and-netanyahu-coming-west-bank-0 ==Reactions== The United Nations Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres said that \\"the status of Golan has not changed,\\" and the US's move resulted in condemnation, criticism or rejection from the European Union, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Belgium, Spain, Poland, South Africa, Turkey, Egypt, the Arab League, Russia, Ireland, Saudi Arabia, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, Jordan, Iraq, Iran, Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia, Somalia, Lebanon, Japan, Cuba, Venezuela, Indonesia, Canada, Pakistan, Sudan, Malaysia, Vietnam, and China. Syria called the move a \\"blatant attack\\" on its sovereignty and territorial integrity and maintained that it had a right to reclaim the territory. The state-owned news organization Syrian Arab News Agency reported that protests were held in several Syrian provinces against Trump‚Äôs declaration. Hezbollah's Hassan Nasrallah, whose group was mentioned as a threat to Israel in the proclamation, stated that \\"resistance, resistance, and resistance\\" was the only way to take back the Israeli-occupied territories. The move was praised by Israeli leaders across the political spectrum, including President Reuven Rivlin, Opposition Leader Shelly Yachimovich, Labor leader Avi Gabbay, Blue and White leader Benny Gantz, Speaker Yuli Edelstein, Kulanu leader Moshe Kahlon, and New Right co-leaders Naftali Bennett and Ayelet Shaked. == Aftermath == Unveiling of the sign to right On April 23, 2019, Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that he will bring a resolution for government approval to name a new community in the Golan Heights after Trump. On June 16, 2019, Israel announced the establishment of Trump Heights, a planned settlement in the Golan Heights. == See also == * United States recognition of Jerusalem as capital of Israel * Israel‚ÄìUnited States relations * Israel‚ÄìSyria relations * Syria‚ÄìUnited States relations == References == ==External links== *Proclamation on Recognizing the Golan Heights as Part of the State of Israel, full text of the proclamation Category:Golan Heights Category:2019 in international relations Category:2019 in Israel Category:2019 in Syria Category:2019 in American politics Category:2019 controversies Category:Israel‚ÄìUnited States relations Category:Israel‚ÄìSyria relations Category:Syria‚ÄìUnited States relations Category:Trump administration controversies Category:March 2019 events in Asia Category:March 2019 events in the United States ","title":"United States recognition of the Golan Heights as part of Israel"},{"id":"60330740","text":"was a Japanese architect.

The Paddestraat (English: Toad Street) is a 2.3 km long cobbled road in the municipality of Zottegem, in East Flanders, Belgium. The road is a regular location of the springtime cycling classics in Flanders. In 1995, the cobbled road of the Paddestraat was classified as a protected monument by the Flemish government. ==Characteristics== The road is situated entirely in Zottegem. The cobbled part starts at the bridge over the Zwalm, a small river at 18 m altitude, on the border between Zwalm and Zottegem. It runs northeasterly towards the Roman Square in Velzeke, a part of Zottegem, at 50 m altitude. Most altitude gain happens in the first 800 m, before flattening out in the latter 1.500 m, totalling ca. 2.350 m of cobbled surface. The road dates back to Roman times, when it was a part of the historic road from Boulogne-sur-Mer to Cologne. An archeological museum, the provincial archeological centre Velzeke (AVE), is situated at the northeasterly entrance of the Paddestraat. Some important archeological findings from Gallo-Roman culture, including the bronze Venus of Velzeke, were made at the site. The Dutch name of the road (English: Toad Street) is taken from the common toad, which are found in large number at the site near the river during mating season. ==Cycling== The site is best known from cycling, as it is a regular feature in the Tour of Flanders. The Paddestraat was first included in the course in 1973, and has been a fixed location in the both the men's and women's race, except for the 1988 event, when the road was under repair. The Paddestraat also features occasionally in Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, Dwars door Vlaanderen and the Tour of Belgium, as well as many junior and U-23 events. ==Gallery== File:Ronde van Vlaanderenroute 03.jpg File:Gesloten hoeve, Paddestraat, Velzeke-Ruddershove 01.jpg File:Hof de Moriaan Zottegem 05.jpg File:Paddestraat 01.jpg ==References== Category:Cobbled streets Category:Tour of Flanders Category:Mountains and hills of East Flanders ","title":"Paddestraat"},{"id":"60330790","text":"Pope Nicholas V Etsi ecclesia Christi is a papal bull issued by Pope Nicholas V on 30 September 1453 in response to the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire.Norman Housley, Crusading and the Ottoman Threat, 1453‚Äì1505 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), p. 18.

His mother, Anna, was from Lugano. His brother, Matthias (born 1707) also became a painter. After completing his secondary education in Graz, he took art lessons from a little known still-life painter named Matthias Vangus (fl. 1710s-20s). He moved to Vienna in 1726 and became a student of the court painter, Jacob van Schuppen, who had just become Director of the \\"Hofakademie der Maler, Bildhauer und Baukunst\\" (now the Academy of Fine Arts). A short time later, he continued his studies in Frankfurt with the Hungarian-born painter, . In 1736, he married Anna Maria Canton, daughter of the painter Franz Canton (1678-1733). He returned to Vienna around 1740. Soon after, his paintings began to rely more heavily on Dutch and French models; losing their previous originality. Later, He took over management of a genre painting class at the Academy and served as Rector from 1752 to 1754, when he resigned, following his wife's death. Many of his works are in private collections, although they may also be seen at the Universalmuseum Joanneum, the Belvedere, the Brukenthal National Museum and the collections of the National Gallery in Prague.

In 2020, the band signed to labels Polyvinyl Record Co. and Inertia Music, and released their third album Truth or Consequences, which featured the singles \\"Right Track / Wrong Man\\", \\"Cool For A Second\\", \\"Southwark\\", \\"Lonely After\\", and \\"Sage\\". == Career == === Early career: EP I and EP II (2014‚Äì2015) === Founded by Burgess, Ryder, and vocalist Kim Pflaum, the group began writing music using file sharing services when Burgess left New Zealand to work at New York-based record label Captured Tracks. The band's first release, EP I, debuted in early 2014, after the single A Long Walk Home For Parted Lovers appeared on several blogs before being quickly taken down. The band were positively reviewed by Pitchfork and profiled by The Guardian, leading to the group signing with Brooklyn-based record label Cascine. In mid-2014, the band began playing live, touring with singer Lorde, and collaborating with other acts, such as Swedish band Air France. Guitarist Sam Perry and vocalist Christie Simpson joined the group in 2015, while Pflaum left and started the solo project Madeira (later renamed Laumƒó). The band released a second EP, EP II, in early 2015, and proceeded to tour extensively throughout Europe, Asia, and North America, with the likes of Jamie xx and Lower Dens. === Yoncalla (2016) === The band quickly released their first full-length album, Yoncalla, the following year. As opposed to the long- distance writing of the band's earlier releases, Yoncalla consisted of material that had been finished during tours for EP II. The majority of the album's final material was recorded in Paris, France, following an American tour which stopped by the city of Yoncalla, Oregon. The band produced the album at electronic musician Philippe Zdar's Motorbass studio in Paris, enabling them to achieve a sound more akin to classic synth-pop than their previous records. === Willowbank (2017) === After a year of heavy touring in support of Yoncalla, the band travelled home to record in New Zealand for the first time. A limited edition cover of the Oasis album (What's The Story) Morning Glory? was distributed on vinyl in early 2017, before the release of the band's second album, Willowbank, in October. The sessions for Willowbank marked the first time that the group had worked together in a professional studio, with the band initially questioning whether they should \\"all move into separate rooms\\" to recreate the remote song writing process from previous records. However, the sessions allowed for stronger collaboration and more organic instrumentation compared to earlier material, leading to jazz musician Olivia Campion joining the band as a live drummer. Lead single Depths (Pt. I) became a success on streaming platforms, and was accompanied by a video created by illustrator Frances Haszard. Following the completion of touring for Willowbank, Perry left the band in order to concentrate on his Serbia- based musical project DOG Power. === EP III (2018) === In wake of the departure of Perry, the remaining four members of the band proceeded to return to the methods of long-distance writing that had inspired their earlier material. This process led to the creation of a third EP, released in October 2018. A video for lead single In Camera was released in early 2019, directed by Pavel Brenner. A video for second single Crush (It's Late, Just Stay) was also released in 2019, directed by Robbie Barnett. ===Truth or Consequences (2020) === After signing to Polyvinyl and Inertia Records, Yumi Zouma released their third studio album Truth or Consequences on March 13th of 2020. The album features the singles \\"Right Track / Wrong Man\\", \\"Cool For A Second\\", \\"Southwark\\", \\"Lonely After\\", and \\"Sage\\".Truth or Consequences, by Yumi Zouma Along with the album, Yumi Zouma is set to release a unique line of merchandise which includes a candle, bandana, and enamel pin. The band announced a reimagined edition of the album named Truth or Consequences - Alternate Versions, which will be released in October 2020. == Band members == ===Current=== * Christie Simpson ‚Äì lead vocals, samplers, keyboards (2015‚Äìpresent) * Josh Burgess - vocals, guitar, bass guitar, keyboards, synthesizers, drum programming, samplers (2014‚Äìpresent) * Charlie Ryder - guitar, bass guitar, keyboards, synthesizers, drum programming, samplers (2014‚Äìpresent) * Olivia Campion - drums (2017‚Äìpresent) ===Previous=== * Sam Perry - vocals, guitar, bass guitar, keyboards, synthesizers, drum programming, samplers (2015‚Äì2018) * Kim Pflaum ‚Äì vocals, guitar, samplers (2014-2015) == Musical equipment == ===Live concert equipment=== * Fender Telecaster guitars * Fender Bronco bass guitar * Waldorf Blofeld sampling synthesizer * Roland SP-404 samplers * Neunaber Wet Reverb guitar pedals * Malekko Analog Chorus guitar pedals * Roland Jazz Chorus guitar amplifiers ===Studio recording equipment=== For studio recordings, the band use their live equipment, a Sequential Prophet 600 synthesizer, and an Apogee Electronics Duet recording interface. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== * Yoncalla (2016) * (What's The Story) Morning Glory?

But soon after her birth, she, an older sister, Lydia Moore Clowes, and parents, William Jones Clowes and Elizabeth Ann Hart Clowes, relocated to near Monticello, New York so her father could attempt to capitalize on land claims in the Minisink Patent. Clowes was two years old when her mother died in 1840. The land claims were not being turned into any economically viable enterprise. By 1851, Clowes' older sister was being raised by a maternal aunt in Virginia. Caroline, herself, was raised by her maternal uncle, Benjamin Hall Hart and his wife, Elizabeth Nichols Hart, in LaGrange, Dutchess County, New York. ==Early work and education== Clowes was involved in the arts by age 16 when her drawings were exhibited in Poughkeepsie. She attended the Poughkeepsie Female Academy and studied under the noted Hudson River School painter, Frederick Rondel, when he took up residence in Poughkeepsie between 1863 and 1868 under commission to Matthew Vassar. ==Exhibition of work== Clowes' profile was raised dramatically after the end of the Civil War. She was exhibiting at the National Academy of Design by 1865 and for well over a decade subsequently, while exhibiting in other major cities. In 1872 in New York her work, \\"An Alarm,\\" was exhibited at the National Academy of Design. In 1876 in Philadelphia her work, \\"Cattle at the Brook,\\" was exhibited at the United States International Exhibition. In 1879 in London, three works, Spring, Autumn and Mountain Ash were exhibited at Royal Albert Hall of Arts and Sciences. In 1879 at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. ==Gallery== File:Two Cows at the Wappinger Creek 1882.jpgTwo Cows at the Wappinger Creek, by C. M. Clowes, 1882. Typical subject and style.

NATO ordered Spain to place a patrol on the pass, the only road supplying Qal'eh-ye and Herat after numerous attacks on military convoys throughout the summer and after the collapse of the Taliban's control on the area. Taliban mullah, Jamuladdin Mansoor, allied with Tajik tribals on both sides of the road tried to prevent passage with help from Ishan Khan. The Spanish forces took control of the road on Monday of July 31st. The insurgents reorganized themselves, starting the first battle on the 3rd of September, resulting in an injured Spanish soldier. The next day, a convoy of 30 vehicles and 100 Spaniards oversaw the meeting between another convoy and the Afghan police for protection, but it was ambushed from four points in a planned operation. The troops retaliated, calling in aerial support. Two Italian helicopters were brought, but refused aerial bombardment due to the proximity to a civilian population. After six hours of fighting, the Taliban and their allies withdrew to the village of Marghozar. One soldier from the Spanish contingency was injured, and two vehicles were rendered unusable. 13 insurgents had been killed, and 3 were injured. == References == Category:Military operations of the War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent) Category:History of Badghis Province Category:2009 in Spain Category:Conflicts in 2009 Category:2009 in Afghanistan Category:Taliban attacks Category:Afghanistan conflict (1978‚Äìpresent) Category:Battles involving Spain Category:Battles involving Italy ","title":"Battle of Sabzak"},{"id":"60331569","text":"Loney Dear is a self-titled sixth studio album by Swedish singer-songwriter Loney, Dear.

It was administered by Studio D and was in both French and English. Its creation was an attempt to address the ‚Äúswelling demand for women-centered films and filmmaking opportunities‚Äù, as many female freelancers were becoming increasingly frustrated with the dozen staff members employed by Studio D who had the privilege of permanent positions. In 1987, the program was revived by executive producer Rina Fraticelli and was charged with ‚Äúproducing shorter, basic information films dealing with issues of immediate concern to Canadian women, including domestic violence, reproductive choice, career choice, health care, and aging‚Äù. A goal of the program was to direct more of Studio D's funds towards creative endeavours instead of being limited by distribution and other logistical details. The FWFP was associated with Studio D, but not part of its formal budgetary structure. Studio D provided leadership and personnel in developing FWFP, as well as sharing its physical space with the program. The NFB matched funds provided by other federal departments to produce films related to women's issues. Some were internal training films, while others were related to important messages of each department's own goals.:The Federal Women‚Äôs Film Program. (1993).

Other FWFP films have discussed nontraditional employment for women, employment for Indigenous women, and employment for disabled women. In 1986, the FWFP funded a film training project through Studio D, extending its mandate to provide training for women filmmakers. == Themes == Themes covered by the FWFP productions are vast and varied, though the program's mandate was to ensure the production of timely films that reflected women's perspectives on current issues facing women and society. Some of the films focussed on issues faced by young people as they assumed increasingly adult responsibilities. Issues explored included representation of women in the fields of math and science, the effects of violence in media on young consumers, and the challenges of unemployment. These documentaries were recommended for secondary school students and were accompanied by interactive guides for classroom participation. Other themes of FWFP productions included domestic abuse and services available to victims and tributes to Indigenous women. == Filmography== === Stand-alone films === *Attention: Women at Work!, 1983.

It extends for a length of and drops in height from its source in the mountains of Girringun National Park to its mouth on the Queensland coast. It is named after John Murray, who was an officer in the paramilitary Native Police force. British colonists initially named it the Macalister River in 1865, but its appellation was later changed to the Murray River. The Murray Falls is a popular tourist destination in the upper reaches of the river. The first British surveyors in the area found that the central parts of the river were surrounded by open grassed plains instead of the thick tropical rainforest which was typical of the lowlands in the region. This facilitated the relatively straightforward cultivation of sugar crops in the area, the rich soil being available without having to clear any forest. These plains, which were called the Murray or Bellenden Plains, became the first area of Far North Queensland in which sugarcane was introduced and grown as a cash crop. In 1866, capitalist agriculturalist John Ewen Davidson was the first colonist to plant sugar on these plains located around the Murray River. ==References== Category:Rivers of Queensland ","title":"Murray River (Queensland)"},{"id":"60331862","text":"Nahuel () is a male given name of Mapuche origin, nawel meaning jaguar.

It was most likely built in the early 1760s by Abraham Salle (c.1732-c.1800), a descendant of Huguenot refugees fleeing persecution in France. Salle's grandfather, also named Abraham (1670-1719), was the immigrant ancestor for most of the Huguenot Salles living in Colonial Virginia. Abraham Salle (the younger) had \\"assembled the original 1,500 acre tract between 1760 to 1763\\" from various parcels of land primarily owned by his uncles William and Robert Wooldridge. The Wooldridge's had inherited the land from their father, John \\"Blacksmith\\" Wooldridge (c.1678-1757), himself the immigrant ancestor of all Wooldridges living in the American South. Abraham sold it to Thomas Mann Randolph in 1777. Randolph used the plantation house as a hunting lodge. His main plantation Tuckahoe was just north of Salisbury, across the James River. The famed American patriot and statesman, Patrick Henry, rented the house during two of his terms as governor of Virginia from 1784 to 1786 because the governor's residence in Richmond used at the time of his tenure was not large enough to accommodate Henry's family. Eventually Salisbury was sold to Dr. Philip Turpin, a graduate of the University of Edinburgh. Upon Turpin's death at Salisbury, the plantation passed to his daughter and son-in-law, Caroline and Dr. Edward Johnson. Their son was Confederate Major General Edward Johnson who participated in the Civil War. After the conflict, Edward Johnson returned to Salisbury (which he had inherited in 1843) to farm along with his brother, Philip Turpin Johnson. The two brothers died at Salisbury in 1873 and 1882, respectively. In 1882, Salisbury, along with the rest of the estate of Philip T. Johnson, passed to Dr. Joseph W. Johnson, a druggist in Richmond. Dr. Johnson likely leased the land to the Salisbury coal company but in November 1905, he offered it for sale. In December 1905, the Salisbury estate was sold to H. D. Eichelberger (who represented the Ginter estate, owner of all of the former Clover Hill mining lands) for $25,000. Later, in 1906, Salisbury and its 1,585 acre property were sold to George Arents and Thomas F. Jefress. The two men were tobacco executives and entrepreneurs. Furthermore, Arents was the nephew of the affluent Richmond businessman, Lewis Ginter; while Jeffress built the Meadowbrook mansion in 1918 in southern Chesterfield which was said to have been the largest house ever built in Chesterfield County (Unfortunately, it burned down in 1967 and is now the site of Meadowbrook Country Club). In 1923, the over 150-year-old house burned down. It was sold by Richmond attorney James Marshall Turner to the Salisbury Corporation in June 1956 for $110,000 and was noted as \\"the largest individually owned tract located close to any major city in the East.\\" This company built the subdivision of Salisbury starting in 1958. In the current day, the clubhouse of the Salisbury Country Club (established 1963) is located near where the Salisbury Plantation main house once stood and its central section was built to resemble the original Salisbury. ==References== Category:Plantations in Virginia ","title":"Salisbury (Chesterfield County, Virginia)"},{"id":"60331884","text":"Yaksatovo () is a rural locality (a selo) and the administrative center of Yaksatovsky Selsoviet, Privolzhsky District, Astrakhan Oblast, Russia.

His work investigates analog and digital technologies to explore ancestry, authenticity, and the relationship between African culture and African-American culture. ==Life and work== Harrison was born in Detroit, Michigan, where he currently lives and works. After earning a BFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 2012, Harrison worked at Ford Motor Company prototyping clay models for cars and car parts. His past work with machinery and industrial design continues to inform and inspire his artistic process today. In his work, Harrison explores issues of race, design, mortality and industry by making use of various technologies. Inspired by the notion of an ‚Äúabstract ancestry,‚Äù Harrison focuses on collecting relics and symbols of African American culture that can be re-contextualized or re- simulated. Bodies of Work In his \\"Dark Silhouettes\\" series, Harrison ‚Äúencapsulates‚Äù dissections of African tribal sculptures in subtly tinted resin blocks. Some of the figures, heads and masks come from Makonde and Dogon tribes while others are of unknown origin. Harrison then slices through or burrows holes, with a CNC router, into some of the blocks producing unique forms and evoking diverse places and times. In his ‚ÄúDark Povera‚Äù series, Harrison scans African artifacts and then reproduces them with his homemade low-resolution 3D printers. In contrast to most 3D printers, which print with silicone and other strong synthetic plastics, Harrison‚Äôs hand-made printers utilize a wet clay, creating a finished product that is an imperfect, abstracted reproduction of the original artifact. == Exhibitions == Solo exhibitions * Detroit City/Detroit Affinities, curated by Jens Hoffmann, MOCAD, Detroit, MI, 2016 * Dark Povera Part 1, Atlanta Contemporary, Atlanta, GA, 2017 * Post Truth / The Lie That Tells the Truth, Culture Lab, Detroit, MI, 2017 * 'Prototype of Dark Silhouettes, Jessica Silverman Gallery, San Francisco, CA, 2018 * 'Abstract Ancestry: Machine Works on Paper, University of Michigan Institute for the Humanities, Ann Arbor, MI, 2018 * Field Station: Matthew Angelo Harrison, Broad Museum, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, 2018 Group exhibitions * Ever get the feeling we‚Äôre not alone in this world?, What Pipeline, Detroit, MI, 2016 * The Politics of Portraiture, Jessica Silverman Gallery, San Francisco, CA, 2016 * Take Me (I‚Äôm Yours), curated by Hans Ulrich Obrist, Jens Hoffmann and Kelly Taxter, Jewish Museum, New York, NY, 2016 * Eric Schmid is an Idiot, curated by What Pipeline, CAVE Detroit, MI, 2017 * Sonic Rebellion: Music as Resistance, MOCAD, Detroit, MI, 2017 * Fictions, The Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, NY, 2017 * The Everywhere Studio, Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami, FL, 2017 * Songs for Sabotage, New Museum Triennial, New Museum, New York, NY, 2018 * At Large Part 2, Reyes Projects, Detroit, MI, 2018 * I Was Raised on the Internet, Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, Chicago, IL, 2018 * Kinship, Jessica Silverman Gallery, San Francisco, CA, 2018 * Uncanny Valley, De Young Museum, San Francisco, CA, 2019 * Landlord Colors: On Art, Economy, and Materiality, Cranbrook Museum, Bloomfield Hills, MI, 2019 * Colored People Time: Quotidian Pasts, Institute of Contemporary Art, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, 2019 == Public collections == * Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, IL * Broad Art Museum, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI * Galeries Lafayette Foundation - Fonds de dotation Famille Moulin, Paris * de Young Museum, San Francisco, CA * Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami, FL * Kadist, San Francisco/Paris * Rennie Collection, Vancouver, B.C. ==References== Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:21st- century American artists Category:African-American artists Category:Artists from Detroit Category:School of the Art Institute of Chicago alumni ","title":"Matthew Angelo Harrison"},{"id":"60331942","text":"Fran Morelli (January 15, 1939 ‚Äì September 10, 2008) was an American football tackle.

She was the Press Secretary to Jacqueline Kennedy. Turnure reportedly had an extramarital affair with 35th President of the United States John F. Kennedy. == Early life and education == Born in New York City, Turnure attended Georgetown University. == Career == Turnure worked for then-United States Senator John F. Kennedy as a receptionist and secretary in his Senate office from 1958 until his election in 1960. Turnure then was hired as the first Press Secretary to a First Lady in United States history, working under Jacqueline Kennedy. In her role as press secretary, Turnure was frequently present at diplomatic receptions and to receive foreign dignitaries. Turnure also helped to coordinate Ms. Kennedy's nationally televised White House tour and historical preservation efforts. Turnure was aboard Air Force One at Love Field Airport as Lyndon B. Johnson took the oath of office two hours and eight minutes after the assassination of John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas. Shortly after the assassination took place, Vice President Johnson kissed Turnure on the hand. After the assassination events and funeral, Turnure left for New York and worked on President Kennedy's administrative papers, a project that was funded by Aristotle Onassis. Turnure also served for a period as the manager of Mrs. Kennedy Onassis' private office and was present at her funeral. After working for the Kennedy family, Turnure was an interior designer in the Manhattan area. == Alleged affair with Kennedy == In The Dark Side of Camelot published in 1997, author Seymour Hersh alleged that Kennedy had an extramarital affair with Turnure in 1958 when she was working in his Senate office. In 1958, Turnure's landlady Florence Kater allegedly took a photograph of the senator leaving Turnure's apartment building in the middle of the night, a photograph that Kater tried repeatedly to bring to public attention to ruin the senator's presidential campaign, according to Hersh. Kater and her husband allegedly rigged a tape recorder to pick up sounds of the couple's lovemaking and made an enlargement of their picture of Kennedy as he exited the building. The credibility of The Dark Side of Camelot was called into question immediately after its 1997 publication.\\"Hersh's History\\", Barbara Comstock, National Review, May 20, 2004 One of Hersh‚Äôs allegations in this book, that the Washington, DC newspaper known in 1960 as The Evening Star reported at the time what the Katers were trying to do, is patently false. \\"Hersh's History\\", Barbara Comstock, National Review, May 20, 2004 The entire output of the newspaper for 128 years has been digitized and can be searched by keyword and by date of publication.DC public library system introduction to Washington Star online archive Florence Kater and her husband allegedly sent their information about JFK‚Äôs adultery to various print media publishers. A company called Stearn Publications supposedly passed it along to J. Edgar Hoover. Soon after, Hoover \\"quietly obtained a copy of the compromising sex tapes and offered them to Lyndon Johnson as campaign ammunition.\\" Johnson \\"had been using all the information Hoover could find on Kennedy - during the campaign, even before the Convention. And Hoover was in on the pressure on Kennedy at the Convention.\\" A few days after Kennedy was extorted to offer Johnson the vice presidency or be outed as a womanizer, Pierre Salinger, Kennedy's campaign's press secretary, had asked Kennedy whether he really expected Johnson to accept the offer or if he was merely making a polite gesture. Kennedy responded cryptically: \\"The whole story will never be known. And it's just as well that it won't be.\\" Seymour M. Hersh, The Dark Side of Camelot, 1997, Chapter 12 == Personal life == Turnure was the daughter of Louise Gwynn and Lawrence Turnure, a New York banker. Her stepfather was Frederic Drake, who was publisher of Harper's Bazaar and Vice President of Hearst Communications. Turnure previously dated Prince Aly Khan. Turnure was married to New York investment banker Robert N. Timmins and resided in Manhattan. Jacqueline Kennedy attended the wedding and threw a private reception for the couple at her Fifth Avenue apartment.

The house was constructed around 1911 after his purchase of the property and Kington resided here until the house was sold in 1925. His residence is the only home still standing in the Morton's Gap area associated with prominent coal mine operators of the early 20th century. Kington was born near Mortons Gap in 1861 and worked in the mines at an early age. In 1901, Kington established the Kington and Wolf Coal Company and in 1907 he formed the Kington Coal Company which operated extensive mines at Mortons Gap. This mine had production of 1,500 tons per day and employed 350 workers at the height of its operation. In 1920, he reorganized his business as the Kington Coal Mining Company and continued to operate area mines into the 1920s. In addition to his mining operations, Kington organized the Planters Bank of Mortons Gap in 1907 and was also president of the Mortons Gap Ice and Light Company.\\" ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hopkins County, Kentucky Category:Italianate architecture in Kentucky Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1911 ","title":"W.W.

It describes a specification on top of the USB standard, with a particular focus on supporting high-performance cameras based on USB 3.0. It is recognized as one of the fastest growing machine vision camera standards. As of October 2019, version 1.1 is the latest version of the standard. The standard is hosted by the AIA and developing a product implementing this standard must pass compliance tests and be licensed. As of late 2019, there are 42 companies that license this standard. The standard itself for reference or evaluation may be requested free of charge. The standard is built upon many of the same pieces as GigE Vision, being based on GenICam, but utilizes USB ports instead of Ethernet. Some of the benefits of this standard include simple plug and play usability, power over the cable, and high bandwidth. Additionally, it defines locking connectors that modify the standard USB connectors with additional screw-locks for industrial purposes. == Technology == The standard covers four major areas: * Device Detection * Register Access * Streaming Data * Event Handling The standard defines a specific USB Class ID (Class 0xEF, Subclass 0x05) for identifying the device. As the standard is defined at a protocol layer, the software vendor providing the driver may be a different entity than the company designing the camera. Register Access includes mandatory USB3 vision registers as well as camera specific registers which may control parameters such as shutter speed or integration time, gamma correction, white balance, etc. The later register types are diverse across cameras. The camera specific registers can be queried via a XML schema file which is part of the GenICam standard. The GenICam standard has a Standard Feature Naming Convention so that vendor agnostic software can be created. The GenICam standard is independent of the transfer protocol. This standard and GigE Vision are examples of wire protocols which pair with the GenICam standard. This contrasts with Camera Serial Interface; the Camera Command Set (CCS) is part of that standard for controlling camera parameters. For many real devices, the vendors provide alternate methods such as I2C to access the full set of parameters that a specific device may support. These can include lighting synchronization and separate motor controls for optical focusing elements. == Implementations == * A complete list of companies offering products complying with this standard is available here: Companies that license USB3 Vision * Open Source implementations: ** Linux kernel driver (NOTE: Basic register access and image streaming only. Significant application logic outside of this kernel module is needed to incorporate GenICam and be fully compatible with the USB3 Vision specification) ** Aravis uses libusb to implement the USB3 Vision protocol. Supports GenICam interface for register introspection. ** Basler Linux kernel modifications - Allows Usb3 zero copy streaming. ** Linux 4.9+ zero copy usbfs is supported by newer versions of libusb. == References == Category:Cameras ","title":"USB3 Vision"},{"id":"60332589","text":"Pody () is a rural locality (a selo) in Chernoyarsky District, Astrakhan Oblast, Russia.

In 1955, she began to study classical ballet, and entered the Ohno Kazuo Dance Institute in 1962. Unlike her mentor and long-time collaborator Hijikata Tatsumi, Nakajima toured extensively outside of Japan and so became not only one of the first female butoh dancers but also one of the first, along with Ohno Kazuo, to introduce the form to audiences outside of Japan. She directed and choreographed the second-generation butoh dance group Muteki-sha. She has appeared in films as well as theater productions, including Adachi Masao's 1969 film Sexual Play and the 1990 documentary Butoh: Body on the Edge of Crisis.https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0620048/ == Dance philosophy == Nakajima, like most butoh choreographers, resists literal interpretations or expressions of the dance's gestures.

the Urban and Social History of the region, in particular that of Iran. An associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, he is the author of several articles and books about Iran's contemporary society and modern history, including Minorities in Iran and the recently published volume in Danish, Irans moderne historie. A fluent speaker of Persian and English, he is a frequent commentator on Danish, English, and international Persian media on matters relating to Iran, Iranian politics, and Danish-Iranian Relations. Rasmus has been criticized a lot on twitter and other social platforms for being a apologist of the islamic Republic of Iran government. == Education == Elling earned both his MA and PhD from the University of Copenhagen, in 2004 and 2010 respectively. He spent time as a researcher at the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies at Columbia University, as well as a postdoctoral researcher at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (SOAS). Spending time as a researcher in Iran also brought him an intimate knowledge of Persian, allowing him a close access to the country and its culture. == Career and scholarship== From 2012 to 2016, Elling was an assistant professor of Iranian Studies at the University of Copenhagen, and since 2016 he has been promoted to the position of the associate professor at the Department for Cross-Cultural and Regional Studies (TORS) in the same university. Elling's research focuses on the social, political, and cultural life of cities, as is most evident from his work on the oil city of Abadan in Southern Iran, where he has conducted most of his ethnographic research. His research is concerned with urban sociology, spatial politics and radical theories of the city. Apart from teaching general courses in Middle Eastern history, Elling is the convener of Global Urban Studies ‚Äì a new Master's Elective at TORS, which among other things encompasses international summer schools on ‚ÄòUrban Culture in Theory and Action‚Äô and ‚ÄòNew Urban Life Across the Globe: Activism and Change in a World of Cities‚Äô. == Projects and publications == Elling is the creator of the Wiki project, Abadan: Retold which is the an attempt to document the history of Abadan, Iran, a Twentieth century oil city. The project includes articles, visual representations, and personal memoirs in order to recreate and preserve the social history of Abadan which has been an important part of Iranian modernity. Based on his dissertation, Elling's book, Minorities in Iran, was concerned with the sensitive question of minorities, ethnicity and nationalism in Iran after the Iranian Revolution of 1979. It is the first comprehensive discussion of this topic in English, addressing the subjects of minority rights, identity claims, and their interaction within the modern nation-state of Iran. His most recent book, Irans Moderne Historie, is the first history of modern Iran written in Danish and deals with the history of 20th century Iran and its struggles with nationalism, modernisation, and international affairs. It is to be released in April 2019 by the Danish publisher, Gyldendal. As a participant in international projects involving Middle Eastern urban history, Elling is also the author of many articles published in academic and popular journals addressing issues of modern social history of Iranian cities. == Selected publications == === Books === * Minorities in Iran: Nationalism and Ethnicity after Khomeini (Palgrave Macmillan, 2013) * Irans Moderne Historie (Gyldendal, 2019) === Selected articles === * State of Mind, State of Order: Reactions to Ethnic Unrest in the Islamic Republic of Iran * On Lines and Fences: Labour, Community, and Violence in and Oil City * Tribal hands and minority votes: ethnicity, regionalism and elections in Iran == Links == * Abdan: Retold * RasmusElling.com * Academic Page at the University of Copenhagen == References == Category:Living people Category:1978 births Category:Danish historians Category:Historians of Iran Category:Historians of the Middle East Category:University of Copenhagen faculty ","title":"Rasmus Christian Elling"},{"id":"60332850","text":"The 2018‚Äì19 CESAFI season was the 18th season of the Cebu Schools Athletic Foundation, Inc., the preeminent inter-scholastic sports competition in Cebu.

Later that year he published his report as a 16-page pamphlet titled \\"Anti-semitic Onslaught in Germany as Seen from Leipzig.\\" A five-page excerpt from that publication was published in the Nuremberg Trial documents in 1946, with further excerpts from that selection quoted in numerous primary source collections on German history since 1974. ==Personal life== According to his entry in the 1941 Register of the Department of State,Register of the Department of State (1941). Washington: Government Printing Office. Buffum was born in Dorchester, Massachusetts in 1895. He attended Phillips Exeter Academy, then Yale University from 1914 to 1917, after which he served in the U.S. Army for two years. He was a newspaper reporter from 1919 to 1923, then an appointment clerk in the U.S. consulate in the Free City of Danzig. He was then appointed as vice consul in Livorno, Italy (then known in English as Leghorn) from 1928 and Palermo, Sicily from 1929. On November 22, 1934, he was stationed at Leipzig, where he was promoted to consul on October 1, 1935. In April 1940 he was relocated to Trieste, from where he was recalled to the United States on January 25, 1941. He died in Baltimore shortly thereafter on May 9, 1941, aged 45. ==Kristallnacht testimony== A five-page excerpt from Buffum's self-published 16-page report about the events of Kristallnacht in Leipzig was published in 1946 in vol. VII of the Nuremberg Trial documents, Nuremburg International Military Trials: Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression. A student researcher found that portions of that excerpt were later republished in all three editions of the widely used primary source collection by Jeremy Noakes and Geoffrey Pridham, Nazism 1919-1945 in 1974, 1984 and 2000.(Exeter: University of Exeter Press, 1984), vol.

The Heilprin Glacier, flowing from the Greenland Ice Sheet in the east, is the largest glacier that has its terminus in the fjord. The Tracy Glacier has its terminus further north near Josephine Peary Island in a bay at the northern side of the head of the fjord where the smaller Hart Glacier, Sharp Glacier, Melville Glacier, and Farquhar Glacier have their terminus. As they discharge into the fjord all these glaciers are separated by nunataks, the largest of which is the Smithson Range.GoogleEarth In the central area of the fjord the Hubbard Glacier discharges on the northern shore and the Hurlbut Glacier on the southern shore. The islands of Qeqertarsuaq (Herbert Island) and Kiatak (Northumberland Island) lie off the fjord's mouth. They are aligned from east to west, dividing the outer gulf into two sounds, the Murchison Sound to the north beyond Cape Ackland, and the Hvalsund to the south, west of Kangeq. { - valign=\\"top\\" Map of Northwestern Greenland 19th century map of the Inglefield Gulf. } ==See also== *List of fjords of Greenland ==References== ==External links== * *Greenland Climate Research Centre takes the temperature at Inglefield Bredning Category:Fjords of Greenland Category:Inglefield family ","title":"Inglefield Gulf"},{"id":"60333250","text":"James Standish Clegg (born 1933) is a Professor Emeritus of Biochemistry at University of California, Davis, based at the Coastal and Marine Sciences Institute (CMSI) in Bodega Bay, California.

Despite having gone through hardship, he soon became a director of the branch at the age of 33, the youngest director in the company, and demonstrated the highest result out of 1,000 branches. He recognized how important it is to trust and support each of the colleague's capability when managing a team, an organization, and this teamwork has become one of Mirae Asset Financial Group's core value. The vision of the branch has been ‚Äúgo forward in order to spin the pinwheel although there are no winds‚Äù, and this is how Park could have had overcome hardship at his first experience of being a head of a branch.

It originates from the city of Lucban, Quezon. It is celebrated annually in the Pahiyas Festival. It can be eaten grilled or fried and can be dipped in sugar, vinegar, or other sauces. ==Etymology== The name kiping is an alternate form of kinipi, meaning \\"pressed\\", from the verb kipi, \\"to press dough to squeeze out the water\\". ==Description== A vendor selling colorful fried kiping Kiping is characteristically leaf-shaped. It is made with molds made from real leaves of various plants that are non-toxic and do not have unusual tastes. The most commonly used are leaves from the kabal tree, Fagraea racemosa. Other plants used include coffee, talisay (Terminalia catappa), cacao, antipolo (Artocarpus blancoi), and saba banana. The rice paste is made from glutinous rice (usually older harvests) that have been soaked for a few hours before being ground into a paste. It is mixed with water, a little bit of coarse salt, and various food dyes. The paste is then spread on the chosen leaf molds and steamed for around half an hour. After steaming, the leaves are then air- dried in shade and peeled off. They are piled on top of each other and weighted down for half a day. They are then separated and dried again, then again compressed under a weight for another half day. They are traditionally hung on strings for storage. There is a traditional superstition that in order to prevent the kiping from cracking, silence must be observed during the entire preparation. Kiping is usually eaten grilled or fried. It can be dipped in sugar or vinegar or other kinds of dips. Kiping can also be used as decorations, especially during the Pahiyas Festival, where bundles of kiping are shaped into colorful chandeliers (called arangya), giant flowers, and other ornaments. These are used to decorate individual houses which are then judged by festival organizers. ==Similar dishes== Kiping is also another name for kabkab, a similar cassava-based wafer from other parts of the country. ==See also== *Aparon *Barquillos *Krupuk *Kropek ==References== Category:Philippine desserts Category:Rice dishes Category:Philippine rice dishes ","title":"Kiping"},{"id":"60333378","text":"Philadelphia Nina Robertson OBE (1866‚Äì1951), was an Australian Red Cross administrator. == Early life == Robertson was born on 27 February 1866 at Wangaratta, Victoria, Australia.

In the stories, only one member of the group usually survives the attack, usually a young girl. == Appearance == Stories about the Marukos often only describe the stern disembodied voice of an old man, telling off whatever group had earned his ire. In an 1887 account, however, the story speaks of an old man in a white \\"camisa\\" whose aged flesh looked like that of a corpse. == Stories == Stories of the Marukos are associated with crossings on many of the rivers of the Ilocos Region, with accounts associated with the Padsan, Nagbaduan, Amburayan, Agoo, and Bued Rivers. The earliest was an offhand account by Juan Francisco Maura in his ‚ÄúLa Relaci√≥n del suceso de la venida del tirano chino del gobernador Guido de Lavezares\\" where he notes that the natives living near Padsan and Nagbaduan lived in fear of a creature called the \\"Morrucos,\\" who caused entire groups of travellers to drown in floods.Maura, Juan Francisco. (1575) La Relaci√≥n del suceso de la venida del tirano chino del gobernador Guido de Lavezares. Another Spanish colonial legend recounted by Don Isabelo de los Reyesde los Reyes, Isabelo. (1887) Ilocandias. associates the name of the Marukos (spelled \\"manrukos\\" in the 1887 text) with the etymology of the Municipality of Rosario, La Union. In the legend, a group of youths were playing around and being noisy while loitering around near the floodplains of the Bued River between Rosario and Sison on a Sunday. They were then confronted by an old man in white garb, whose flesh looked like a corpse - the Marukos. The creature accused them of engaging in leisure activities on a holy day and put a curse on them, causing them to lose their sense of direction. As a result, they failed to notice that they were about to be swept away by one of the flash floods that often plagued the river. In the end, only a young girl survived the encounter with the Marukos, by clinging to a \\"Balingkawanay\\" (Pittosporum pentandrum) tree. According to the De Los Reyes, some stories claim that the girl had survived by praying the Rosary, while other stories say that her name was Rosario. Either way, the story of the Marukos became closlely associated with the etymology of the town of Rosario, which used to be part of Pangasinan. The legend is generally treated as a cautionary tale against raucousness and gallivanting on \\"the Lord's holy day\\" of Sunday.Demetrio, Francisco R., Ed. (1991) Encyclopedia of Philippine Folk Beliefs and Customs Volume II.

However, a disembodied voice which the girl claimed was a Marukos called out from the dark and told the soldiers to quickly report back to their barracks in town. The girl made it to her home all right, but the soldiers did not. The account quotes her as saying \\"The Marukos called the soldiers away and I never saw them again.\\" News accounts about the \\"Marrukos\\" from 1992 tell a tale almost identical to the 1976 account, but with the setting changed to the Amburayan River near Tagudin. Instead of the martial law curfew, the story referred to a curfew for minors that had been imposed on Tagudin at the time.Tagudin Community Update. (June‚ÄìJuly 1976) UCCP Magsaysay-Tagudin. Some scholars believe that the Amburayan story is merely a retelling of the 1976 story - revived because of social tensions regarding the new curfew and young people's protests against it.Sals, Florent Joseph (2005).

La Union: Limbagan Printhouse. p. 80. == Etymology == The exact history of the word \\"Marukos\\" is debated, but scholars generally agree that the name is probably linked to the ilocano word \\"agrikosrikos\\" (to go around in circles, to meander). Ilocano historians have also linked it to the words \\"parikot\\" (trouble or hardship) and \\"agparubbok\\" (to spring up). Some have also linked it to the Tagalog word \\"Maloko\\" (tricksy), and to \\"Moro\\", a reference to the Moro people who were feared among the Ilocanos in Colonial times. It was first referenced by Juan Francisco Maura in 1575, who spelled the word as \\"Morrucos\\". Later Spanish-era accounts used the word \\"Manrucos.\\" Modern accounts of the demon refer to it as Marukus or Marrukus, the variation in the spelling being largely a matter of contemporary Ilocano orthography. == See also == * Rosario, La Union * Padsan River * Amburayan River * Bued River * Ilocano people == References == Category:Demons Category:Ilocano culture Category:Legendary creatures ","title":"Marukos"},{"id":"60333389","text":"The UN September 1950 counteroffensive was a large-scale offensive by United Nations Command (UN) forces against North Korean forces commencing on 23 September 1950. Following the UN counterattack at Inchon on 15 September, on 16 September UN forces within the Pusan Perimeter broke out of the perimeter, driving back the North Koreans and moved north linking up with the UN forces coming from Inchon near Osan on 27 September. ==Background== By 23 September the Korean People's Army (KPA) was everywhere in retreat from the Pusan Perimeter. US Eighth Army, motorized and led by armored spearheads, was ready to sweep forward along the main axes of advance. On 22 September Eighth Army commander General Walton Walker issued his order for the pursuit. The Eighth Army order stated: Enemy resistance has deteriorated along the Eighth Army front permitting the assumption of a general offensive from present positions. In view of this situation it is mandatory that all efforts be directed toward the destruction of the enemy by effecting deep penetrations, fully exploiting enemy weaknesses, and through the conduct of enveloping or encircling maneuver get astride enemy lines of withdrawal to cut his attempted retreat and destroy him. The order directed a full-scale offensive: US I Corps was to continue to make the main effort along the Taegu-Kumch'on-Taejon-Suwon axis and to effect a linkup with X Corps coming from Inchon; the US 2nd Infantry Division was to launch an unlimited objective attack along the Hyopch'on-Koch'ang-Anui-Chonju- Kanggyong () axis; the 25th Infantry Division on the army's southern flank was to seize Chinju and be ready to attack west or northwest on army order; and the Republic of Korea Army (ROK) in the east was to destroy the KPA in its zone by deep penetrations and enveloping maneuvers. An important section of the Eighth Army order and a key to the contemplated operation stated, \\"Commanders will advance where necessary without regard to lateral security.\\" Later in the day, Eighth Army issued radio orders making IX Corps, under General John B. Coulter, operational at 14:00, 23 September and attaching the US 2nd and 25th Infantry Divisions to it. This order charged IX Corps with the responsibility of carrying out the missions previously assigned to the 2nd and 25th Divisions. In preparing for the pursuit, Eighth Army moved its headquarters from Pusan back to Taegu, reopening there at 14:00, 23 September. The UN forces around the Pusan Perimeter at this time numbered almost 160,000 men, of whom more than 76,000 were in Eighth Army and about 75,000 in the ROK. UN reinforcements had begun arriving in Korea by this time. On 19 September the Philippine 10th Infantry Battalion Combat Team began unloading at Pusan, and on 22 September the 65th Regimental Combat Team started unloading there. The next day Swedish Red Cross Field Hospital personnel arrived at Pusan. On the 19th, the Far East Command deactivated the Pusan Logistical Command and reconstituted it as the 2nd Logistical Command, its mission of logistical support unchanged. ==Offensive== ===The 25th Division crosses southwest Korea=== On 23 September General Coulter, in a meeting with General Walker at the 25th Division command post, requested authority to change the division's axis of attack from southwest to west and northwest. He thought this would permit better co-ordination with the 2nd Division to the north. Walker told Coulter he could alter the division boundaries within IX Corps so long as he did not change the Corps' boundaries. The change chiefly concerned the 27th Infantry Regiment which now had to move from the 25th Division's south flank to its north flank. 25th Division commander General William B. Kean formed a special task force under Capt. Charles J. Torman, commanding officer of the 25th Reconnaissance Company, which moved through the 27th Infantry on the southern coastal road at Paedun-ni () the evening of the 23rd. The 27th Regiment then began its move from there to the division's north flank at Chungam-ni () . The 27th Infantry was to establish a bridgehead across the Nam River and attack through Uiryong to Chinju. On the morning of 24 September Task Force Torman attacked along the coastal road toward Chinju. North of Sach'on the task force engaged and dispersed about 200 KPA soldiers of the 3rd Battalion, 104th Security Regiment. By evening it had seized the high ground at the road juncture south of Chinju. The next morning the task force moved up to the Nam River bridge which crossed into Chinju. In doing so one of the tanks hit a mine and fragments from the explosion seriously wounded Captain Torman, who had to be evacuated. Meanwhile, on the main inland road to Chinju the KPA 6th Division delayed the 35th Infantry Regiment at the Chinju pass until the evening of 23 September, when covering units withdrew. The next day the 35th Infantry consolidated its position at the pass. That night a patrol reported that KPA demolitions had rendered the highway bridge over the Nam at Chinju unusable. On the strength of this information the 35th Infantry made plans to cross the Nam downstream from the bridge. Under cover of darkness at 02:00, 25 September, the 2nd Battalion crossed the river southeast of Chinju. It then attacked and seized Chinju, supported by tank fire from Task Force Torman across the river. About 300 KPA troops, using mortar and artillery fire, served as a delaying force in defending the town. The 3rd and 1st Battalions crossed the river into Chinju in the afternoon, and that evening Task Force Torman crossed on an underwater sandbag ford that the 65th Engineer Combat Battalion built east of the damaged highway bridge. Working all night, the engineers repaired the highway bridge so that vehicular traffic began crossing it at noon the next day, 26 September. downstream from Chinju, near the blown bridges leading to Uiryong, engineer troops and more than 1,000 Korean refugees worked all day on the 25th constructing a sandbag ford across the Nam River. KPA mortars fired sporadically on the workers until silenced by counterbattery fire of the 8th Field Artillery Battalion. Before dawn of the 26th the 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry, crossed the Nam. Once on the north bank, elements of the regiment attacked toward Uiryong, to the northwest, and secured the town just before noon after overcoming a KPA force that defended it with small arms and mortar fire. The regiment pressed on to Chinju against negligible resistance on 28 September. On 24 September Eighth Army had altered its earlier operational order and directed IX Corps to execute unlimited objective attacks to seize Chonju and Kanggyong. To carry out his part of the order, General Kean organized two main task forces with armored support centered about the 24th and 35th Infantry Regiments. The leading elements of these two task forces were known respectively as Task Force Matthews (formerly Task Force Torman) and Task Force Dolvin. Both forces were to start their drives from Chinju. Task Force Matthews, the lefthand column, was to proceed west toward Hadong and there turn northwest to Kurye, Namwon, Sunch'ang, Kumje, Iri and Kunsan on the Kum River estuary. Taking off at the same time, Task Force Dolvin, the righthand column, was to drive north out of Chinju toward Hamyang, there turn west to Namwon, and proceed northwest to Chonju, Iri and Kanggyong on the Kum River. Three blown bridges west of Chinju delayed the departure of Task Force Matthews until 10:00, 27 September. Capt. Charles M. Matthews, commanding officer of A Company, 79th Tank Battalion, led the advance out of Chinju with the 25th Reconnaissance Company and A Company, 79th Tank Battalion. Task Force Blair based around the 3rd Battalion, 24th Infantry, followed Task Force Matthews, and the rest of the regiment came behind it. Matthews reached Hadong at 17:30. In a sense, the advance of Task Force Matthews became a chase to rescue a group of US prisoners that the North Koreans moved just ahead of the pursuers. Korean civilians and bypassed KPA soldiers kept telling of them being four hours ahead, two hours ahead, but always ahead. At Hadong the column learned that some of the prisoners were only thirty minutes ahead. From Hadong, in bright moonlight, the attack turned northwest toward Kurye. About above Hadong at the little village of Komdu () the advanced elements of the task force liberated eleven American prisoners. They had belonged to the 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment. Most of them were unable to walk and some had open wounds. Just short of Namwon about noon on 28 September, several vehicles at the head of the task force became stuck in the river crossing below the town after Sgt. Raymond N. Reifers in the lead tank of the 25th Reconnaissance Company had crossed ahead of them. While the rest of the column halted behind the stuck vehicles Reifers continued on into Namwon. Entering the town, Reifers found it full of KPA soldiers. Apparently the North Koreans' attention had been centered on two F-84 jets that could be seen sweeping in wide circles, rocketing and strafing the town, and they were unaware that pursuing ground elements were so close. Surprised by the sudden appearance of the American tank, the North Koreans scattered. Reifers heard American voices calling out, \\"Don't shoot! Americans! GIs here!\\" A second later a gateway leading into a large courtyard burst open and the prisoners poured out into the street. Reifers radioed for support and some of the tanks and vehicles now pushed ahead across the stream to join Reifers in Namwon. 86 American prisoners had been freed. Task Force Matthews cleared Namwon of KPA soldiers. In mid-afternoon Task Force Dolvin arrived there from the east. Task Force Matthews remained overnight in Namwon, but Task Force Blair continued on toward Chongup, which was secured at noon on 29 September. That evening Task Force Blair secured Iri. There, with the bridge across the river destroyed, Blair stopped for the night and Task Force Matthews joined it. Kunsan, the port city on the Kum River estuary, fell to the 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry, without opposition at 13:00 on 30 September. Eastward of and generally parallel to the course of Task Force Matthews, Task Force Dolvin and the 35th Infantry moved around the eastern and northern sides of the all but impenetrable Chiri-san area, just as the 24th Infantry had passed around its southern and western sides. This almost trackless waste of 750 square miles of high forested mountains forms a rough rectangle northwest of Chinju about by in dimension, with Chinju, Hadong, Namwon and Hamyang at its four corners. This inaccessible area had long been a hideout for Communist agents and guerrillas in South Korea. Now, as the KPA retreated from southwest Korea, many stragglers and some organized units with as many as 200 to 400 men went into the Chiri Mountain area to carry on guerrilla activities. Task Force Dolvin moved out of Chinju at 06:00 on 26 September, on the road northwest toward Hamyang, the retreat route taken by the main body of the KPA 6th Division. The tank-infantry task force included as its main elements A and B Companies, 89th Medium Tank Battalion, and B and C Companies, 35th Infantry. It had two teams, A and B, each formed of an infantry company and a tank company. The infantry rode the rear decks of the tanks. The tank company commanders commanded the teams. out of Chinju the lead M26 Pershing struck a mine. While the column waited, engineers removed eleven more from the road. further on, a second tank was damaged in another mine field. Still farther along the road a third minefield, covered by a KPA platoon, stopped the column again. After the task force dispersed the KPA soldiers and cleared the road of mines, it found 6 antitank guns, 9 vehicles, and an estimated 7 truckloads of ammunition in the vicinity abandoned by the enemy. At dusk, the KPA blew a bridge north of Hajon-ni () just half an hour before the task force reached it. During the night the task force constructed a bypass. The next morning, 27 September, a mine explosion damaged and stopped the lead tank. KPA mortar and small arms fire from the ridges near the road struck the advanced tank- infantry team. Tank fire cleared the left side of the road, but an infantry attack on the right failed. The column halted, and radioed for an air strike. Sixteen F-51 fighter-bombers came in strafing and striking the KPA-held high ground with Napalm, fragmentation bombs, and rockets. General Kean, who had come forward, watched the strike and then ordered the task force to press the attack and break through the KPA positions. The task force broke through on the road, bypassing an estimated 600 KPA soldiers. Another blown bridge halted the column for the night while engineers constructed a bypass. Continuing its advance at first light on the 28th, Task Force Dolvin an hour before noon met elements of the 23rd Infantry, 2nd Division, advancing from the east, at the road junction just east of Hamyang. There it halted three hours while engineers and 280 Korean laborers constructed a bypass around another blown bridge. Ever since leaving Chinju, Task Force Dolvin had encountered minefields and blown bridges, the principal delaying efforts of the retreating KPA 6th Division. When it was approaching Hamyang the task force received a liaison plane report that KPA forces were preparing to blow a bridge in the town. On Colonel Dolvin's orders the lead tanks sped ahead, machine-gunned KPA troops who were placing demolition charges, and seized the bridge intact. This success upset the KPA's delaying plans. The rest of the afternoon the task force dashed ahead at a speed of an hour. It caught up with numerous KPA groups, killing some of the soldiers, capturing others, and dispersing the rest. At midafternoon Task Force Dolvin entered Namwon to find that Task Force Matthews and elements of the 24th Infantry were already there. Refuelling in Namwon, Task Force Dolvin just after midnight continued northward and in the morning reached Chonju, already occupied by elements of the 38th Infantry Regiment, and continued on through Iri to the Kum River. At 15:00, 30 September, its mission accomplished, Task Force Dolvin was dissolved. It had captured or destroyed 16 antitank guns, 19 vehicles, 65 tons of ammunition, 250 mines, captured 750 KPA soldiers, and killed an estimated 350 more. It lost 3 tanks disabled by mines and 1 officer and 45 enlisted men were wounded in action. In crossing southwest Korea from Chinju to the Kum River, Task Force Matthews had traveled and Task Force Dolvin, . In the wake of Task Force Dolvin the 27th Regiment moved north from Chinju to Hamyang and Namwon on 29 September and maintained security on the supply road. This same day, 29 September, ROK Marines captured Yosu on the south coast. ===The 2nd Infantry Division moves west=== Opposite the old Naktong Bulge area, the KPA 9th, 4th and 2nd Divisions retreated westward. At Sinban-ni the 4th Division turned toward Hyopch'on. The 9th withdrew on Hyopch'on, and the 2nd, after passing through Ch'ogye (), continued on to the same place. Apparently the 9th Division, in the lead, had passed through Hyopch'on before elements of the US 2nd Infantry Division closed in on the town. On 23 September the 38th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division had hard fighting in the hills around Ch'ogye before overcoming KPA delaying forces. The next day the 23rd Infantry Regiment from the southeast and the 38th Infantry from the northeast closed on Hyopch'on in a double envelopment movement. Elements of the 38th Infantry established a roadblock on the north-south Chinju-Kumch'on road running northeast out of Hyopch'on and cut off an estimated two KPA battalions still in the town. During the day the 3rd Battalion, 23rd Infantry, entered Hyopch'on after a rapid advance of from the southeast. As the KPA fled Hyopch'on in the afternoon, 38th Infantry fire killed an estimated 300 of them at the regiment's roadblock northeast of the town. Two flights of F-51s caught the rest in the open and continued their destruction. The surviving remnant fled in disorder for the hills. The country around Hyopch'on was alive with hard-pressed, fleeing North Koreans on 24 September, and the Fifth Air Force, flying fifty-three sorties in the area, wrought havoc among them. That night elements of the 1st Battalion, 38th Infantry, entered Hyopch'on from the north. At daylight on the 25th, the 38th Infantry started northwest from Hyopch'on for Koch'ang. The road soon became impassable for vehicles and the men had to de-truck and press forward on foot. In retreating ahead of the 38th Infantry on 25 September the KPA 2nd Division, according to prisoners, abandoned all its remaining vehicles and heavy equipment between Hyopch'on and Koch'ang. This apparently was true, for in its advance from Hyopch'on to Koch'ang the 38th Infantry captured 17 trucks, 10 motorcycles, 14 antitank guns, 4 artillery pieces, 9 mortars, more than 300 tons of ammunition, and 450 KPA soldiers, and killed an estimated 260 more. Division remnants, numbering no more than 2,500 men, together with their commander, Maj. Gen. Choe Hyon, who was ill, scattered into the mountains. Up ahead of the ground troops, the Air Force in the late afternoon bombed, napalmed, rocketed, and strafed Koch'ang, leaving it virtually destroyed. After advancing approximately during the day, the 38th Infantry stopped at 20:30 that night only a few miles from the town. Elements of the 38th Infantry entered Koch'ang at 08:30 on 26 September, capturing there a North Korean field hospital containing forty-five KPA wounded. Prisoners disclosed that elements of the KPA 2nd, 4th, 9th and 10th Divisions were to have assembled at Koch'ang, but the swift advance of the US 2nd Division had frustrated the plan. The 23rd Infantry Regiment was supposed to parallel the 38th Infantry on a road to the south, in the pursuit to Koch'ang, but aerial and road reconnaissance disclosed that this road was either impassable or did not exist. 2nd Division commander General Laurence B. Keiser then directed Colonel Paul L. Freeman Jr. to take a road to the north of the 38th Infantry. Mounted on organic transportation, the regiment, less its 1st Battalion, started at 16:00 on the 25th and made a night advance to Koch'ang, fighting three skirmishes and rebuilding four small bridges on the way. It arrived at Koch'ang soon after the 38th Infantry, in daylight on 26 September. That evening the 23rd Infantry continued the advance to Anui, away, which it reached at 19:30 without opposition. Except for the small town itself, the area was a maze of flooded paddies. The regimental vehicles could find no place to move off the roads except into the village streets where they were dispersed as well as possible. At least one KPA group remained in the vicinity of Anui. At 04:00 on 27 September, a heavy KPA artillery and mortar barrage struck in the town. The second round hit the 3rd Battalion command post, killing the battalion executive officer, the S-2, the assistant S-3, the motor officer, the artillery liaison officer, and an antiaircraft officer. The battalion commander Lt. Col. R. G. Sherrard, was severely wounded; also wounded were twenty-five enlisted men of the Regimental and Headquarters Companies. Also on 27 September the last organized KPA unit east of the Naktong River, elements of the KPA 10th Division, withdrew from the notorious Hill 409 near Hyongp'ung () and crossed to the west side of the river before daylight. Patrols of the 9th Infantry Regiment entered Hyongp'ung in the afternoon, and two companies of the 2nd Battalion occupied Hill 409 without opposition. On 28 September the 2nd Battalion, 9th Infantry, crossed the Naktong to join the 2nd Division after the newly arrived 65th Regimental Combat Team of the US 3rd Infantry Division relieved it on Hill 409. At 04:00 on 28 September, Colonel Peploe started the 38th Infantry, with the 2nd Battalion leading, from Koch'ang in a motorized advance toward Chonju, to the west across the mountains. The 25th Division also was approaching Chonju through Namwon. Meeting only light and scattered resistance, the 2nd Battalion, 38th Infantry, entered Chonju at 13:15, having covered the distance in nine and a half hours. At Chonju the battalion had to overcome about 300 KPA soldiers of the 102nd and 104th Security Regiments, killing about 100 of them and taking 170 prisoners. There the 38th Infantry ran out of fuel for its vehicles. Fortunately, a 2nd Division liaison plane flew over the town and the pilot learned the situation. He reported it to the 2nd Division and IX Corps which rushed gasoline forward. At 15:30 on 29 September, after refueling, the 3rd Battalion departed Chonju for Nonsan and continued to Kanggyong on the Kum River, arriving there without incident at 03:00 the morning of 30 September. IX Corps had only two and a half truck companies with which to transport supplies to the 25th and 2nd Divisions in their long penetrations, and the distance of front-line units from the railhead increased hourly. When the 2nd Division reached Nonsan on the 29th the supply line ran back more than , much of it over mountainous terrain and often on one-way roads, to the railhead at Miryang. The average time for one trip was forty-eight hours. In one 105-hour period, Quartermaster truck drivers supporting the 2nd Division got only about thirteen hours' sleep. At the end of September the 2nd Division was scattered from the Kum River southward, with the 38th Infantry in the Chonju-Kanggyong area, the 23rd Infantry in the Anui area, and the 9th Infantry in the Koryong- Samga area. ===Recapture of Taejon=== On the right flank of the US 2nd Infantry Division, the British 27th Infantry Brigade, attached to the US 24th Infantry Division for the pursuit, was to move against Songju while the 24th Division simultaneously attacked parallel to and north of it on the main highway toward Kumch'on. After passing through Songiu, the British brigade was to strike the main highway halfway between the Naktong River and Kumch'on. Its path took it along the main retreat route of the KPA 10th Division. The brigade was across the Naktong and ready to attack before daylight on 22 September. At dawn the 1st Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, seized a small hill, called by the men Plum Pudding Hill, on the right of the road short of Songju. The battalion then attacked the higher ground immediately to the northeast, known to the British as Point 325 or Middlesex Hill. Supported by US tank fire and their own mortar and machine gun fire, the Middlesex Battalion took the hill from dug-in KPA soldiers before dark. While the Middlesex Battalion attacked Hill 325, the 1st Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders moved up to attack neighboring Hill 282 on the left of the road. Starting before dawn on 23 September B and C Companies after an hour's climb seized the crest of Hill 282, surprising there a KPA force at breakfast. Across a saddle, and nearly away to the southwest, higher Hill 388 dominated the one they had just occupied. C Company started toward it, but KPA troops occupying this hill already were moving to attack the one just taken by the British. The KPA supported their attack with artillery and mortar fire, which began falling on the British. The action continued throughout the morning with KPA fire increasing in intensity. Shortly before noon, with American artillery fire inexplicably withdrawn and the five supporting U.S. tanks unable to bring the KPA under fire because of terrain obstacles, the Argylls called for an air strike on Hill 388. Just after noon the Argylls heard the sound of approaching planes. Three F-51s circled Hill 282 where the British displayed their white recognition panels. The KPA on Hill 388 also displayed white panels. To their dismay the tactical air control party was unable to establish radio contact with the F-51's. Suddenly, at 12:15, the F-51s attacked the wrong hill napalming and machine-gunning the Argyll position. The attack was over in two minutes and left the hilltop a sea of orange flame. Survivors plunged down the slope to escape the burning napalm. Maj. Kenneth Muir, second in command of the Argylls, watching the flames on the crest die down, noticed that a few wounded men still held a small area on top. Acting quickly, he assembled about thirty men and led them back up the hill before approaching KPA reached the top. There, two bursts of enemy automatic fire mortally wounded him as he and Maj. A. I. Gordon-Ingrain, B Company commander, fired a 2-inch mortar. However the situation on the hill was hopeless. Gordon-Ingram counted only ten men with him able to fight, and some of them were wounded. His three Bren guns were nearly out of ammunition. At 15:00 the survivors were down at the foot of the hill. The next day a count showed 2 officers and 11 men killed, 4 officers and 70 men wounded, and 2 men missing for a total of 89 casualties; of this number, the mistaken air attack caused approximately 60. That night the 1st Battalion, 19th Infantry Regiment, attacked south from Pusang-dong () on the Waegwan- Kumch'on highway and captured Songju at 02:00 on 24 September. From there it moved to link up with the British 27th Brigade below the town. That day and the next the 19th Infantry and the British brigade mopped up in the Songju area. On the afternoon of 25 September the British brigade, released from attachment to the US 24th Division, reverted to I Corps control. The KPA 10th Division which had been fighting in the Songju area, its ammunition nearly gone and its vehicles out of fuel, withdrew on the 24th and 25th after burying its artillery. A captured division surgeon estimated the 10th Division had about 25 percent of its original strength at this time. About 25 September, KPA I Corps, ordered all its units south of Waegwan to retreat northward. On 23 September, the US 24th Division started its attack northwest along the Taejon-Seoul highway. General John H. Church had echeloned his three regiments in depth so that a fresh regiment would take the lead at short intervals and thus maintain impetus in the attack. Leading off for the division, the 21st Infantry Regiment headed for Kumch'on, the KPA headquarters. Elements of the KPA 105th Armored Division blocked the way with dug-in camouflaged tanks, antitank guns, and extensive minefields. In the afternoon a tank battle developed in which D Company, 6th Medium Tank Battalion, lost four M46 Patton tanks to KPA tank and antitank fire. During a slow advance, US tanks and air strikes in turn destroyed three KPA tanks. Just as this main Eighth Army drive started it was threatened with a supply breakdown. Accurate KPA artillery fire during the night of the 22nd destroyed the only raft at the Naktong River ferry and cut the footbridge three times. The ferrying of vehicles and supplies during the day practically stopped, but at night local Koreans carried across the river the supplies and ammunition needed the next day. Shortly after midnight, 23‚Äì24 September, the 5th Regimental Combat Team (5th RCT) passed through the 21st Infantry to take the lead. KPA troops in positions on Hill 140, north of the highway, stopped the regiment about , east of Kumch'on. There the KPA fought a major delaying action to permit large numbers of their retreating units to escape. The North Korean command diverted its 9th Division, retreating from the lower Naktong toward Taejon, to Kumch'on to block the rapid Eighth Army advance. Remaining tanks of two regiments of the KPA 105th Armored Division and the 849th Independent Anti-Tank Regiment, the latter recently arrived at Kumch'on from the north, also joined in the defense of the town. In the battle that followed in front of Kumch'on, the 24th Division lost 6 M46 tanks to KPA mines and antitank fire, while the KPA lost 8 tanks, 5 to air attack and 3 to ground fire. In this action the KPA 849th Regiment was practically destroyed. The 5th RCT and supporting units lost approximately 100 men killed or wounded, most of them to tank and mortar fire. Smaller actions flared simultaneously at several points on the road back to Waegwan as bypassed KPA units struck at elements of the 19th Infantry bringing up the rear of the 24th Division advance. As a result of the battle in front of Kumch'on on 24 September, the 21st Infantry swung to the north of the highway and joined the 5th RCT that night in a pincer attack on the town. The 3rd Battalion of the 5th RCT entered Kumch'on the next morning, and by 14:45 that afternoon the town, a mass of rubble from bombing and artillery barrages, was cleared of the KPA. That evening the 21st Infantry continued the attack westward. The 24th Division was interested only in the highway. If it was clear, the column went ahead. With the fall of Kumch'on on the 25th, KPA resistance melted away and it was clear that the KPA were intent only on escaping. On 26 September the 19th Infantry took the division lead and its 2nd Battalion entered Yongdong without resistance. In the town jail the troops liberated three American prisoners. The regiment continued on and reached Okch'on, east of Taejon, at 02:00 on 27 September. There it halted briefly to refuel the tanks and give the men a little rest. At 05:30 the regiment resumed the advance, but just outside Okch'on the lead tank hit a mine and KPA antitank fire then destroyed it. The 1st Battalion deployed and attacked astride the road but advanced only a short distance. The KPA held the heights west of Okch'on in force and, as at Kumch'on three days earlier, were intent on a major delaying operation. This time it was to permit thousands of their retreating fellow soldiers to escape from Taejon. This fight in front of Taejon disclosed that the city, as expected, was an assembly point for retreating KPA units south and west of Waegwan. The 300 prisoners taken during the day included men from seven KPA divisions. The reports of KPA tanks destroyed in the Taejon area during the day are confusing, conflicting, and, taken together, certainly exaggerated. The ground forces reported destroying 13 tanks on the approaches to the city, 3 of them by A Company, 19th Infantry, bazooka teams. The Air Force claimed a total of 20 tanks destroyed during the day, 13 of them in the Taejon area, and another 8 damaged. At 07:00 on 28 September an air-strike hit the KPA blocking position. When the 2nd Battalion advanced cautiously up the slopes, it was unopposed. It then became clear that the KPA had withdrawn during the night. Aerial reconnaissance at the time of the air strike disclosed approximately 800 KPA troops moving out of Taejon on the road past the Taejon Airfield. At noon aerial observers saw more KPA troops assembling at the railroad station and another concentration of them a few miles west of Taejon turning toward Choch'iwon. The Air Force napalmed and strafed still another force of 1,000 KPA soldiers west of the city. Scouts of the 2nd Battalion, 19th Infantry, and engineers of C Company, 3rd Engineer Combat Battalion, entered the outskirts of Taejon at 16:30. An hour later the 19th Infantry secured the city after engineers had cleared mines ahead of tanks leading the main column. At 18:00 a 24th Division artillery liaison plane landed at the Taejon Airfield. On 28 September, the 19th Infantry Regiment captured so many KPA stragglers that it was unable to keep an accurate count of them. The capture of large numbers of prisoners continued during the last two days of the month; on the 30th the 24th Division took 447 of them. At Taejon the division captured much KPA equipment, including four U.S. howitzers lost earlier and fifty new North Korean heavy machine guns still packed in grease. At Choch'iwon the North Koreans were destroying equipment to prevent its capture. Already other US forces had passed Taejon and Choch'iwon on the east to cut the main highway farther north at Ch'onan and Osan. With the capture of Taejon, the 24th Division accomplished its mission in the pursuit. On 29 September the 24th Division command post moved to Taejon. From there the division had the task of protecting the army line of communications back to the Naktong River. Its units were strung out for nearly : the 19th Infantry held the Taejon area up to the Kum River, the 21st Infantry extended from Taejon southeast to Yongdong, the 5th RCT was in the Kumch'on area, and the 24th Reconnaissance Company secured the Waegwan bridges. ===From Tabu-dong to Osan - the Eighth Army linkup with X Corps=== The Eighth Army breakout plans initially required the 1st Cavalry Division to cross the Naktong River at Waegwan and follow the 24th Division toward Kumch'on and Taejon. As the breakout action progressed, however, I Corps changed the plan so that the 1st Cavalry Division would cross the river at some point above Waegwan, pursue a course east of and generally parallel to that of the 24th Division, and seize Sangju. I Corps commander General Frank W. Milburn left to General Hobart R. Gay the decision as to where he would cross. General Gay and others, including Colonel Holmes, his chief of staff, and Colonel Holley of the 8th Engineer Combat Battalion, had proposed a crossing at Naktong-ni () where a KPA underwater bridge was known to exist. General Walker rejected this proposal. He himself flew in a light plane along the Naktong above Waegwan and selected the ferry site at Sonsan as the place the division should cross. In front of the 1st Cavalry Division two KPA divisions were retreating on Sangju. The KPA 3rd Division reportedly had only 1,800 men when its survivors arrived there. The other division, the 13th, was in complete disorder in the vicinity of Tabu-dong () and northward along the road to Sangju when the 1st Cavalry Division prepared to engage in the pursuit. On the morning of 21 September, Col. Lee Hak Ku, the chief of staff of the KPA 13th Division surrendered to the 8th Cavalry Regiment near the village of Samsandong south of Tabu-dong. Colonel Lee had slipped away from his companions during the night and approached the US lines alone. He was the ranking North Korean prisoner at the time and remained so throughout the war. Before he became chief of staff of the 13th Division, Lee had been operations officer (G-3) of KPA II Corps. Based on his testimony, KPA II Corps had ordered its divisions on 17 September to go on the defensive and that the 13th Division knew nothing of the Inchon landing. Lee gave a full report on the deployment of the 13th Division troops in the vicinity of Tabu-dong, the location of the division command post and the remaining artillery, the status of supply, and the morale of the troops. He gave the strength of the division on 21 September as approximately 1,500 men. The division, he said, was no longer an effective fighting unit, it held no line, and its survivors were fleeing from the Tabu-dong area toward Sangju. The regiments had lost communication with the division and each, acting on its own impulse and according to necessity, was dispersed in confusion. Many other 13th Division prisoners captured subsequently confirmed the situation described by Colonel Lee. Lee said the 19th Regiment had about 200 men, the 21st Regiment about 330, the 23rd about 300; that from 70 to 80 percent of the troops were South Korean conscripts and this condition had existed for a month; that the officers and noncommissioned officers were North Korean; that all tanks attached to the division had been destroyed and only 2 of 16 self-propelled guns remained; that there were still 9 122-mm howitzers and 5 120-mm mortars operational; that only 30 out of 300 trucks remained; that rations were down one half; and that supply came by rail from Ch'orwon via Seoul to Andong. At the time of Colonel Lee's surrender, General Gay had already directed Lt. Col. William A. Harris, Commanding Officer, 7th Cavalry Regiment, to lead the pursuit movement for the 1st Cavalry Division. Colonel Harris, now with a 2-battalion regiment (the 2nd Battalion had relieved the British 27th Brigade on the Naktong), organized Task Force 777 for the effort. Each digit of the number represented one of the three principal elements of the force: the 7th Cavalry Regiment, the 77th Field Artillery Battalion, and the 70th Tank Battalion. Harris assigned Lt. Col. James H. Lynch's 3rd Battalion as the lead unit, and this force in turn was called Task Force Lynch. In addition to the 3rd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, it included B Company, 8th Engineer Combat Battalion; two platoons of C Company, 70th Tank Battalion (7 M4 tanks); the 77th Field Artillery Battalion (less one battery); the 3rd Platoon, Heavy Mortar Company; the regimental I&R; Platoon; and a tactical air control party. After helping to repel an attack by a large KPA force cut off below Tabu-dong and seeking to escape northward, Task Force Lynch started to move at 08:00, 22 September from a point just west of Tabu-dong. Brushing aside small scattered KPA groups, Colonel Lynch put tanks in the lead and the column moved forward. Up ahead flights of planes coursed up and down the road attacking fleeing groups of KPA soldiers. Near Naksong-dong, where the road curved over the crest of a hill, KPA antitank fire suddenly hit and stopped the lead tank. No- one could see the enemy guns. General Gay, who was with the column, sent the remaining four tanks in the advance group over the crest of the hill at full speed firing all weapons. In this dash they overran two KPA antitank guns. Further along, the column halted while men in the point eliminated a group of KPA in a culvert in a 10-minute grenade battle. After the task force had turned into the river road at the village of Kumgok but was still short of its initial objective, the Sonsan ferry, a liaison plane flew over and dropped a message ordering it to continue north to Naktong-ni for the river crossing. The column reached the Sonsan ferry at 15:45. There, before he turned back to the division command post in Taegu, General Gay approved Lynch's decision to stop pending confirmation of the order not to cross the river there but to proceed to Naktong-ni. At 18:00 Lynch received confirmation and repetition of the order, and an hour later he led his task force onto the road, heading north for Naktong-ni, away. A bright three-quarter moon lit the way as the task force hastened forward. up the river road it began to pass through burning villages, and then suddenly it came upon the rear elements of retreating North Koreans who surrendered without resistance. An hour and a half before midnight the lead tanks halted on the bluff overlooking the Naktong River crossing at Naktong-ni. Peering ahead, men in the lead tank saw an antitank gun and fired on it. The round struck a concealed KPA ammunition truck. Shells in the truck exploded and a great conflagration burst forth. The illumination caused by the chance hit lighted the surrounding area and revealed a fascinating and eerie sight. Abandoned KPA tanks, trucks, and other vehicles littered the scene, while below at the underwater bridge several hundred KPA soldiers were in the water trying to escape across the river. The armor and other elements of the task force fired into them, killing an estimated 200 in the water. Task Force Lynch captured a large amount of equipment at the Naktong-ni crossing site, including 2 abandoned and operable T-34 tanks; 50 trucks, some of them still carrying US division markings; and approximately 10 artillery pieces. According to prisoners taken at the time, this force consisted principally of units of the KPA 3rd Division, but it included also some men from the 1st and 13th Divisions. Reconnaissance parties reported the ford crossable in waist-deep water and the far bank free of KPA troops. Colonel Lynch then ordered the infantry to cross to the north bank. At 04:30, 23 September, I and K Companies stepped into the Naktong and began wading the river. The crossing continued to the accompaniment of an exploding KPA ammunition dump at the other end of the underwater bridge. At 05:30 the two companies secured the far bank. Altogether, in the twenty-two hours since leaving Tabu-dong, Task Force Lynch had advanced , captured 5 tanks, 50 trucks, 6 motorcycles, 20 artillery pieces, secured a Naktong River crossing site, and had killed or captured an estimated 500 KPA soldiers. During the 23rd, Maj. William O. Witherspoon, Jr., led his 1st Battalion across the river and continued on northwest to Sangju, which he found abandoned. Meanwhile, Engineer troops put into operation at Naktong-ni a ferry and raft capable of transporting trucks and tanks across the river, and on the 24th they employed 400 Korean laborers to improve the old North Korean underwater bridge. Tanks were across the river before noon that day and immediately moved forward to join the task force at Sangju. As soon as the tanks arrived, Colonel Harris sent Capt. John R. Flynn with K Company, 7th Cavalry, and a platoon of tanks farther up the road to Poun, which they entered before dark. Colonel Harris had authority only to concentrate the regiment at Poun; he was not to go any farther. On the 24th also, General Gay sent a tank-infantry team down the road from Sangju towards Kumch'on where the 24th Division was engaged in a hard fight on the main Waegwan-Taejon- Seoul highway. Since this took the force outside the 1st Cavalry Division zone of action, I Corps ordered it to withdraw, although it had succeeded in contacting elements of the 24th Division. On 24‚Äì25 September General Gay concentrated the 1st Cavalry Division in the Sangju-Naktong-ni area while his advanced regiment, the 7th Cavalry, stayed at Poun. About dark on the 25th he received a radio message from I Corps forbidding him to advance his division farther. Gay wanted to protest this message but was unable to establish radio communication with the Corps. He was able, however, to send a message to Eighth Army headquarters by liaison plane asking for clarification of what he thought was a confusion of General Walker's orders, and requesting authority to continue the breakthrough and join X Corps in the vicinity of Suwon. During the evening, field telephone lines were installed at Gay's forward echelon division headquarters at the crossing site, and there, just before midnight, General Gay received a message from General Walker granting authority for him to go all the way to the link- up with X Corps if he could do so. Acting quickly on this authority, General Gay called a commanders' conference in a Sangju schoolhouse the next morning, 26 September, and issued oral orders that at twelve noon the division would start moving day and night until it joined the X Corps near Suwon. The 7th Cavalry Regiment was to lead the advance by way of Poun, Ch'ongju, Ch'onan, and Osan. Division headquarters and the artillery would follow. The 8th Cavalry Regiment was to move on Ansong via Koesan. At noon the 5th Cavalry Regiment, to be relieved by elements of the ROK 1st Division, was to break off its attack toward Hamch'ang and form the division rear guard; upon reaching Choch'iwon and Ch'onan it was to halt, block KPA movement from the south and west, and await further orders. On the right of the 1st Cavalry Division the ROK 1st Division, as part of US I Corps and the only ROK unit operating as a part of Eighth Army, had passed through Tabu-dong from the north on 22 September and headed for the Sonsan ferry of the Naktong. It crossed the river there on the 25th, and moved north on the army right flank to relieve elements of the 1st Cavalry Division, and particularly the 5th Cavalry Regiment, in the Hamch'ang-Poun area above Sangju. The 1st Cavalry Division was now free to employ all its units in the pursuit. Upon receiving General Gay's orders, Colonel Harris in turn ordered Colonel Lynch at Poun to lead northwest with his task force as rapidly as possible to effect a linkup with 7th Division troops of the X Corps somewhere in the vicinity of Suwon. This task force was the same as in the movement from Tabu-dong on the 22nd, except that now the artillery contingent comprised only C Battery of the 77th Field Artillery Battalion. The regimental I&R; Platoon and 1st Lt. Robert W. Baker's 3rd Platoon of tanks, 70th Tank Battalion, led Task Force Lynch out of Poun at 11:30 on 26 September. Baker had orders from Lynch to move at maximum tank speed and not to fire unless fired upon. For mile after mile they encountered no KPA opposition, only cheers from South Korean villagers watching the column go past. Baker found Ch'ongju deserted except for a few civilians when he entered it at midafternoon. At approximately 18:00, after traveling , Baker's tanks ran out of gasoline and the advance stopped at Ipchang-ni. For some reason the refuel truck had not joined the tank-led column. Three of the six tanks refueled from gasoline cans collected in the column. Just after these three tanks had refueled, members of the I&R; Platoon on security post down the road ran up and said a KPA tank was approaching. Instead, it proved to be three KPA trucks which approached quite close in the near dark before their drivers realized that they had come upon an American column. The drivers immediately abandoned their vehicles, and one of the trucks crashed into an I&R; jeep. On the trucks was enough gasoline to refuel the other three tanks. About 20:00 the column was at last ready to proceed. Colonel Harris ordered Colonel Lynch, at the latter's discretion, to drive on in the gathering darkness with vehicular lights on. This time Baker's platoon of tanks, rather than the I&R; Platoon, was to lead the column. The other platoon of three tanks was to bring up the rear. At his request, Colonel Lynch gave Baker authority to shoot at KPA soldiers if he thought it necessary. Shortly after resuming the advance at 20:30 the task force entered the main Seoul highway just south of Ch'onan. It soon became apparent that the task force was catching up with KPA soldiers. Ch'onan was full of them. Not knowing which way to turn at a street intersection, Baker stopped, pointed, and asked a KPA soldier onguard, \\"Osan?\\" He received a nod just as the soldier recognized him as an American and began to run away. The rest of the task force followed through Ch'onan without opposition. Groups of KPA soldiers just stood around and watched the column go through. Beyond Ch'onan, Baker's tanks caught up with an estimated company of KPA soldiers marching north and fired on them with tank machine guns. Frequently they passed KPA vehicles on the road, KPA soldiers on guard at bridges, and other small groups. Soon the three lead tanks began to outdistance the rest of the column, and Colonel Lynch was unable to reach them by radio to slow them. In this situation, he formed a second point with a platoon of infantry and a 3.5-inch bazooka team riding trucks, the first truck carrying a .50-caliber ring-mounted machine gun. Actions against small enemy groups began to flare and increase in number. When they were ten miles south of Osan men in the task force heard from up ahead the sound of tank and artillery fire. Lynch ordered the column to turn off its lights. Separated from the rest of Task Force Lynch, and several miles in front of it by now, Baker's three tanks rumbled into Osan at full speed. After passing through the town, Baker stopped just north of it and thought he could hear vehicles of the task force on the road behind him, although he knew he was out of radio communication with it. T-34 tank tracks in the road indicated that KPA armor might be near. Starting up again, Baker encountered KPA fire about north of Osan. His tanks ran through it and then Baker saw American M26 tank tracks. At this point fire against his tanks increased. Antitank fire sheared off the mount of the .50-caliber machine gun on the third tank and decapitated one of its crew members. Baker's tanks, now approaching the lines of the US 31st Infantry Regiment, X Corps, were receiving American small arms and 75-mm recoilless rifle fire. American tanks on the line held their fire because the excessive speed of the approaching tanks, the sound of their motors, and their headlights caused the tankers to doubt that they were enemy. One tank commander let the first of Baker's tanks go through, intending to fire on the second, when a white phosphorus grenade lit up the white star on one of the tanks and identified them in time to avoid a tragedy. Baker stopped his tanks inside the 31st Infantry lines. He had established contact with elements of X Corps. The time was 22:26 on 26 September; the distance, miles from the starting point at Poun at 11:30 that morning. That Baker ever got through was a matter of great good luck for, unknown to him, he had run through a strong KPA tank force south of Osan which apparently thought his tanks were some of its own, then through the KPA lines north of Osan, and finally into the 31st Infantry position just beyond the KPA. Fortuitously, American antitank and antipersonnel mines on the road in front of the American position had just been removed before Baker's tanks arrived, because the 31st Infantry was preparing to launch an attack. Baker's tanks may have escaped destruction from American weapons because of a warning given to X Corps. Shortly after noon of 26 September MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo had radioed a message to X Corps and to the Far East Air Forces saying that elements of Eighth Army might appear at any time in the X Corps zone of action and for the Corps to take every precaution to prevent bombing, strafing, or firing on these troops. At mid-afternoon, General Walker and Fifth Air Force commander General Earle E. Partridge, flying from Taegu unannounced, landed at Suwon Airfield and conferred with members of the 31st Infantry staff for about an hour. Walker said that elements of the 1st Cavalry Division attacking from the south would probably arrive in the Osan area and meet the 7th Division within thirty-six hours. Baker and the 31st Infantry tank crews at the front line tried unsuccessfully to reach Task Force Lynch by radio. Instead of being right behind Baker at Osan, the rest of Task Force Lynch was at least an hour behind him. After turning out vehicular lights approximately south of Osan, Task Force Lynch continued in blackout. Just south of the village of Habong- ni, Colonel Lynch, about midnight, noticed a T-34 tank some off the road and commented to Captain Webel, the regimental S-3 who accompanied the task force, that the Air Force must have destroyed it. Many men in the column saw the tank. Suddenly it opened fire with cannon and machine gun. A second tank, unnoticed up to that time, joined in the fire. Task Force Lynch's vehicular column immediately pulled over and the men hit the ditch. Lt. John G. Hill, Jr., went ahead to the point to bring back its rocket launcher team. This bazooka team destroyed one of the T-34s, but the second one moved down the road firing into vehicles and running over several of them. It finally turned off the road into a rice paddy where it continued to fire on the vehicles. A 75-mm recoilless rifle shell immobilized the tank, but it still kept on firing. Captain Webel had followed this tank and at one point was just on the verge of climbing on it to drop a grenade down its periscope hole when it jerked loose from a vehicle it had crashed into and almost caught him under its tracks. Now, with the tank immobilized in the rice paddy, a 3.5 inch bazooka team moved up to destroy it but the weapon would not fire. Webel pulled a 5-gallon can of gasoline off one of the vehicles and hurried to the side of the tank. He climbed on it and poured the gasoline directly on the back and into the engine hatch. A few spurts of flame were followed by an explosion which blew Webel about to the rear of the tank. He landed on his side but scrambled to his feet and ran to the road. He had minor burns on face and hands and two ribs broken. The burning tank illuminated the entire surrounding area. Up at the head of the halted column, Colonel Lynch heard to the north the sound of other tank motors. He wondered if Baker's three tanks were returning. Watching, he saw two tanks come over a hill away. Fully aware that they might be KPA tanks, Lynch quickly ordered his driver to place the lead truck across the road to block it. The first tank was within 100 yards of him before they got the truck across the road. The two tanks halted a few yards away and from the first one a voice called out in Korean, \\"What the hell goes on here?\\" A hail of small arms fire replied to this shout. The two tanks immediately closed hatches and opened fire with cannon and machine guns. The truck blocking the road burst into flames and burned. The three tanks still with Task Force Lynch came up from the rear of the column and engaged the KPA tanks. Eight more T-34's quickly arrived and joined in the fight. The American tanks destroyed one T-34, but two of them in turn were destroyed by the KPA tanks. Webel, in running forward toward the erupting tank battle, came upon a group of soldiers who had a 3.5 inch bazooka and ammunition for it which they had just pulled from one of the smashed American trucks. No one in the group knew how to operate it. Webel took the bazooka, got into position, and hit two tanks, immobilizing both. As KPA soldiers evacuated the tanks, he stood up and fired on them with a Thompson submachine gun. Sgt. Willard H. Hopkins distinguished himself in this tank-infantry melee by mounting an enemy tank and dropping grenades down an open hatch, silencing the crew. He then organized a bazooka team and led it into action against other tanks. In the tank-infantry battle that raged during an hour or more, this bazooka team was credited by some sources with destroying or helping to destroy 4 of the KPA tanks. One of the KPA tanks ran all the way through the task force position shooting up vehicles and smashing into them as it went. At the southern end of the column a 105-mm howitzer had been set up and there, at a point-blank range of , it destroyed this tank. Unfortunately, heroic Sergeant Hopkins was killed in this exchange of crossfire as he was in the act of personally attacking this tank. Combined fire from many weapons destroyed another tank. Of the 10 tanks in the attacking column, 7 had been destroyed. The 3 remaining T-34's withdrew northward. In this night battle Task Force Lynch lost 2 men killed, 28 wounded, and 2 tanks and 15 other vehicles destroyed. After the last of the KPA tanks had rumbled away to the north, Colonel Harris decided to wait for daylight before going further. At 07:00 on 27 September, the task force started forward again. The men were on foot and prepared for action. Within a few minutes the point ran into a KPA tank which a 3.5 inch bazooka team destroyed. A KPA machine gun opened fire on the column but was quickly overrun and the gunners killed in a headlong charge by Lt. William W. Woodside and two enlisted men. A little later the column came upon two abandoned KPA tanks and blew them up. The head of Task Force Lynch reached Osan at 08:00. At 08:26 on 27 September, north of Osan Task Force 777 sent a message to General Gay which said in part, \\"Contact between H Company, 31st Infantry Regiment, 7th Division, and forward elements of Task Force 777 established at 0826 hours just north of Osan, Korea.\\" After the link-up with elements of the 31st Infantry, elements of Task Force 777 did not actually participate in this regiment's attack against the North Koreans on the hills north of Osan. Their communication equipment, including the forward air controllers and their medical troops, however, did assist the 31st Infantry. General Gay arrived at Osan before noon and, upon seeing the battle in progress on the hills to the north, conferred with a 31st Infantry battalion commander. He offered to use the 8th Cavalry Regiment as an enveloping force and assist in destroying the KPA. He also offered to the 31st Infantry, he said, the use of the 77th and 99th Field Artillery Battalions and one tank company. The battalion commander said he would need concurrence of higher authority. Elements of the 1st Cavalry Division stood idly by at Osan while the 31st Infantry fought out the action which it did not win until the next afternoon, 28 September. General David G. Barr, commanding general of the 7th Infantry Division, has said he was never informed of General Gay's offer of assistance. In this rapid advance to Osan, the 1st Cavalry Division cut off elements of the 105th Armored Division in the Ansong and P'yongt'aek area and miscellaneous units in the Taejon area. On the 28th, elements of C Company, 70th Tank Battalion, and K Company, 7th Cavalry, with the strong assistance of fighter-bombers, destroyed at least seven of ten T-34's in the P'yongt'aek area, five by air strikes. Elements of the 16th Reconnaissance Company barely escaped destruction by these KPA tanks, and did suffer casualties. As late as 29 September, L Company of the 5th Cavalry Regiment ambushed approximately fifty KPA soldiers in nine Russian-built jeeps driving north from the vicinity of Taejon. ===The ROK advance to the 38th Parallel=== In the east, the ROK made advances from Taegu that kept pace with Eighth Army, and in some instances even outdistanced it. This performance is all the more remarkable because the ROK Army, unlike the Eighth Army, was not motorized and its soldiers moved on foot. In the ROK II Corps, the 6th and 8th Divisions on 24 September gained approximately . The 6th Division advanced on Hamch'ang and entered it the night of 25 September. By the 27th it was advancing across the roughest part of the Sobaek Mountains, past Mun'gyong in the high passes, on its way to Chungju. On 30 September the 6th Division encountered KPA delaying groups as it approached Wonju. The ROK 8th Division made similarly rapid advances on the right of the 6th Division. Its reconnaissance elements entered Andong before midnight of the 24th. Five spans of the 31-span bridge over the Naktong there were down. Remnants of two KPA divisions, the 12th and 8th, were retreating on and through Andong at this time. The 12th Division was pretty well through the town, except for rearguard elements, when advanced units of the ROK 8th Division arrived, but the main body of the KPA 8th Division had to detour into the mountains because ROK troops arrived there ahead of it. After two days of fighting, during which it encountered extensive KPA minefields, the ROK 8th Division secured Andong on 26 September. That evening the division's advanced elements entered Yech'on, northwest of Andong. The next day some of its troops were at Tanyang preparing to cross the upper Han River. On 30 September the division met strong KPA resistance at Chech'on and bypassed the town in the race northward. The ROK Capital Division was keeping pace with the others in the pursuit. On the 27th it had entered Ch'unyang, about east of the ROK 8th Division, and was continuing northward through high mountains. On the night of 1‚Äì2 October, shortly after midnight, an organized KPA force of from 1,000 to 2,000 soldiers, which had been bypassed some place in the mountains, struck with savage fury as it broke out in its attempt to escape northward. Directly in its path was Wonju where the ROK II Corps headquarters was then located. This force overran the Corps headquarters and killed many of its men, including five American officers who were attached to the Corps or who had come to Wonju on liaison missions. The KPA ran amok in Wonju until morning, killing an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 civilians. Along the east coast the ROK 3rd Division, with heavy US naval gunfire support, captured Yongdok on 25 September. A huge cloud of black smoke hung overhead from the burning city. The fall of the town apparently caught the KPA 5th Division by surprise. Some Russian-built trucks were found with motors running, and artillery pieces were still in position with ammunition at hand. Horse-drawn North Korean signal carts were found with ponies hitched and tied to trees. After the fall of Yongdok it appears that remnants of the 5th Division, totaling now no more than a regiment, turned inland for escape into the mountains. One North Korean regimental commander divided his three remaining truckloads of ammunition and food among his men and told them to split into guerrilla bands. In the pursuit up the coastal road above Yongdok, Maj. Curtis J. Ivey, a member of KMAG, with the use of twenty-five 2¬Ω-ton trucks made available for the purpose through the efforts of Colonel McPhail, KMAG adviser to the ROK I Corps, led the ROK forces northward in shuttle relays. When a roadblock was encountered it was Major Ivey who usually directed the action of the point in reducing it. The impressive gains by the ROK units prompted General Walker to remark on 25 September, \\"Too little has been said in praise of the South Korean Army which has performed so magnificently in helping turn this war from the defensive to the offensive.\\" On up the coast road raced the ROK 3rd Division. It secured Samch'ok on the morning of 29 September, and then continued on toward Kangnung. It moved north as fast as feet and wheels could take it over the coastal road. It led all ROK units, in fact, all units of the United Nations Command, in the dash northward, reaching a point only below the 38th Parallel on 30 September. ==Aftermath== The last week of September witnessed a drastic change in the pattern of North Korean military activity. Enemy targets were disappearing from the scene. On 24 September some fighter pilots, unable to find targets, returned to their bases without having fired a shot. Survivors of the once victorious KPA were in flight or in hiding, and, in either case, they were but disorganized and demoralized remnants. On 1 October there occurred an incident illustrating the state of KPA demoralization. A USAF T-6 Mosquito Forward Air Controller pilot dropped a note to 200 KPA soldiers northeast of Kunsan ordering them to lay down their arms and assemble on a nearby hill. They complied. The pilot then guided UN patrols to the waiting prisoners. The virtual collapse of the North Korean military caused General MacArthur on 1 October to order the USAF to cease further destruction of rail,highway, bridge, and other communication facilities south of the 38th Parallel, except where they were known to be actively supporting a KPA force. Air installations south of the 40th Parallel were not to be attacked, and he halted air action against strategic targets in North Korea. Loss of weapons and equipment in the retreat north from the Pusan Perimeter was of a scope equal to or greater than that suffered by the ROK in the first week of the war. For the period 23‚Äì30 September, IX Corps alone captured 4 tanks, 4 self- propelled guns, 41 artillery pieces, 22 antitank guns, 42 mortars, and 483 tons of ammunition. In I Corps, the 24th Division on one day, 1 October, captured on the Kumsan road below Taejon 7 operable tanks and 15 artillery pieces together with their tractors and ammunition. On the last day of September the 5th Cavalry Regiment captured three trains complete with locomotives hidden in tunnels. A few miles north of Andong advancing ROK forces found approximately 10 76-mm guns, 8 120-mm mortars, 5 trucks, and 4 jeeps, together with dead KPA soldiers, in a tunnel‚Äîall had been destroyed earlier by USAF napalm attacks at either end of the tunnel. At Uisong, ROK forces captured more than 100 tons of rice, other supplies, and most of the remaining equipment of one KPA division. The North Koreans had abandoned many tanks, guns, vehicles, ammunition, and other equipment because they lacked gasoline to operate their vehicles. After the UN breakout from the Pusan Perimeter, in the period from 26 September to 21 October 1950, seven survey teams traveled over all major routes of armored movement between the Perimeter line and the 38th Parallel, and also along the Kaesong-Sariwon-P'yongyang highway above the Parallel. This survey disclosed 239 destroyed or abandoned T-34 tanks and 74 self-propelled 76-mm guns. The same survey counted 60 destroyed US tanks. According to this survey, air action destroyed 102 (43 percent) of the tanks, napalm accounting for 60 of them or one-fourth the total enemy tank casualties; there were 59 abandoned T-34's without any visible evidence of damage, also about one-fourth the total; UN tank fire accounted for 39 tanks(16 percent); and rocket launchers were credited with 13 tanks (5 percent). The number credited to bazooka fire is in error, for the number certainly is much higher. Very likely air action is credited in this survey with many tanks that originally were knocked out with infantry bazooka fire. There are many known cases where aircraft attacked immobilized tanks after bazooka fire had stopped them. There was an almost complete absence of KPA tanks destroyed by US antitank mines. No reliable information is available concerning the number of damaged tanks the North Koreans were able to repair and return to action. But the figure of 239 found destroyed or abandoned comes close to being the total number used by the KPA in South Korea. Very few escaped from the Pusan Perimeter into North Korea at the end of September. From July through September 1950 United States tank losses to all causes was 136. A survey showed that mine explosions caused 70 percent of the loss. This high rate of U.S. tank casualties in Korea to mines is all the more surprising since in World War II losses to mines came to only 20 percent of tank losses in all theaters of operations. In the two weeks beginning with 16 September, the breakout and pursuit period, the UN forces in the south placed 9,294 prisoners in the Eighth Army stockade. This brought the total to 12,777, Eighth Army had captured 6,740 of them and the ROK 6,037. Beginning with 107 prisoners on 16 September the number had jumped to 435 on 23 September and passed the 1,000 mark daily with 1,084 on 27 September, 1,239 the next day, and 1,948 on 1 October. The rapid sweep of the UN forces northward from the Pusan Perimeter in the last week of September bypassed thousands of KPA troops in the mountains of South Korea. One of the largest groups, estimated to number about 3,000 and including soldiers from the KPA 6th and 7th Divisions with about 500 civil officials, took refuge initially in the Chiri Mountains of southwest Korea. At the close of the month, of the two major KPA concentrations known to be still behind the UN lines, one was south of Kumch'on in the Hamyang area and the other northeast and northwest of Taejon. Just before midnight, 1 October, a force of approximately sixty KPA riflemen, using antitank and dummy mines, established and maintained a roadblock for nearly ten hours across the main Seoul highway about northwest of Kumch'on. A prisoner said this roadblock permitted about 2,000 KPA soldiers and a general officer of the KPA 6th Division to escape northward. The 6th at the time apparently still had its heavy machine guns and 82-mm. mortars but had discarded all heavier weapons in the vicinity of Sanch'ong. North Korean sources make quite clear the general condition of the KPA at the end of September. The 6th Division started its withdrawal in good order, but most of its surviving troops scattered into the Chiri Mountain area and elsewhere along the escape route north so that only a part reached North Korea. The 7th Division commander reportedly was killed in action near Kumch'on as the division retreated northward; remnants assembled in the Inje-Yanggu area above the 38th Parallel in mid-October. In the 2nd Division, Maj. Gen. Choe Hyon, the division commander, had only 200 troops with him north of Poun at the end of September. Other elements of the division had scattered into the hills. Parts of the 9th and 10th Divisions retreated through Taejon, and other parts cut across the Taejon highway below the city in the vicinity of Okch'on when they learned that the city had already fallen. Only a handful of men of the 105th Armored Division reached North Korea. The commanding general of KPA I Corps apparently dissolved his headquarters at Choch'iwon during the retreat and then fled with some staff officers northeast into the Taebaek Mountains on or about 27 September. From the central front near Taegu, 1,000 to 1,800 men of the 3rd Division succeeded in reaching P'yonggang at the beginning of October. The 1st Division, retreating through Wonju and Inje, assembled approximately 2,000 men at the end of October. Of all the KPA divisions fighting in South Korea perhaps no other suffered destruction as complete as the 13th. Certainly no other yielded so many high-ranking officers as prisoners of war. In August the 13th Division artillery commander surrendered; on 21 September Col. Lee Hak Ku, the chief of staff, surrendered; three days later the commander of the self-propelled gun battalion surrendered; the division surgeon surrendered on the 27th; and Col. Mun Che Won, a 26-year-old regimental commander, surrendered on 1 October after hiding near Tabu-dong for nearly a week. The commander of the 19th Regiment, 22-year-old Lt. Col. Yun Bong Hun. led a remnant of his command northward by way of Kunwi, Andong, and Tanyang. Near Tanyang, finding his way blocked by ROK troops, he marched his regiment, then numbering 167 men, into a ROK police station at Subi-myon and surrendered. A few members of the division eventually reached the P'yonggang area. Remnants of the 8th Division, numbering perhaps 1,500 men, made their way northeast of P'yonggang and continued on in October to a point near the Yalu River. Some small elements of the 15th Division escaped northward through Ch'unch'on to Kanggye in North Korea. From Kigye about 2,000 men of the 12th Division retreated through Andong to Inje, just north of the 38th Parallel, picking up stragglers from other divisions on the way so that the division numbered about 3,000 to 3,500 men upon arrival there. Remnants of the 5th Division infiltrated northward above Yongdok along and through the east coast mountains in the direction of Wonsan. The bulk of the KPA troops that escaped from the Pusan Perimeter assembled in the Iron Triangle and the Hwach'on-Inje area of east-central North Korea just above the 38th Parallel. On 2 October a USAF pilot reported an estimated 5,000 KPA marching in small groups along the edge of the road north of the 38th Parallel between Hwach'on and Kumhwa. The commanding general of the KPA II Corps and his staff apparently escaped to the Kumhwa area in the Iron Triangle, and the best available evidence indicates that the commanding general and staff of the KPA Army Front Headquarters at Kumch'on also escaped northeast to the Iron Triangle. From there in subsequent months this headquarters directed guerrilla operations on UN lines of communications. It appears that not more than 25,000 to 30,000 disorganized North Korean soldiers reached North Korea from the Pusan Perimeter. For all practical purposes the KPA had been destroyed. ==See also== *Battle of Inchon *Pusan Perimeter Offensive *Second Battle of Seoul *UN offensive into North Korea == References == Category:Conflicts in 1950 Category:1950 in Korea Category:Battles of the Korean War Category:Battles involving North Korea Category:Battles involving South Korea Category:Battles of the Korean War involving the United Kingdom Category:Battles of the Korean War involving the United States ","title":"UN September 1950 counteroffensive"},{"id":"60333418","text":"Anthony P.

She was a high-status adult female, of North African descent, who died in York in the 4th century AD. Her skeleton was found with bracelets, pendants, earrings, beads as well as a glass jug and mirror. She appears to have originally been from North Africa. A piece of bone inscribed with the words, ‚ÄúHail, sister may you live in God‚Äù was found with her skeleton. ==Skeletal remains== A 2010 research paper studied the skeletal remains of the Ivory Bangle Lady, which were found within a stone coffin. This research showed that the skeleton is of a young adult female, aged 18-23 years. Her height was calculated using regression analysis of her limb-bone length to be approximately 152-160 cm. Significantly, this research also used FORDISC to identified the Ivory Bangle Lady as having North African ancestry. This conclusion was reached following craniometric multivariate analyses, including measuring Mahalanobis distance, which suggested a strong affinity with two reference populations of African-American females from the 19th and 20th Centuries. Isotope analysis of oxygen and strontium isotopes suggest that she spent her childhood in the west of Britain or in coastal areas of Western Europe and the Mediterranean. However, a 2009 study found that FORDISC 3.0 \\"is only likely to be useful when an unidentified specimen is more or less complete and belongs to one of the populations represented in its reference samples\\", and even in such \\"favorable circumstances it can be expected to classify no more than 1 per cent of specimens with confidence.\\" Immediately after the publication of this research and its discussion in the press the Ivory Bangle Lady became a focal point of a debate about immigration in the past, with public discussions focusing on her racial identity. Notably, the comments on the online publication of a Daily Mail article highlighted a backlash from readers. Emily Hanscam, in a 2019 article, compared this to the criticism aimed at Mary Beard in 2017 for defending the inclusion of a Black army officer in a BBC cartoon. ==Grave goods== The Ivory Bangle Lady was buried wearing ivory and jet bangles, a bracelet of blue glass beads, silver and bronze pendants, two yellow-glass earrings. A small, round glass mirror, a dark blue glass flagon, and an openwork, ivory inscription plaque were also included in the grave. The plaque reads SOROR AVE VIVAS IN DEO (\\"Hail sister, may you live in God\\"), which is evidence for a Christian population in late Roman York. Whilst the plaque is clearly Christian, the existence of other grave goods and the alignment of the grave in a north-south (rather than east- west) arrangement strongly suggests that the lady interred was pagan, but had connections with a Christian community rather than herself being a Christian.

Shkalim is a researcher of Jewish communities, and a curator of Jewish art. In her poetry Shekalim describes the experience of the female, Jewish and Mizrahi identities, in the family and public spheres. == Biography == Shkalim was born in Tehran, the capital of Iran, to Nurit and Peretz Shkalim, the second of their five children. In 1958, when she was four, the family immigrated to Israel, where her father became a carpet dealer, and owner of a chain of stores. After her national service she completed a BA in literature and history at Bar Ilan University. She then married and had three children. Later, she divorced. In the early 1990s, her husband was sent to the United States for four years for work, and that was when she started writing, as she was disconnected from home, friends, family and work. Shkalim says she is not influenced by other writers, and actually does not read poetry, because \\"when I read I don't write\\". Shkalim completed her MA at Washington University in the United States, and then proceeded to study for her PhD at Tel Aviv University, in the department of Jewish history. Her area of research is the traditions of various Jewish communities, and of the Persian Jewish community in particular. She was the founding manager of The Center for Jewish Heritage at the Eretz Israel Museum in Tel Aviv, and worked as a regional and national guide on Jewish art for the Ministry of Education, and also wrote and edited learning materials about holiday traditions of different communities in Israel. In her research, Shkalim traces not only the religious and cultural roots and expressions of Jewish traditions, but also how these traditions have been affected by the non-Jewish surroundings in which they were shaped. == Poetry == Shkalim's poetry deals with the meeting point of East and West, and the status of women in the Persian and Mizrahi cultures, while reclaiming canonical texts to create ongoing dialogs with the Bible, Mishna, Talmud, Midrash and Aggadah, as well as piyyut, Jewish literature and more. Her work describes the Mizrahi woman's struggle for equality and self-realization, and the ambivalence experienced by a modern Israeli woman, who is feminist and religious, who grew up in the patriarchal-tribal Mizrahi culture. Shkalim draws from her own experience, coming from a background she was taught to be ashamed of, her struggle with her own identity, and her emerging as a proud, assertive, Mizrahi feminist. Her book, Sharkia (\\"Fierce Eastern Wind\\") is largely autobiographical, and is included in the mandatory school literature curriculum in Israel. == Works == * What a Woman Needs to Know ◊û◊î ◊¶◊®◊ô◊õ◊î ◊ê◊ô◊©◊î ◊ú◊ì◊¢◊™, ◊°◊§◊® ◊©◊ô◊®◊ô◊ù ◊î◊ï◊¶◊ê◊™ ◊õ◊†◊®◊™ ◊ñ◊û◊ï◊®◊î ◊ë◊ô◊™◊ü, 2017. * Sharkia ◊©◊®◊ß◊ô◊î ◊°◊§◊® ◊©◊ô◊®◊ô◊ù ◊î◊ï◊¶◊ê◊™ ◊õ◊†◊®◊™ ◊ñ◊û◊ï◊®◊î ◊ë◊ô◊™◊ü, 2006. *A Mosaic of Israel's Traditions.

She was the second wife of ≈ûehzade √ñmer Faruk, son of the last Caliph of the Muslim world, Abdulmejid II and ≈ûehsuvar Hanƒ±m. ==Early life== Mihri≈üah Sultan was born on 1 June 1916 in Be≈üikta≈ü Palace. Her father was crown prince ≈ûehzade Yusuf Izzeddin who had died 4 months before her birth, and her mother was Leman Hanƒ±m, the daughter of Ahmed Bey and ≈û√ºkriye Hanƒ±m. She was the fourth child, and second daughter born to her father and the third child of her mother. She had two elder siblings, a sister, ≈û√ºkriye Sultan, ten years elder than her and a brother, ≈ûehzade Mehmed Nizameddin, seven years elder than her. She was the granddaughter of Abdulaziz and D√ºrr√ºnev Kadƒ±n. At the exile of the imperial family in March 1924, Mihri≈üah moved to Alexandria, Egypt. ==First marriage== ≈ûehzade √ñmer Faruk had an increased interest in his cousin Mihri≈üah. It was also a public knowledge that things were not going well between Faruk and his wife Princess Sabiha Sultan, the daughter of Sultan Mehmed VI. In 1944, Mihri≈üah even sided with Faruk when the council chose Prince Ahmed Nihad as the head of the family. While Sabiha backed the council's decision and approved the choice of the leader. His daughters also sided with their mother. Faruk accused Sabiha of turning their daughters against him. But he was already in love with Mihri≈üah and the issue of the council was just an excuse. Faruk divorced Sabiha on 5 March 1948, after twenty eight years of marriage, and just four months later married Mihri≈üah in a religious ceremony on 31 July 1948. In the prenuptial agreement she asked that the right to divorce her husband be included in the contract. She owned a small apartment building No. 8 Road 11 off Menashe Avenue in Cairo. Nesli≈üah Sultan tells in her memoirs that after Faruk married her they were not on good terms with each other. They still saw each other but Nesli≈üah refused to be anywhere near her. She, however, took good care of Faruk. Realizing how she was sacrificing herself for his sake, Nesli≈üah decided to see her again. It was Faruk's habit to come to Nesli≈üah's house for lunch on Mondays, and from then on he began to bring Mihri≈üah with him. However, their marriage did not last and a few years later, Mihri≈üah divorced Faruk using her right to divorce her husband. Later Faruk would tell his friends \\"I divorced the most beautiful woman in the world to marry the ugliest one. Fate!\\" ==Second marriage== After Mihri≈üah divorced √ñmer Faruk, she married ≈ûevket Arslanoƒülu. In 1952, Mihri≈üah returned to Istanbul after the revocation of the law of exile for princesses. She spent her last years with her cousin Gevheri Sultan, daughter of her uncle ≈ûehzade Mehmed Seyfeddin, in a spacious apartment in Taksim Square. ==Death== Mihri≈üah Sultan died on 25 January 1987 at the age of seventy, and was buried in the mausoleum of her great-grandfather Sultan Mahmud II, Divanyolu, Istanbul. ==Ancestry== ==References== ==Sources== * Category:1916 births Category:1987 deaths Category:People from Istanbul Category:Daughters of Ottoman sultans Category:20th-century Ottoman royalty Category:20th-century women of the Ottoman Empire ","title":"Mihri≈üah Sultan (daughter of ≈ûehzade Izzeddin)"},{"id":"60334224","text":"The Colusa High School and Grounds, at 745 10th St. in Colusa, California, was built during 1925 to 1926.

Regular events included a community laundry, a creche, language lessons and solidarity events. ==Temporary closure== After demonstrations both for and against migration on February 6 2016, Klinika was attacked by a group of neo-Nazis.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It has also been known as the Andrew Jackson Caldwell House after the man who built the house. There is a second contributing building on the property. Octagon Hall is located northeast of Franklin, Kentucky on U.S. Route 31W. ==Architecture== It is a red brick, two-story octagon house with a high basement. The three front facades have brick laid in Flemish bond, while brickwork is common bond elsewhere. With ==History== In 1847, Andrew Jackson Caldwell laid out the foundation for his new family home he would share with his wife Lizzie and their daughter Mary Elizabeth. Wanting distinction, his home would not be a simple structure like so many others in the area, but an eight-sided edifice. During the Civil War, Octagon Hall served as a hospital for not only Confederate soldiers, but for Federal soldiers, as well. It also doubled as a hideout for Confederate troops on the run from the Union army. Currently, it is the site of the Octagon Hall Museum & Kentucky Confederate Studies Archive. There is a rather extensive library, and a display of Civil War artifacts, Native American artifacts, and genealogical and historical research material. There is a slave cemetery, historic gardens on the grounds, as well as tours of the house.https://www.kentuckytourism.com/octagon-hall- civil-war-museum/ ==Paranormal== The Octagon Hall is known as one of the most haunted places in the South.https://www.octagonhallmuseum.com/ Almost everybody who steps foot inside Octagon Hall has had some sort of paranormal experience; shadow figures, dark entities, and disembodied voices. Even before construction was completed in 1859, Octagon Hall was marred by tragedy. The owner, Andrew Jackson Caldwell's wife, Lizzie, tragically died before they could move into their new home, and she was buried on the grounds. Their daughter, Mary Elizabeth, joined her in the makeshift cemetery when she was 12-years-old when she died in a tragic accident. She died while catching her clothing on fire standing too close to the fireplace while in the 'winter kitchen' located in the basement. Witnesses have reported toys being moved around by an unseen force in Mary Elizabeth's bedroom. Some visitors have felt their hands being grabbed as if it was by a little child, as well as whispers of a little girl's voice saying, \\"Mommy\\". In the attic, there have been reports by visitors that an unsettled spirit of a Confederate soldier, known as 'Edward', has been seen. Edward's leg was nearly shot off by Union troops. He managed to escape and made his way to Octagon Hall. However, by the time it was safe for him to come out of hiding, it was three days, he had already bled out. People say that they can still hear Edward dragging his leg around inside the house. ==In popular culture== ===Television=== Octagon Hall has been featured on A&E;, Syfy, History Channel, Discovery Channel, and many others.

Smith), also known as \\"The Cabbage King,\\" was one of the most successful market gardeners working in South West Middlesex, England in the 19th and 20th centuries. Smith was born in Putney in 1855 but lived most of his life in Feltham until his death in 1927. Smith was remembered by one of his foremen, Alfred Lucas: > \\"He was a man of extreme modesty, was deeply but silently religious, did not > drink or smoke and I never heard him use a profane expression during the > whole 14 years I was in his service. He told me he never had time to read a > book. He had no holiday when I was with him and he was absent only 3 months > when he had a severe breakdown and fear was entertained for his life.\\" Lucas, as the man who spent much time working with Smith, is the main source of information relating to Smith. == Career == === Humble Beginnings === In 1890, Smith began his empire with a modest 40 acre fruit garden (Feltham Glebeland) that faced the Staines Road in Bedfont, a single horse, and a few secondhand tools. When Lucas joined the operation around 1890 Smith only had four employees: Tom Witt, Bob Jackson, Tommy Day, and Polly Jackson. After successfully cultivating this garden for some time, Smith expanded his reach by taking over another 40 acres on the Walton Road; this became known as No. 2 Garden. This time Smith chose to plant half the field with fruit trees and half with brussels sprouts, onions, beetroots, and cabbages. Smith's empire continued to expand with 30 more acres, new employees, and new horses and materials. A dramatic new chapter began in Smith's life with the retirement of his father, Henry Smith, in 1891. === The Rise of an Empire === After taking over his father's business, A.W. Smith continued to expand his business even further. As he entered this new chapter of business Smith added another crop to his stock: tomatoes. To houses these plants, he built five large glass houses (250 feet long by 15 feet wide), predecessor to modern greenhouses, along the Feltham Hill road towards Sunbury. Since these houses were built on land previously used for cereal crops, Smith had to make a few changes; he dug a five foot deep four foot wide passage to allow water to get into the houses. This new crop proved to be wildly successful, so Smith proceeded to build seven larger glasshouses (250 ft. by 30 ft.). To cope with the water problem for these houses, Smith built a brick water tower nearby. These additions of land and crops required new additions as well; Smith acquired more horses, employees, and tools. This growth in horses depended upon for work led to some troubles as they often needed to be shoed, which could take valuable time, so Smith created his own blacksmith's forge on his property. No longer limited by this, Smith continued to expand his landholdings and stables, acquiring many more horses for work. The next notable direction Smith took his business in was when he purchased about 45 acres of land just off of Feltham High Street. While this seems simple, it is notable because the land was not incredibly well suited or farming; however, Smith had other plans. He ordered the construction of 20 glasshouses, the largest yet at 600 ft. by 32 ft. to be populated with tomatoes. This massive sea of glass, incredibly expensive at the time, cost ‚Ç§13,500 and came to be known as The Glass City. Unfortunately, the site of the City would prove to cause trouble later on as the plants did not yield as much as planned; several solutions were attempted, including individually potting the 200,000 plants, but none completely solved the problem. Despite this, Smith chose to move his headquarters from Feltham Hill to this new site of Feltham Farm in the year 1899. Smith personally financed and constructed a new complex including a blacksmith's forge, wheelwright, office, and more. This establishment of the new base of operations proved to be advantageous to Smith as his father's lease on a significant portion of land came to a close and was snatched up by his elder brother E.F. Smith. This land included the former headquarters of the group at Feltham Hill as well as Smith's own residence at Burnham Villa. While it was a huge blow to Smith's morale this event proved to be nothing he could not handle; the loss of some fields was overcome, and he found a new residence in Feltham House. Smith made up for the 40 acres he lost to his brother by purchasing another 70 acres in Ashford. When showed this land, Lucas points out that it was very far from a point at which it could be useful to a gardener, but Smith was not to be stopped. So, teams began to work the field and make it ready for fruit trees, but a snag arose when one plow broke on a large, mushroom-shaped piece of ironstone (about 20 ft. in diameter). Even when it was revealed that this land was dotted heavily with these ironstone protrusions, Smith refused to be daunted; he ordered men to hand-drill holes in all the stones large enough to fit a parcel of gunpowder. Smith then blasted each chunk of ironstone until he had enough surface room to grow the trees, about 3 ft. of dirt was needed. However, Smith wanted to test the land with a crop of brussels sprouts first, so once the field was fully worked this crop would ensure the ground was properly cleaned for the more costly fruit trees. Smith's empire began to take its final form with two noteworthy acquisitions of land. The first belonged to a Mr. Batson and was approximately 200 acres in close proximity to Smith's already established holdings. Naturally, when Batson approached Smith with an offer to sell his land, Smith quickly accepted, thereby closing off the territory and extending his reach far into Feltham. The second piece of land was about 300 acres controlled by a Mr. Hatch who, when Smith approached at the end of his lease, agreed to turn the land over to Smith. While both of these land acquisitions required varying degrees of work to get ready for Smith's plans, it was well worth it to establish his over 900 acre empire. === The Workers === Due to the extreme size of his operation, Smith hired large numbers of workers for various tasks, all of which were paid quite fairly for their work. Some of the tasks taken by men were Foremen, Blacksmith, Wheelwright, repairman for glasshouses, diggers, plow workers, pieceworkers, and more. The women were employed in tasks such as weeding, hoeing, planting, and harvesting fruit. A number of Show Travelers were also employed when they came to Feltham; they were given some of the harder tasks of picking more difficult crops, thereby relieving some of the women of this stress. Even so, there was a moment when the women felt unfairly paid at work and attempted a strike; however, Lucas was able to settle the matter without loss of productivity. The most interesting aspect was Smith's hiring policy. He was willing to hire anyone, man or woman, who could put in an honest day's hard work, regardless of their background. Previous convicts were hired right alongside poor widows trying to get by. === The Workplace Environment === As was to be expected from his upbringing, Smith entertained specific expectations for his workers. He was never late and would reprimand workers who were late or tried to leave the job early, often outright firing the offender. He specified rules and fines regarding any avoidable problems such as careless destruction of plants, eating product, and so on, but was still seen as a benevolent employer due to his wish to keep those who needed work employed. Smith also took care of his workers, stopping and resolving feuds before they could grow further. Smith also defended his land within his rights; he employed a few people to guard the land at night and keep any poachers or thieves at bay. Besides ensuring security, Smith also ensured quality. He developed a special version of hoe specifically for cutting lettuce that did not require the user to constantly bend to the ground; this allowed one man to much more quickly cut the lettuce while two or three others picked it up after him. This maintained a single standard of quality since only the one man would choose which heads of lettuce were suitable for cutting. Beyond this, Smith outlined several specific procedures for weeding, digging, picking, and packing. Thus he ensured all the produce bearing his name was up to his high standards and packed perfectly for the journey to market. === Crops of \\"The Cabbage King\\" === As is expected, Smith was very specific with picking what varieties of crops he grew. He grew a number of fruits: apples, both the kind for eating and for cooking, plums, pears, gooseberries, currants, raspberries, strawberries, and cherries. Inside his famous glasshouses, Smith also grew tomato plants. These plants produced on average 4 pounds of tomatoes per plant. Smith also grew mint, both within the glasshouses and without. During various months, he was also a key supplier of parsley, spring onions, leeks, and root crops: potatoes, Jerusalem artichokes, mangold worzel (mangelwurzel), turnips, parsnips, and beetroot. Smith also grew several varieties of beans (runner, broad, and longpod) and peas throughout the season. Smith also grew smaller quantities of large onions, marrows, and rhubarb. In all, the glasshouses alone produced somewhere around 200 tons of food per year while employing about 40 workers. But the most notable of Smith's crops were his greens. He was a very successful grower in that he was able to constantly be shipping greens to market throughout the year: spinach in spring, cauliflower and brussels sprouts in summer until mid Autumn, savoy cabbage in late Autumn throughout the winter, and after Christmas until the following April, kale and broccoli. His long cabbage season caused by the adeptness with which the land grew cabbages was what earned Smith the nickname of \\"The Cabbage King\\" amongst vendors in Covent Garden and locals of Feltham. Most notably, Smith produced one million cabbages in a single season. He very specifically chose the varieties best suited for glasshouses as well as outdoor growing in the later months. Smith also grew lilies for a time, on the advice of his brother E.F. Smith. Starting with a small trial venture, Smith was quite satisfied with the product and the money it brought in during the winter months, so he moved to a larger venture and constructed two glasshouses specifically for lilies. However, the large number of lilies produced by the Smith brothers drove the market price of the lilies down that year and Lucas reports Smith had a net loss of ‚Ç§500; Smith thus abandoned lilies and turned these two houses over to cucumbers. Besides this failed venture, Smith also grew wallflowers, forget-me-nots, honesty, and violets. Managing this vast array of plants required a large amount of fertilizer, namely manure. Originally, Smith used a number of carts to ferry manure to Feltham from London; however, as his holdings grew and technology progressed, he chose to try a more efficient method. Smith otained permission to build a railway leading to his farm and purchased three rail carts to carry manure as well as his own driving engine. This allowed for workers previously engaged in moving manure to spend their time elsewhere, thus creating more efficiency. == Politics == The passing of the Local Government Act of 1894 caused a rift in Feltham; the once united town began to divide over the issues it raised. At this time Smith was approached by some fellow community members and was encouraged to run, so he did in order to maintain the current rates on property. He was elected with a majority to be Chairman of the First Parish Council of Feltham; however, he only attended one meeting after which he declared public life was too slow for him. He remained nominal chair and a co- chair was elected by the rest of the group. == The End of the Story == Smith continued work in much the same manner for a number of years. He acquired more land in several different purchases as late as 1920. He worked tirelessly until his death in 1927 caused by heat failure after a bout with influenza at 71. He is buried in Feltham cemetery. == References == Category:English gardeners Category:English businesspeople Category:1855 births Category:1927 deaths ","title":"A.W.

They have a dry and powdery texture and are usually flower-shaped. They originate from the Tagalog people of southern Luzon, particularly in the provinces of Laguna, Quezon, and Marinduque. ==Etymology== The name is derived from urar√≥ (also arar√≥, araru, aroru, or aruru), the Tagalog and Spanish common name of the maranta arrowroot, Maranta arundinacea, the source of the flour. It is also called galletas de Liliw (Spanish for \\"Liliw biscuits\\"), after the town of Liliw in Laguna, where it is a regional specialty. ==Description== Urar√≥ cookies from Liliw, Laguna in traditional papel de Japon wrapping Traditional urar√≥ production is labor-intensive, starting with the harvesting of arrowroots. The roots are washed and then crushed with a stone on a slab of hardwood in a process known as pag-ilod. The liquid resulting from this process is collected and then undergoes a second process, the pinapatining, wherein it is allowed to sit until the water separates from the starch. The water is poured off and the starchy mass is kneaded to extract more water. Finally the starch is dried and sieved through katsa (muslin) to produce the flour. The entire process takes an entire day. The flour is then mixed with rendered lard, duck egg yolks, sugar, and milk. They are then baked in a pugon, the traditional Filipino clay ovens. Modern urar√≥, however, are usually made from arrowroot flour, sugar, milk, margarine (or butter), and eggs. In some cases, arrowroot flour is even substituted with tapioca flour or rice flour, resulting in poorer quality cookies. Urar√≥ can also be modified with other ingredients like coconut cream or maple syrup. Both of these versions usually lack the melt-in-the-mouth quality of traditional urar√≥ made with pure arrowroot flour and lard. Urar√≥ are traditionally sold in cylindrical stacks wrapped in colored cr√™pe paper (papel de Japon). Urar√≥ are similar in texture and are sometimes confused with puto seco, another powdery Filipino biscuit. But urar√≥ is not as dry as puto seco and have a milky and buttery taste. ==See also== *Puto seco *Mamon tostado *Rosquillos == References == Category:Philippine cuisine Category:Cookies ","title":"Uraro"},{"id":"60334961","text":"Svetoslav Merdzhanov (1876 - 1901), Bulgarian anarchist and founder of Gemidzhii group.Die makedonische Frage.

While he was still studying at the Ruse High school, thanks to the influence of the libertarian Varban Kilifarski, he joined the anarchist group of this city on the Danube and so did not finish high education. After working for a time in a notary, he went to Geneva (Switzerland) to study law, but became here part of the anarchist \\"Geneve group\\", founded in 1898 by Petar Mandjukov and closely related to the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (IMARO). Following his decision to devote himself to the struggle for the liberation of Macedonia and Thrace from Ottoman rule, he went in 1899 to Skopje where, after some time, he was arrested by the authorities and thrown in prison. Later he moved to Thessalonica where he met Yordan Shurkov whom he knew from Plovdiv. Shurkov was teacher at the Bulgarian Men's High School of Thessaloniki. He introduced Merdzhanov at the school, where he also began to work as a teacher. Through Shurkov he met the Veles group. The Veles group, as it turned out, was ripe for becoming involved in the revolution. Merdzhanov sparked some of the Veles graduates with this ideas. The first meetings of the group took part with the purpose of forming a revolutionary circle with aim of changing international public opinion in the matter of the freedom of Macedonia and Adrianople Thrace. Subsequently, in 1899, Merdzhanov with Mandjukov and Petar Sokolov, was part of the guerrilla group of Gotse Delchev, and become a member of the IMARO. This group acted in the mountainous areas of Pirin. In 1900 he arrived in Istanbul where Merdzanov created the anarcho- terrorist group and with Pavel Shatev, Mandjukov and Sokolov participated in the preparation of blasting of the Ottoman Imperial Bank's central office, for which they dig a tunnel. This group also prepared an attack against Sultan Abdul Hamid II. The plan was discussed with a members of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation. In September 1900 the Ottoman police apprehended a member of the group, and later the whole group was arrested. In 1901 the prisoners were deported œÑŒø Bulgaria, after pressure from the Bulgarian government. Merdzanov and Sokolov went to Sofia and began to think up new ideas. One of which was to hold up the Orient Express on Turkish territory near Adrianople, and to gain possession of the mail in order to finance future actions. In July 1901 he formed a new terrorist group with the participation of Armenian revolutionaries and left in the area of Adrianople. After kidnapping Nuri Bey, a son of Mustafa Dertli Chiflik, rich owner of Adrianopole, the group had an armed confrontation with the Ottoman army, Sokolov and two other members of the group were killed, as well as Nuri Bey. Merdzjanov was captured alive, together with another Bulgarian and two Armenians. The captives were taken to Adrianople. After terrible torture, the survivors were condemned to death. Slave Merdzanov, and his comrades, were hanged on November 27, 1901 in Adrianople.–ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–æ–≤, –ë–æ—Ä–∏—Å –ô. –í—ä—Ç—Ä–µ—à–Ω–∞ –º–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–æ- –æ–¥—Ä–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∞ —Ä–µ–≤–æ–ª—é—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω–∞ –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏—è. –í–æ–π–≤–æ–¥–∏ –∏ —Ä—ä–∫–æ–≤–æ–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª–∏ (1893-1934). –ë–∏–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–Ω–æ-–±–∏–±–ª–∏–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ—Å–∫–∏ —Å–ø—Ä–∞–≤–æ—á–Ω–∏–∫, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è, 2001, —Å—Ç—Ä. 102. ==References== Category:People from Karnobat Category:Bulgarian revolutionaries Category:Members of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization Category:Bulgarian anarchists Category:Thracian Bulgarians Category:Bulgarian Men's High School of Thessaloniki Category:Bulgarian people imprisoned abroad Category:Prisoners and detainees of the Ottoman Empire Category:1876 births Category:1901 deaths ","title":"Slavi Merdzhanov"},{"id":"60334966","text":"Goobey is a surname.

The tale is noted for combining Christian ideas with concepts found in Scandinavian non-Christian traditions.Marlene Ciklamini, 'Folklore and Hagiography in Arngr√≠mr‚Äôs Gu√∞mundar saga Arasonar ,' Fabula, 49 (2008), 1‚Äì18, . == Medieval Sources == The main medieval source for stories about Selkolla is different versions of Gu√∞mundar saga Arasonar, specifically versions B and D, where the episode is often now referred to as Selkollu √æ√°ttr ('the Selkolla episode'). === Gu√∞mundar saga version D === This summary is based on the D-version of Gu√∞mundar saga.The summary is adapted from that of Gunnlaugur Bjarnason, 'Tveir heimar m√¶tast: Gu√∞mundur Arason biskup, hetja og v√∂r√∞ur gegn illsku' (unpublished BA dissertation, University of Iceland, 2017), pp. 10-11, citing Biskupa s√∂gur, ed. by J√≥n Sigur√∞arson and Gu√∞brandur Vigf√∫sson, 2 vols (Copenhagen: M√∏ller, 1858‚Äì78), II 78-81. The events of Selkollu √æ√°ttr take place in the Westfjords, beginning when a man and woman are taking a baby girl to be baptised. On the way, they indulge in an \\"immoral rest\\" beside a large stone, fittingly called Miklisteinn ('large stone') and \\"turn onto the alternative road of fornication\\". Once they have finished having sex, they return to the child, who they had set down, and find that it is now \\"black, dead, and hideous\\". The couple decide to leave the child behind and walk away, but as they do so they hear a cry. They return to the child and find that it is alive, but it is now so \\"terrifying that they dare neither touch it nor come near\\". They go to the farm to fetch more people, but when they return to the stone, the child has vanished. It is then said that a certain woman is \\"newly arrived in the district, sometimes with an ordinary face but sometimes with a seal's head. This devil walked about as boldly by day as by night, for which reason this midday-devil was called Selkolla in the district\\". What follows is an account of the assaults of this being at a farm which is never localised in any more detail. First, in the guise of the farmer's wife, she tries to entice him into having sex. When he realises what is actually going on, he tries to turn for home, but Selkolla bars his way, such that he gets home to the farm \\"tired and exhausted\\", and lies in bed \\"on account of that sickness, which the deceitful trick of the Devil had afflicted upon his virility. He could not have any thereafter, because the same unclean spirit seeks him day and night with enthusiasm\\". No- one wants to be near the farmer to provide him with any solace, \\"except for one diligent kinsman of his, who lies beside him until Selkolla overcomes him in the night and bursts out his eyes\\". Gu√∞mundr, who is wandering the Westfjords, is called in and asked to tackle the fiend. He decides to stay at the farm which Selkolla is afflicting, and once he has gone to bed for the night he sees that a woman \\"takes him by surprise\\" and tries to pull off his shoes, which his servants have forgotten to do. Gu√∞mundur realises immediately who it is and drives Selkolla away with the words \\"far ni√∞r, fjandi, ok gakk ei framarr!\\" (\\"go down, devil, and don't come back!\\"). The next day, Gu√∞mundr and Selkolla meet again and he drives her down once more, this time by setting up seven crosses. So ends Gu√∞mundr's dealings with Selkolla. She rears her head once more on board a ship which is on the way \\"over the flord, or bay\\" which separates the country's dioceses. But the crew have received the blessing of Gu√∞mundr for the journey, and the blessing prevents Selkolla from harming them. The episode ends with a 21-stanza account in skaldic verse by Einarr Gilsson, known as Selkolluv√≠sur.Mart Kuldkepp, 'The People, the Bishop, and the Beast: Remediation and Reconciliation in Einarr Gilsson‚Äôs Selkolluv√≠sur,' in Supernatural Encounters in Old Norse Literature and Tradition, ed. by Daviel S√§vborg and Karen Bek-Pedersen, Borders, Boundaries, Landscapes, 1 (Turnhout: Brepols, 2018), pp. 105-22 ; . === Gu√∞mundar saga, version B === The story also appears in the B-version of Gu√∞mundar saga,Biskupa s√∂gur, ed. by J√≥n Sigur√∞arson and Gu√∞brandur Vigf√∫sson, 2 vols (Copenhagen: M√∏ller, 1858‚Äì78), I 604-8. where the main difference is that some of the characters are named,Gunnlaugur Bjarnason, 'Tveir heimar m√¶tast: Gu√∞mundur Arason biskup, hetja og v√∂r√∞ur gegn illsku' (unpublished BA dissertation, University of Iceland, 2017), p. 11 (n. 43). and the text claims that Selkolla gave her name to the cliff Selkollu-Kleifar.Bengt af Klintberg, 'Scandinavian Folklore Parallels to the Narrative about Selkolla in Gu√∞mundar saga biskups,' in Supernatural Encounters in Old Norse Literature and Tradition, ed. by Daviel S√§vborg and Karen Bek-Pedersen, Borders, Boundaries, Landscapes, 1 (Turnhout: Brepols, 2018), pp. 59-74 ; . === √çslendinga saga === Selkolla is briefly mentioned in √çslendinga saga:Sturlunga saga including the √çslendinga saga of lawman Sturla Thordsson and other works, 2 vols (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1878), I 223.Cf.

By the twentieth century, however, stories told about Selkolla were being influenced by the medieval narrative, which had come into print and was becoming better known in Iceland.Margaret Cormack, 'Saints, Seals, and Demons: The Stories of Selkolla', in Supernatural Encounters in Old Norse Literature and Tradition, ed. by Daviel S√§vborg and Karen Bek-Pedersen, Borders, Boundaries, Landscapes, 1 (Turnhout: Brepols, 2018), pp. 75-103 ; . Supposedly, the stone where the child who became Selkolla was laid is to be found not too far from H√≥lmav√≠k, and features in tourism marketing in the area.K. A. Lund, 'Just Like Magic: Activating Landscape of Witchcraft and Sorcery in Rural Tourism, Iceland', in The Changing World Religion Map: Sacred Places, Identities, Practices and Politics, ed. by Stanley D. Brunn and Donna A. Gilbreath (Dordrecht: Springer, 2014) 767‚Äì782 (pp. 777-78), . == Analyses == The medieval story of Selkolla has been shown to share motifs with post-medieval Scandinavian folklore about changelings and ghosts or other hauntings by dead children,Sean B. Lawing, 'The Place of the Evil: Infant Abandonment in Old Norse Society', Scandinavian Studies (2013), 133-50 (pp. 146-47). the skogsr√•,Daniel S√§vborg, 'B√∫i the Dragon: Some Intertexts of J√≥msv√≠kinga Saga', Scripta Islandica: Isl√§ndska S√§llskapets √Örsbok, 65 (2014), 101-17 (pp. 112-13). and folklore about seals. Contrary to the claims in the B-version of Gu√∞mundar saga, it is unlikely that she gave her name to the cliff Selkollukleifar ('Seal-head-cliffs'): rather the cliff was probably named after seals that were visible from it, and the story of Selkolla then invented to explain the name.Bengt af Klintberg, 'Scandinavian Folklore Parallels to the Narrative about Selkolla in Gu√∞mundar saga biskups ,' in Supernatural Encounters in Old Norse Literature and Tradition, ed. by Daviel S√§vborg and Karen Bek-Pedersen, Borders, Boundaries, Landscapes, 1 (Turnhout: Brepols, 2018), pp. 59-74 ; . == References == Category:Creatures in Norse mythology Category:Corporeal undead Category:Circumpolar mythology Category:Icelandic folklore Category:Scandinavian legendary creatures Category:Female legendary creatures ","title":"Selkolla"},{"id":"60335149","text":"Xianju National Park () is a national park in Xianju County, Zhejiang, China. It lies between the Kuocang Mountains () and Dalei Mountain () in southeastern Zhejiang province. It shrouded by the cloud and mist all the year around. It covers an area of . ==Name== Xianju has magnificent springs, waterfalls, cliffs and valleys, as well as layer upon layer of peaks immersed in mist. As a splendid work of nature, the beautiful place is just like a fairland on earth, so local people call it \\"Xianju\\", meaning a residence where the immortals live. ==Natural history== The volcanic rock landform of Xianju National Park was shaped 120 million years ago. With the Pacific Plate diving beneath the Eurasia Plate, volcanoes in the coastal area of southeastern China erupted on a large scale. Between two eruptions, there wasn't new lava reaching the crater. Thus, in the weathering process, the crater gradually collapsed into a bowl-shaped pit and then became a lake with more and more water retained in it. After that, volcanoes got active and volcanic rock started to build up again. The volcanic eruptions brought very thick layers of volcanic rock. In the later stage, the earth's crust rose and the exposed earth's surface was eroded. With the increase in the erosion degree, the earth's surface became a combination of various geomorphic types, including scabland, screen-shaped cliffs, door-shaped rock, pillar peaks and so on. In June 1924, Ren-Chang Ching found longleaf torreya in Xianju. He collected a specimen and took it to the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University in the United States. In 1925 he named the tree after his academic supervisor, John George Jack. In March 2014, it began to build a national park and completed in November 2015. ==Geology== In the park, there is the most typical and complete geomorphic system of rhyolitic mountainous land. In terms of volcanic geology and petrology, the region is of great scientific value. The volcanic rock is acidic in the park. Its silicon dioxide content is over 66%. The park has 101 major geological relics and 24 water views. In the geomorphic landscape of Xianju National Park, Fanzheng Rock is one of the iconic pillar peaks. With the height of and the diameter of , it towers aloft on a mountain which is more than high. Its flat top like a huge steamer, the mist hazing the peak, is just like the steam coming from the rice steamer, that's why the peak is called Fanzheng Rock (). ==Fauna and Flora== The park is designated as a wildlife preserve. There are strict regulations on the rocks, plants, animals and birds from the park. It has a forest coverage rate of over 93%. The park has well-preserved evergreen broad-leaved forests. Within the boundaries of the park, the following number of species are known to live: 322 species of vertebrates (of them, there are 26 species under class ‚Ö° national protection, such as pangolin, long-tailed goral, reeves, sumatran serow, black muntjac, silver pheasant, masked palm civet and wild boar), 1,505 species of vascular plants (of them, there are 14 species under class ‚Ö† and ‚Ö° national protection, such as Taxus chinensis var. mairei and longleaf torreya), 57 species of ferns, 18 species of gymnosperms, and 1,365 species of angiosperms. ==River== Yong'an River (), known as the mother river of Xianju County, originates from Heaven's Tip () at an altitude of . The long river has 38 tributaries of different sizes in the Xianju County, those tributaries flow into the Yong'an River from the south and north. ==Culture== In October 2018, Xianju National Park served as a shooting location for the CCTV travel documentary series Homeland, Dreamland. ==See also== * List of national parks of China ==ReferencesCategory:National parks of China Category:Protected areas established in 2015 Category:Tourist attractions in Taizhou, Zhejiang Category:Geography of Zhejiang Category:2015 establishments in China ","title":"Xianju National Park"},{"id":"60335150","text":"173rd Siege Battery was a unit of Britain's Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA) formed during World War I. It served on the Western Front, including the Battles of Vimy Ridge, Third Ypres and Cambrai, and the crushing victories of the Allied Hundred Days Offensive in 1918. ==Mobilisation== 173rd Siege Battery was formed at Falmouth, Cornwall under Army Council Instruction 1239 of 21 June 1916, based upon a cadre of 3 officers and 78 other ranks (the establishment of a TF garrison company) supplied by the Cornwall (Duke of Cornwall's) Royal Garrison Artillery, a coast defence unit of the Territorial Force based in Falmouth. It went out to the Western Front on 3 October 1916, manning four 6-inch 26 cwt howitzers, and joined 48th Heavy Artillery Group (HAG) in Third Army on 10 October.Army Council Instructions for June 1916.Frederick, p. 703.'Allocation of Siege Batteries RGA', The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 95/5494/4.'Headquarters Heavy Artillery Groups', TNA file WO 95/5494/1. ==Service== Crew positioning a 6-inch 26 cwt howitzer. ===Ancre Heights=== The practice was to move batteries between HAGs as required, and 173rd Siege Bty rapidly transferred to 40th HAG with Fifth Army on 18 October. Fifth Army was engaged in the Battle of the Ancre Heights, the last phase of that summer's Somme Offensive. The fighting ground on despite increasingly bad weather, culminating in the Battle of the Ancre (13‚Äì18 November). 173rd Siege Bty remained with Fifth Army during the winter, switching to 10th HAG on 11 December, and back to 40th HAG on 2 February, while Fifth Army carried out a series of small Operations on the Ancre, January‚ÄìMarch 1917.Farndale, Annex E.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 114‚Äì20. ===Vimy=== On 21 March 1917, 173rd Siege Bty was transferred north to join 63rd HAG with First Army, which was preparing for the Battle of Vimy Ridge. 63rd HAG was assigned to I Corps. The artillery plan for the heavy guns before the attack emphasised counter-battery (CB) fire. At Zero hour, while the field guns laid down a Creeping barrage to protect the advancing infantry, the heavy howitzers fired further ahead to hit the rear areas on the reverse slope of the ridge, especially known gun positions. The attack went in on 9 April with I Corps and Canadian Corps successfully capturing Vimy Ridge while Third Army attacked further south near Arras. The only hold-up on 9 April was at Hill 145, near the north end of the Canadian attack, and the capture of this position was completed the next day. Fighting in the southern sector (the Battle of Arras) continued into May.Farndale, pp. 164‚Äì6, 174‚Äì6, Map 23.Cave, pp. 119‚Äì27, Map p. 121.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 74‚Äì8. 6-inch howitzer being moved through mud on the Western Front. ===Ypres=== 173rd Siege Bty switched to 79th HAG on 16 April and 15th HAG on 5 May, while remaining with First Army. Then on 10 July 1917 it moved to 56th HAG which was joining Fifth Army for the forthcoming Third Ypres Offensive. Gun batteries were packed into the Ypres Salient where they were under observation and CB fire from the Germans on the higher ground. Casualties among guns and gunners were high, even before the offensive opened with the Battle of Pilckem Ridge on 1 August, when Fifth Army failed to make much progress. A second push on 16 August (the Battle of Langemarck) suffered from rushed artillery planning and was unsuccessful. The offensive continued through the summer and autumn of 1917, but after a short spell with 55th HAG (8‚Äì17 September) 173rd Siege Bty was relieved and sent back to Third Army, where it joined 17th HAG, changing to 4th HAG on 14 November.Farndale, pp. 199‚Äì204, Map 26.Edmonds, 1917, Vol II, pp. 150-210.Wolff, pp. 155‚Äì76. 6-inch howitzer and crew during the Ypres offensive, 1917. ===Cambrai=== Third Army was preparing for its surprise attack with tanks at the Battle of Cambrai. There was to be no preliminary bombardment or registration shots, and the guns were to open fire at Zero hour firing 'off the map' at carefully surveyed targets.Farndale, pp. 216‚Äì21, Map 32. Miles, 1917, Vol III, pp. 26, 29. When the battle began with a crash of artillery at 06.20 on 20 November the German defenders were stunned, and the massed tanks completed their overcome. In most areas the attack was an outstanding success. Exploitation over succeeding days was less spectacular, though some bombardments were set up to help the infantry take certain villages.Cooper, pp. 85‚Äì8.Farndale, pp. 221‚Äì30. On 30 November the Germans put in a heavy counter-attack against the weakened troops in the ill-organised captured positions, which they quickly overran, and Third Army had to scramble to set up a defensible line for the winter.Cooper, pp. 171‚Äì98.Farndale, pp. 249‚Äì58. 173rd Siege Bty continued to change command within Third Army, to 32nd HAG on 14 December and then 54th HAG on 29 December. However, by now HAG allocations were becoming more fixed, and on 1 February 1918 they were converted into permanent RGA brigades. 54th Brigade was defined as an 8-inch Howitzer Brigade, though most of the batteries like 173rd were equipped with 6-inch howitzers. 173rd Siege Bty remained with this brigade until the Armistice.Farndale, Annex M. 6-inch howitzers during the Spring Offensive. ===Spring Offensive=== When the German Spring Offensive began on 21 March 1918, part of Third Army was engaged in the desperate fighting, but overall it was not obliged to retreat as far or to abandon as many heavy guns as Fifth Army further south. The German offensive had been halted on Third Army's front by 5 April.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 92‚Äì7.Farndale, pp. 259‚Äì79. ===Hundred Days=== Third Army joined in the Allies' victorious Hundred Days Offensive with the Battle of Albert on 23‚Äì24 August, and continued with the Battles of the Scarpe (26‚Äì30 August), the Drocourt-Qu√©ant Switch Line (2‚Äì3 September) Havrincourt (12 September), √âpehy (18 September), Canal du Nord (27 September‚Äì1 October) and Second Cambrai (8‚Äì10 October).Blaxland, pp. 206‚Äì45.Farndale, pp. 290‚Äì5, 304. By 17 October, Third Army had closed up to the River Selle ; now it prepared to seize a substantial bridgehead for further advances. 54th Brigade was assigned to V Corps for the assault crossing on 20 October (the Battle of the Selle), which was to be carried out as a surprise, with no preliminary bombardment, with a Zero hour of 02.00, when the moon would be full. Half of the corps' heavy artillery fired a creeping barrage, halting at each objective in turn, while the remainder carried out CB fire and bombarded specific targets. The infantry of 17th (Northern) and 38th (Welsh) Divisions crossed their footbridges, fought their way over the railway, through the village of Neuvilly and up onto the second of three successive ridges. The third ridge, the final objective for the day, proved troublesome, so a fresh barrage as put down on it at 16.00 and it was taken without further problems.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 163‚Äì7.Blaxland, p. 252.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, 1918, Vol V, pp. 334‚Äì8.Farndale, pp. 309‚Äì10. After the crossing of the Selle, and shortly afterwards of the Sambre Canal, the offensive turned into a pursuit, and most of the siege batteries had to be left behind. Fighting was ended on 11 November by the Armistice with Germany. Demobilisation began early in 1919. In the interim order of battle for the postwar army the battery was supposed to form 128th Bty RGA, but this was rescinded after the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, and the battery was disbanded in 1919. ==Notes== ==References== * Maj A.F.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) and co- sponsored by Mario D√≠az-Balart (R-FL), Donna Shalala (D-FL), and Debbie Mucarsel-Powell (D-FL). It aims to monitor and investigate Russia's increasing involvement in the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis and the crisis in Venezuela in general. The bill was introduced to the House as H.R. 1477 on February 28, 2019 and passed by the House of Representatives on March 25, 2019. The bill would need to pass the Senate and be signed by the President of the United States in order to become law. On 8 April, it was referred to a Senate subcommittee.All Actions on H.R.1477 in the 116th Congress == Introduction == Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said the bill was introduced because of Russia's menacing influence that prevents the restoration of a functioning democracy in Venezuela while posing an imminent military threat to the United States and the entire Western Hemisphere. In December 2018, the Russian military sent two Tupolev Tu‚Äì160 nuclear-capable bombers to Venezuela for joint military exercises, which carry conventional or nuclear-tipped cruise missiles with an estimated maximum range of around 3,000 miles. At the same time, both Russian and Venezuelan forces took part in a joint 10-hour exercise across the Caribbean Sea with the Tu‚Äì160 aircraft. In a 2016 deal, Venezuela offered Russia 49.9% of Citgo as collateral for a $1.5 billion loan. Due to the poor state of Venezuela's economy, which includes a high risk of default, it is possible the Bolivarian Government of Venezuela may give Citgo to Rosneft, Russia's government-run oil company. Both Republican and Democratic politicians in the United States urged oversight on this deal, describing Citgo's sale to Russia as a risk to the national security of the United States. In December 2018, it was suggested that Rosneft has lent PDVSA for $6.5 billion partly as prepayment for crude oil, of which $3.1 billion remained outstanding as of the end of September 2018. The bill also mentioned that during the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis, Russia has provided financial support for President Maduro while countering international support for interim president Juan Guaid√≥. Moreover, it was reported in that Russia sent Wagner Group contractors to provide security and protection for Maduro, a charge which Russia denies. Congresswoman Schultz said that the bill takes a critical step toward understanding and addressing the impact of Russia-Venezuela military cooperation, and to ensure it does not obstruct democracy or safety in the region while preventing Russia \\"to outfit Maduro with weapons of oppression.\\" Co-sponsor Mario D√≠az-Balart said the bill was necessary to monitor Russia's threat to stability and democracy within the Western hemisphere, explaining that the Maduro regime \\"has invited adversaries such as Russia and China into its doorstep.\\" == Proposals == Under the bill, it requires the US State Department to provide a threat assessment and strategic approach for dealing with Russia's growing military sway in Venezuela. It also requires the President of the United States to monitor the risk of Russian acquisition of the Venezuela's CITGO assets in the United States. The bill also imposes a travel ban on individuals working on behalf of the Russian government in direct support of Venezuelan security forces, which includes the following agencies: *National Bolivarian Armed Forces of Venezuela (FANB) *Bolivarian National Guard (GNB) *Bolivarian National Intelligence Service (SEBIN) *Bolivarian National Police (PNB) *Scientific, Penal, and Criminal Investigation Service Corps (CICPC) *Ministry of Interior, Justice, and Peace (MPPIJ) == Reactions == Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the bill would not make Russia reverse its diplomatic stance on the crisis in Venezuela and its support to Nicol√°s Maduro by increasing more sanctions on Russia. Oleg Morozov, member of the Federation Council's Foreign Affairs Committee described the bill as \\"nonsense\\" and an anti-Russian sanctions policy. According to Russia's ambassador to Venezuela, Vladimir Zaemsky, the Russian government is ready to respond by imposing similar measures should the bill pass. == See also == *Magnitsky Act *Venezuela Defense of Human Rights and Civil Society Act of 2014 *Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act *Defending American Security from Kremlin Aggression Act *Venezuela TPS Act of 2019 *Responses to the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis == References == == External links == * All Actions on H.R.1477 in the 116th Congress Category:Russia‚ÄìUnited States relations Category:Sanctions legislation Category:United States foreign relations legislation Category:Proposed legislation of the 116th United States Congress Category:International reactions to the crisis in Venezuela Category:Venezuelan presidential crisis ","title":"Russian‚ÄìVenezuelan Threat Mitigation Act"},{"id":"60335163","text":"Pilipit is a traditional Filipino deep-fried twisted doughnut.

It is one of several lists of U.S. pipeline accidents. See also: list of natural gas and oil production accidents in the United States. __NOTOC__ == Incidents == This is not a complete list of all pipeline accidents. For natural gas alone, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), a United States Department of Transportation agency, has collected data on more than 3,200 accidents deemed serious or significant since 1987. A \\"significant incident\\" results in any of the following consequences: * Fatality or injury requiring in-patient hospitalization. * $50,000 or more in total costs, measured in 1984 dollars. * Liquid releases of five or more barrels (42 US gal/barrel). * Releases resulting in an unintentional fire or explosion. PHMSA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) post-incident data and results of investigations into accidents involving pipelines that carry a variety of products, including natural gas, oil, diesel fuel, gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel, carbon dioxide, and other substances. Occasionally pipelines are re-purposed to carry different products.Data sets of PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents for 1986-2001, 2002-2009, and 2010-2017 can be downloaded from the tab by that name on the PHMSA's Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and- statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident-flagged-files, accessed 2018.01.10.

PHMSA Pipeline Failure Investigation Reports are at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/safety-reports/pipeline-failure-investigation- reports. NTSB Pipeline Accident Reports are at https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/pipeline.aspx. The following incidents occurred during 1996: * January 6, Pennsylvania: A gas pipeline failure excised a section of pipe. The gas later ignited, causing a vegetation fire in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. Later inspections found numerous flaws on this pipeline. * January 9, California: Farm equipment pierced a Chevron crude oil pipeline near Coalinga, California, spilling about 210,000 gallons of crude oil over about four acres of land. * January 12, Texas: A backhoe hit a six-inch Amoco gas pipeline in Andrews, Texas. Consequently, the pipeline exploded, causing severe burns to two workers and minor injuries to two others. One of the workers with severe burns died a few days later. * February 5, Missouri: A pipeline ruptured and spilled diesel fuel into a creek in Fairview Heights, Missouri. * February 7, Pennsylvania: A Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. worker was killed in West Finley, Pennsylvania when the coupling on a pipeline that was being pressure-tested broke loose and hit him. * February 17, Texas: A Diamond Shamrock propane pipeline was severed by a trenching machine in Parker County, Texas, resulting in the loss of 6,355 barrels of propane. US Highway 377 was shut down while fumes dissipated. * February 18, Ohio: A 20-inch natural gas line near South Point, Ohio failed, causing a massive fire. There were no injuries. * March 1, Utah: An oil sheen in a canal in Salt Lake City, Utah was eventually traced back to a leaking four-inch Chevron diesel fuel pipeline. The pipeline had been damaged by previous excavation. There were no injuries. * April 23, South Carolina: A Colonial Pipeline line failed near Gaffney, South Carolina, spilling gasoline. At first the spill was reported to be only 250 gallons, but later reports indicated that 1,386 gallons were spilled. Rock abrasion was cited as the cause for the failure. * May 8, Ohio: A 20-inch Columbia Gas pipeline was ruptured by a crew installing a water pipeline in Oregon, Ohio. One business nearby was evacuated. * May 23, Louisiana: A Marathon Petroleum 20-inch pipeline ruptured at a location near Gramercy, Louisiana. The ruptured pipeline ultimately released about of gasoline into a common pipeline right-of-way and marshland. Gasoline also entered the Blind River, causing environmental damage and killing fish, wildlife, and vegetation in the area. The pipeline controller did not immediately recognize that the pipeline had failed, and continued to ignore alarms from the pipeline SCADA system. * May 23, Connecticut: The largest penalty in an environmental case since the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill was announced. The Connecticut-based Iroquois Pipeline Operating Company was ordered to pay $22 million in criminal and civil fines for violating federal environmental and safety laws. The violations stemmed from the construction of one of the country's longest natural gas pipelines, running 370 miles from Canada through upstate New York and Connecticut to Long Island. Backfill of the pipeline was one of the issues cited. Four individuals also received jail time. * June 17, Washington: An Olympic Pipeline products line near Everett, Washington sprung a leak from a buckled area of pipe. About 1,000 gallons of gasoline were spilled into North Ebey Slough. The spill was discovered by a crew installing a water line nearby. * June 26, South Carolina: A 36-inch Colonial Pipeline ruptured at the Reedy River, near Fork Shoals, South Carolina. The ruptured pipeline released about of fuel oil into the Reedy River and surrounding areas. The spill polluted a stretch of the Reedy River, causing significant environmental damage. Floating oil extended about down the river. Approximately 35,000 fish were killed, along with other aquatic organisms and wildlife. The estimated cost to Colonial Pipeline for cleanup and settlement with the State of South Carolina was $20.5 million. No one was injured in the accident. The pipeline was operating at reduced pressure due to known corrosion issues, but pipeline operator confusion led to an accidental return to normal pressure in that pipeline section, causing the rupture. * August 4, Minnesota: of unspecified petroleum product spilled from a Lakehead pipe near Donaldson, Minnesota. * August 24, Texas: A Koch butane pipeline ruptured, causing an explosion and fire near Kemp, Texas. Two teenagers were killed after driving into the unseen butane cloud while going to report the pipeline leak. A mobile home was also destroyed by the fire. The leak was caused by external corrosion. The pipeline was only 15 years old at the time. * September 26, Michigan: A bulldozer operator in Grand Haven, Michigan hit and ruptured a Wolverine pipeline. Petroleum ignited, burning the bulldozer operator. About 43,000 gallons of petroleum product was lost. * October, Washington: The Yellowstone Pipeline was found to be leaking in Spokane County, Washington. An unknown amount of petroleum product contaminated soil in the area, requiring soil remediation. * October 17, Indiana: A leaking Amoco pipeline caused traffic to be shut down on an industrial area street in Hammond, Indiana, starting on October 17. About 1,250 barrels of gasoline were spilled. The leak was caused by external corrosion of the pipeline, which was installed in 1928. * October 23, Louisiana: In Tiger Pass, Louisiana, the crew of a Bean Horizon Corporation dredge dropped astern spud into the bottom of the channel in preparation for dredging operations. The spud struck and ruptured a 12-inch submerged natural gas steel pipeline. The pressurized natural gas released from the pipeline enveloped the stern of the dredge and an accompanying tug, then ignited, destroying the dredge and the tug. No fatalities resulted from the accident. * November 5, Tennessee: A Colonial Pipeline stub line in Murfreesboro, Tennessee ruptured, shortly after undergoing maintenance. The accident was caused by a valve being left closed after maintenance, which caused pressure to build up when the pipeline was restarted, rupturing the pipeline. * On November 21, Puerto Rico: An explosion occurred in a shoe store and office building in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico. Thirty-three people were killed, and at least 69 were injured. Crews from the local gas provider, Enron, had not found any gas leaks previously, despite complaints of propane odor in the buildings. * December 11, Kansas: A natural gas line operated by Williams ruptured just north of Tonganoxie, Kansas. Corrosion around a fitting called a \\"T-Drip\\" failed, allowing gas to escape. * December 26, Louisiana: A bulldozer ruptured a 10-inch LPG pipeline near Maringouin, Louisiana, forcing the evacuation of nearby residents. There was no explosion or fire. ==References== Category:Lists of pipeline accidents in the United States ","title":"List of pipeline accidents in the United States in 1996"},{"id":"60335234","text":"Jaime C. Bulatao (September 22, 1922- February 10, 2015), called \\"Father Bu\\" by his students and coworkers, is a Filipino Jesuit priest and psychologist. He is one of the co-founders of the Ateneo de Manila University's Department of Psychology and the Psychological Association of the Philippines. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Jaime ‚ÄúJimmy‚Äù Carlos Bulatao was born in Paco, Manila on September 22, 1922. His father, Emilio Bulatao, headed the Physiology Department of the University of the Philippines College of Medicine. When the family escaped from their Paco residence during the Second World War's end-game carpet bombing, Butatao's father brought with him nothing but his research papers. His mother, Encarnacion Ungson, was a public school teacher before she married. Bulatao has three older siblings: Josefine ‚ÄúJo‚Äù Ungson Jayme, Rodolfo ‚ÄúDodoy‚Äù Bulatao, and Elisa ‚ÄúEly‚Äù Ungson Quizon. They grew up in Lingayen in the province of Pangasinan where he was first taught by Belgian nuns and was at the top of his class. ===Education=== Bulatao attended St. Theresa's College in Manila for kindergarten. His parents wanted him to go to La Salle for grade school; however, he insisted on going to Ateneo Grade School against his parent's wishes. After taking a look at the school and meeting Fr. John Hurley, his parents allowed him to attend Ateneo. He graduated high school in 1939 and as the valedictorian. Hurley inspired him to become a Jesuit. He entered the Jesuit novitiate in Novaliches at the age of 16, leaving behind his childhood sweetheart, Faley Honzales. He was ordained in 1952. Bulatao attended Woodstock College in New York and obtained a theology degree. For his post graduate studies, he went to Fordham College in New York and completed an MA in experimental psychology, then a PhD in clinical psychology with a focus on Comparative Physiological Psychology. ==== Languages ==== Bulatao taught himself the basics of several languages, including French, Japanese, and conversational Chinese. During 1980s, when the Philippines was under martial law, Bulatao helped save Psychology Department secretary Susan Cellano from Marcosian intelligence agents. The Marcosian intelligence agents were to pick up Cellano from Bellarmine Hall, and another secretary Nits del Rosario called Bulatao and asked him to help. She spoke in French so that the arresting agents did not understand their conversation. Bulatao went to the Psychology department and was able to protect Cellano from the agents. === Teaching === Bulatao began teaching in 1946 at Ateneo before leaving to pursue his postgraduate studies at Fordham. Bulatao returned to the Philippines in 1960 and helped establish the Ateneo de Manila's Department of Psychology where he taught there for more than four decades. The department tried to advise him to retire, but he refused. He held seminars in hypnosis, along with informal class sessions referred to as ‚ÄúConversations with Father Bulatao.‚Äù He also helped found the Psychological Association of the Philippines. In 1964, he co-founded the Philippine Guidance and Personnel Association with colleagues from various local universities. He was known for his hypnosis classes where would tell his students to ‚Äúfly‚Äù through astral travel. Ateneo School of Government dean Antonio La Vi√±a, who drove Bulatao to wakes and parties, recalled: ‚ÄúFollowing that hypnotic voice, I once traveled to a friend's balcony and asked for forgiveness from that friend for having hurt her. And sure enough, a week or two later, a letter from that friend came, telling me I was forgiven.‚Äù A student of his named Mira Ofreneo, who is the current dean of the Psychology Department, wrote a poem for him on 22 Sept. 2013 with a title ‚ÄúGURU‚Äù. The Psychological Association of the Philippines named a teaching award in his honor. ===Research and interest in the supernatural=== Bulatao introduced group dynamics in the Philippines and wrote The Technique of Group Discussion in 1965. He advocated the importance of understanding the Filipino psyche. He undertook studies on the psychology of Filipino culture and the phenomena of spirituality and consciousness. As a clinical psychologist, Bulatao aimed to find the kind of therapy that worked best in the cultural context of the Philippines, experimenting with different alternatives that combined both his knowledge of Western methods and his understanding of the local culture. Despite being a Catholic priest, Bulatao was known for his fascination with the mystical and supernatural. He was most interested in mediumship, hypnosis, and extra-sensory perception (ESP). His interest began when he visited Thailand during the early 70's where he was introduced to Buddhist monks and their meditation techniques. He began to search for a clinical explanation and to research the effects of this method on one's psyche with a focus on the Philippines. He was in contact with spiritistas (exorcists), faith-healers, and youths who were thought to be possessed. His focus on studying these phenomena was not readily accepted, but his work paved the way for the \\"Bulatao Method\\", which combined the supernatural and theological questions. Bulatao always carried a pair of L-shaped dowsing rods he called the ‚ÄúRod of Moses‚Äù in order to answer questions from students, find concentration energy fields, and locate missing objects. === Later life and death === In 2010, it was alleged that then- senator and presidential candidate, Benigno Aquino III, underwent a psychiatric evaluation by Bulatao in 1979 that showed he suffered from depression, which some claimed made him psychologically unfit to seek the presidency. This so-called \\"Bulatao Report\\" was released and spread through chain mail. Bulatao, however, denied that he wrote and signed the report, claiming it to be false. By 2008, Bulatao was already diagnosed with senile and emphysema He died at Ateneo's Jesuit Residence on February 10, 2015 at 8:25PM after a four day hospital stay. The University did not detail the cause of death. After a funeral Mass at Ateneo de Manila University's Church of Gesu that began on February 11, he was laid in the Sacred Heart Novitiate cemetery in Novaliches, Quezon City on February 14, 2015. In a memo after Bulatao's death, the Psychology Department stated that although Bulatao received many awards for his contribution to psychology, he believed his greatest achievement was teaching. ==Awards and honors== Bulatao received several awards for his work. * Achievement Awardee of the Philippine National Science Society (formerly NRCP) for 1987. * National Social Scientist Awardee of the Philippine Social Science Council (PSSC) for 1990. * Gawad ng Pagkilala by the Pambansang Samahan ng Sikolohiyang Pilipino for 1990. * National Book Awardee for the Social Sciences by the Manila Critics Circle for 1992-1993. * One of Quezon City's Most Outstanding Citizens for 2008 * President Emeritus Award from PGCA (Philippine Guidance and Counseling Association) in 2006 ==Published works== *Hiya (1964) *The technique of group discussion (1965): A best-selling classic in group dynamics written with the Filipino personality in mind. It offers practical advice to those involved in organizations, clubs, seminars, business and leadership training programs, and other activities requiring group effort. Originally published in 1965. Eighth reprint, March 1999. *Split level Christianity (1966): He was also for his study on split-level Christianity in the Philippines, which is seen when Christians fail to walk their talk. In 1966, Bulatao defined it as ‚Äúthe coexistence within the same person of two or more thought-and-behavior systems which are inconsistent with each other. According to Bulatao: ‚ÄúSo it is with the split-leveled person; at one level he professes allegiance to ideas, attitudes and ways of behaving which are mainly borrowed from the Christian West, at another level he holds convictions which are more properly his ‚Äúown‚Äù ways of living and believing which were handed down from his ancestors, which do not always find their way into an explicit philosophical system, but nevertheless now and then flow into action.‚Äù Bulatao gave examples of inconsistency of values with behavior from how Filipinos dealt with pornography, infidelity and corruption. Bulatao also explained this split-level Christianity. He proposed that: ‚ÄúA study of the two levels may bring out the following analysis: the top or surface level is the more ‚ÄúChristian‚Äùpart. ‚ÄúIt is made up of rules and beliefs picked up in school or in church. In large part, it is conceptualized, or at least verbalized, usually in a foreign language like English, Spanish or Latin. Much of it is learned by rote, from catechism or from books.‚ÄùBulatao then argues that the lower or deeper level is made up of the rules, beliefs, attitudes and action tendencies which are more common in the environment, which are picked up at home and in the street rather than at school. ‚ÄúA large part of it is never verbalized, but acts as a sort of unspoken philosophy, spontaneously flowing into action when the occasion calls it forth and the inhibitory forces are removed.‚Äù Bulatao ends his article as a good Jesuit who has posed a problem does, by asking ‚Äúwhat can be done about split-level Christianity? He quotes another Pope, Paul VI, who in his Encyclical, Ecclesiam Suam, says, ‚ÄúWhen the Church distinguishes itself from human nature, it does not oppose itself to it, but rather unites itself to it...The Church should enter into a dialogue with the world in which it exists and labors.\\" *The finger abacus (1966) *The self and the group; theory and techniques of self-discovery groups (1967) *The Manileno's mainsprings (1970) *Inculturation, faith, and Christian life (1976‚Äì1978) *Phenomena and their interpretation: Landmark essays, 1957-1989 (1992): The book consists, first of all, of empirical excursions into infrequently charted territories of the Flipino soul. Drawn from keen, rigorous, and emphatic observation, these intricately sketched descriptions of various phenomena of our religion, consciousness, and culture, provide the reader with maps, as it were, of the Filipinos' outer and inner lives - as citizens of a particular history, on one had, and the other, as creatures of a timeless subjective, transpersonal universe. *Hypnosis and hypnotherapy (2000) *Therapeutic Tales: healing, hypnotherapy, and Father Bu (2010): The book is a compilation of articles written bu therapists, counselors, teachers and students of psychology. All the contributors have, at one time or another, been students in Bulatao's classes. *Consciousness mapping: exploring your relationships through the star matrix (2010): Consciousness maps, according to Bulatao, are \\"maps of human relationships, especially of relationships that come from the distant past and are deeply etched in our heart and mind. It begins to take form at birth as a baby reaches for his mother's breast\\" and becomes more varied and intense as the child grows. If one is to understand a person fully, one must tap into this person's consciousness. Every page of this book guides us on how this can be done. - Edna Franco, Ph.D., Associate Professor, Department of Psychology, Ateneo de Manila University. ==References== ==External links== * Ateneno Bulatao Center for Psychological Services Category:1922 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Filipino psychologists Category:Filipino Jesuits Category:20th-century Jesuits Category:People from Paco, Manila Category:Ateneo de Manila University faculty Category:Woodstock College alumni Category:Fordham University alumni ","title":"Jaime C.

Thanks to her flower paintings, she is remembered as one of Luxembourg's most celebrated female painters. ==Biography== Born in Longwy, France, Lily Unden was the daughter of Emile Charles Unden, a Luxembourger, who was a civil engineer in a factory in Longwy-Bas. She returned to Luxembourg with her family just before the First World War, settling in Muhlenbach quarter of Luxembourg City. After earning her baccalaur√©at from the √âcole Saint-Joseph, she studied art in Brussels, Paris, Metz and Strasbourg. Under worked as a painter until the German occupation but as she refused to join the Nazi Volksdeutsche Bewegung, she was assigned to work in a pharmacy. She became a member of the Luxembourg Resistance but was arrested by the Gestapo on 3 November 1942 and eventually sent to the Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp. While she was there, she met the poet C√©cile Ries (1911‚Äì1985) who encouraged her to write poetry about her concentration camp experiences. She returned to Luxembourg after being liberated in 1945 and taught at the Lyc√©e de jeunes filles or Girls' High School. In 1947 and 1948, she studied art at New York's Columbia University after which she headed art education at the Lyc√©e de jeunes filles. In 1949, she taught French at the √âcole professionnelle de l'√âtat in Esch-sur-Alzette until she was engaged to teach at the Lyc√©e Robert- Schuman (1966‚Äì1973). As an artist, in addition to her still lifes and landscapes, she illustrated poetry collections, including those of C√©cile Ries and Anne Berger (born 1951). As a poet, she is remembered above all for her works inspired by her wartime experiences, especially her humiliating imprisonment at Ravensbr√ºck. Lily Unden died in Luxembourg City. In 2015, a home for refugees in Limpertsberg was opened as the Foyer Lily Unden. ==References== Category:1908 births Category:1989 deaths Category:20th-century Luxembourgian painters Category:20th-century Luxembourgian writers Category:Female resistance members of World War II Category:Luxembourgian women painters Category:Luxembourgian women writers Category:People from Longwy Category:Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp survivors ","title":"Lily Unden"},{"id":"60335459","text":"The Tiglian, also referred to as the Tegelen, is a temperate complex stage in the glacial history of Northern Europe. It is preceded by the Praetiglian (stage). The stage was introduced by Zagwijn in 1957 based on geological formations in Tegelen in southern Netherlands. Originally, it was thought to be part of a sequence of glacials and interglacials, namely Praetiglian (cold), Tiglian (warm), Eburonian (cold), Waalian (warm), Menapian (cold), and Bavelian (warm).Kasse (1993), Periglacial environments and climate development during Early Pleistocene Tiglian stage (Beerse Glacial) in northern Belgium, Geologie en Mijnbouw 72, 107-123, Kluwer The Praetiglian and Tiglian are today regarded as corresponding to the Biber stage in the glacial history of the Alps and to the Gelasian (2.6-1.8 million years ago) in the global division of the Quaternary period. Deep sea core samples have identified approximately 40 marine isotope stages (MIS 103 ‚Äì MIS 64) during the Gelasian.German Stratigraphic Commission: Stratigraphische Tabelle von Deutschland 2016 Thus, there have probably been about 20 glacial cycles of varying intensity during Praetiglian and Tiglian.

Glein is an American geochemist at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, TX. He studies planetary science, astrobiology, and organic geochemistry. Glein was the first to describe how Saturn's moon Enceladus is the only known body, besides Earth, that has all of the requirements necessary for life. Glein has been involved in multiple spacecraft missions, leading to significant findings about Pluto, Enceladus, and Titan. In 2017, he was recognized for Outstanding Contributions to the ESA Rosetta Mission by the European Space Agency. == Education == Glein earned his B.S. from the University of Washington in 2006, where he majored in Chemistry. He also completed a minor in Earth and Space Sciences, and specialized in Astrobiology and Planetary Science. In 2012, he earned his Ph.D. in Geological Sciences at Arizona State University with a dissertation titled ‚ÄúTheoretical and experimental studies of cryogenic and hydrothermal organic geochemistry.‚Äù\\"Theoretical and Experimental Studies of Cryogenic and Hydrothermal Organic Geochemistry\\" repository.asu.edu. Retrieved 3-28-2019 == Career == From 2012‚Äì2014, Glein was a postdoctoral fellow at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and in 2014, at the University of Toronto. During his fellowships he focused on high pressure-temperature experimentation, and stable isotope geochemistry. In 2015, Glein began work as a research scientist at the Space Science and Engineering division of the Southwest Research Institute. He was promoted to a senior research scientist in 2018. Glein is a member of the American Geophysical Union, Deep Carbon Observatory, Geochemical Society, and Outer Planets Assessment Group. Currently he is involved in the Life Investigation For Enceladus (LIFE) mission, and the Enceladus Life Finder (ELF) mission. == Research == While encompassing planetary science, astrobiology, and organic geochemistry, Glein's research focuses on the oceanography of planetary moons. Glein is currently studying two of Saturn's moons, Enceladus and Titan, to determine if they are able to host life. In a 2017 paper Glein describes how large hydrocarbons were found on both of Saturn's moons. Samples were taken from oceans on the moons by the spacecraft Cassini and analyzed using mass spectrometry. This finding proved Enceladus is the only known body, besides Earth, with all of the requirements necessary for life. Glein also helped discover that a reaction called serpentization takes place in Enceladus's ocean, making it an even stronger candidate for hosting life. Serpentization occurs when metallic rock reacts with water to form hydrogen. Glein postulates the form of hydrogen produced by the serpentization reaction on Enceladus is a possible source of energy for certain microbes. Glein is studying hydrocarbon containing samples, collected by Cassini, to further understand the origin of Titan's unique nitrogen-methane atmosphere. In addition to findings related to Saturn's moons, Glein has also made significant discoveries regarding Pluto. Analyzing samples brought back by the Rosetta mission, he found that Pluto contains notably similar amounts of nitrogen to comets explored by Rosetta, providing support for the theory that Pluto was formed by multiple comets. == Honors and awards == In 2013, the Geological Society of Washington, D.C awarded Glein the Bradley Prize for Best Paper for his 2013 paper, ‚ÄúThe exotic yet familiar geochemistry of Titan.‚Äù In 2017, the European Space Agency recognized Glein for his Outstanding Contributions to the ESA Rosetta Mission. == Additional sources == * ‚ÄúCassini finds final ingredient for alien life in Enceladus‚Äôs sea.‚Äù www.newscientist.com.
